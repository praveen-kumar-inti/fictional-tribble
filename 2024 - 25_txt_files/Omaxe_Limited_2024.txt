1.	 	 Physical Impacts of Climate Change
	
Risk: Adapting to climate change and its associated risks is imperative for business continuity. Managing our GHG 
footprint and making focused efforts for reduced emissions reduction is critical for us to remain a sustainable 
business. Ineffective management of our GHG footprint may expose us to physical and transition risk thereby 
adversely impacting business resilience and growth.
	
Rationale/ Mitigation Measures:  1. Implement a robust data monitoring framework for external reporting 2. 
Implement interventions to bridge gaps in climate change mitigation measures, compliance gaps.  
2.	
Health and Safety
	
Risk: For real estate companies, it is essential to inherent risks associated with property management, 
construction, and maintenance activities. Providing a safe work environment and preventing accidents are 
paramount to protecting employees, contractors, and tenants from potential hazards. Compliance with safety 
regulations is not only a legal obligation but also a critical factor in mitigating financial risks related to workplace 
injuries, liability claims, and potential fines

measures to minimize risks.
