1
Energy 
management
Opportunity
Around the globe, there 
is an urgent need to 
save energy. By adopting 
Energy management 
practices, the Company 
can not only help in 
reducing the carbon 
emissions that contribute 
to global warming, 
but it will also help in 
reducing the Company’s 
dependence on limited 
fossil fuels.
Robust processes and 
meticulously designed 
systems are in place 
to optimize energy 
efficiency, and an 
unwavering commitment 
to continuously improve 
them to enhance our 
energy-saving initiatives.
The Company takes 
constant measures to 
conserve energy and 
increase use of energy 
through renewable 
sources such as solar.
The Company has also 
adopted an Energy and 
Carbon policy to drive 
its energy management 
initiatives.
Positive -
By increasing reliance 
and dedicated 
Investments in 
efficient technologies, 
renewable energy, 
energy-efficiency 
and embracing 
green energy can 
positively impact the 
Company’s financial 
performance and 
reduce operating 
costs over the long 
term.
2
Managing 
packaging 
materials and 
waste
Risk
Plastic waste is India’s 
and the world’s most 
formidable environmental 
challenge today.
The Company being in 
the business of consumer 
products and since 
majority of its final goods 
are packed in plastic 
bottles/ wrappers, the 
Company consider plastic 
as risk to the environment 
and its business.
The management 
of plastic packaging 
materials, especially at 
the end-of-life stage, is 
an issue of significant 
societal importance and 
potential business risk.
Dematerialization 
in packaging. Use 
of recycled as well 
as recyclable plastic 
materials in packaging.
100% compliance to 
Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) 
framework to ensure 
collection and 
environmentally safe 
disposal of plastic waste.
Negative – Non-
compliance with 
regulatory norms on 
waste management 
can lead to fines/ 
penalties and can 
adversely affect the 
operating costs of the 
Company.

3
Climate 
change
Risk
The potential 
consequences of climate 
change can significantly 
harm the Company’s 
business, and a failure to 
adopt a suitable strategy 
or implement it correctly 
can severely disrupt the 
Company’s business 
continuity.
Being a manufacturing 
Company, our business 
is energy intensive and 
regulators are also very 
prompt to take corrective 
action in case of failure 
from Company side to 
comply with various laws 
protecting Environment 
and which may lead to 
heavy fines & penalties.
Reduction in direct and 
indirect GHG emissions 
through:
a.	 investment in state-
of-the-art equipment 
and automation 
initiatives at the 
Company’s plant to 
ensure optimal energy 
consumption.
b. Investment in low-
carbon technologies
c. Increase in share of 
renewable and clean 
energy.
d. Replacement of 
traditional lights with 
LEDs across majority 
of our plants
e. Installing variable 
frequency drive (VFD) 
on major conveyor 
belt system at some of 
the Company’s plants, 
reducing its motor 
power consumption.
f. Centralising air 
compressor, water 
chiller with single 
chiller (for winters) 
and vaccum pump 
systems;
g. Educate employees 
and workers about 
negative impacts of 
climate change and 
corrective measures 
required in day to 
day life to reduce the 
impact.
Positive - The 
adoption of eco-
friendly technology 
and emission 
reduction techniques 
may lead to a short 
term rise in costs, 
but, it would benefit 
the Company in a 
long run for business 
sustainability.
Being a socially 
responsible 
organization, apart 
from statutory 
compliances, 
Company also takes 
voluntary measure to 
mitigate the impact 
on Environment.

4
Water 
consumption
Risk
As water is a limited 
resource, it presents a 
potential threat to the 
Company’s business 
operations. Also, poor 
management of waste 
water can lead to non-
compliance with legal 
requirements leading 
to penalties, fines, etc. 
besides demeaning image 
of the Company.
The Company has 
initiated pilot programs to 
decrease the consumption 
of raw water during the 
manufacturing process, 
and all its facilities have 
efficient water recycling 
and wastewater treatment 
systems.
The Company also aims 
to implement zero liquid 
discharge (ZLD) facilities 
at all its plants in near 
future.
The Company has 
also adopted Water 
Stewardship Policy 
to promote water 
conservation.
Positive - The cost 
of operations is 
directly related to 
water consumption. 
Therefore, effective 
water management 
has a positive 
financial impact not 
only in the short term, 
but also in the long 
term.
Measures undertaken 
for efficient water 
management 
across facilities and 
implementation of 
ZLD will have positive 
financial implications 
in long run.
5
Product 
life cycle 
assessment 
(LCA)
Opportunity
Product life cycle 
assessment will help 
the Company to gain 
a comprehensive 
understanding of the 
environmental footprint 
of its products and 
develop effective plans 
for mitigating any 
adverse environmental 
impacts resulting from its 
products.
N.A.
Positive - Any cost we 
incur to conduct the 
Life Cycle Assessment 
will yield positive 
results for the 
Company in the long 
run.

6
Raw material 
sourcing and 
sustainability
Risk
The type of products 
the Company produces 
heavily relies on the 
quality of its raw 
materials. The potential 
environmental hazards 
resulting from climate 
change could jeopardize 
the availability and 
reliability of raw materials 
for the Company. 
Additionally, failure to 
source raw materials 
sustainably may lead 
to compliance risks, 
negatively impacting 
the Company’s ESG 
performance and rating.
By leveraging our R&D 
capabilities, the Company 
can explore potential 
substitutes for specific raw 
materials in cases where 
they become unavailable.
Additionally, the Company 
will collaborate with 
its vendors to identify 
sustainable methods for 
the sourcing, storage, 
and transportation of raw 
materials.
The Company has also 
adopted a Sustainability 
Policy.
Positive - The 
Company can 
strengthen its 
environmental 
dedication by 
procuring raw 
materials from 
local suppliers. 
This practice will 
not only reduce 
emissions resulting 
from transportation 
but also improve 
product quality and 
support the regional/
national community. 
Additionally, the 
Company can benefit 
from lower raw 
material costs by 
sourcing locally.
Negative –
Inability to procure 
raw material 
can impact the 
production. It can also 
reduce the margin or 
create disruption in 
operations.
The Company is 
working towards 
having a sustainable 
supply chain where 
it can decrease its 
dependencies to 
external factors and 
make it more resilient.

Employee 
health and 
safety
Risk
Failure to prioritize 
employee health and 
safety can result in 
reduced productivity 
and an increased risk of 
injuries and harm to our 
employees.
Non-compliance with 
appropriate safety 
standards can attract 
high frequency of health 
and safety incidents 
and ultimately decrease 
productivity.
Numerous endeavours 
and undertakings have 
been put in place to 
guarantee the well-being 
and safety of employees. 
Additionally, the 
Company has in place an 
EHS management system 
for all its facilities. The 
Company also conducts 
regular training for its 
employees and workers to 
tackle workplace hazards.
The Company is also 
driving various employee 
engagement and 
wellbeing programs for 
better mental health and 
stress-free life.
Positive – Allocating 
financial resources 
towards employee 
health and safety 
can yield positive 
long-term results by 
reducing downtime 
and costs associated 
with any injury or 
illness.
8
Human rights Risk
The ever-evolving 
regulations surrounding 
human rights present 
a challenge for the 
Company’s business. 
Additionally, addressing 
modern slavery is a key 
business risk to remain 
relevant for future 
generations.
The Company dedicates 
significant efforts to 
ensure that its business 
practices do not infringe 
upon human rights and it 
adheres to all applicable 
relevant labour laws and 
regulations.
The Company also have 
a grievance redressal 
system and have also 
adopted Human Rights 
Policy to promptly 
address human rights 
issues.
Negative - Any 
human rights 
violations or non-
compliance of 
statutory norms can 
lead to substantial 
financial and 
reputational risks for 
a company, which 
can ultimately have 
a negative impact 
on the Company’s 
business.

Responsible 
marketing
Risk
In order to establish trust 
and foster engagement 
with the Company’s 
stakeholders, it is essential 
that the Company 
engage in responsible 
marketing practices and 
are transparent about 
the environmental and 
societal impacts of 
its products. It is also 
important to note that 
failure to comply with 
relevant marketing 
standards, laws, and 
regulations poses a risk to 
the Company’s business.
The Company recognises 
the importance of

fundamental aspect of its 
approach.

10
Stakeholder 
engagement
Opportunity
The connection between 
decision-making and 
accountability is essential, 
and effective engagement 
between stakeholders and 
the Company’s Board is 
crucial for informed and 
meaningful decision-
making. Engaging with 
stakeholders involves 
providing opportunities 
for both parties to listen 
to each other and gain 
insights into different 
perspectives. Therefore, 
the Company places a 
great importance on 
engaging with all of 
its stakeholders in the 
decision-making process 
for its business.
N/A
Positive- Investors are 
increasingly looking 
for companies 
that take a holistic 
approach to business, 
which includes 
engaging with 
stakeholders, and 
are more likely to 
invest in companies 
that demonstrate a 
commitment to social 
responsibility.

15
Compliance 
and 
governance
Risk
The Manufacturing and 
service facility of the 
Company is spread across 
the Country with 23 units.
Number of units 
also increases the 
corresponding number of 
compliance risk associated 
to its functioning and 
complying of various Laws 
applicable at local/ State 
level.
The Regulations/ laws 
in the consumer goods 
industry continues to 
evolve with newer Health, 
Environment & Safety 
norms. Non-compliance 
of the same may lead to 
environmental, social and 
reputational risk.
In order to ensure 
and track compliance 
of all the laws and 
regulations applicable 
to the Company, along 
with having a strong 
leadership and resilient 
execution teams, it has 
also implemented a 
Compliance Tool software 
mechanism viz. “Legatrix” 
designed by Legasis 
Services Private Limited.
Negative –
An organization’s 
failure to comply with 
applicable laws and 
regulations can affect 
its revenue, profits 
which can lead to 
loss of reputation, 
business 
opportunities and 
valuation. It may also 
lead to incur Legal 
Cost and in many 
cases Civil/ Criminal 
consequences.

PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Essential Indicators
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made 
by the entity, respectively.
 
The Company’s R&D department is invested in programs which continually focus on arriving at most optimal 
formulation spaces within our product categories. An area of considerable focus is to reexamine current surfactant 
load in powders, bars, gels, and liquids and understand ways of optimising these without compromising on 
product performance or quality. Such efforts also ensure a reduced surfactant environmental load downstream 
thereby helping our environment.
 
The Company is also exploring to incorporate greener surfactants in powders, detergent liquids and dishwash 
liquids to offer the advantage of easy biodegradability whilst offering performance parity to fossil fuel-based 
surfactant. The environmental and social impact relevant to such greener products are considerable and are in 
alignment with UN SDGs. Greener surfactants are completely biodegradable and offer a promising alternative 
to fossil-based surfactants which have a high salience of usage globally in surfactants. The use of such greener 
surfactants is beneficial to the society and the environment and are in line with UN SDGs.
 
Optimization of process cycle times in oral care within the personal care category also assists in improving 
efficiencies while also ensuring power savings. Similarly, within our Household Insecticide category our 
company has successfully demonstrated the use of agricultural waste as useful value add input raw material in 
coil manufacture.
 
Some of these technologies employing Agri wastes have been commercially deployed with considerable bottom

https://www.jyothylabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sustainable-Procurement-Policy-JLL.pdf
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
Approximately 73.95% of the inputs was sourced sustainably. While selecting vendors/ channel partners, 
the Company always analyse & evaluate the sustainability of the vendors/ channel partners. The Company’s

3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
 
For Plastics, E-waste and Hazardous waste, we have a best-in-class waste management practice in place. We 
engage with certified partners for the co-processing/ recycling of waste of waste.
	
(a)	 Plastic:
	
	
Reuse - industrial plastic waste is collected at the Company’s factories and used in plastic package 
moulding of the Company’s products. This reduces wastage of plastic at the factory level itself.
	
	
Recycle / End-of-life disposal –
 
 
The Company has engaged Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) registered plastic waste processors to 
collect plastic waste from municipal waste sites, public areas, bulk generators like hotels and restaurants. 
Once the plastic waste is collected, these plastic waste processors weigh the waste, segregate and compress 
it, and thereafter send it for recycling/end of life disposal. The processed plastic waste is generally sent to 
either a recycler who converts it to plastic granules which are then added to virgin plastic for reuse, or to 
a co-processor for generation of energy, or to road construction agencies for road construction.
 
 
Additionally, the Company has taken significant efforts to reduce its usage of plastic in its packaging. 
During the year, the Company has successfully reduced use of plastic in its Henko Matic 1L Liquid Detergent 
Pouch by 10% by reducing 20-micron laminate thickness, Exo Bar by 11.9% by reducing 7-micron laminate 
thickness.
	
(b)	 E-waste:
 
 
The Company has engaged a CPCB registered vendor for E-waste collection, disposal & recycling process. 
For recycling and disposal of E-waste, as and when the plants identify any e-waste, the same is informed to 
the Central IT team of the Company. Which in-turn requests, the E-waste collecting vendor to collect the 
e-waste from the specific location and dispose the e-waste in accordance with regulatory norms.

Annual Report
2024-25
 
 
The process adopted by the Company’s e-waste vendor is as follows:
 
 
The first crusher adopts double-shaft shredding, the second crusher adopts hammer crusher, and the third 
crusher adopts high-speed turbine crusher. The material is pulverized into powder through three-stage 
pulverization, and then sorted by air separation equipment and electrostatic separation equipment. This 
production line has a novel and unique structure, large production capacity and low power consumption, 
one-time feeding, and multiple machines cooperate to complete; Controlled by PLC, the machine improves 
the quality of recovered copper and prevents secondary pollution. The recovery rate of copper in waste 
circuit boards is over 98% through separation and sorting equipment.
	
(c)	 Hazardous waste:
 
 
For recycling and disposal of hazardous waste:- All hazardous products of the Company are segregated 
at the depot level and sent to the respective State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) authorised waste 
management processor for disposal in accordance with regulatory norms.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes /No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
 
Yes, the Extended Producer Responsibility is applicable to the Company’s activities. At Jyothy Labs, we believe 
that it’s our responsibility to promote sustainable practices and reduce our environmental impact. The Company 
is compliant with the action plan approved by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for the Financial Year
