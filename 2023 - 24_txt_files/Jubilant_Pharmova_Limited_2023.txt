Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to present Jubilant Pharmova Limited's BRSR Report for the fiscal year 2024 (FY 2024). As a pharmaceutical company, 
our core purpose is to improve lives through scientific and medical advancements. Our commitment to harnessing the power of 
science and technology has been instrumental in our holistic growth. 
We are committed to delivering products with improved productivity and protecting the environment for future generations. To 
reflect this commitment, we established sustainability goals to challenge ourselves and ensure that we are helping to create a 
better world. We recognise that sustainability goes beyond reducing emissions, it also encompasses human rights, the importance 
of nature and how we utilise scarce resources such as water. 
Within this report, we emphasise the sustainability challenges and opportunities encountered during FY 2024. Despite the 
obstacles faced, our Company achieved stable revenues due to the diversification of our businesses. We have expedited capacity 
expansions to bolster our capabilities and meet evolving demands. This year, we are also fulfilling the reporting requirements 
of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) as mandated by SEBI. Our commitment to sustainability is 
evidenced by our achievements in ESG ratings. We attained an outstanding percentile of 93% in the S&P Global ESG Indices 
CSA 2023 (DJSI). In the EcoVadis assessment, we scored 65 out of 100 placing us among the top 15% of global pharmaceutical 
companies. This achievement underscores our dedication to environmental, social, and governance factors. Additionally, we have 
received an impressive ‘B’ score band from CDP for ‘Climate Change’ and ‘Water Security’, known as the ‘Management’ band. 
Our progress towards sustainability goals has been truly remarkable. We have surpassed expectations by achieving a 14% 
reduction in specific energy consumption, a 16% decrease in specific water consumption, and an impressive 33% reduction in 
specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to our FY 2024 target. Our continuous focus on our employee performance 
has led to an increase in our employee training during FY 2024 to 7.8 training man-days/ employee/ year, a decent increase of 
54% against the set FY 2024 target. At present, we are revisiting and working on FY 2029 ESG targets and will communicate with 
you soon.
This report provides detailed insights into our initiatives, progress, and future plans. We acknowledge the evolving business 
landscape and the growing demands from stakeholders regarding ESG issues. Our strong ESG position instils confidence among 
stakeholders and allows us to explore new markets.
Transparency is a core value for us, and we consistently share our ESG performance and goals with stakeholders. Our sustainability 
culture is fueled by our strong value system, and we continue to innovate and learn from the markets we serve. We aim to inspire 
the right talent and foster a supportive team that embraces change and supports our organisation’s cause.
As we move forward, we are committed to giving back more than we take. We look forward to continued sustainable growth in 
collaboration with our stakeholders.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Since we are in the Pharma business we don’t reclaim our products to recycle & reuse. However, we do have a policy and system in 
place to manage different types of waste generated in our pant premises. In brief following approaches followed while handling 
and disposing of our wastes:
	
Waste Management approach:
	
The Company adopted the 3R approach for waste minimisation: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
a)	
Hazardous waste 
	
The Company follows the following methods for proper disposal of the hazardous waste generated at its facilities, depending 
on their nature and local regulations:
•	
Recycle and Reuse through authorised third-party
•	
Co-processing at cement kiln
•	
Secured land fill
•	
Incineration (both solid and liquid)
 b) 	 Non-hazardous waste
	
At the Company, the non-hazardous wastes are either recycled or reused by third parties. Metal scrap, plastic scrap, paper and 
wooden material scraps are a few major contributors of non-hazardous waste. 
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Since the operations in India do not sell branded products (with plastic packaging) to consumers directly and also do not import 
any plastic packaging items, EPR is not applicable
