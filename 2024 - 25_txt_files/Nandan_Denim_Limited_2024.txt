the risk or opportunity
(Indicate positive or
negative
implications)
1
Chemical
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Shifting consumer 
preference towards safe 
& sustainable products. 
Additionally, the 
regulatory environment 
is getting more stringent 
on the sustainability 
aspects of chemicals and 
its associated impacts.
Opportunity:
To become a globally  
preferred denim brand 
in manufacturing safe, 
sustainable products 
while adhering to all 
regulatory compliances
We are engaged with our 
vendors and suppliers 
for the elimination of 
hazardous chemicals 
and to implement safer 
sustainable products
Positive:
Reputational benefit 
resulting in increased 
demand for goods. 
Increased revenue due 
to better competitive 
position to reflect shifting 
consumer preferences.
Negative:
Reduced revenue from 
decreased demand of 
goods 
2
People
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Reputational risk if we 
fail to ensure fair labour 
practices, protection of 
human rights, health and 
safety of our employee & 
workers.
Opportunity:
By addressing the 
above risks, we are 
securing our social 
license to operate and 
representing ourselves
Promoting inclusiveness, 
leadership qualities, 
retaining talent, 
creating friendly work 
arrangements
Positive:
While ensuring our 
people’s prosperity in 
consideration, we seek 
to improve employee 
satisfaction, better 
retention and lowering 
cost of management.
Negative:
Reduced revenue due 
to negative impact on 
workforce.
3
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
While energy contributes 
to the growth of textile 
and apparel industry, 
resulting emissions 
are a dampener for 
environmental health. 
Increasing demand of 
textile and apparels in 
the world, followed by 
increased production is 
the cause of higher GHG 
emissions.
Opportunity:
Improving upon the 
energy efficiency and 
increasing renewable 
usage will support us 
in cutting down the 
energy expenses and 
achievement of pertinent 
emission reduction 
commitments.
We have implemented 
2 MW Wind Mill Power 
Project and 1 MW 
Solar rooftop system 
for captive electricity 
consumption 
Positive:
Wind Mill Project 
installation and 1 MW 
Solar rooftop system for 
captive consumption 
shall result in reduction 
in energy cost and 
reduction in fuel 
consumption
Negative:
Due to increase in price 
of fuel and energy, 
the cost of production 
increases

management and 
consumer engagement
NA
Positive:
Partnering with 
innovative summit, 
product innovation, 
digital transformation, 
Sewage Treatment plant.
5
Cotton
Risk
Cotton is our main raw 
material and being an 
agricultural product 
it is dependent on 
weather/ environment. 
Unpredictable rainfall & 
weather results in lower 
production of cotton and 
in turn result high price 
of cotton
Preparation of advance 
strategic plan for 
purchase of cotton to 
mitigate any shortage in 
raw material.
Negative
Increase in cost of raw 
materials which in turn 
results in increase in 
product cost.
6
Natural fiber
Opportunity
Due to increasing 
green revolution 
and environment 
sustainability, the use of 
natural fiber is increasing 
due to increase in 
demand by customers.
NA
Positive Implications
Increase in revenue due 
to increase in demand of 
sustainable products
7
Water
Risk
Water is one of the 
essential requirement 
for our operation, even 
for cultivation of cotton 
and due to its scarcity, 
efficient management of 
water is highly essential 
for our operations 
We recycle and reuse 
water by establishing an 
Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP) and a Reverse 
Osmosis Plant (RO) 
within our facility. We 
also treat wastewater 
with our Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) 
and reuse the treated 
water for gardening. In 
order to utilize backwash 
water, we have also 
installed a pipeline 
from the power plant to 
the fabric division. So, 
we can conserve the 
water by minimizing the 
extraction of water
May increase production 
and operations cost
8
Climate 
Change
Risk
Due to inadequate 
climate conditions and 
unseasonal rain, the 
production of cotton 
and other essential raw 
materials are effected 
which results in scarcity 
of available raw materials
The company prepares 
a strategic plan for 
mitigating the risk in line 
with production
Negative implication
Non Availability of raw 
materials at reasonable 
price, which results in 
sourcing of materials at 
higher price.
