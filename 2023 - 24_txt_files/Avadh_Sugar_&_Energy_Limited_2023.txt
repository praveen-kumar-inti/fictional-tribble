1
Climate 
Change 
Risk
Climate change has a profound 
impact on agriculture, 
particularly on sugar production. 
Altered rainfall patterns, 
temperature fluctuations, and 
extreme weather events directly 
influence crop yields and 
quality. Furthermore, increasing 
greenhouse gas emissions can 
create both regulatory and 
reputational challenges.
We have started tracking Scope 
1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions. 
Additionally, ASEL is committed 
to enhancing climate resilience 
by investing in sugarcane 
varieties to different soils and 
climates, adopting improved 
and advanced agri-practices. 
The Company also continuously 
focuses on alternative sources of 
green energy.
Negative
Opportunity
The sugarcane sector mitigates 
climate change by producing 
bioethanol, a renewable energy 
source. This helps decrease 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
reduces reliance on fossil fuels, 
aligning with the global trend 
toward sustainable energy 
adoption.
Positive
2
Water 
Management 
Risk
Operating as a sugar producer 
necessitates substantial water 
consumption. Environmental 
challenges such as water 
scarcity and pollution pose 
significant risks, potentially 
disrupting the supply chain and 
escalating operational costs. 
ASEL has successfully deployed a 
ZLD system across its distilleries, 
enabling efficient water reuse. 
Recycled water is utilized for 
irrigation, thereby significantly 
mitigating the risks associated 
with water scarcity. Additionally, 
the Company has adopted water 
harvesting measures such as 
using wells to accelerate ground 
water recharge.
Negative
3
Waste 
Management 
Opportunity
Implementing efficient waste 
management practices allows 
the company to optimize 
resource utilization by recycling, 
reusing, or repurposing waste 
materials. This can lead to 
savings in costs such as raw 
material procurement and waste 
disposal.
Positive
4
Health and 
Safety of 
Employees and 
Workers 
Risk
The sugar industry inherently 
carries risks to employee/
worker health and safety 
due to the use of machinery, 
equipment, and complex 
processes. Potential hazards 
include accidents, injuries, or 
occupational illnesses, often 
stemming from equipment 
malfunctions, insufficient 
training, or non-adherence to 
safety protocols. Such incidents 
not only compromise employee/
worker well-being but can also 
affect the company’s reputation, 
lower morale, reduce employee/
worker engagement, increase 
turnover, and hinder the ability to 
attract and retain talent.
The Company strengthened 
employee/worker health 
and safety by initiating 
comprehensive training 
and educational efforts on 
safety practices. 5-S has 
been implemented as tool of 
safety and improved working 
environment to employees. 
Investments were made in safety 
equipment and infrastructure, 
including facility enhancements 
to improve workplace safety. 
Employee/worker involvement 
was actively promoted by 
encouraging participation 
in safety programs and the 
reporting of potential hazards.

5
Human Capital 
Development 
Opportunity
Investing in the development 
of employees/workers through 
training and skill-building 
programs can lead to increased 
productivity and operational 
efficiency. Well-trained 
employees/workers are better 
equipped to perform their roles 
effectively, leading to higher 
output and reduced wastage. 
Further, Well-trained employees/
workers are better equipped 
to maintain quality standards 
and adhere to safety protocols, 
reducing the risk of product 
defects, recalls, and related 
expenses.
Positive
6
Product Quality 
and Safety 
Risk
Compliance risks, including 
misleading claims, customer 
complaints, and regulatory 
fines, can be significant. 
Any compromise in product 
safety or quality undermines 
customer trust and damages the 
company’s reputation. Moreover, 
negative publicity from safety 
issues can erode sales and 
diminish brand image.
Our production process 
incorporates rigorous quality 
control measures to uphold 
regulatory standards and ensure 
consistent product quality. 
Additionally, we conduct regular 
laboratory tests on our products 
to maintain optimal quality and 
safety.
Negative
7 
Corporate 
Governance 
Risk
The sugar industry in India is 
highly regulated, with policies 
related to pricing, export, 
and import. Good corporate 
governance ensures that the 
company complies with these 
regulations, avoiding legal 
issues and penalties. Also, the 
company must ensure that its 
business practices align with 
ethical standards and legal 
requirements. 
To strengthen our governance 
framework, we have developed 
and implemented internal SOPs 
across all functional areas, 
tailored to meet the specific 
needs of our industry. Our 
anti-corruption protocols are 
rigorously enforced, fostering 
a culture of integrity and 
accountability. To promote 
transparency and compliance, 
we regularly provide training 
sessions for employees and 
workers on ethical conduct, 
code of conduct, and anti-
bribery practices. Additionally, 
we maintain a comprehensive 
compliance monitoring 
system and engage in open 
communication with local 
stakeholders to establish and 
maintain trust

challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
The sugar industry is a vital component of India’s rural economy, with over 50 million farmers serving as regular 
suppliers. The K. K. Birla Group of sugar companies, which includes Avadh Sugar, plays a significant and constructive 
role in the social development and upliftment of people in its command areas. To support societal well-being, the 
Company organizes demonstration camps to promote better farming methodologies, hosts technical seminars, 
offers subsidies for high-quality seeds, conducts research into high-yielding and high-sucrose sugarcane varieties, 
and provides loans to farmers. Additionally, Avadh Sugar has contributed to infrastructural development by 
establishing schools offering job-oriented education at concessional fees, as well as building hospitals, temples, and 
other facilities for the benefit of the communities surrounding its plants. 
ASEL has established an ESG Policy that aligns with its mission and vision towards Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles. This policy enhances the Company’s internal practices to align with the nine principles

1. 	 Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
ASEL recognizes the critical importance of effective stakeholder engagement for achieving sustainability and 
inclusive growth and employs a systematic approach to identify key stakeholders. This process begins with structured 
qualitative methods, including internal brainstorming sessions to pinpoint the diverse individuals and entities 
impacted by the organization’s activities, particularly within the complex sugar industry, which involves farmers, 
associations, sugarcane development societies, and councils. Following identification, ASEL conducts a thorough 
stakeholder analysis, assessing each stakeholder based on their power, legitimacy, and urgency. This analysis enables 
the classification and prioritization of stakeholders into categories such as disadvantaged, vulnerable, marginalized, 
or non-marginalized groups. ASEL’s engagement strategy is meticulously designed to address the concerns and 
expectations of all stakeholders, with a special emphasis on those who are disadvantaged, vulnerable, or marginalized. 
By integrating respect for human rights into its management systems and ensuring access to grievance mechanisms, 
ASEL fosters transparent and ethical interactions with stakeholders.

10. 	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Our sugar production from sugarcane exemplifies an eco-friendly cycle, where by-products like bagasse are used for 
power generation, molasses for distillery products, and press mud and ash for organic manure. We have established 
comprehensive waste management guidelines for all units, covering both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with 
regular performance monitoring. Consequently, most by-products and waste from our manufacturing processes 
are effectively recycled. We strictly adhere to all applicable norms for liquid effluent management, evidenced by 
our sewage treatment plant’s capacity to treat up to 200 liters per ton of crushed cane. One of our production units 
operates as a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) unit, and there is no distillery spent wash generated.
