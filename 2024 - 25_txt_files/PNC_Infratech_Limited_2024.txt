1
Climate change
R
The pressing issue of climate change 
has underscored the necessity to 
enhance 
the 
resilience 
of 
urban 
regions. Many infrastructures and 
public areas weren’t planned to cope 
with the environmental challenges we 
currently face, including severe weather 
conditions, air pollution, energy deficits, 
and water scarcity. Tackling climate 
change demands the expansion of 
innovative solutions in areas such 
as energy, efficiency, material use, 
and beyond. Government policies are 
catalyzing a shift towards eco-friendly 
construction. The climate action agenda 
presents commercial opportunities that 
empower us to aid in climate change 
adaptation and reduction.
As 
an 
organization, 
we 
recognize the imperative to 
address carbon emissions as 
a risk. We are committed to 
adopting proactive measures, 
including investing in clean 
technologies, optimizing energy 
efficiency, 
and 
promoting 
sustainable 
practices. 
By 
taking decisive action, we aim 
to mitigate our carbon footprint 
and contribute to a greener, 
low-carbon future.

(Indicate positive

Potential alterations brought on by 
climate change, such as regulatory 
modifications, 
shifts 
in 
consumer 
preferences, and other substantial 
changes in the Company’s operational 
context, could also significantly affect 
the business and poses a risk.
2
Circularity, 
including 
materials and 
resources 
efficiency
R
The Company is in construction 
business 
and 
the 
disruption 
in 
operations could have the risk of 
creating an adverse economic impact. 
The 
link 
between 
circular 
flows 
and climate emissions is clear, and 
increasing circular material flows could 
help reduce climate impact. Circularity 
and resource efficiency are linked to 
operational efficiency and reduced 
environmental impact.
The 
Company 
may 
adopt 
measures 
that 
promote 
circular practices, such as 
utilizing 
recycled 
materials, 
implementing efficient waste 
management, and prioritizing 
resource 
conservation. 
By 
embracing circularity, we aim to 
minimize environmental impact 
and contribute to a sustainable 
construction industry.
Negative
3
Occupational 
health and 
safety
R
The Group is engaged in executing 
potentially hazardous projects that 
necessitate ongoing supervision and 
administration of health and safety risks. 
Neglecting to handle these risks could 
lead to serious consequences, such 
as causing fatal or life-altering injuries 
to our employees, subcontractors, 
external individuals, or the general 
public. Additionally, it could expose 
us to the possibility of legal action, 
substantial penalties, disqualification 
from tender participation, and damage 
to our reputation. 
We 
have 
implemented 
comprehensive risk mitigation 
measures 
to 
ensure 
occupational 
health 
and 
safety. These include regular 
safety training programs, strict 
adherence to safety protocols, 
regular 
inspections. 
We 
prioritize the use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE), 
conduct risk assessments, and 
promote a culture of proactive 
reporting 
and 
continuous 
improvement.
Negative
4
Corporate 
Governance 
and Business 
Ethics 
R
Failure to adhere to the Code of Ethics 
may result from a lack of adherence 
to a risk compliance approach; an 
absence 
of 
a 
suitable 
corporate 
culture; a deficient training program 
and compliance monitoring; lack of a 
robust testing and monitoring regime; 
inadequate whistleblowing procedures 
and a lack of awareness about these 
channels across the organization; or 
deliberate or negligent noncompliance. 
Non-compliance with the Code of 
Ethics can leave the Group vulnerable 
to incidents of bribery and corruption, 
At our organization, we have 
robust policies and procedures 
in place to ensure effective risk 
mitigation and promote sound 
governance 
and 
business 
ethics.
We adhere to strict regulatory 
standards, 
conduct 
regular 
audits, and maintain a strong 
compliance framework. Our 
employees are educated on 
ethical practices, and we foster 
a 
culture

Human Rights 
& Labor 
Conditions
R
Companies need to ensure that they are 
not indirectly involved in human rights 
abuses. Violations like poor working 
conditions, modern slavery, child labor, 
or environmental infractions at work 
locations/sites or by subcontractors 
or suppliers in our supply chain can 
inflict harm on individuals and the 
environment.
Such transgressions can lead to 
reputational damage, a loss of trust in 
the Company’s responsibility, and can 
result in fines, penalties, civil litigation, 
and criminal prosecution. It is essential 
for businesses to respect and support 
the principles of freedom of association 
and the effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining. Furthermore, 
businesses must actively work towards 
eliminating all forms of forced and 
compulsory labor.
We prioritize human rights 
and 
labor 
conditions 
by 
implementing comprehensive 
policies and practices that 
mitigate risks. Our organization 
strictly adheres to regulatory 
compliances 
and 
labor 
standards. We promote fair 
treatment, non-discrimination, 
safe working conditions, and 
provide appropriate training 
and support to our employees, 
ensuring 
their 
rights 
and 
wellbeing are upheld.
Negative
6
Supply chain 
management
R
As a responsible business, it entails 
conducting operations in a fair and 
ethical manner, prioritizing integrity in 
decision making, and establishing trust 
as a reliable partner within the supply 
chain. Sustainable supply chains are 
crucial in ensuring safe and equitable 
conditions for all stakeholders. Any 
disruptions or shortages of materials 
and labor can lead to both financial 
and nonfinancial repercussions, such 
as environmental or safety incidents, 
violations of human rights within the 
supply chain, compromised ability
We have implemented various 
risk mitigation measures in 
our supply chain management 
to 
ensure 
operational 
efficiency. 
This 
includes 
establishing reliable supplier 
networks, 
and 
maintaining 
strong relationships. We have 
streamlined 
processes 
for 
timely supplies and inventory 
management, 
ensuring 
interrupted operations.

Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
R
One of the key areas of focus is the 
advancement of a circular model 
that emphasizes the reduction and 
optimization of material usage, as 
well as effective waste management. 
By optimizing resources, businesses 
can enhance operational and financial 
efficiency 
while 
simultaneously 
minimizing 
waste 
generation. 
Neglecting proper waste management 
practices 
can 
lead 
to 
inefficient 
utilization of raw materials and an 
escalation in production costs.
We prioritize proper waste 
management 
practices 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
associated 
with 
waste 
and 
materials 
management. Our organization 
has 
implemented 
protocols 
for the storage, handling, and 
disposal of waste. We ensure 
compliance with all applicable 
regulations and industry best 
practices.

Water 
usage and 
management
R/O
Risk:
Water plays a vital role in construction 
activities 
and 
has 
significant 
implications 
for 
the 
environment 
throughout 
its 
extraction, 
usage, 
and discharge processes. Given the 
growing strain on water resources and 
the imperative to protect the natural 
environment, effective control and 
management of water resources have 
become crucial. Thus, it is essential to 
encourage the responsible and efficient 
use of water, along with the development 
of infrastructure that promotes its 
conservation in a sustainable and 
environmentally-friendly 
manner. 
Identifying 
and 
mitigating 
water-
related risks, as well as implementing 
responsible management procedures, 
are necessary steps towards achieving 
these goals.
Opportunity:
Implementing effective water usage 
and management practices not only 
reduces costs but also mitigates 
the adverse effects of groundwater 
depletion and water pollution.
We understand the importance 
of water management and 
subsequently, the Company 
shall put in efforts for efficient 
water conservation techniques, 
monitor water consumption 
and to identify areas for 
improvement. 
Additionally, 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
environmental standards and 
minimizing water-related risks.

Quality of 
Products and 
Project delivery
O
Quality serves as a crucial competitive 
advantage in the construction sector, 
which requires high levels of technical 
sophistication. 
Organizations 
must 
adhere 
to 
quality 
standards 
to 
effectively identify and fulfill customer 
needs and priorities. Failure to meet 
quality expectations or encountering 
issues related to customer health 
and safety can pose potential risks,

Customer 
Experience & 
Satisfaction
R
Establishing collaborative and enduring 
relationships with customers is the 
cornerstone of achieving success. 
The presence of customers and 
their 
acceptance 
of 
a 
business 
proposition are vital for its survival and 
sustainability. Any decline or cessation 
in customer demand can negatively 
impact the Company’s revenue and 
profitability. Aligning delivery objectives 
with those of the customer is essential 
in ensuring favorable outcomes and 
maintaining customer satisfaction.
We prioritize risk mitigation 
in customer experience and 
satisfaction by ensuring the 
quality of our services.
We closely align our processes 
and deliverables with customer 
expectations, 
striving 
for 
excellence in every aspect. 
We take proactive measures 
to 
address 
any 
issues 
promptly, provide timely and 
transparent 
communication, 
and make efforts towards early 
project delivery, all with the 
aim of exceeding customer
