by the RM. The KYCs are digitally 
captured and stored on the cloud.

Green Homes Initiatives 
tie-up with IFC   
We are trying to build a portfolio of 
green buildings in the aﬀordable,

with the advisory wing of IFC, we are 
creating a complete green housing 
framework for the evaluation and 
certiﬁcation process.   
The homes can be 
green-certiﬁed. This 
measure will in turn 
help reduce green-
house gas emissions.   
 
HomeFirst has Board approved policies on Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan. The 
policy document provides guidance for ensuring business continuity about people, process and
