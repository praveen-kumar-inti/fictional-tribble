Material issue 
identified*
Indicate whether 
risk or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk/opportunity
Increasing 
financial literacy
Indians traditionally lean towards saving money and investing in 
secure instruments. However, increasing financial literacy can broaden 
horizons and provide new investment perspectives
Digitisation
The demand for digital transactions is steadily increasing, driven by 
low-cost internet data, widespread smartphone penetration, and India’s 
biometric identity card system
Date security 
and customer 
privacy
The Company’s technology infrastructure is expanding, heightening the 
risk of privacy breaches and data security vulnerabilities
Corporate 
governance
The Company prioritises growth, while ensuring compliance, maintains 
asset quality through ethical and transparent practices, and provides 
necessary disclosures to regulators and stakeholders. This commitment 
upholds their trust and enhances the Company’s reputation and goodwill
Customer 
satisfaction
The Company serves a broad client base with financial products and 
services. Any undesirable customer experience could lead to customer 
attrition or  reputational damage
Human capital 
development
Managing the skills, capabilities and power of employees within an 
organisation is crucial
Everything from recruitment, development, retention, and rewards 
to enhancing performance contributes to the Company's talent 
management strategy
A well-directed talent management system, elevate the organisation to 
new heights and lay the groundwork for fostering leadership
The main objective of the talent management process is to hire the 
most talented individuals for the organisation
Climate change
The emergence of climate change has created new material risks and 
heightened reputational risks for businesses
There is a significant untapped opportunity as the country strengthens 
its resilience to climate risks
Shareholder activism regarding governance practices is on the rise
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
The responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or 
an opportunity to the business, the rationale for identifying the same, and the approach to adapt or mitigate the risk, along with 
its financial implications, are indicated below:

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No): 
	
	
No.
	
	
The Company’s primary focus is to provide financial solutions to its customers. Though sustainable sourcing may 
not be directly pertinent to its business operations, the Company remains dedicated to energy conservation and 
resource consumption reduction through the implementation of advanced technologies.
	
	
Through extensive utilisation of technology, the Company actively minimises its paper and fuel consumption. 
This strategic approach not only enhances efficiency but also demonstrates a commitment to minimising 
environmental impact.
	
	
Some initiatives that exemplify the Company's efforts towards sustainable sourcing include: 
	
	
•	
Transitioning from plastic pens to eco-friendly paper pens, thus reducing plastic usage and lessening the 
demand for plastic production, consequently leading to lower carbon dioxide emissions.
	
	
•	
Shifting from conventional notepads to recycled paper versions, to reduce the impact of tree depletion, 
decrease water usage, and reduce solid waste accumulation in landfills.
	
	
Moreover, these initiatives showcase the Company’s commitment to sustainable practices and environmental 
stewardship. Additionally, sustainable sourcing may not align directly with its primary business focus.

Due to the specific nature of the Company’s operations, opportunities for reclaiming, reusing, recycling, and disposing 
of products are somewhat constrained. However, the Company has established partnerships with renowned vendors 
to handle specific waste streams in a responsible manner. 
	
For instance, e-waste generated by the data centre undergoes collection by an authorised vendor, which subsequently 
processes it at their recycling and recovery unit. Furthermore, the Company has partnered with an authorised vendor 
to oversee the management waste originating from its air conditioning systems. Through collaboration with an HVAC 
waste management company, regular visits are conducted to collect all types of HVAC waste. Moreover, this waste 
undergoes disposal via a designated channel aimed at minimising carbon emissions.
	
By working closely with these vendors, the Company ensures that the waste is handled in an environmentally conscious 
manner, aligning with its commitment to sustainable practices.

i.	
Reducing plastic usage: The Company has transitioned from plastic pens to eco-friendly paper pens in its office

decrease in harmful carbon dioxide emissions, benefitting the environment.
	
ii.	
Usage of recycled paper: Currently, the Company uses recycled paper notepads instead of fresh paper onesr, 
conserving trees, reducing water usage, and minimising solid waste in landfills, and lowering carbon dioxide 
emissions.
	
iii.	
Provision of Company transport facility: The Company offers bus transportation to employees, reducing private 
vehicle usage and carbon dioxide emissions, thus promoting cleaner air quality.
	
iv.	
Energy Efficiency: Through the installation of motion sensors for office lighting and the utilisation of HVAC equipment 
with high energy ratings, the Company significantly saves power. This reduction in power consumption lessens the 
need for energy generation, subsequently lowering carbon dioxide emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion.
