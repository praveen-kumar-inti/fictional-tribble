service providers to bridge the rapidly growing “digital divide” by servicing billions of poor, bottom-of-pyramid consumers in 
rural and remote areas who would otherwise have been bereft of broadband connectivity for access to modern education, 
employment, healthcare and financial services. Moreover, the availability of high-speed broadband also has a positive 
environmental impact by allowing users to cut carbon emissions by teleworking, video conferencing, remote healthcare 
consultations, e-commerce, online banking, smart metering and other applications that reduce both road and air travel. As a 
responsible product company, we give due consideration to environmental issues like global warming, climate change etc. and 
our products are designed accordingly. As a global supplier of telecom equipment, our products are qualified in various countries 
including US & Europe to meet strict environmental, emission norms. We make an effort to choose energy-efficient chipsets that 
consume lesser power for equivalent functionality, during the component selection process. Engineering processes and analysis 
approves this in product planning to reduce the overall carbon footprint of each design. We have also designed some customer 
premise devices, especially those meant for powering remote areas with limited electricity, to include support for solar PV.
