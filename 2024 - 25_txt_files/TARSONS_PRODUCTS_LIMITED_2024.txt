(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1. 
Water and 
wastewater 
management
Risk 
Water scarcity poses a significant 
risk to companies reliant on water 
intensive operations, leading to 
operational disruptions and higher 
water 
procurement 
expenses. 
Additionally, 
manufacturing 
generates 
wastewater 
that 
requires treatment before disposal. 
Failure to comply with water 
quality regulations can result in 
compliance and mitigation costs.
With a strong commitment to water 
conservation, 
the 
Company 
will 
prioritize water stewardship through 
the implementation of conservation 
measures and the elimination of water 
wastage. The manufacturing process 
minimizes direct water consumption 
and utilizes hot water sparingly 
to 
reduce 
overall 
water 
usage. 
Furthermore, it will actively pursue 
water reuse and recycling initiatives 
to minimize freshwater consumption. 
These initiatives demonstrate the 
Company’s dedication to responsible 
water management, aiming to reduce 
environmental impact.

(Indicate

2.
Energy and 
Emissions 
Risk 
The 
manufacturing 
industry 
employs a range of machinery, 
which 
requires 
substantial 
energy consumption and leads 
to substantial direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
including 
carbon 
dioxide 
and 
methane 
from 
fuel 
usage. 
Additionally, 
manufacturing 
activities 
may 
generate 
air 
emissions such as sulphur dioxides 
(SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 
hazardous air pollutants.
 Recognizing the significance of 
emissions and energy management, 
the 
Company 
conducts 
annual 
monitoring of fugitive air emissions, 
including greenhouse gases like CO2 
and Methane. It emphasizes procuring 
materials 
from 
local 
vendors 
whenever 
feasible 
to 
minimize 
product imports. Furthermore, the 
Company 
implements 
controlled 
and well-planned business travel, 
adhering to a “travelling light” policy.
Negative
3.
Waste 
Management
Risk 
As a routine aspect of company 
operations, waste is generated 
through machinery maintenance, 
office administration, and general 
operations. 
Inadequate 
waste 
handling can result in air pollution, 
climate 
change, 
and 
adverse 
ecological effects. Furthermore, it 
poses health and safety hazards to 
individuals exposed to the waste. 
Failure to comply with waste 
management 
regulations 
may 
result in substantial fines.
The Company focuses on waste 
reduction 
by 
implementing 
measures such as reusing waste 
whenever feasible. Additionally, it 
adopts 
standardized 
approaches, 
in compliance with environmental 
laws and guidelines, for the storage, 
transportation, 
and 
disposal 
of 
hazardous waste.
Negative
4.
Employee 
Welfare and 
Engagement 
Risk 
Neglecting employee welfare and 
engagement can have detrimental 
effects on both individuals and 
the Company. Employees who 
perceive a lack of value, support, or 
engagement are prone to burnout, 
mental 
health 
problems, 
and 
physical ailments. This can lead to 
elevated absenteeism, decreased 
productivity, and higher turnover 
rates.
The Company implements diverse 
strategies 
to 
enhance 
employee 
engagement 
and 
satisfaction, 
such 
as 
offering 
training 
and 
development 
programs, 
providing 
comprehensive healthcare benefits, 
establishing grievance mechanisms 
to address concerns, and fostering 
career advancement and growth 
opportunities.

5.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk 
The Company relies heavily on 
manual labor for maintenance, 
repairs, 
and 
on-site 
tasks, 
exposing workers to potential 
hazards associated with powered 
haulage and heavy machinery. As 
a result, there is an increased risk 
of accidents, falls, fatalities, and 
injuries. Temporary employees, 
lacking sufficient training and 
experience, 
are 
particularly 
vulnerable. Failure to prioritize 
workers’ health and safety can 
lead to fines, penalties, and legal 
or regulatory actions. Additionally, 
health 
and 
safety 
risks 
can 
cause project delays, downtime, 
increased 
project 
costs, 
and 
reduced profitability.
The Company is committed to 
continually enhancing its occupational 
health and safety practices, aiming 
to ensure the well-being and safety 
of its workers and employees. The 
Company prioritizes safety through 
a 
thorough 
hazard 
identification 
process, providing employees with 
health 
and 
safety 
training 
and 
equipping them with suitable safety 
gear to effectively mitigate risks and 
protect their wellbeing.

Safety
Opportunity
Ensuring 
premium 
product 
quality and safety, plastic product 
manufacturers can enhance their 
reputation, foster customer loyalty, 
gain a competitive advantage, 
mitigate liability risks, and comply 
with 
regulations. 
Investing 
in 
the quality and safety of their 
products is a key factor in ensuring 
the 
longterm 
success 
and 
sustainability.

7.
Selling 
Practices 
& Product 
Labelling
Opportunity
Product labelling plays a crucial 
role in the manufacturing industry 
by providing vital information to 
consumers about product usage 
and safety precautions. Insufficient 
labelling can lead to consumer 
misuse 
or 
misunderstanding, 
potentially 
causing 
harm. 
Similarly, incorrect labelling can 
result 
in 
misidentification 
or 
misclassification 
of 
products, 
leading to disruptions in the supply 
chain, delays, and financial losses.

Labor 
Management
Risk
Companies that rely on on-site 
workers must implement effective 
labor 
management 
practices, 
considering 
factors 
such 
as 
workforce 
complexity 
(size, 
labor intensity, and operational 
locations), 
management-labor 
interaction, worker rights, and 
efforts to engage employees. 
Retention 
of 
skilled 
labor 
is 
particularly crucial to mitigate 
operational risks
The 
Company 
prioritizes 
labor 
management 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
well-defined 
policies 
and 
procedures 
related 
to employee benefits, compliance 
with labor standards and laws, 
provision of adequate training for 
job continuity, and various initiatives 
aimed at enhancing engagement and 
addressing worker grievances.
Negative
9.
Human 
Rights
Risk
Companies that prioritize respect 
for 
human 
rights 
showcase 
their dedication to establishing 
sustainable and mutually beneficial 
relationships with stakeholders 
affected 
by 
their 
operations, 
including customers, communities, 
workers, and investors. This entails 
demonstrating genuine concern 
for the well-being of the individuals 
whose lives they touch.
The Company acknowledges the 
significance of human rights issues, 
including aspects such as minimum 
wages, a no-child labor policy, the 
elimination of forced labor, and the 
prevention of sexual harassment. It 
diligently monitors compliance and 
ensures adherence to all relevant 
standards and laws. The Company 
remains 
open 
to 
address 
any 
violations or concerns related to 
human rights.
Negative
10.
Community 
Engagement 
and 
Development
Opportunity
By investing in the development 
of local communities, businesses 
contribute to the establishment 
of a stable, prosperous, and 
sustainable 
environment 
for 
their operations. This proactive 
approach not only benefits the 
community but also enhances the 
business’s position by fostering 
a supportive local economy and 
expanding its customer base.
-
Positive
11.
Anticorruption 
& Bribery 
Risk
Implementing 
robust 
anticorruption 
and 
anti-bribery 
measures is crucial for a company 
to 
uphold 
ethical 
standards, 
maintain its reputation, mitigate 
legal and financial risks, ensure 
fair competition, and foster trust 
among stakeholders.
The 
Company 
adheres 
to 
a 
comprehensive anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery policy, which serves 
as a guiding principle for its code 
of conduct. Robust monitoring and 
reporting procedures are in place to 
ensure compliance with applicable 
laws, and a reporting mechanism is 
provided to address any violations 
that may occur.

Compliance 
and Business 
Ethics
Risk
Business ethics and management 
cover significant concerns such 
as fraud, executive misconduct, 
corruption, money laundering, and 
anti-trust 
violations. 
Violations 
can 
result 
in 
investigations, 
hefty 
fines, 
settlements, 
and 
reputational damage. Regulatory 
compliance ensures adherence to 
government regulations, building 
trust, credibility, reputation, and 
customer appeal. Noncompliance 
can 
lead 
to 
fines, 
legal 
consequences, and reputational 
harm.
The 
Company 
maintains 
ethical 
standards 
by 
establishing 
clear 
ethical principles. Compliance with 
relevant laws is ensured through 
stakeholder engagement, and any 
violations are actively monitored 
and reported. Non-compliance with 
ethical and compliance norms is 
treated with utmost seriousness 
by the Company, which also offers 
effective mechanisms for reporting 
any instances of non-compliance.

Corporate 
Governance

of 
corporate 
governance 
and 
business ethics practices, including 
ownership, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency, on 
the well-being and interests of 
shareholders and investors.
The 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
effective corporate governance is 
reflected in its well-defined policies. 
These policies encompass board 
diversity, 
a 
comprehensive 
code 
of conduct, clear guidelines for

principles for resolving conflicts of 
interest, and conducting business
