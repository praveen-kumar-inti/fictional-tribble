1.
GHG Emissions
Risk
Greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions pose several risks 
for dairy companies, which 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
global emissions.
Climate change intensifies due 
to GHG emissions, leading to 
shifting weather patterns.
These 
shifts 
compromise 
the availability and quality of 
essential resources like water 
and feed crops for dairy cattle.
Rising temperatures increase 
heat stress in cattle, negatively 
affecting their health and 
productivity.
To mitigate GHG emissions risks, PMFL is 
taking the following actions:
Enhancing feed efficiency
•	 Improving the nutritional content and 
digestibility of cattle feed to reduce 
enteric methane emissions per unit of 
milk produced.
•	 Implementing 
precision 
feeding 
techniques to minimize waste and 
optimize animal performance.
•	 Decreasing manure emissions
•	 Utilizing better manure management 
practices such as composting and 
anaerobic digestion to reduce methane 
and nitrous oxide emissions.
•	 Exploring technologies that capture and 
reuse biogas for energy.
Negative
The impact of GHG emissions on 
climate change can create supply 
chain disruptions. Extreme weather 
events like droughts and floods 
can affect feed availability, milk 
production, 
and 
transportation 
logistics, resulting in input cost 
volatility and potential shortages.
Using 45% clean renewable energy in 
operations
Transitioning to solar, wind, and other 
renewable sources to power processing 
plants and other facilities.
Reducing reliance on fossil fuels, thereby 
lowering the company’s carbon footprint.
Implementing conservation measures
Promoting land stewardship practices that 
preserve soil health and biodiversity.
Investing in sustainable agriculture and 
regenerative practices across the supply 
chain.
Optimizing water usage
Installing 
water-efficient 
systems 
and 
recycling 
water 
wherever 
possible 
in 
production and cleaning processes.
Monitoring water usage to reduce waste and 
ensure sustainable consumption.
Addressing 
public 
concerns 
about 
ecological impact
Increasing 
transparency 
through 
sustainability 
reports 
and 
public 
communication.
Engaging with stakeholders and local 
communities to build trust and demonstrate 
environmental responsibility.

2.
Water Management
Risk
Effective water management 
is 
crucial 
in 
the 
dairy 
industry 
for 
maintaining 
hygiene, product quality, and 
sustainability.
Poor water quality can harm 
the taste, texture, and shelf-life 
of dairy products, impacting 
brand reputation. 
Water 
scarcity 
challenges 
animal 
welfare 
and 
farm 
profitability, as dairy farming 
relies heavily on water.
Unsustainable water usage 
and 
wastewater 
disposal 
can lead to pollution and 
ecosystem degradation.
To address water management risks, 
PMFL has implemented various strategies, 
including water conservation practices, 
monitoring water usage, and implementing 
water management plans.
As a result, it has significantly reduced water 
consumption per litre of milk handled.
Approximately 55% of the unit’s water 
usage is sourced from recycled sources, 
demonstrating commitment to responsible 
water management and environmental 
preservation.
This achievement is driven by recycling and 
reusing ETP-treated water for gardening, 
agriculture, and cleaning milk storage 
tankers, adoption of the Zero Liquid 
Discharge principle.
Negative 
Poor water management can lead 
to 
significant 
negative 
financial 
consequences 
for 
a 
company 
operating in the dairy industry. 
Dairy production is heavily water-
intensive, requiring large quantities 
for livestock, cleaning, processing, 
and cooling activities.
Scarcity of water resources can 
further disrupt production schedules, 
limit livestock health and milk yield, 
and cause raw material supply 
constraints, leading to lower output 
and revenue losses.
3.
Waste Management
Risk
Improper 
disposal 
of 
dairy waste can result in 
environmental 
pollution, 
contaminating 
water 
sources 
and 
harming 
local 
ecosystems. 
Health 
hazards emerge as manure 
accumulation 
becomes 
a 
ground for pathogens, posing 
threats to both livestock and 
nearby communities.
To mitigate the risk, PMFL has implemented 
effective waste management system by 
implementing 
end-to-end 
operations 
generate Fly ash, ETP Sludge, Paper 
waste and Plastic waste and treat them 
responsibly.
Negative
Poor waste management practices 
can result in significant financial 
risks for a company operating in 
the dairy industry. The production 
process 
generates 
substantial 
waste, including manure, wastewater, 
packaging 
materials, 
and 
by-
products from processing activities.
4.
Product Quality and Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Product quality and safety 
can pose both risks and 
opportunities 
for 
our 
Company. Here are some 
reasons:
Risk:
Food safety concerns, Cost 
of compliances, include hiring 
personnel, 
implementing 
quality control measures, and 
investing in technology to 
ensure product safety.
Opportunity:
Our Company differentiates 
themselves from competitors 
and establish a competitive 
advantage. Consumers are 
willing 
to 
pay 
more 
for 
products that are perceived to 
be of higher quality and safe. 
Prioritizing product quality and 
safety encourages innovation 
and differentiation within the 
industry. 
Implementing quality control measures, 
Investing in technology, Developing a 
robust crisis management plan, educating 
employees 
and 
collaborating 
with 
regulators.
Positive and Negative 
Positive
Prioritizing product quality and safety 
creates strong positive financial 
implications for the company. By 
differentiating 
themselves 
from 
competitors through superior quality 
and safe products, the company is 
able to build greater trust and loyalty 
among consumers, leading to more 
stable and consistent sales volumes. 
A strong focus on quality and safety 
encourages internal innovation and 
continuous improvement, resulting 
in the development of new and 
improved products that can capture 
additional market share.
Negative
Food safety concerns and the 
associated cost of compliances can 
lead to significant negative financial 
implications for a company.
Implementing strict quality control 
measures and acquiring advanced 
technologies for monitoring, testing, 
and traceability require substantial 
capital investment.

Customer   Welfare
Opportunity
Customer welfare presents 
a significant opportunity for 
our Company to improve 
their financial performance 
and 
grow 
their 
business. 
By 
prioritizing 
customer 
needs, dairy companies can 
build trust and loyalty with 
customers, 
increase 
sales 
and revenue, and enhance 
their brand reputation and 
market positioning, which can 
all contribute to long-term 
success.
-
Positive
Focusing on customer welfare has 
positive financial implications for a 
company in the dairy industry.
By ensuring that products are safe, 
nutritious, and responsibly produced, 
the company builds stronger trust 
and 
loyalty 
among 
consumers, 
leading to repeat purchases and 
long-term customer relationships.
As part of our commitment to public 
health and well-being, the company 
places 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
addressing nutritional deficiencies 
through our product offerings. By 
delivering high-quality, nutrient-rich 
dairy products, we aim to support 
better nutrition outcomes across the 
communities we serve.
This proactive approach not only 
aligns with our mission to promote 
healthier lifestyles but also plays a 
vital role in enhancing customer trust 
and loyalty.
6.
Competitive Behaviour
Opportunity
Competitive behaviour is an 
opportunity for our Company, 
as it can lead to innovation, 
increased 
market 
share, 
improved efficiency, higher 
customer 
satisfaction, 
and 
overall industry growth.
-
Positive
Competitive 
behaviour 
creates 
positive financial implications for 
the company by driving innovation, 
operational 
improvements, 
and 
market expansion. 
In responding to competition, the 
company is encouraged to develop 
better products, optimize processes, 
and enhance customer service-
actions that attract new customers 
and strengthen existing customer 
loyalty. As part of this strategy, the 
company is actively prioritizing new 
product 
development, 
ensuring 
that it remains agile and responsive

7.
Data Privacy and Security
Risk
Ensuring the security of data 
across the entire value chain-
particularly customer data-
is critical to the continuity 
and integrity of our business 
operations. Any breach of 
data privacy could lead to 
the exposure of sensitive 
company 
information, 
resulting in potential fraud, 
operational disruptions, and 
reputational damage.
With the company’s product-
Avvatar 
also 
being 
sold 
through online platforms, the 
importance of robust data 
privacy 
and 
cybersecurity 
measures 
is 
significantly 
heightened. 
We 
continue 
to invest in advanced IT 
infrastructure, secure payment 
systems, 
and 
compliance 
with relevant data protection 
regulations to mitigate these 
risks and uphold the trust our 
customers place in us.
The Company has implemented a cyber 
security policy to prevent any possible 
cyber-attack, data breach or any sabotage 
attempt to disrupt business processes.
The Company has also developed a 
proper business continuity plan which 
includes building of redundancy for entire IT 
infrastructure and network.
Negative
Data 
breaches 
pose 
significant 
financial risks to the company, 
including potential regulatory fines, 
legal 
liabilities, 
and 
operational 
disruptions—particularly 
critical 
given our growing online presence 
through the Avvatar brand.
A serious breach can lead to loss of 
customer trust, reduced sales, and 
long-term reputational damage.
These 
risks 
underscore 
the 
importance of robust data protection 
measures as a key element of our 
business continuity and financial 
resilience strategy.

challenges, 
targets and achievements
“At Parag  Milk  Foods  Limited, we believe that sustainable growth is the foundation 
of long-term success. Over the past year, we have taken decisive steps to 
reduce our environmental footprint while delivering value to our customers 
and communities. We achieved a 52% increase in energy consumption from 
renewable sources, a 29% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and a 
13.5% decrease in particulate matter from air emissions. These achievements 
are a direct result of our investments in solar and biogas energy, use of wood 
briquettes, and adoption of more eco-friendly refrigerants. Our biogas generation 
initiatives-across ETP plants and farms-not only support internal energy needs 
but also empower over 250 milk producers through integrated renewable energy 
systems, reducing their dependence on conventional fuels. We are proud to 
say that these efforts reflect our unwavering commitment to environmental 
responsibility.
In parallel, we continue to prioritize customer welfare by focusing on nutrition, 
product quality, and sustainable sourcing. With a strong emphasis on new 
product development, we are responding to evolving consumer needs while 
maintaining high standards of hygiene, sanitation, and quality control. Our 
competitive approach drives continuous improvement across operations, from 
packaging innovations to waste reduction and water conservation. By reducing 
water consumption per litre of milk, increasing water recycling, and transitioning 
toward 100% recyclable packaging by 2030, we are not just meeting compliance-
we are shaping a future our stakeholders can be proud of. These efforts reflect 
our mission to grow responsibly while creating lasting positive impact for our 
customers, partners and the planet.”

Investment in Emission Control: Installation and Commissioning of Electrostatic 
Precipitator (ESP)-
An investment of H2.5 crore was made towards the successful installation and 
commissioning of an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP), an advanced air pollution control 
technology designed to remove suspended particulate matter from boiler flue gases.
In compliance with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms, which mandate 
particulate emission levels below 75 PPM, the installed ESP has enabled us to achieve 
emissions of less than 30 PPM. This significant improvement reflects the effectiveness 
of our design engineering, meticulous project execution, and our strong commitment to 
environmental compliance.
Visible improvements have been observed in ambient air quality, particularly in the 
reduction of chimney smoke and the enhanced cleanliness of the surrounding farmland. 
This initiative represents a major milestone in our ongoing commitment to sustainability

procurement practices are essential to building long-term value and ensuring the well-being 
of all stakeholders involved in our supply chain.
Empowering Dairy Farmers
Dairy farmers represent a vital link in our supply chain. Engaging directly with them provides 
a unique opportunity to address pressing sustainability challenges while co-creating resilient 
and sustainable value chains. Through close collaboration, we aim to enhance farmers’ 
livelihoods and strengthen the overall stability of our operations.
Efficient Procurement and Logistics
Recognizing the perishable nature of milk, we prioritize direct procurement from farmers 
to ensure freshness and quality. Our state-of-the-art logistics infrastructure enables rapid 
transportation to chilling centers, preserving the nutritional value of milk and significantly 
reducing waste across the supply chain.
Environmentally Responsible Sourcing Strategy
Sustainability is integrated into every step of our sourcing strategy. By adopting 
environmentally responsible practices, we not only support the efficient delivery of fresh milk 
to millions of consumers but also contribute to lowering our ecological footprint. This holistic 
approach ensures that our operations benefit both the environment and the communities 
we serve.

Particulars
Response

Whether an 
occupational health and 
safety management 
system has been 
implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If 
yes, the coverage such 
system?
Our Company is dedicated to ensuring the health, safety and overall well-being of its employees 
through the implementation of the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 
framework. As part of this commitment, regular awareness sessions are conducted to educate 
employees on various safety-related aspects, promoting a culture of safety and responsibility in 
the workplace.
In addition to general safety training, the Company provides specialized instruction in key 
operational areas such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) and Total 
Productive Maintenance (TPM), reinforcing our focus on both preventive risk management and 
operational excellence.
Recognizing that employee well-being extends beyond physical safety, the Company actively 
supports mental health by organizing programs and interactive sessions with well-being experts 
and medical professionals.
b)
What are the processes 
used to identify work-
related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
All work-related hazards associated with routine activities are systematically identified and 
assessed through the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process. Based on this 
assessment, appropriate control measures are implemented to mitigate or eliminate potential 
risks. The site-specific risk register is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in 
operations or newly identified hazards.
In addition to internal evaluations, the Company conducts regular audits-either independently 
or at the request of customers—to identify both routine and non-routine work-related hazards. 
These audits play a critical role in ensuring ongoing compliance, maintaining workplace safety, 
and fostering a proactive approach to risk management.
c)
Whether you have 
processes for workers 
to report the work-
related hazards and 
to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Our Company has clear processes for reporting work-related hazards to their supervisors or 
designated safety officers. These processes includes both formal reporting mechanisms, such as 
incident reports, and informal reporting mechanisms, such as verbal reporting. Workers are also 
trained on how to identify and report hazards in their workplace.
Additionally, regular safety audits and training are conducted to ensure workers are aware of and 
follow these processes.
d)
Do the employees/ 
worker of the entity 
have access to non-
occupational medical 
and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No)
Each location has undertaken various certifications and follow the Group policy towards employee 
safety and wellbeing.

project related to reducing 
Green House Gas emission? If 
yes, then provide details.
•	
Solar Power Agreements: We have entered into agreements for the purchase and delivery 
of solar power with Tata Solar Power, committing to an 8 MVA Solar Power capacity. The 
Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), Shareholder Agreement (SHA), and Power Delivery 
Agreement (PDA) have been completed.
•	
Biogas Power Generation: Currently, we are generating 2,000 units per day from biogas 
produced at our Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). This renewable energy is being used to 
support operations and reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources.
•	
Biogas for Canteen Operations: Biogas generated from our ETP is also being used in 
our canteen, replacing 7 LPG cylinders per day. This has led to an annual savings of 49,000 
kg of LPG, demonstrating our commitment to utilizing renewable energy sources in daily 
operations.
•	
Refrigeration System Upgrade: We have transitioned 1,200 TR refrigeration units from 
Freon to 134A, which contributes to the reduction of ozone depletion. We plan to replace all 
remaining Freon-based systems by 2026 to further mitigate environmental impact.
•	
Ozone-Friendly Refrigerants: Additionally, 12 TR refrigeration units have been replaced 
from R22 to R407C, a more environmentally friendly alternative. We will continue replacing 
Freon-based refrigeration units until 2026.
•	
Wood Briquettes for Boilers: In our efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels, we have 
switched to wood briquettes for boiler operations, leading to a reduction in coal consumption 
by 6 tons annually.
•	
Biogas Generation from Cow Dung: At our cow farm, we are generating 1,800 units per 
day of biogas from cow dung. This renewable energy contributes to both environmental 
sustainability and operational efficiency.
•	
Integrated Renewable Energy and Sustainable Agriculture: In partnership with Irisoil 
Agro Tech Pvt. Ltd, we have launched an integrated renewable energy and sustainable 
agriculture scheme for our milk producers. This initiative provides household-level biogas 
plants, slurry filtration units, vermicomposting bags and ozola bags at no cost about 250 milk 
producers. As a result, these farmers no longer need to purchase gas cylinders throughout 
the year, reducing their dependency on non-renewable energy.
