Headquartered in Hyderabad, Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), 
was incorporated on 16 July, 1970 as a Public Sector Undertaking 
under the Ministry of Defence, Government of India to be 
the manufacturing base for guided missile systems and allied 
equipment for the Indian Armed Forces.
Since its inception, BDL has been working in collaboration with 
DRDO & foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for 
manufacture and supply of various missiles and allied equipment 
to Indian Armed Forces.
The lead taken by the Nation to develop indigenous, sophisticated 
and contemporary missiles through the Integrated Guided Missile 
Development Programme (IGMDP), gave BDL an opportunity to 
be closely involved in the programme, wherein it was identified 
as the Prime Production Agency. This opened up a plethora 
of opportunities to assimilate advanced manufacturing and 
programme management technologies and skills.
Today, BDL has evolved as one among the few industries in 
the world having state-of-the-art facilities for manufacture and 
supply of Guided Missiles, Underwater Weapons, Air- borne 
products and allied defence equipment for the Indian Armed 
Forces. The Company also offers Product Life Cycle Support and 
Refurbishment / Life Extension of vintage Missiles.
BDL has graduated from being a missile manufacturer to a 
Weapon System Integrator and has emerged as a complete 
solution provider for the Indian Armed Forces.
BDL has three manufacturing units, out of which two are located in 
Telangana State (Hyderabad and Bhanur) and one Andhra Pradesh 
(Visakhapatnam). As a part of expansion plan, the Company is in 
the process of setting up of additional manufacturing facilities at 
Ibrahimpatnam (near Hyderabad), Amravati in Maharashtra and 
Jhansi in UP which will be used to manufacture Surface to Air 
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Missiles (including new generation Missiles), VSHORAD rockets 
and propellants for various Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) 
respectively.
BDL has been constantly working towards upgrading its 
manufacturing technologies and processes to state-of-the-art 
including industry 4.0, Robotics operated workshops, latest 
Surface Mounted Devices assembly lines and has always 
maintained highest quality standards in its products by adopting 
to best QA practices like AS 9100, etc. The pursuit has resulted in 
reduction in production cost, benchmarking of productivity norms 
and modernization of management system and less dependence 
on imported technology.
The ‘ease of doing business’ approach adopted by the Government 
of India has paved the way to create a congenial ecosystem for 
the company to manufacture products indigenously and offer 
its products/services to the customers, both, the Indian Armed 
Forces and the global buyers. During last few years, the Company 
has forayed into international market by offering its products to 
friendly foreign countries.
BDL, with its over five decades of missile and allied defence 
equipment manufacturing experience, skill-sets developed and 
state-of-the-art infrastructure, is poised to enter new avenues of 
manufacturing covering a wide range of weapon systems such as 
Air-to-Air Missiles, Air-to-Surface Missiles, Air Defence Systems, 
Underwater Weapons and Mines.
The quest for technological excellence has been the guiding 
principle of BDL and living up to the sobriquet, ‘THE FORCE 
BEHIND PEACE’.

10) Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Food waste is being disposed by means of animal feeding. The biomedical waste is being disposed through the agency registered 
with the Pollution Control Board on alternate working days. The lead acid batteries are given to the authorized recyclers/dealers 
on buy back basis as and when required. Metal scrap is being disposed through M/s MSTC. All hazardous waste and e-waste 
are disposed through the agency registered by Pollution Control Board. Effluent generated from electroplating processes is 
treated in effluent treatment plan and later again it is treated in reverse osmosis system. RO output is utilized in the form of 
demineralized water inside the premises. Sewage is treated in sewage treatment plant. The treated water from sewage treatment 
plant is used for gardening purpose. The hazardous and toxic chemicals are stored securely at identified place and disposed after 
accumulation of sufficient quantity. Continuous monitoring of effluent thereby reducing the generation of ETP/Paint sludge from 
the electroplating section. Because of automated machines, the solid waste such as metals and non-metals are being reduced 
from the process. PAC (Coagulants) is being used in final treated effluent resulted into minimizing the hazardous waste i.e. ETP 
sludge.
	
BDL has formulated policy to ban the single use plastics inside the premises. The shredded waste papers are being used to pack 
products. BDL has reduced paper consumption by means of the following:
•	
Pay – slips are issued in electronic form.
•	
E-mail system is being used to receive communications like Inter Department Notes (IDN), letters, circulars, agenda and 
minutes of meetings etc. 
•	
Conduct ACR system through online.
