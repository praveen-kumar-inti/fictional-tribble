Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, and 
achievements 
Dear Stakeholders,
It gives me immense pleasure to unveil our inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report in compliance with framework 
prescribed by SEBI. The report is an illustration of the Company's environmental and social performance during the reporting period, 
which demonstrates our commitment towards creating long term value for our stakeholders.
Despite the various economic challenges faced during the reporting period the Company was able to overcome them by embracing an 
ESG framework. The framework has enabled the Company to integrate ESG into every aspect of its business strategy. It has not only 
enabled us to identify various risks & opportunities but also set an action plan to mitigate risks and improve upon our performance 
towards key objectives. 
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022-2023 (Contd.)
During the reporting period, we have aligned with the 4V model, i.e., Vision, Value, Velocity & Visibility to help us drive our ESG ambitions. 
Thus, our endeavour to be admired by stakeholders for our sustainable performance, ethics and culture has led us to attaining new heights, 
which is illustrated in the following sections of the report.
I hereby thank all our stakeholders for demonstrating unflinching faith in our endeavors. This has been a great source of motivation for us to 
perform to the best of our abilities and to ensure that we continue offering our services seamlessly. We look forward to your continued 
support and insights so as to benchmark ourselves with the best practices in the area of sustainability.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
The Company reckons with the growing impact of climate change and have set forth in a low carbon journey by adopting proactive 
steps.
Adopting energy efficient technologies - The Company has adopted new technologies and upgraded existing infrastructure to 
reduce its energy intensity (details of such measures are available in Annexure - A of the Directors’ Report).
Enhancing green energy - In this endeavor BCL has already installed Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) to the tune of 24 MW and 
integrated 12.5 MW of solar plants to source cleaner and greener forms of energy and are in the process of revamping the capacity to 
25.3 MW and 17.5 MW respectively in the near future. 
Enhance use of Alternative Fuel Sources - The Company has charted its plans to increase Thermal Substitution Rate (TSR) from the 
current level of 8.5% to 25% by 2026 as a strategic vision at its cement manufacturing units through increased sourcing and 
consumption of wastes of other industries as alternative fuels. The Company’s jute division utilizes jute waste to generate electricity 
and steam at its captive power plants, thereby avoiding use of fossil fuels in operations.
Reducing clinker factor in cement - The Company identifies and utilizes alternative raw materials in the form of fly ash and slag to 
gradually reduce proportion of clinker in cement products, thereby reducing carbon footprint from calcination of limestone. The 
Company has also explored the feasibility for manufacturing of LC3 cement (future step towards reducing carbon emission). 
Removing emissions through offsets - The Company has invested extensively in planting over 8.5 lakh trees and maintaining green 
cover in and around mining, plants and residential areas to enhance offsets on a year-on-year basis. The Company also plans to explore and 
evaluate opportunities to invest in carbon capture technologies that enable us to achieve carbon negative operations in the long term.
Optimizing logistics transportation - Reducing emissions across our value chain is equally important to address climate change. The 
Company applies digital and innovative technologies such as BTAP wagons and Integrated Logistics Management system to optimize 
routes, reduce turnaround time and thereby reduce its emissions.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
The Company recognizes that every material has an intrinsic value not only in its use phase but also at the end of life. The generation of 
any waste materials is a result of significant under utilization of resources and products. The intrinsic value can be unlocked through 
efficient and responsible management of waste.
While the Company’s cement kilns offer a unique solution to address climate change by managing waste generated by societies and 
industries responsibly, it has made focused efforts within the boundary of its operations to segregate waste at source and conserve our 
natural resources through minimization of waste.
The following measures have been taken by the Company to manage significant waste in its operations:
Plastics (including packaging) 
Plastic waste generated by Jute division is disposed off through authorized recyclers.
E-waste
The Company is not in the business of electronic consumer goods. However, the E-waste 
produced during the office operations is sold to the registered recyclers.
Hazardous waste
The hazardous waste generated is disposed through the registered recyclers or disposers 
having permissions from State Pollution Control Boards.
Jute waste
The Company utilizes in process jute waste as fuel for its captive power plant for the jute mill in 
Birlapur to generate steam and electricity.
Biodegradable waste
Biodegradable waste generated at our premises is converted to manure through automatic 
organic waste composting machine.
Other waste
Other non-hazardous waste such as steel scrap generated at the premises is recycled through 
authorized recyclers who provide valid certificates of the end use. Coal ash generated at captive 
power plants is utilized in-house as an additive to cement manufacturing.

Outcome of the initiative
Saving of  ` 53.5 Lakhs achieved.
Saving of ` 8.6 Lakhs achieved resulting 
from 1.74 Lakh units saved.
Saving of ` 22 Lakhs achieved resulting from 
improving power factor to more than 0.995.
When 27 MW TPP operates at 25MW load, 
steam consumption reduced at  from 4.36 
Kg/kwh to 4.22 Kg/kwh & saved 16-17 
MT/day coal.
Saving of 56.4 KW achieved.
After this modification saving in specific heat 
consumption would be 5 - 8 kCal/kg of 
clinker.
The new circuit bypassing the old system of 
crushed limestone pile formation and 
reclaimation will result in cost saving of 
` 2.43 / T.
Commissioning of this system will result in 
reduction in material transportation costs 
and improvement in environment.
After this system is taken in circuit, there will 
be reduction in specific power consumption 
in coal grinding at CCW Plant.
