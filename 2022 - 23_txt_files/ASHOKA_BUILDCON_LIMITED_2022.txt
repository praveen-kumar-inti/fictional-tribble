Carbon emission is considered the 
primary driver of global climate 
change. The scientific studies have 
proven that carbon emissions from 
industries strengthen the greenhouse 
effect, causing climate change. 
The Organization is working on 
a plan to reduce the emissions 
and align itself to the emission 
reduction commitments.

Negative 
9 
Health 
& 
Safety 
Risk 
Because of the nature of its operations, the 
Organization has to negotiate with a risk, which 
could jeopardize the health and safety of our

can lead to the harm, injury, death, or illness of 
employees at the workplace or could harm

Opportunity Employee engagement is an objective and 
subjective measure of the interest, drive, level of 
enthusiasm and dedication employees feel 
toward 
their 
job 
and 
their

responsibilities. This is an opportunity for the 
Organization as it has been observed that better 
engaged employees are more concerned about
