Integration of acquisitions has in the 
past required a period of adjustment 
before efficiencies were fully realised. 
Raksha and Medvantage, for instance, 
moved to positive contribution 
within a few quarters as processes 
were streamlined and scale benefits 
captured.
Impact and Strategic Direction
Strategic Roadmap
The proposed acquisition of 
Paramount, previously owned by 
Fairfax Asia and the Shah family, 
marks a milestone in the TPA 
sector, consolidating Medi Assist's 
position as a market leader. Medi 
Assist's market share by premiums 
managed will increase by ~6% in 
the Group segment and by ~4% 
in the health insurance industry 
(Group + Retail), on March 2024 
proforma basis. This strategic move 
strengthens our market leadership 
and aligns with our long-term 
vision of making quality healthcare 
accessible and efficient.
Paramount Health Services 
& Insurance TPA
Earlier acquisitions such as 
Medvantage and Raksha were 
fully integrated and contributed 
positively to profitability. 
Improvements were achieved 
through automation of claim 
management, rationalisation of 
support functions, and the use of 
Medi Assist’s existing infrastructure. 
These integrations have 
strengthened both the retail and 
corporate portfolios, supporting 
higher retention and efficiency.

BUSINESS MODEL
Resilient Business Model 
and High Barriers to Entry
Market Leadership 
and Scale
Technology-Driven  
Operational Excellence
Diversified and Enduring 
Stakeholder Relationships
Medi Assist’s domain expertise, superior 
technology infrastructure, exclusive 
network arrangements, and deep 
relationships create significant barriers 
to entry for competitors. The Company’s 
asset-light business model, negative 
working capital, and consistency in 
revenues further reinforce its resilience, 
enabling it to sustain leadership in a 
consolidating industry landscape.
Medi Assist’s leadership in the health 
benefits administration sector is rooted 
in its ability to operate efficiently at 
scale, serving a broad spectrum of 
insurers, corporates, policyholders 
and manage government schemes as 
well as their beneficiaries. This scale 
translates into superior bargaining 
power with healthcare providers, the 
ability to negotiate preferential pricing, 
and the resources to invest in deploying 
professional talent and technology and 
drive innovation ahead of the curve. The 
Company’s market position also attracts 
new business, strengthens its brand, and 
enables it to shape industry standards 
as the benefits administrator of choice.
Strategic investment in proprietary 
technology platforms over the last several 
years has allowed Medi Assist to create 
superior capabilities in delivering seamless, 
efficient, and transparent services to all 
stakeholders. Automation, AI, and digital 
workflows reduce manual intervention, 
lower costs, and improve accuracy in claims 
processing and policy management while 
managing scale efficiently. The flexibility of 
these platforms supports both managed 
services and SaaS models, catering to 
clients at various stages of digital maturity 
and potential for augmenting in-house 
or 3rd party systems to new-generation 
capabilities and integrations..
Medi Assist’s services directly / indirectly  
leading insurers, large corporates, 
government programmes and millions of 
beneficiaries, while engaging with other 
stakeholders including brokers, agents, 
insurance aggregators, telehealth and ou-
patient service providers etc., reflecting 
its ability to manage diverse needs with 
consistency and reliability. Long-standing 
relationships, often spanning over 
decades, provide stability in revenue, 
with high retention and growth rates 
demonstrating improving satisfaction 
and trust. This diversified engagement 
model also creates opportunities for 
cross-selling value-added services and 
deepening stakeholder relationships.
Comprehensive and  
Exclusive Healthcare Network

Data Analytics / Insights
Robust Financial Performance 
and Balance Sheet
The Company’s extensively curated pan-
India network ensures that policyholders 
have access to a wide array of quality 
healthcare services covering facilities 
across urban and rural locations. 
Exclusive arrangements with select 
insurers for network access and helping 
hospitals in managing ‘insurance/credit’ 
aspect in an evolving insurance landscape 
enables Medi Assist to offer cost-effective 
solutions, manage medical inflation, and 
enhance the member experience. This 
network advantage also enables last mile 
support in India as Mayfair focuses on 
strengthening network capabilities across 
global benefits administration business.
Medi Assist investments in digitisation 
and improving quality of data for years 
has enabled creation of a large digital 
health repository. The Company is a 
leader in leveraging AI/ML and advanced 
analytics to drive capabilities that enable 
to identify trends, personalise offerings, 
and develop innovative solutions that 
address emerging needs. The Company 
is emerging as a leader in AI enabled 
Fraud prevention with a Proprietary 
FDE (fraud detection engine). Enhanced 
fraud detection and predictive analytics 
further support operational efficiency 
and risk management for the insurers. 
Medi Assist’s financial strength is 
developed through disciplined cost 
management, strong cash flows, 
and prudent capital allocation. The 
Company’s negative working capital 
model and consistent and growing 
revenue streams provide resilience 
against market volatility, while healthy 
margins and liquidity enable continued 
investment in growth initiatives and 
technology upgrades. The Company 
has a robust capital allocation strategy 
to benefit from investments over long-
term and efficient capital management 
that positively impact return ratios.
A combination of market leadership, 
technological advancement, and 
financial resilience positions Medi 
Assist as the partner of choice for 
insurers, corporates, and members. 
Strategic Initiatives and  
Global Opportunity
A strategic approach to mergers and 
acquisitions has enabled Medi Assist 
to expand its capabilities, geographic 
footprint, and market presence / share. 
Medi Assist has an established template 
to improve efficiency in operations and 
technology of the acquired entities to 
ensure seamless integration and improve 
operating and financial metrics over long 
term. The integration of Mayfair We Care, 
UK, and other acquisitions have positioned 
the Company to serve Indian corporates 
with global operations and tap into the 
international private medical insurance 
market to support Indian and global 
insurers with superior health benefits 
administration. This global perspective 
supports diversification and long-term 
growth towards borderless benefits.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Delivering Growth in a 
Complex Environment
 
FY25 was a year of strong 
performance and operational 
progress. We closed the year with 
consolidated operating revenue 
of ₹7,233.2 million, reflecting 
a 14% Y-o-Y growth while 
maintaining an EBITDA margin 
of 21.3% and delivering a PAT of 
₹916.0 million. These outcomes 
reaffirm the resilience of our 
business model and our ability to 
grow efficiently despite broader 
industry sluggishness.
Our market share of the total 
Health Insurance industry 
in India by Premiums under 
management rose to 30.3% in the 
Group segment and 5.7% in the 
Retail segment.The Acquisition 
of Paramount will add ~₹3,800 
- ₹4,000 Cr of incremental 
Premiums Under Management 
significantly enhancing our 
scale. It also deepens our 
provider network and potential 
for meaningful operational 
efficiencies once the integration 
is completed. Most importantly, it 
allows us to extend our advanced 
technology capabilities, including 
AI-led fraud detection, intelligent 
claims automation, and 
predictive insights and enrich 
the policyholder experience and 
streamline benefits management.
Investing in Capabilities 
That Matter
 
We continued to invest in  
scale, quality, and platform- 
level innovation. 
Raksha Prime, which enables 
a seamless instant checkout 
experience using predictive 
tools saw great adoption across 
policyholders facilitating more 
than 175k discharges. Our 
curated network is an outlier on 
medical inflation management 
with average claim size growth 
at sub 6% annually, making 
health insurance sustainable in 
an environment where insurers 
are seeing significant impact in 
their portfolios due to increased 
severity and frequency.
Our significant investments 
in quality of data, building 
proprietary AI/ML models 
have led to development of 
an advanced fraud, waste, 
and abuse (FWA) detection 
capabilities , contributing to over 
₹390 crore in savings for our 
insurer partners during the year. 
Our detection accuracy improved 
1.5x year-on-year, reflecting 
continuous investments in 
analytics, fraud detection 
rules engine, and provider-
side surveillance. As we move 
forward, we plan to decouple this 
engine to make it interoperable 
with any core processing system, 
further expanding its utility 
across the ecosystem.
As we look ahead, Medi Assist is 
scaling our capabilities beyond 
administration to orchestrate 
value across the full spectrum 
of health benefits. Our evolution 
from a TPA to a full-fledged 
Health Benefits Administrator 
(HBA) reflects a real shift in how 
we think about partnerships, 
technology, product design, and 
stakeholder outcomes.
We are building toward a 
modular, unbundled architecture, 
thereby allowing insurers 
and employers to plug into 
services based on their unique 
needs, whether in claims, fraud 
control, member engagement, 
or international benefits, which 
opens up a new growth frontier.
Our global IPMI platform, Mayfair, 
will continue to grow with Indian 
and international insurers looking 
for seamless access and claims 
support across borders.
We are reimagining claims, 
support, and account 
management workflows,  
not just for speed or cost, but 
to build adaptive, intelligent 
systems that can evolve with 
regulatory expectations and 
policyholder behaviour. We’re 
not just preparing for the future, 
we’re building it.
Medi Assist stands uniquely 
positioned at the centre of what 
matters, to deliver solutions with 
integrity and impact.
With our scale, infrastructure, 
data intelligence, and operating 
maturity, we are not just 
managing claims, we are shaping 
the future of care access, benefits 
design, and payer-provider 
collaboration in India. Our 
commitment remains strong to 
our shareholders, our partners, 
our policyholders, and the larger 
health and insurance ecosystem.
Thank you for your continued 
trust and support.
Sincerely,
Satish V.N. Gidugu
 
Whole-Time Director and  
Chief Executive Officer
Dear Shareholders,
 
It gives me great pride to present 
to you the Annual Report for FY25, 
our first full year as a publicly listed 
company. This milestone marks more 
than a transition in our corporate 
journey; it reaffirms our long-standing 
commitment to transparency, value 
creation, and responsible leadership 
in India’s evolving healthcare and 
insurance ecosystem.
FY25 was a year that tested 
the industry’s fundamentals. 
Macroeconomic pressures, muted 
corporate hiring, and inflation-led 
shifts in retail health premiums created 
a challenging environment. Yet, Medi 
Assist remained focused, agile, and 
aligned to our purpose, delivering 
solutions that work at scale, across 
insurers, policyholders, and providers.
We expanded our provider network to 
20,204 hospitals, scaled Raksha Prime 
and delivered on industry benchmarks 
across discharge efficiency and 
improving cashless enablement. Our 
proposed acquisition of Paramount is 
a landmark development in the TPA 
industry in India and a significant step 
forward to consolidate best in class 
capabilities and portfolios and unlock 
value.
Our technology platform,  
MAtrix, is one of the most advanced,  
AI enabled,claims automation 
platforms in the industry and is 
emerging as the bedrock of our 
operations while managing significant 
volumes of the industry through our 
technology services vertical. Not only 
are we setting new benchmarks in 
efficiency and automation, several 
insurers have integrated with NHCX 
via our platform, and we are driving 
the insurer's compliance with 
IRDAI’s accelerated authorisation 
and discharge standards which 
were introduced in FY25. We also 
significantly advanced our capabilities 
in detecting Fraud, Waste and 
Abuse(FWA) ensuring not only faster, 
but also cleaner claims.  FY25  
showed us what’s possible. We are 
focused on scaling modular health 
benefits, cloud-native processing,  
and a bold transformation agenda 
across claims, services, and  
automation across the industry.

Harnessing the Forces of India’s 
Healthcare Transformation
MEGATRENDS (1/2)
India's healthcare and insurance sectors are on the cusp of transformation, driven by 
demographic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving consumer preferences. 
As the country's population grows and urbanises, the demand for quality healthcare 
and comprehensive insurance coverage is surging. This dynamic landscape presents 
unprecedented opportunities for players like Medi Assist to shape the future of health 
benefits administration in India.
Increasing Focus on Preventive Healthcare 
Megatrend 
 
India’s rising burden of chronic diseases is 
driving demand for preventive care. With over 
100 million people living with diabetes and 
82 million with multiple chronic conditions1, 
the emphasis is shifting from treatment to 
prevention. Government programmes such as 
Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres 
and large-scale teleconsultation platforms are 
reinforcing the shift towards early intervention 
and healthier lifestyles.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist has the opportunity to tackle India's 
chronic disease burden through its plug-and-
play OPD platform that empanels outpatient and 
wellness partners for cashless preventive services. 
Combined with advanced AI/ML predictive models 
and extensive provider network, Medi Assist can 
efficiently process frequent, lower value preventive 
claims in a cashless model through technology 
while creating leadership, efficiency and superior 
policyholder experiences
Rising Healthcare Expenditure
Megatrend 
 
Healthcare spending in India continues to 
grow at a rapid pace, reaching USD 440 billion 
in 20232. Medical inflation, averaging 12% in 
20243, is putting a pressure on households 
and employers alike. With out-of-pocket 
expenses still accounting for ~40% of total 
spending 4 , structured health financing 
through insurance is becoming indispensable 
for both affordability and access.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist can manage rising healthcare 
expenditure and medical inflation by enabling 
structured, affordable healthcare consumption 
through its scale, curated provider network, and 
AI-powered cost containment tools. By delivering 
negotiated tariffs, predictive analytics, and seamless 
claims administration, Medi Assist reduces out-of-
pocket burden for households and helps insurers 
manage loss ratios. Its ability to and private covers 
positions it as a critical enabler of sustainable 
healthcare access in India.

Growth in Health Insurance Penetration
Megatrend 
 
Health insurance coverage is expanding, with 
~57 crore lives covered in FY20245. Government 
schemes such as PMJAY have widened access 
to nearly 360 million people, while the private 
market continues to serve the urban employed 
base. Yet, underinsurance remains a challenge as 
75% of policyholders have coverage of less than 
₹10 lakhs. This creates significant headroom for 
deeper penetration and higher-value products.
Leveraging the Trend 
  
Medi Assist has the opportunity to enable India's 
expanding health insurance coverage by addressing 
the underinsurance gap through technology-driven 
solutions, modular products, and advanced analytics. 
Its scale, curated provider network, and AI-led cost 
management enable insurers to offer affordable and 
appropriate health insurance supporting both private 
and government schemes, Medi Assist is uniquely 
positioned to drive deeper penetration, enhance 
member experience, and deliver sustainable, 
inclusive healthcare consumption across India’s 
evolving insurance ecosystem.
Expanding Role of Government in Insurance and Healthcare
Megatrend 
 
Government programmes now cover nearly 60% 
of India’s population6 , redefining the role of 
private insurers and TPAs. Public schemes like 
PMJAY are increasing access, while regulatory 
reforms such as mandatory coverage of pre-
existing conditions are expanding the overall 
addressable market. The government’s stated 
ambition of “Insurance for All by 2047” ensures 
that insurance penetration will remain a 
national priority.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist has the opportunity to support the 
rapid expansion of government health programmes 
and regulatory reforms by serving as the trusted 
execution backbone for both public and private 
insurers. With proven expertise in administering 
large-scale schemes and advanced technology 
platforms, it ensures transparent claims, efficient 
settlements, and wider network access. By bridging 
government coverage with private insurers and 
modular offerings, Medi Assist is positioned to, 
support “Insurance for All,” and deepen its market 
leadership.

Digital Transformation in Insurance
Megatrend 
 
The insurance sector is undergoing digital 
modernisation at every stage. IRDAI mandated 
adoption of the National Health Claim Exchange 
in 2023, paving the way for seamless, paperless 
claims. Integration with Ayushman Bharat Digital 
Mission has already created 728 million health 
IDs8. These developments are driving efficiency, 
reducing costs, and setting the foundation for a 
fully digital insurance ecosystem.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist has the opportunity to drive the digital 
transformation of insurance by deploying its AI-
enabled MAtrix adjudication platform and seamlessly 
integrating with NHCX and ABDM frameworks. With 
capabilities in digital enrolment, instant discharge, 
and consent-based claims, Medi Assist ensures faster, 
paperless settlements while improving compliance. Its 
interoperable technology stack positions it as a trusted 
partner to insurers navigating regulatory mandates, 
enabling scalable, transparent, and cost-efficient health 
benefits administration in India’s digital-first ecosystem.
Consolidation in the TPA industry 
Megatrend 
 
The TPA industry in India is witnessing 
significant consolidation, driven by the need 
for scale and service integration. Only 19 TPAs 
remained active by 2025, and acquisitions by 
larger players are reshaping the competitive 
landscape7. The top firms now hold around 
70%+ of the market. Consolidation is expected 
to continue as scale advantages in technology 
and networks become decisive.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist is well-positioned to benefit from 
industry consolidation through its scale, financial 
strength, and proven integration capabilities. 
With acquisitions like Paramount and Mayfair, it 
has built a robust template for driving operational 
efficiencies, enhancing provider networks, and 
deploying advanced technology across acquired 
entities. As smaller TPAs exit, Medi Assist can 
further consolidate market share, deepen insurer 
relationships, and reinforce its leadership as 
India’s premier health benefits administrator.
Increasing use of TPAs in Health Insurance Ecosystem
Megatrend 
 
TPAs have become integral to health insurance 
delivery. In FY2024, they processed more 
than 70% of claims5, ensuring efficiency in 
settlements and wider access to hospital 
networks. As insurers seek cost control and 
service differentiation, TPAs are moving beyond 
administration to provide analytics, fraud 
detection, and member engagement, reinforcing 
their central role in the ecosystem.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist can capitalise on the central role of TPAs 
by expanding its technology-led solutions that go 
beyond claims processing. With AI-powered fraud 
detection, predictive analytics, and seamless digital 
platforms, Medi Assist delivers cost savings, faster 
settlements, and enhanced member engagement. Its 
scale, curated hospital network, and proven ability 
to manage complex group, retail, and government 
schemes, position it as the partner of choice in 
India’s evolving health insurance ecosystem.

Increasing Use of Artificial Intelligence 
and Machine Learning
Megatrend 
 
Artificial intelligence is becoming a defining 
feature of healthcare and insurance operations. 
Over one-third of healthcare organisations are 
piloting AI tools, with 16% already deploying 
generative AI8. These technologies are enabling 
predictive analytics, fraud detection, and 
personalised care management, opening up 
new opportunities for efficiency and member 
engagement across the insurance value chain.
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist is uniquely positioned to harness AI and 
ML by leveraging its proprietary fraud detection 
engine, predictive out-of-pocket cost tools, and 
real-time analytics platforms like MAven Insights. 
These innovations improve claims accuracy, 
contain medical inflation, and personalise member 
journeys. By embedding AI across workflows, Medi 
Assist drives efficiency for insurers, enhances 
transparency for members, and strengthens its role 
as the technology leader in India’s evolving health 
benefits administration ecosystem.

Rising Demand for Value-Added Services
Megatrend 
 
As health insurance becomes more 
competitive, stakeholders are looking beyond 
claims settlement. Value-added services for 
TPAs in India form a small part of revenues 
compared to a much larger share for peers in 
the US, indicating a large growth runway7. 
Leveraging the Trend  
 
Medi Assist has the opportunity to monetize the 
rising demand for value-added services by scaling 
its proprietary platforms like Raksha Prime, MAven 
Navigator, and MAven Insights, which enhance 
member experience, cost transparency, and financial 
planning. By moving beyond claims administration 
into predictive analytics, and digital engagement, 
Medi Assist can strengthen insurer partnerships, 
and align with global benchmarks, positioning itself 
as India’s leading technology-driven Health Benefits 
Administrator.

Management Discussion 
and Analysis 
Indian Economy
During the year under review, 
the Indian economy sustained 
growth while navigating a period 
of global economic volatility. 
India continued to be one of 
the fastest-growing major 
economies, with GDP projected 
to grow by 6.5% in FY25. Inflation 
moderated from 5.4% in FY24 
to 4.9% in FY25, supporting 
improved consumer sentiment 
and stimulating expenditure, 
especially within rural markets. 
Growth in rural consumption and 
a notable increase in investment 
activity characterised the 
reporting period. Momentum 
in capital formation reflects 
a favourable business 
environment, shaped by timely 
government interventions and 
targeted policy measures. The 
Production-Linked Incentive 
scheme, alongside the adoption 
of the China plus one strategy by 
global businesses, contributed to 
the comprehensive development 
of multiple industry sectors.
Foreign direct investment 
inflows reached USD 55.6 
billion in FY25, exceeding the 
previous year’s figures and 
supporting economic growth 
and industrial development. The 
continued focus on investment, 
accompanied by increased public 
expenditure, has underpinned 
positive economic prospects. 
Revisions to income tax slabs 
are further anticipated to raise 
disposable incomes, which 
may further support private 
consumption.
The Reserve Bank of India 
reduced the repo rate to 6.25% in 
February 2025, with a further cut 
to 6% in April. These efforts were 
taken to spur investment and 
economic activity, while striving 
for price stability. 
External accounts remained 
stable, with the current account 
deficit contained at 1.10% 
of GDP in 2024-25, a slight 
increase compared to 0.70% 
in the prior fiscal year. Strong 
financial inflows and a steady 
services trade surplus helped 
mitigate the impact of foreign 
portfolio outflows and currency 
fluctuations. While domestic 
investment, easing inflation, and 
timely policy measures enhanced 
India’s ability to maintain 
momentum, external challenges 
remained.
Indian Healthcare Sector
India’s healthcare sector has 
emerged as one of the nation’s 
most significant industries in 
terms of both revenue generation 
and employment. The total 
market size reached over 
$370 billion in 2022. The post-
pandemic period saw the sector’s 
scale rise from approximately 
$280 billion in 2020 to $440 
billion in 2023, representing an 
estimated annual growth of 16%. 
This accelerated trajectory has 
been driven by increased demand 
for quality healthcare, rising 
private and public investment, 
and rapid adoption of digital 
health solutions.

Current healthcare 
industry landscape  
in India 
Although India’s healthcare sector 
has grown rapidly over the last 
few years, persistent challenges 
such as a weak health system, 
lack of quality infrastructure, and 
lack of quality service delivery to 
vulnerable populations, continues 
to exist. 
India’s healthcare expenditure 
stands at approximately 3.3% 
of GDP, a proportion that 
remains notably lower than the 
global average and significantly 
behind countries such as the 
United States (16.6%), Germany 
(12.7%), France (12.3%), and 
Brazil (9.9%). This measured 
investment translates to per 
capita healthcare spending that 
is among the lowest in the BRICS 
nation. The investment in 2022 
stood at approximately USD 
79.5 per person, compared to 
USD 848.6 in Brazil, USD 1,078.2 
in Russia, USD 672.5 in China, 
and USD 569.8 in South Africa. 
Despite being one of the fastest-
growing healthcare markets, 
the sector faces challenges 
in meeting the demands of a 
large and diverse population, 
particularly in rural and semi-
urban regions. 
A key consequence of limited 
healthcare expenditure is the 
persistent gap in infrastructure 
development. Many regions 
continue to experience shortages 
of hospital beds, diagnostic 
facilities, and skilled healthcare 
professionals. The density of 
doctors and nurses per 1,000 
population remains below 
World Health Organization 
recommendations at 1:834 
as per the National Medical 
Commission, and the distribution 
of healthcare resources is uneven 
across states. These constraints 
have led to increased reliance on 
private healthcare providers, who 
account for a significant share of 
service delivery.
The interplay between 
inadequate infrastructure and 
rising demand has contributed 
to elevated costs of care. 
Insufficient public facilities 
often result in patients seeking 
treatment from private providers, 
where higher input costs and 
capital investments are reflected 
in medical bills. This dynamic, 
combined with advances in 
medical technology and the 
growing burden of diseases, 
has fuelled persistent medical 
inflation in India, outpacing 
general inflation rates and 
placing additional pressure on 
household finances. 
This situation is particularly 
challenging for vulnerable 
populations, often resulting in 
limited access to timely and 
quality healthcare, especially in 
rural and semi-urban areas. The 
predominance of such direct 
expenses signals a pressing 
need for enhanced investment 
and comprehensive insurance 
coverage. 
Furthermore, much of the 
current spending is directed 
towards curative care and repeat 
outpatient visits, rather than 
preventive interventions that 
could lower long-term costs and 
hospital admissions. Addressing 
these imbalances by increasing 
public investment and expanding 
preventive care initiatives is 
imperative to alleviating the 
burden on ordinary citizens and 
open significant opportunities 
for sector growth. Consequently, 
there remains substantial scope 
for investment and innovation, 
which can bolster the sector’s 
capacity and contribute towards 
building a more resilient and 
accessible healthcare system  
for all.

Key Growth Drivers of  
Indian Healthcare Sector 
Demographic Changes 
India's vast and growing population of 1.4 billion with an 
expanding elderly cohort which causes a rising need for age-
related care provides the demographic tailwind that ensures a 
large and sustained healthcare market.
Infrastructure Gaps and Opportunities 
Hospital capacity remains unevenly distributed, with only 
seven states accounting for about 65% of India’s hospital beds 
while roughly half the population lives outside these states. 
This clear supply–demand mismatch is prompting both public 
and private sectors to expand hospitals, clinics and diagnostic 
centres.
Technology Adoption and Digital Health 
Rapid adoption of digital health solutions is transforming care 
delivery and widening access. Telemedicine and mobile health 
services are bridging geographic barriers by bringing medical 
advice and monitoring to remote areas. Digital platforms 
focused on electronic health records, health apps and AI-
driven analytics also enable more cost-effective and preventive 
care, helping mitigate rising healthcare costs through early 
intervention and efficiency gains. This tech-driven evolution is 
improving healthcare quality and reach across India.
Government Initiatives and Policy Support 
Public healthcare spending, though currently around 1.3% of 
GDP; the lowest among BRICS nations, is targeted to increase 
by end of 2025. The government has launched initiatives like 
the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission in 2021 to integrate 
health systems nationwide, alongside expanding medical 
education and public hospital networks. These measures aim 
to address infrastructure gaps, enhance service delivery, and 
catalyse further investment in health.
Rising Investment Trends 
Under-penetration of healthcare has attracted robust investor 
interest. Institutional investors, including global private equity 
and venture funds, are making steady inroads to capitalise 
on India’s healthcare needs. This influx of capital is visible in 
the cumulative investments since 2019, with hospitals and 
clinics attracting 8,257 million dollars across ninety-eight 
deals. Healthcare technology has also seen strong activity, 
with two hundred and four deals amounting to 3,112 million 
dollars. These investments are financing new hospitals, 
specialist clinics, and innovative healthtech start-ups, thereby 
accelerating the sector’s growth and modernisation.

Rising Imperative of Health Insurance
According to a report by Aon on Global Medical Trends, India continues to experience one of the highest 
rates of medical inflation globally, with data highlighting  the country’s unique position among both 
developed and emerging markets. In 2024, the gross medical trend for India stood at 12%, rising further 
to 13% in 2025. These figures are markedly higher than those recorded in other major economies, where 
gross medical inflation rates for 2024 ranged from 0.4% in Japan to 15% in the United Kingdom, with most 
countries reporting single-digit trends.

Key Drivers of Medical Inflation
Several structural factors underpin India’s 
elevated medical inflation:
Rising Hospital & Treatment Costs  
Hospitals are increasingly raising the 
cost of services, room rents, and doctor 
consultation fees, which form the largest 
component of medical inflation in India
Growing Burden of Chronic Diseases 
The prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
conditions, and cancer has driven up the 
demand for long-term and recurrent care.
Healthcare Infrastructure Constraints 
Limited public sector capacity and workforce 
shortages have resulted in greater reliance 
on private providers, where higher operating 
costs are often passed on to patients.
The Future of Health Insurance  
in India: Size & Scale
India's health insurance sector stands at a 
transformative inflection point, driven by 
escalating medical costs, regulatory reforms, and 
an ambitious vision for universal coverage. The 
industry has recorded remarkable growth with 
health insurance premiums reaching ₹1,08,110 
crore in FY25, representing an 8.97% increase 
over the previous year.
The industry's growth story over recent years 
has been remarkable. Between FY 2020 and FY 
2024, total premiums across life and non-life 
segments increased from ₹7.8 lakh crore to 
₹11.2 lakh crore. This strong double-digit growth 
provides the foundation for ambitious future 
projections estimating the sector could reach 
₹25 lakh crore by 2030.
Impact on Healthcare Outcomes
The sustained rise in medical costs  
has had a profound impact on healthcare 
outcomes in India
Increased Out-of-Pocket Expenditure 
Approximately 45% of total health spending 
is borne directly by households, making India 
one of the highest globally for out-of-pocket 
healthcare payments. This has led to financial 
strain, with a significant proportion of families 
resorting to borrowing or liquidating assets to 
fund medical expenses.
Delayed or Foregone Care 
High treatment costs have resulted in some 
patients postponing or foregoing necessary care, 
which can adversely affect health outcomes and 
increase the risk of complications.
Pressure on Public Health Systems 
Overcrowded public facilities and resource 
constraints have limited the availability of 
subsidised care, further shifting the burden 
to private providers and exacerbating cost 
pressures.
Rising Insurance Premiums 
Health insurers have experienced higher 
claims outgo, leading to premium increases 
and product adjustments. This cycle of rising 
costs and premiums has implications for both 
affordability and insurance penetration.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (4/8)
Understanding the 
Coverage Gap
While government-sponsored 
schemes such as Ayushman 
Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan 
Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) have 
successfully extended coverage 
to economically vulnerable 
groups, and employer-sponsored 
or private insurance products 
serve formal sector employees 
and higher-income individuals, 
a considerable segment of the 
population remains uninsured.
India’s health insurance 
landscape is marked by a 
profound protection gap, 
particularly within the “Missing 
Middle.” This segment, 
comprising approximately 40 
crore individuals, including 
informal sector workers and self-
employed individuals who are 
neither eligible for government-
subsidised schemes nor able to 
afford private health cover. The 
missing middle sits between 
two ends of the spectrum: 
low-income households with 
access to government support 
and high-income households 
covered by employer or private 
voluntary schemes. As depicted 
above, twenty-five percent of 
the population remains entirely 
without coverage, and much 
of the formal coverage for the 
remainder is insufficient given 
modern healthcare needs.
A significant share of those 
technically insured remain 
critically under-insured. Research 
from 2025 highlights that 75% of 
health insurance policyholders 
in India have cover amounts 
of less than ten lakh, while 
the majority of hospitalisation 
expenses can easily surpass 
these limits. As a consequence, 
nearly half of insured individuals 
are burdened with policies that 
are inadequate to protect them 
against potential expenditure. 
This under-insurance is 
further exacerbated by an 
ongoing increase in healthcare 
costs and the persistent rise 
of out-of-pocket spending. 
Notwithstanding recent 
improvements, out-of-pocket 
expenditure continues to make 
up a substantial proportion 
of total health expenditure, 
leaving many families 
exposed to financial distress 
in the event of illness or 
hospitalisation.
This under-penetration and 
under-insurance reflect 
both a vulnerability and a 
large untapped commercial 
opportunity. Bridging the 
coverage gap for the missing 
middle is imperative, not 
only for increasing national 
health resilience but also for 
delivering on the broader 
vision of universal and inclusive 
health insurance in India. 
Government initiatives in recent 
years have recognised and begun 
to address this imperative. 
Ayushman Bharat Pradhan 
Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana 
remains the world’s largest 
publicly funded health insurance 
scheme, while policy reforms 
such as streamlined product 
offerings, targeted awareness 
campaigns, and regulatory 
support for blended financing 
and digital infrastructure, aim 
to drive greater accessibility, 
affordability, and uptake. The 
Union Government, through the 
IRDAI, has also set an ambitious 
target of “Insurance for All” by 
2047, further supporting sectoral 
growth and innovation.
Recognising the challenge  
posed by the uninsured "missing 
middle," the Government of  
India has launched several 
initiatives to broaden health 
insurance coverage.

Cashless Everywhere” Initiative 
Launched in January 2024 by the General Insurance 
Council in collaboration with insurers, the “Cashless 
Everywhere” initiative enables policyholders to 
access cashless hospitalisation at any hospital 
nationwide, irrespective of network status. 
Policyholders who pre-inform the insurer (48 hours 
prior for elective or within 48 hours for emergency 
admissions) may avail treatment without upfront 
payment, subject to policy terms. This measure 
simplifies claims procedures and strengthens trust 
in health insurance.
AYUSH Treatment Coverage Parity 
In January 2024, the Insurance Regulatory and 
Development Authority of India (IRDAI) mandated 
that all health insurers provide coverage for AYUSH 
treatments (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, 
Siddha, Homeopathy) on par with allopathic care. 
Insurers are required to empanel AYUSH hospitals, 
establish standard treatment protocols, and 
integrate AYUSH into their hospital networks to 
facilitate cashless claims. This directive, effective 
April 2024, ensures comprehensive coverage for 
alternative treatments.
Regulatory Sandbox Expansion 
To promote innovation, IRDAI expanded its 
Regulatory Sandbox framework in January 2025. 
The revised regulations adopt a principles-based 
approach and permit inter-regulatory sandbox 
experiments across financial sectors. This extension 
supports insurers and InsurTechs in piloting new 
products and services under relaxed regulatory 
conditions, reinforcing a dynamic, innovation-
friendly environment.
Expenses of Management (EoM) Reforms 
Effective April 2023, IRDAI introduced standardised 
caps on operating expenses: general insurers are 
limited to 30% of gross premium, while standalone 
health insurers are capped at 35%. Previous 
category-wise limits were removed, granting 
insurers flexibility provided overall expenses 
remain within the prescribed caps. Additional 
allowances are available for investments in rural 
business, government schemes, InsurTech, or 
consumer awareness.  
In January 2024, EoM and commission guidelines 
were unified for streamlined compliance, with 
ongoing requirements for board-approved 
business plans and cost policies to ensure expense 
efficiencies benefit policyholders.
Long-Term Policy Continuity Norms 
IRDAI reinforced norms for long-term health 
insurance products to safeguard policyholders. For 
multi-year policies, insurers must honour original 
terms for existing policyholders throughout the 
policy duration, even if the product is withdrawn 
from new sales. The moratorium period for 
contesting claims due to past nondisclosure has 
been reduced from eight to five years, and waiting 
periods for pre-existing diseases are now capped at 
three years. These measures enhance stability and 
consumer confidence in long-term coverage.
Digital Integration with  
National Health Systems 
A major regulatory focus has been the integration 
of insurers with India’s digital health infrastructure. 
From June 2023, insurers have been required to 
capture the Ayushman Bharat Health Account 
(ABHA) number for every insured individual and 
obtain consent to access medical records through 
national digital health systems. Insurers are also 
onboarding the National Health Claims Exchange 
(NHCX), which standardises electronic claims data 
exchange among hospitals, TPAs, and insurers. By 
August 2023, significant progress had been made 
towards integrating insurers and TPAs with the 
Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, enabling digital 
health ID creation and policy linkage.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (5/8)
Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) Expansion 
The Government of India has continued to 
strengthen the Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri 
Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the world’s largest 
health assurance scheme. As of November 2024, 
nearly 360 million beneficiaries had been verified. 
In October 2024, the scheme was extended to all 
citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of income 
or socio-economic status, adding an estimated 45 
million families (approximately 60 million senior 
individuals) to the insurance net. Eligibility was 
also expanded in March 2024 to include families of 
ASHA and Anganwadi workers. Many state health 
insurance programmes have converged with PM-
JAY, collectively increasing the insured population 
and reducing out-of-pocket medical expenses for 
vulnerable groups.
Bima Sugam Digital Platform 
FY25 saw significant progress on Bima Sugam, a 
comprehensive digital marketplace for insurance. 
Spearheaded by IRDAI with government backing, 
Bima Sugam is designed as a one-stop portal where 
customers can compare, purchase, and manage 
life, health, and general insurance policies. The 
first phase is scheduled for rollout in mid-2025. 
The platform aims to democratise insurance 
distribution by onboarding all insurers and 
intermediaries, improving product accessibility, 
reducing acquisition costs, and supporting the 
Insurance for All mission. Integration with digital 
payment and KYC infrastructure is expected to 
boost online health insurance sales, particularly in 
smaller cities and underserved markets.
Digital Health Stack &  
Unified Health Interface (UHI) 
The central government has continued to develop 
the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), 
a digital health backbone supporting insurance 
uptake. By late 2024, over 670 million unique ABHA 
IDs had been created, with more than 420 million 
health records linked. Key components, including 
the Unified Health Interface (UHI) and Health 
Claims Exchange (HCX), have advanced towards 
nationwide implementation, streamlining electronic 
claim submissions. These initiatives are laying the 
foundation for seamless interoperability between 
healthcare providers and insurers, enabling real-
time digital verification of coverage and claims 
processing, and enhancing service delivery and 
trust in the insurance system.
“Insurance for All by 2047” Vision 
A long-term vision to achieve universal insurance 
coverage by 2047 underpins recent reforms. The 
Insurance for All by 2047” roadmap, articulated by 
IRDAI in 2023, seeks to ensure that every Indian has 
access to life, health, or general insurance by the 
nation’s centenary of independence. This ambition 
has led to the formation of state-level insurance 
committees and targeted awareness campaigns 
to reach untapped markets. In the health sector, 
the vision aligns with scaling public schemes such 
as PM-JAY and encourages insurers to develop 
affordable, accessible health covers for lower-
income and rural populations.

Rising Healthcare Needs 
and the Role of TPAs
As India’s population becomes 
more health-conscious and 
medical treatment grows 
increasingly advanced and 
expensive driven by rising global 
burden of chronic diseases, 
the demand for reliable access 
to quality healthcare has 
never been greater. This rise 
in healthcare needs places 
a corresponding emphasis 
on comprehensive health 
insurance, which offers families 
and individuals a much-needed 
safety net against unforeseen 
medical expenses. However, as 
insurance coverage expands 
and policy structures become 
more elaborate, the process of 
administering these benefits 
efficiently and fairly becomes 
ever more complex. Here, Third-
Party Administrators emerge 
as the linchpin connecting all 
participants in this evolving 
ecosystem. By ensuring claims 
are processed swiftly, benefits 
are managed transparently, and 
networks operate seamlessly, 
TPAs deliver the operational 
backbone that supports the 
entire health insurance value 
chain, transforming heightened 
healthcare needs into effective 
and trusted insurance coverage.
Evolution of the TPA  
Model in India 
The TPA model, which originated 
in the United States during 
the 1970s to address the need 
for specialised health benefits 
administration, was formally 
introduced in India through 
egulations mandated by the 
IRDAI. Since its introduction, 
TPAs have emerged as 
an essential intermediary 
connecting insurers, 
policyholders and healthcare 
providers. They manage a 
range of functions including 
pre-authorisations, claims 
adjudication, provider network 
administration and member 
support services. 
 
Growing Importance in a 
Complex Environment 
With the rising complexity of 
group health insurance,  
Market Opportunities
The global insurance Third Party 
Administrators (TPA) market is 
projected to grow from ₹28.6 
lakh crore in 2024 to ₹31.5 
lakh crore in 2025, reflecting a 
10.3% year-on-year increase. 
While regionally North America 
remains the largest market as of 
2024, Asia-Pacific is expected to 
post the fastest growth through 
2029. Global growth, primarily 
driven by insurance penetration, 
and increased operational 
outsourcing, particularly in the 
health insurance sector will 
enable the TPA market to grow 
at a compounded annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of 9.9% to reach 
₹45.99 lakh crore by 20291.
India’s health insurance sector 
has experienced substantial 
growth, driven by escalating 
medical expenses, increased 
awareness among policyholders, 
and supportive government 
initiatives. Health insurance 
premiums underwritten 
exceeded ₹1 trillion in FY25, 
establishing the segment as a 
prominent contributor within 
the general insurance industry. 
This growth has enhanced the 
strategic importance of Third-
Party Administrators (TPAs), 
who now play a central role 
in enabling scale, operational 
efficiency, and trust across the 
insurance value chain2.
Core Functions and Strategic 
Evolution of Third Party 
Administrators 
Third Party Administrators 
(TPAs) are licensed entities 
entrusted with a central role 
in the health insurance sector. 
They operate as the crucial 
intermediary between insurers, 
healthcare providers, and 
policyholders, orchestrating the 
efficient administration of health 
benefits. TPAs are responsible 
for a broad spectrum of 
operational services, ensuring 
that insurance processes 
remain seamless, transparent, 
and compliant with regulatory 
standards. 
marked by diverse benefit 
structures, increasing claims 
volumes and multiple stakeholder 
interactions, the role of TPAs has 
gained greater significance. This 
complexity is further amplified by 
trends such as medical inflation 
and the rising risk of fraud, 
waste and abuse, all of which 
require specialised oversight. 
In this environment, TPAs 
streamline operational processes, 
ensure consistency in benefit 
administration and support faster 
claims turnaround across both 
group and retail portfolios. 
 
Strategic Advantages of TPAs 
A key strength of TPAs lies 
in their ability to consolidate 
claims across multiple insurers, 
which enables them to negotiate 
favourable rates with hospital 
networks. These negotiated 
arrangements, particularly 
relevant in cashless settlements, 
contribute to cost containment 
for insurers while enhancing 
access and affordability for 
policyholders. In the group 
segment, TPAs also bring stability 
in service delivery. Employers 
often value the efficiency, 
hospital network depth and 
consistency of experience  
offered by TPAs, which leads  
to enduring associations even 
when insurers change. 
 
Beyond claims handling, TPAs  
are responsible for broad 
network management, 
empanelment of hospitals and 
adoption of digital platforms that 
enable transparent and efficient 
claims processing. Their growing 
investment in analytics and fraud 
detection further strengthens 
risk control and operational 
resilience. 
 
As the health insurance 
landscape continues to 
evolve, TPAs have progressed 
from being administrative 
facilitators to becoming strategic 
partners. Their contribution 
to cost efficiency, process 
standardisation and member 
satisfaction makes them integral 
to the sustainable growth of the 
health insurance ecosystem.

Benefits of 
Third-Party 
Administrators 
(TPAs) 
Benefits for Insurers
Operational Efficiency 
Outsourcing claims processing 
and administrative functions 
to Third-Party Administrators 
(TPAs) enables insurers to 
enhance operational efficiency 
while achieving cost savings. By 
delegating routine tasks to TPAs, 
insurers streamline internal 
workflows, reduce overheads, 
and can focus more effectively 
on core areas such as product 
development and underwriting.
Benefits for 
Policyholders
Enhanced Customer Experience 
TPAs contribute to superior 
service delivery for policyholders 
by providing round-the-clock 
customer support and user-
friendly digital platforms for 
claims submission and tracking. 
Efficient management of inquiries 
and grievances ensures timely 
resolutions and clear guidance 
for customers. The adoption 
of digital portals and AI-driven 
support tools further accelerates 
claim intimation and status 
updates, leading to higher 
satisfaction among policyholders.
Access to Quality Care  
through Cashless Networks 
TPAs maintain extensive networks 
of accredited hospitals and 
healthcare providers, negotiated 
under preferred tariffs. 
Policyholders benefit from access 
to quality care at pre-agreed 
rates and can avail themselves 
of cashless hospitalisation at 
network facilities. TPAs facilitate 
the identification of appropriate 
hospitals and coordinate direct 
settlement of bills, eliminating 
the need for upfront payments  
by policyholders.
Fraud Prevention 
TPAs employ advanced data 
analytics and sophisticated 
fraud detection tools to identify 
irregularities in claims data. Real-
time monitoring of claims enables 
early identification of suspicious 
patterns, ensuring that only 
legitimate claims are processed. 
This proactive approach to fraud 
prevention mitigates financial 
losses for insurers and upholds 
the integrity of the claims 
process.
Data Analytics and Insights 
The extensive volume of claims 
and healthcare data managed 
by TPAs provides insurers with 
valuable insights. These analytics 
support insurers in optimising 
provider networks, refining 
product pricing, and enhancing 
risk management. Regular 
feedback on claim turnaround 
times and denial reasons further 
enables insurers to improve 
operational efficiency.
Benefits for  
Healthcare Providers
Streamlined Billing and 
Administration 
TPAs simplify the insurance 
billing and claims submission 
process for healthcare providers 
by serving as a single point 
of contact. This approach 
reduces administrative burdens, 
minimises errors, and ensures 
claims are processed accurately 
and efficiently. Providers benefit 
from the TPA’s expertise in 
adjudication, resulting in fewer 
claim rejections and greater 
operational focus on patient care.
Increased Patient Volume 
Hospitals and clinics within 
a TPA’s preferred network 
experience higher patient 
inflows, as insured individuals are 
directed towards these facilities 
for cashless treatment. This 
Transparency in  
Claims Processing 
TPAs promote transparency 
by offering real-time updates 
on claim status through digital 
portals and mobile applications. 
Policyholders can monitor each 
stage of the claims process, 
from initiation to settlement, 
fostering trust and confidence. 
Open visibility ensures that 
customers remain informed 
and expectations are managed 
effectively throughout the claims 
journey.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy 
Given the sensitive nature 
of personal and medical 
information handled, TPAs 
prioritise robust cybersecurity 
measures. Investments in secure 
data storage, encryption, and 
stringent access controls protect 
policyholder data from breaches. 
Value-Added Services 
Beyond claims administration, 
TPAs offer a range of value-
added services such as wellness 
programmes, telemedicine 
support, ambulance assistance, 
and health helplines. These 
additional offerings support 
preventive care and emergency 
response, contributing to a 
holistic healthcare experience for 
policyholders thereby promoting 
improved health outcomes.
arrangement drives additional 
revenue for healthcare providers 
and ensures a steady stream of 
insured patients whose bills are 
settled directly by the insurer.
Efficient and Timely 
Reimbursement 
TPAs facilitate prompt payment 
to hospitals following claim 
approval, improving cash 
flow and financial stability for 
healthcare providers. The use 
of technology, such as online 
claim portals and automated 
adjudication, expedites the 
reimbursement process 
and reduces revenue cycle 
uncertainty.
Importance of TPAs in the Insurance Ecosystem
The increasing volume of claims and the growing complexity of 
health insurance products have reinforced the indispensable 
role of Third-Party Administrators (TPAs) within the insurance 
ecosystem. Over the period FY18–22, the proportion of TPA-
serviced premium to total industry premium remained stable 
at 54.6%. Industry projections by Frost & Sullivan indicate this 
share is expected to rise to 61.2% by FY2028, reflecting the 
sector’s growing reliance on TPAs for premium administration.
Management of  
Policy Complexity 
As insurance products become 
more sophisticated, TPAs manage 
the complexities associated 
with diverse policy features, 
including outpatient cover, day-
care treatments, and wellness 
benefits. Digital tools provided 
by TPAs enable real-time tracking 
of benefits, coverage limits, and 
authorisation requirements, 
allowing providers to deliver 
care without being encumbered 
by varying insurance terms. This 
results in smoother coordination 
between hospitals and insurers, 
even for complex claims involving 
multiple treatments or innovative 
policy coverages.

During FY24, general and health 
insurers collectively settled 
approximately 2.69 crore health 
insurance claims, resulting in a 
total disbursement of ₹83,493 
crore. The average payout per 
claim amounted to ₹31,086. 
Of the total claims processed, 
72% were managed through 
Third-Party Administrators 
(TPAs), while the remaining 28% 
were addressed via in-house 
settlement mechanisms.

volume were settled  
through the cashless 
channel
•	
Reimbursement-based 
settlements constituted  
38.96% of claims
•	
An additional 1% of claims 
were processed using a 
combination of cashless and

This pattern highlights the 
increasing reliance on TPAs and 
the progressive enhancement 
of digital claims infrastructure, 
both of which are instrumental 
in achieving faster turnaround 
times and elevating service 
standards across the industry.
Evolution Towards Health 
Benefits Administration 
and Enhanced Service 
Offerings
With ongoing changes in the 
healthcare landscape, many 
leading TPAs are gradually 
evolving into Health Benefits 
Administrators (HBAs). An 
HBA builds on the core 
business model of a TPA while 
providing a broader and more 
integrated range of health 
benefit management services 
for insurers, employers, and 
members. The Health Benefits 
Administrator (HBA) model 
represents a progressive 
approach to health insurance 
administration, marked by 
the integration of advanced 
technology, strategic 
partnerships, and a focus on 
holistic health management.
The following features 
distinguish the HBA model
•	 Integrated Technology and 
Data-Driven Services
HBAs combine real-time 
analytics with advanced digital 
platforms to automate claims, 
strengthen fraud detection, 
and provide actionable insights 
and tailored service offerings
•	 Proactive Stakeholder 
Engagement
By collaborating closely with 
insurers, providers, employers, 
and members, HBAs enable 
value-based care models, 
focusing on outcomes, cost 
containment, and improved 
health results
•	 Continuous Innovation
The shift towards HBAs reflects 
a commitment to ongoing 
digital innovation, enabling 
the delivery of efficient, 
transparent, and future-ready 
healthcare solutions for all 
stakeholders
TPAs have become indispensable 
partners in the health insurance 
value chain, driving operational 
excellence, stakeholder support, 
and strategic innovation through 
their expanded role as Health 
Benefits Administrators.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (8/8)
In FY25, growth was powered new 
business acquisition and ~95% 
client retention driven by superior 
value delivery to insurers and 
policyholders through value-added 
services including FWA detection, 
cashless services, and instant 
discharges. Market share expanded 
to 30.3% in group business and 
5.7% in retail which will further be 
strengthened post consolidation of 
Paramount TPA.
Margins benefited from operational 
efficiency and scale in our fee-based 
model with no underwriting risk. 
Technology investments in claims 
automation, process consolidation, 
and high operating leverage (with 
employee costs as the largest 
expense) drove improvements in 
margin profile. 
Strong cash position of ₹3,122.4 
million and operating cashflow of 
₹1,380.9 million reflects advance 
payments from insurers for claims 
processing, enabling negative 
working capital and minimal 
reinvestment requirements. This 
asset-light, low capital intensity 
model generates strong cash 
flow and high returns on invested 
capital, making TPAs indispensable 
to insurers through operational 
efficiency and cost control.
Total Income  
Our total income increased by 
14.4% to ₹7,470.8 million for the 
Financial Year 2025 from ₹6,530.5 
million for the Financial Year 2024,  
primarily due to increase in revenue 
from contracts with customers.
Revenue from Contracts 
Our revenue from contracts with 
customers increased by 14.0% to 
₹7,233.2 million for the Financial 
Year 2025 as compared to ₹6,347.3 
million for the Financial Year 2024. 
This was primarily on account 
of increase in our income from 
TPA services to ₹6,678.9 million 
for the Financial Year 2025 from 
₹5,909.9 million for the Financial 
Year 2024. The increase in our 
income from TPA services was 
driven by an increase in our total 
premium under management 
(excluding Government sponsored 
schemes) to ₹211.1 billion for the 
Financial Year 2025 from ₹190.5 
billion for the Financial Year 
2024. This increase was largely 
attributable to the growth of our 
group accounts portfolio as a result 
of an increase in business from 
existing accounts and securing 
new group accounts and also 
on account of our retention of 
~95% of all our group premiums 
serviced during the Financial Year 
2025. Further, our revenue from 
operations attributable to servicing 
Government sponsored schemes 
increased to ₹796.6 million during 
the Financial Year 2025 from 
₹640.4 million during the Financial 
Year 2024, due to our continuing 
involvement in major Government 
sponsored projects covering over 
290 million+ beneficiaries.
The increase in revenue from 
contracts with customers also 
includes income from health 
management services to the tune 
of ₹455.1 million for the Financial 
Year 2025 from ₹396.5 million for 
the Financial Year 2024. Health 
management services includes 
revenue driven by our subsidiary 
Mayfair UK, our International 
Benefits Administrator, that 
amounted to of ₹368.4 million 
during Financial Year 2025, 
registering a modest growth from 
₹367.7 million Financial Year 2024. 
Our Technology Services vertical 
generated license revenue of ₹99.2 
million for the Financial Year 2025, 
representing a sharp uptick from 
₹26.5 million for the Financial Year 
2024.
Other Income  
Our other income increased by 
29.7% to ₹237.6 million in Financial 
Year  2025 from ₹183.2 million 
in Financial Year 2024, driven 
primarily from fair value gains on 
investments
Expenses
Employee Benefits expenses 
Employee benefits expenses 
increased by 20.2% to 3,058.6 
million for the Financial Year 
2025 from ₹2,545.3 million for 
the Financial Year 2024, primarily 
due to an increase in salaries, 
bonus and allowances to ₹2,804.0 
million for the Financial Year 2025 
from ₹2,284.6 million for the 
Financial Year 2024. The increase 
in salaries, bonus and allowances 
was mainly on account of an 
increase in number of members 
of our leadership team and our 
work force (primarily in the claims 
management, operations, provider 
partnership teams and Mayfair) 
during the year to support the 
growth in our business. Our 
headcount increased to 6,398 as 
of March 31, 2025 from 6,140 as of 
March 31, 2024.
Finance Costs 
Our finance costs increased by 
225.3% to 103.0 million for the 
Financial Year 2025 from ₹31.7 
million for the Financial Year 2025, 
primarily due to interest on working 
capital loans
Depreciation and  
amortization expense 
Our depreciation and amortization 
expense increased by 29.5% to 
₹557.8 million for Financial Year 
2025 from ₹430.8 million for 
Financial Year 2024, primarily 
on account of an increase in 
amortization of intangible assets 
from ₹185.6 million for Financial 
Year 2024 to ₹294.9 million for 
Financial Year 2025 on account of 
acquired assets and intellectual 
property.
Other Expenses 
Our other expenses increased 
by 6.7% to ₹2,633.5 million for 
Financial Year 2025 from ₹2,468.9 
million for Financial Year 2024, 
primarily due to an increase in 
legal and professional expenses 
to ₹510.7 million for Financial 
Year 2025 from ₹332.2 million for 
Financial Year 2024, an increase 
in advertisement and business 
promotion expenses to ₹312.0 
million for Financial Year 2025 from 
₹238.4 million for Financial Year 
2024.
These increases were partially 
offset by a decrease in sub-
contracting expenses to ₹651.0 
million for Financial Year 2025 from 
₹700.0 million for Financial Year 
2024, and a decrease in postage 
and communication expenses to 
₹84.1 million for Financial Year 
2025 from ₹125.8 million for 
Financial Year 2024.
The increase in legal and 
professional expenses was mainly 
on account of higher investigation 
fees required by customers and 
transaction expenses arising from 
business expansion activities.  
The increase in advertisement 
and business promotion expenses 
reflects additional business

development activities to support 
revenue growth. The decrease in 
sub-contracting expenses reflects 
improved operational efficiency and 
in-house capability development
Income Tax Expense 
Our total income tax expense 
increased by 54.2% to ₹201.9 
million for Financial Year 2025 
from ₹130.9 million for Financial 
Year 2024, primarily on account 
of higher current tax liability due 
to improved profitability, only 
partially offset by an adjustment 
for current tax relating to earlier 
years amounting to a credit of ₹5.7 
million for Financial Year 2025, 
significantly lower compared to a 
credit of ₹48.8 million for Financial 
Year 2024, and a decrease in 
deferred tax credit to ₹65.1 million 
for Financial Year 2025 from ₹74.0 
million for Financial Year 2024.
Other Operational 
Milestones

the year included the expansion 
of the provider network to 20,204 
(includes network proprietary to 
Medi Assist + GIPSA hospitals) 
active partners, with over 10,000 
new hospitals added. This 
expansion has increased the 
company’s ability to negotiate 
tariffs and maintain service quality 
across diverse geographies. The 
introduction of hospital desks in 
key cities has provided in-person 
support, improving the experience 
for both insurers and policyholders.
Product innovation remained a 
priority, with the launch of Raksha 
Prime, a differentiated cashless 
product designed to improve 
discharge efficiency and real-
time out-of-pocket estimation. 
Investments in proprietary 
technology platforms, including 
the continued development of the 
MAtrix system, have strengthened 
claims management, fraud 
detection, and analytics capabilities. 
These enhancements support 
the company’s transition towards 
a technology-led, future-ready 
operating model.
Looking ahead, Medi Assist will 
continue to focus on disciplined 
execution and technology-driven 
operations.  
The company’s strategic priorities 
include expanding provider 
relationships, leveraging data-
driven insights to optimize 
operational performance, and 
advancing the Health Benefits 
Administrator model. Medi 
Assist remains committed to 
strengthening its efforts towards 
the prevention and detection of 
Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) 
in claims processing, ensuring 
greater transparency and trust 
across stakeholders. The company 
is well-positioned to address 
sectoral challenges such as medical 
inflation, regulatory transformation, 
and the increasing complexity in 
claims processing.
Internal Control 
Adequacy
The Company has established a 
comprehensive internal control 
framework designed to safeguard 
its assets from unauthorised use 
or disposal. This system ensures 
that all transactions receive proper 
authorisation, are accurately 
recorded, and are appropriately 
reported. The internal control 
structure also facilitates optimal 
resource utilisation and enhances 
operational efficiency. Regular 
monitoring of operations is 
conducted to ensure compliance 
with applicable laws and 
regulations. Independent auditors 
have confirmed the adequacy and 
effectiveness of these internal 
control measures.

Development and 
Industrial Relations

as a critical asset fundamental to its 
continued growth. A strong emphasis 
is placed on employee engagement 
and professional development, with

(B) Technology Absorption 
Medi Assist is implementing a data strategy centered 
around leveraging digital assistants to transform its 
operations. These assistants, powered by state-of-the-
art AI models and trained extensively on Medi Assist's 
internal data, are designed to handle everything 
from mundane tasks to complex data requests. 
This strategic move aims to empower employees by 
providing them with role-specific information and 
tools, thereby enhancing efficiency and allowing them 
to focus on higher-value activities. Furthermore, a key 
objective of this initiative is to eliminate information 
asymmetry that currently exists due to Medi Assist's 
extensive PAN India presence and the challenges 
posed by regular industry attrition. By centralizing 
knowledge and making it readily accessible through 
these digital assistants, Medi Assist expects to foster 
a more informed workforce, standardize information 
flow across all locations, and mitigate knowledge loss 
caused by employee turnover.
Medi Assist has transformed 80% of its technology 
stack. By transitioning from traditional hypervisors to 
open-source technology and highly scalable container 
orchestration for micro services, the company has 
achieved substantial energy savings and reduced 
total cost of ownership. This strategic move has also

Risk
All stakeholders in the

volume of confidential 
client information 
and daily business

Data breaches can harm 
business operations 
due to unauthorized 
users, spying activity 
and circulation of insider 
information.
We've developed

the management 
code that directs 
our employees and 
other stakeholders 
throughout the value 
chain to maintain 
honesty, openness, 
and be responsible

upheld across all departments and activities.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?  
Regarding the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis:
1.	
Routine Basis:
•	
Regular workplace inspections conducted by trained personnel.
•	
Continuous monitoring of work processes and conditions.
•	
Periodic reviews of incident reports and near-miss incidents.
•	
Feedback from employees through safety observation programs.
2.	
Non-Routine Basis:
•	
Conducting thorough risk assessment for new projects, processes, or changes in the workplace.
•	
Assessing risks associated with non-routine tasks or activities through a structured hazard identification 
process.
•	
Ensuring that all employees are trained to recognize and report hazards promptly.
	
These processes are integral to maintaining a proactive approach to occupational health and safety, 
ensuring that potential risks are identified early and appropriate controls are put in place to mitigate 
them effectively.
3.	
Reporting Work-Related Hazards:
•	
Reporting Channels: Workers can report hazards through various channels, including direct 
supervisors, designated safety officers, safety committees, and anonymous reporting systems.
•	
Incident Reporting System: We maintain an incident reporting system where workers can document 
and report hazards, near-misses, and accidents promptly.
4.	
Removing Themselves from Risks:
•	
Stop Work Authority: Employees are empowered with "Stop Work Authority," allowing them to halt 
work if they identify a hazard that poses an immediate risk to health or safety.
	
These processes ensure that hazards are promptly addressed, and employees feel empowered to 
contribute to maintaining a safe working environment without fear of repercussions. Regular reviews 
and updates of these processes help us continuously improve our safety management system.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Medi Assist Healthcare Services Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:
Sr.  
No.
Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in 
our audit
1.
Assessment of the carrying value of intangible 
assets 
(including 
intangible 
assets 
under 
development)
(Refer to Note 3.h, Note 2.D to the Standalone 
Financial Statements regarding the recognition, 
amortisation of Intangible Asset, ‘Impairment 
Losses’ 
and 
‘judgements, 
estimates 
and 
assumptions’ respectively).
Our audit procedures with respect to this area 
included, among others, following:
a.	
We obtained an understanding and assessed 
the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of relevant internal controls with 
regard to the classification of development 
expenditure and their capitalisation and 
evaluation 
of 
impairment 
for 
internally 
generated intangible assets.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone 
Financial Statements of Medi Assist Healthcare 
Services Limited (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Standalone Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, 
and the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, 
including Other Comprehensive Income, Standalone 
Statement of Changes in Equity and Standalone 
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, 
and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements, 
including material accounting policy information and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act’) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, 
as amended (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at March 31, 2025, and its profit and 
other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its 
cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 53 to the accompanying 
Statement which describes that search and seizure 
operation was carried out by the Directorate of 
Enforcement at certain offices of a wholly owned 
subsidiary and the management’s assessment thereof 
about the consequent impact on the Standalone 
Financial Statements. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in 
our audit
The 
Company 
incurs 
product 
development 
costs and capitalises such expenditure to the 
extent it qualifies for recognition as an Intangible 
Asset (product development). Such expenditure 
includes internal manpower costs and outsourced 
manpower costs specifically incurred on such 
development projects. Up to the stage the products 
are ready for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by the management, the 
Company records the qualifying expenditure as 
‘intangible assets under development’. 
The Company has capitalised Rs 102.31 million of 
intangibles in the nature of internally developed 
software during the year and has an amount of 
Rs 38.66 million under development as at March 
31, 2025 for new technology developments. The 
Company has also acquired Intangible assets 
amounting to Rs 461.75 million during the year 
ended March 31, 2025 for digitization of claims 
processing.
Intangible assets under development are tested for 
impairment on an annual basis. The Company tests 
other intangible assets for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
The appropriateness of Intangible assets and 
Intangible assets under development capitalised is 
a key audit matter due to the judgement involved 
in assessing if the cost meets the capitalisation 
criteria, dependency of the business on the 
assets capitalised / under capitalisation and key 
assumptions used in the measurement model for 
impairment. The measurement model used for 
review of impairment of these Intangible assets 
depends largely on management’s assessment with 
regard to the appropriateness of estimated future 
cash flows, and the discount rates used. Hence, 
there are significant estimates and judgements 
involved in determining the above.
b.	
We evaluated management review controls 
over calculations of the future economic 
benefit of the projects.
c.	
We observed management’s validation of 
relevant data elements and benchmarking the 
assumptions.
d.	
We observed management’s assessment of 
sensitivity of the impact of the changes in key 
assumptions.
e.	
We discussed with senior management and 
challenged management assumptions.
f.	
We tested the capitalisation of project related 
expenses incurred during the year with 
underlying documents relating to material 
costs, 
directly 
attributable 
overheads, 
designing cost, software expenses, testing 
charges and related salary cost incurred 
to verify existence and appropriateness of 
classification of research and development.
g.	
We performed sensitivity tests on the model 
by analysing the impact of using other possible 
growth rates and discount rates within a 
reasonable and foreseeable range.
h.	
We inspected the technical team’s approvals 
for initiation of capitalisation.
i.	
We reviewed the central cost allocation for 
the year and determined costs capitalised 
are directly attributable including the interest 
capitalised.
j.	
We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures 
made in the Standalone Financial Statements. 
Based on the above procedures performed, 
we did not identify any significant exceptions 
in the management’s assessment in relation 
to the capitalisation of intangible assets and 
intangible assets under development.
Key Audit Matters (Contd.)
Information other than the Standalone 
Financial Statements and Auditor’s 
Report thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Management report, 
Chairman’s statement, Director’s report but does 
not include the Standalone Financial Statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Management 
report, Chairman’s statement, Director’s report etc is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it becomes 
available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
When we read the Management report, Chairman’s 
statement, Director’s report etc, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we 
are required to communicate the matter to those 
charged with governance under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s 
responsibilities Relating to Other Information’. 
Responsibilities of Management and 
Board of Directors for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view 
of the financial position, financial performance, 
changes in equity and cash flows of the Company 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
accounting 
principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Standalone Financial Statements.
We give in “Annexure A” a detailed description of 
Auditor’s responsibilities for Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements.

To the Independent Auditor’s Report on even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of Medi Assist 
Healthcare Services Limited 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management 
and Board of Director’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the Standalone Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the Standalone Financial Statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
Standalone Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 
2025 and are therefore, the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls

Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
Standalone Financial Statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on 
the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due 
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2. Basis of preparation 
A. Statement of compliance:
The Standalone Financial Statements (the “Financial 
statements”) [comprising the Standalone Balance 
Sheet ("Balance Sheet") as at March 31, 2024, 
standalone Statement of Profit and Loss ("Statement 
of Profit and Loss”) including standalone other 
comprehensive 
income 
("other 
comprehensive 
income"), the Standalone Cash Flow Statement ("Cash 
Flow Statement"), the Standalone Statement of 
Changes in Equity ("Statement of Changes in Equity”) 
and the notes to standalone financial statements for 
the year ended on that date] of the Company have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
(as amended from time to time) and presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), 
as applicable and other relevant provisions of the Act. 
These Standalone Financial Statements have been 
prepared for the Company as a going concern on 
the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective at 
the Company’s annual reporting date March 31, 
2025. These Standalone Financial Statements were 
authorised for issuance by the Company’s Board of 
Directors on May 15, 2025.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied to 
all the year presented, unless otherwise stated.
B. Functional and presentation currency
These standalone financial statements are presented 
in Indian rupees, which is also the functional currency 
of the Company. All amounts have been rounded-
off to the nearest million, up to two decimal places, 
unless otherwise indicated.
C. Basis of measurement
The standalone financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost basis, except for 
the following:
Items
Measurement basis
Certain financial assets 
and liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) 
Fair value
Share based payment at 
grant date
Fair value
Defined benefit and other 
long-term employee 
benefits obligations
Present value of 
defined benefit 
obligations less fair 
value of plan assets.
D. Use of estimates and judgements
In preparing these standalone financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS, management has made 
estimates, judgements and assumptions. These 
estimates, judgements and assumptions affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of 
contingent liabilities at the date of the standalone 
financial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting 
estimates could change from period to period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate 
changes in estimates are made as management 
becomes 
aware 
of 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are 
reflected in the standalone financial statements in the 
year in which changes are made and, if material, their 
effects are disclosed in the notes to the standalone 
financial statements.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised prospectively.
Judgements, estimates and assumptions are 
required in particular for:
(a) Determination of the estimated useful lives:
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives 
are different from that prescribed in Schedule II and 
in case of intangible assets, these are estimated by 
management taking into account the nature of the 
asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating 
conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, 
anticipated technological changes, manufacturers’ 
warranties and maintenance support.
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
(b) Recognition of deferred tax assets:
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases, (and unutilised business 
loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits). 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable income will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and 
unused tax credits could be utilised.
(c) Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations:
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is 
determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and life expectancy. The discount 
rate is determined by reference to market yields 
at the end of the reporting period on government 
bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds 
correspond to the probable maturity of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Due to complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long term nature, 
defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting period.
(d) Fair valuation of employee share options:
The fair valuation of the employee share options is 
based on the Black-Scholes Model used for valuation 
of options. Key assumptions made are with respect 
to expected volatility, share price, expected dividends 
and discount rate, under this pricing model.
(e) Impairment testing: 
Property, plant and equipment, investments, right-
of-use assets, intangible assets and other assets are 
tested for impairment at least annually and when 
event occur or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the recoverable amount of the asset or cash 
generating units to which these pertain is less than 
its carrying value. The recoverable amount of cash 
generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value 
less costs of disposal. The calculation of value in use 
of a cash generating unit involves use of significant 
estimates and assumptions which includes turnover 
and earnings multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-
adjusted discount rate, future economic and market 
conditions.
(f) Leases
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease based on the requirements of the 
relevant standard. Identification of a lease requires 
management 
judgment. 
Computation 
of 
the 
lease liabilities and right-of-use assets requires 
management to estimate the lease term (including 
anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount 
rate. Management estimates the lease term based on 
past practices and reasonably estimated/anticipated 
future events. The discount rate is generally based on 
the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease 
being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
(g) Expected credit losses on financial assets:
The Company recognises an allowance for expected 
credit losses (ECLs) for all financial assets not held at 
fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the 
difference between the contractual cash flows due in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an 
approximation of the original effective interest rate (in 
case of non current financial assets).
For trade receivables and contract assets, the 
Company applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The 
Company has established a provision matrix that is 
based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted 
for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and 
the economic environment.
E. Measurement of fair values
The Company measures certain financial instruments 
at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is 
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
(i)	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
(ii)	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

For the year ended 31 March 2025

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
is unobservable.
When the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the DCF model. The inputs to these models 
are taken from observable markets where possible, 
but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement 
is required in establishing fair values. Judgements 
include considerations of inputs such as liquidity 
risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions 
about these factors could affect the reported fair value 
of standalone financial instruments.
Further information about the assumptions made 
in measuring fair values is included in the following 
notes:
- 	
Note 30: Employee share based payments.
- 	
Note 32: Financial Instruments.
F. Current and non-current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the 
Standalone Balance Sheet based on current/non-
current classification.
An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of 
the following criteria:
- 	
it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for 
sale or consumption in, the Company’s normal 
operating cycle.
- 	
it is held primarily for the purpose of being 
traded;
- 	
it is expected to be realised within 12 months 
after the reporting date; or
- 	
it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any 
of the following criteria:
- 	
it is expected to be settled in the Company’s 
normal operating cycle;
- 	
it is held primarily for the purpose of being 
traded;
- 	
it is due to be settled within 12 months after the 
reporting date; or
- 	
the Company does not have an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the reporting date. 
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the 
counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of 
equity instruments do not affect its classification.
Current assets/liabilities include current portion of 
non-current assets/liabilities respectively.
All other assets/liabilities are classified as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities (if any) are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
Operating cycle
Based on the nature of the operations and the time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, 
the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of current/non-current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
3. Material accounting policies
a. Financial instruments
(i) Recognition and initial measurement
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial 
instruments also include derivative contracts.
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or 
sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash 
or another financial instrument, or by exchanging 
financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial 
instruments, with the exception of contracts that were 
entered into and continue to be held for the purpose 
of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in 
accordance with the entity’s expected purchase, sale 
or usage requirements.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments.
Recognition and initial measurement – financial 
assets and financial liabilities:
A financial asset (except for trade receivables and 
unbilled revenue/contract assets) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at 
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition 
or issue. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 
FVTPL are recognised immediately in the standalone 
statement of profit and loss.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income consists of interest income on funds 
invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of 
FVTPL financial assets. Interest income is recognised 
as it accrues in the standalone statement of profit and 
loss, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the standalone 
statement of profit and loss on the date that the 
Company’s right to receive payment is established, 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated 
with the dividend will flow to the Company, and the 
amount of dividend can be measured reliably.
Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans 
and borrowings and financial liabilities. The costs of 
these are recognised in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss using the effective interest method.
(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets
The Company classifies financial assets as measured 
at 
amortised 
cost, 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through 
profit and loss (“FVTPL”) on the basis of following:
- 	
the entity’s business model for managing the 
financial assets; and
- 	
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
Amortised cost:
A financial asset is classified and measured at 
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are 
met:
- 	
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows, and
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVOCI”):
A financial asset is classified and measured at FVOCI if 
both of the following conditions are met:
- 	
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets 
and
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not 
held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to 
present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair 
value in OCI (designated as FVOCI – equity investment). 
This election is made on an investment by investment 
basis.
Fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”)
A financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL 
unless it is measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial 
recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a 
financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements 
to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at 
FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets: Business model assessment
The Company makes an assessment of the objective 
of the business model in which a financial asset is held 
at investment level because this reflects the best way 
the business is managed and information is provided 
to management. The information considered includes:
- 	
the stated policies and objectives for each of such 
investments and the operation of those policies 
in practice.
- 	
the risks that affect the performance of the 
business model (and the financial assets held 
within that business model) and how those risks 
are managed;
- 	
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of 
financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for 
such sales and expectations about future sales 
activity.
Transfers of financial assets to third parties in 
transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are 
not considered as sales for this purpose, consistent 
with the Company’s continuing recognition of the 
assets.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Financial assets that are held for trading or are 
managed and whose performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.
Financial assets: Assessment whether 
contractual cash flows are solely payments of 
principal and interest:
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is 
defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial 
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration 
for the time value of money and for the credit risk 
associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and 
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows 
are solely payments of principal and interest, the 
Company considers the contractual terms of the 
instrument. This includes assessing whether the 
financial asset contains a contractual term that could 
change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows 
such that it would not meet this condition. In making 
this assessment, the Company considers:
- 	
contingent events that would change the amount 
or timing of cash flows;
- 	
terms that may adjust the contractual coupon 
rate, including variable interest rate features;
- 	
prepayment and extension features; and
- 	
terms that limit the Company's claim to cash 
flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse 
features).
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely 
payments of principal and interest criterion if the 
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid 
amounts of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable 
additional 
compensation 
for 
early 
termination 
of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset 
acquired at a significant discount or premium to its 
contractual par amount, a feature that permits or 
requires prepayment at an amount  that substantially 
represents the contractual par amount plus accrued 
(but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also 
include reasonable additional compensation for 
early termination) is treated as consistent with this 
criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is 
insignificant at initial recognition.
(iii) Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at 
FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including 
any interest or dividend income, are recognised in standalone statement of profit and 
loss.
Financial assets at 
amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in standalone Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in standalone statement 
of profit and loss.
Equity investments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as 
income in standalone Statement of Profit and Loss unless the dividend clearly represents 
a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised 
in OCI and are not reclassified to standalone statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent 
measurement and gains and losses
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified 
as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading, or it 
is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial 
recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured 
at fair value and net gains and losses, including any 
interest expense, are recognised in standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and 
losses are recognised in standalone statement of 
profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is 
also recognised in standalone Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
(iv) Derecognition
Financial assets
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive 
the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset are transferred or in which the 
Company neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not 
retain control of the financial asset.
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
Financial liabilities
The Company derecognises a financial liability when 
its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, 
or expire. The Company also derecognises a financial 
liability when its terms are modified and the cash 
flows under the modified terms are substantially 
different. In this case, a new financial liability based 
on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. 
The difference between the carrying amount of the 
financial liability extinguished and the new financial 
liability with modified terms is recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.
(v) Offsetting financial instruments:
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, 
and only when, the Company currently has a legally 
enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends 
either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
b. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the respective functional currency of the Company at 
the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences 
are generally recognised in the standalone statement 
of profit and loss.
c. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the standalone balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the standalone statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
excluding restricted cash balance and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts as they are considered an integral part 
of the Company’s cash management. Any cash and 
cash equivalents, other bank balances with significant 
restrictions with regards to the Company's ability to 
freely use it is disclosed appropriately by way of a foot 
note.
d. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. 
The cash flows from operating, investing and financing 
activities of the Company are segregated.
e. Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is computed by 
dividing the net profit after tax for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period and for all periods 
presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus 
shares, stock split, other than the conversion of 
potential equity shares that have changed the number 
of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
The number of shares used in computing diluted 
earnings per share comprises the weighted average 
number of shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per share and also the weighted average 
number of equity shares that could have been issued 
on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as of the beginning of the period unless issued at a 
later date. In computing dilutive earning per share, 
only potential equity shares that are dilutive i.e. which 
reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share 
are included.
Diluted EPS adjust the figures used in the determination 
of basic EPS to consider:
• 	
The after-income tax effect of interest and other 
financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
• 	
The weighted average number of additional 
equity shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
f. Revenue from operations
Income from services
The Company follows Ind AS 115 “Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers”. Revenue is recognised 
upon transfer of control of promised services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration 
the Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
services (net of goods and services tax). Revenue 
is recognised when the amount of revenue can be 
reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria 
have been met as described below.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration 
received 
or 
receivable. 
Amounts 
disclosed as revenue are net of indirect taxes, trade

allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf 
of third parties and is not recognised in instances 
where there is uncertainty with regard to ultimate 
collection. In such cases revenue is recognised on 
reasonable certainty of collection.
Revenue from software subscription fee is recognised 
on the basis of number of claims processed by the 
Company in accordance with the terms of the service 
agreement entered with the customer.
Revenue from licenses where the customers obtains 
"right to access" is recognised over the access period 
as per the contract with the customers.
Revenue from health management services comprise 
of rendering health administration work. Such 
amounts are recognised as revenue on a pro-rata 
basis during the period of the underlying contract 
with the customers. Performance obligations while 
rendering services are satisfied over time.
Revenue from services also comprise business 
support services incurred for other companies and are 
recognised as and when these services are rendered.
Revenue in excess of invoicing are classified as unbilled 
receivables where related performance obligations 
are rendered over the contract term and right to 
consideration is unconditional. Invoicing in excess of 
revenues are classified as contract liabilities.
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods 
or services to a customer for which the Company has 
received consideration (or an amount of consideration 
is due) from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Company transfers goods 
or services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made or the payment 
is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when the Company performs 
under the contract.
g. Property, plant and equipment 
Recognition and measurement
Items 
of 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
are 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item 
of property, plant and equipment comprises:
a) 	
its purchase price, including import duties and 
non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting 
trade discounts and rebates.
b) 	 any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management.
c) 	
the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an 
entity incurs either when the item is acquired or 
as a consequence of having used the item during 
a particular period for purposes other than to 
produce inventories during that period.
An item of property, plant and equipment is eliminated 
from the standalone financial statements on disposal 
or when no further benefit is expected from its use 
and disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready 
for intended use before such date are disclosed under 
capital work-in-progress.
Depreciation 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is 
provided on straight-line method over the useful lives 
determined based on internal assessment by the 
management which in certain instances are different 
from those prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of 
the Companies Act, 2013 in order to reflect actual 
usage of the assets. The Company estimates the useful 
lives for property, plant and equipment as follows:

is lower.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis i.e. from 
the date on which asset is ready for use and the 
depreciation charge for the year is recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.
The  useful lives and methods of depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate.

h. Intangible assets
(i) Recognition and measurement
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses, if any. 
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible 
asset is based on a number of factors including the 
effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and 
other economic factors such as the stability of the 
industry and technology required to obtain the 
expected future cash flows from the asset. 
Intangible assets under development
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development 
expenditures on an individual project are recognised 
as an intangible asset when the Company can 
demonstrate: 
• 	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be available 
for use or sale.
•	
Its intention to complete and its ability and 
intention to use or sell the asset.
•	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits.
•	
The availability of resources to complete the 
asset.
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development.
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Amortisation of the asset 
begins when development is complete, and the asset 
is available for use. It is amortised over the period 
of expected future benefit. Amortisation expense 
is recognised in the standalone statement of profit 
and loss unless such expenditure forms part of 
carrying value of another asset. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for impairment 
annually.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied 
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other 
expenditure is recognised in the standalone statement 
of profit and loss as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation 
is 
recognised 
in 
the 
standalone 
statement of profit and loss on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets from the date that they are available for use. 
Management believes that period of amortisation is 
representative of the period over which the Company 
expects to derive economic benefits from the use of 
the assets. Amortisation methods and useful lives are 
reviewed periodically including at each financial year 
end. Amortisation on additions and disposals during 
the year is provided on proportionate basis.
The intangible assets are amortised over the estimated 
useful lives as given below:

Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss. 
when the asset is derecognised.
i. Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure:
a) 	
Financial assets which are measured at amortised 
cost e.g., loans receivables, deposits and bank 
balance.
b) 	 Trade receivables or contract assets/unbilled 
receivables or another financial asset that result 
from transactions that are within the scope of Ind 
AS 115.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the 
Company applies a simplified approach in calculating 
ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The 
Company has established a provision policy that is 
based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted 
for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and 
the economic environment. For other financial assets, 
expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal 
to twelve months expected credit loss unless there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk from

initial recognition, in which case those are measured 
at lifetime expected credit loss.
Write off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written 
off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is 
no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the 
case when the Company determines that the debtor 
does not have assets or sources of income that could 
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts 
subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that 
are written off could still be subject to enforcement 
activities in order to comply with Company's 
procedures for the recovery of amount due.
j. Impairment of non-financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 36, the Company assesses, 
at each reporting date, whether there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an 
asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
(CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value 
in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those 
from other assets or Company of assets. When the 
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account. If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
k. Leases
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Company as a lessee
The Company’s leased asset class primarily consist of 
leases for buildings. The Company, at the inception 
of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a 
lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:
(i) 	
the contract involves the use of an identified 
asset;
(ii) 	 the Company has the right to obtain substantially 
all the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use; and
(iii) 	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the 
asset.
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a 
lease liability at the lease commencement date. The 
cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception 
shall comprise the amount of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less any 
lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by 
the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying 
asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which 
it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation, 
accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The 
right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using 
the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets 
are tested for impairment whenever there is any 
indication that their carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss.
The Company measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily 
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, 
the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For 
leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the 
Company, on a lease by lease basis, may adopt either 
the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease 
or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio 
as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed 
payments, variable lease payments, residual value 
guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option and payments of penalties for terminating the 
lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising 
an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is 
subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying 
amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, 
reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease 
payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount 
to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or 
to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. 
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
The Company recognises the amount of the re-
measurement of lease liability due to modification as 
an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss depending upon the 
nature of modification. Where the carrying amount 
of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there 
is a further reduction in the measurement of the 
lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining 
amount of the re-measurement in the standalone 
statement of profit and loss.
The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of 
low-value assets. The Company recognises the lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Critical judgements in determining the lease 
term 
In determining the lease term, management considers 
all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not 
exercise a termination option. Extension options (or 
periods after termination options) are only included in 
the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be 
extended (or not terminated).
For leases of buildings, the following factors are 
normally the most relevant: 
(a) 	 If there are significant penalties to terminate (or 
not extend), the Company is typically reasonably 
certain to extend (or not terminate). 
(b) 	 If any leasehold improvements are expected to 
have a significant remaining value, the Company 
is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not 
terminate). 
(c) 	 Otherwise, the Company considers other factors 
including historical lease durations and the costs 
and business disruption required to replace the 
leased asset.
l. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing 
cost also includes exchange differences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
m. Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits:
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of receiving employee services are classified 
as short-term employee benefits. These benefits 
include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia. 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for employee 
services is recognised as an expense for the related 
service rendered by employees.
(ii) Post-employment benefits:
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which an entity pays specified 
contributions to a separate entity and has no obligation 
to pay any further amounts. The Company makes 
specified monthly contributions towards employee 
provident fund and employees state insurance to a 
Government administered scheme which is a defined 
contribution plan. The Company's contribution is 
recognised as an expense in the standalone statement 
of profit and loss during the period in which the 
employee renders the related service.
Defined benefit plans
The Company’s gratuity benefit scheme is a defined 
benefit plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect 
of a defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value.
The present value of the obligation under such 
benefit plan is determined by independent qualified 
actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method which 
recognises each period of service that give rise to 
additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and 
measures each unit separately to build up the final 
obligation. 
The obligation is measured at present values of 
estimated future cash flows. The discount rates 
used for determining the present value are based 
on the market yields on Government Securities as 
at the balance sheet date. The Company classifies 
the gratuity as current and non-current based on 
the actuarial valuation reports or based on expected 
future cash flows.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income (OCI). Further, the profit 
or loss does not include an expected return on 
plan assets. Instead net interest recognised in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss is calculated 
by applying the discount rate used to measure the

Financial Statements
MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets 
above or below the discount rate is recognised as part 
of re-measurement of net defined liability or asset 
through other comprehensive income.
Re-measurements comprising actuarial gains or losses 
and return on plan assets (excluding amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are 
not reclassified to the standalone statement of profit 
and loss in subsequent periods.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation resulting from plan amendments or 
curtailments are recognised immediately in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss as past service 
cost.
The Company has considered only such changes in 
legislation which have been enacted up to the balance 
sheet date for the purpose of determining defined 
benefit obligation.
(iii) Other long- term employee benefits:
Compensated absences
The employees can carry-forward a portion of the 
unutilised accrued compensated absences and utilise 
it in future service periods. The Company records 
an obligation for such compensated absences in the 
period in which the employee renders the services that 
increase this entitlement. The obligation is measured 
by independent qualified actuary using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method. Accumulated leave, which is 
expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, is 
treated as short-term employee benefit.
(iv) Share-based compensation:
Employees of the Company receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payments, whereby 
employees render services as consideration for equity 
instruments (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined 
by the fair value at the date when the grant is made 
using an appropriate valuation model. Further details 
are given in Note 28.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in employee stock option reserve in equity. 
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded 
manner over the vesting period. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed over the 
vesting period of the respective tranches of such 
grants (accelerated amortisation).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Company's best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The expense or credit in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss for a period represents the movement 
in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised in employee 
benefits expense.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is 
the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, 
provided the original vesting terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense, measured as at the date 
of modification, is recognised for any modification 
that increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share.
n. Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in the standalone 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent it 
relates to items directly recognised in equity or in 
other comprehensive income.
Current income tax 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income for the year and any 
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect 
of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects 
the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be 
paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if 
any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax 
rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting dates.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise 
the assets and settle the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried 
forward tax losses and tax credits (if any). Deferred tax 
is not recognised for:
- 	
temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and that 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss at the time of transaction.
Notes to Standalone Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
- 	
temporary differences related to investments in 
subsidiary and associates, when the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which they can be used. The existence of 
unused tax losses is strong evidence that future 
taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case 
of a history of recent losses, the Company recognises 
a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has 
sufficient taxable temporary differences or there 
is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available against which such deferred tax 
asset can be realised. Deferred tax assets recognised 
or unrecognised are reviewed at each reporting date 
and are recognised/reduced to the extent that it is 
probable/no longer probable respectively that the 
related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. The measurement of deferred 
tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Company expects, at 
the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend 
to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net 
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised 
simultaneously.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI 
or directly in equity.
o. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the standalone balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the standalone statement of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
excluding restricted cash balance and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts as they are considered an integral part 
of the Company’s cash management. Any cash and 
cash equivalents, other bank balances with significant 
restrictions with regards to the Company's ability to 
freely use it is disclosed appropriately by way of a foot 
note.
p. Provisions (other than for employee 
benefits) and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when there is a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
The expenses relating to a provision is presented in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss net of any 
reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance 
cost.
A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the 
present value of the lower of the expected cost of 
terminating the contract and the expected net cost 
of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is 
established, the Company recognises any impairment 
loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may, but will probably not, require an outflow of 
resources. When there is a possible obligation or a 
present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of 
outflow of resources is remote, no provision is made.
A contingent asset is not recognised but disclosed in 
the Company's standalone financial statements where 
an inflow of economic benefit is probable.
Provisions, contingent assets, contingent liabilities and 
commitments are reviewed at each reporting date.
q. Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Company 
that engages in business activities from which it 
earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating 
results are regularly reviewed by the Company’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions 
for which discrete financial information is available. 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the 
Board of Directors. 
r. Cash dividend
The Company recognises a liability to make cash 
distributions to equity holders when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in

India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved 
by the shareholders (in the case of interim dividend it 
is approved by Board of Directors). A corresponding 
amount is recognised directly in equity.
s. Recent pronouncement on Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS): 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 
31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance 
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, 
relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable 
to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Company has 
reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its 
evaluation has determined that it does not have any 
significant impact in its financial statements.
t. Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount 
of the investment is assessed. Where the carrying 
amount of an investment is greater than its estimated 
recoverable amount, it is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount and the difference is 
transferred to the standalone statement of Profit 
and Loss. On disposal of investment, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount is charged or credited to the standalone 
statement of Profit and Loss.

relating to non-controlling interests in Mayfair We 
Care Ltd.
(a) 	 The Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act, 2015 
was notified by the Government of India with 
retrospective effect from 1 April 2014. The 
Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka based on the 
writ petition no 5272/2016 and 5311/2016, has 
vide its order dated 2 February 2016, stayed 
the operation of the said notification for the 
FY 2014-15. The obligation to pay the bonus for 
the FY 2014-15 will arise only if the High Court 
disposes off the writ petition in favour of the 
Government. Hence, the management has taken 
a view and an amount of ` 0.44 million which is 
the approximate statutory bonus liability for the 
eligible employees in respect of FY 2014-15, has 
been considered as contingent liability.
(b) 	 In light of the judgment of Honourable Supreme 
Court dated 28 February 2019 on the definition 
of “Basic Wages” under the Employees Provident 
Funds & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952 and based 
on Company’s evaluation, there are significant 
uncertainties 
and 
numerous 
interpretative 
issues relating to the judgement and hence it is 
unclear as to whether the clarified definition of 
Basic Wages would be applicable prospectively 
or retrospectively. The amount of the obligation 
therefore cannot be measured with sufficient 
reliability for past periods. The Company will 
evaluate its position and update its provision, 
if required, on receiving further clarity on the 
subject. The Company does not expect any 
material impact of the same.
(c) 	 The Company had filed a statement of claim 
before 
the 
Arbitration 
Centre, 
Bangalore 
comprising a Sole Arbitrator on 30th March 
2023 against an ex-employee of the Company 
(“Respondent”) for breach of confidentiality 
and other violations (“Arbitration Case”). The 
Respondent filed a counter claim of ` 8.50 million 
against the Company towards employee stock 
options/vesting of shares and compensation. 
Consequently, the Sole Arbitrator passed an 
order dated 29th December 2023 (“Interim Arbitral 
Order”) restraining the Company from making 
any changes or alterations in its share holding 
pattern and listing the shares of the Company 
before stock exchanges pending disposal of the 
Arbitration Case. Company filed an appeal before 
The City Civil and Sessions Court, Bangalore 
(‘Court”) seeking stay on the Interim Arbitral 
Order and also deposited ` 8.50 million as deposit 
for the appeal (“Appeal Case”). The said Arbitral 
Order was stayed by the Court pursuant to its 
order dated 05 January 2024 pending disposal 
of Appeal Case. The Arbitration Case has now 
been amicably settled between the parties and a 
final Compromise Arbitral Award dated 14 March 
2025 was passed by the Sole Arbitrator effectively 
disposing of the Arbitration Case.
	
In view of the amicable settlement of the 
Arbitration Case, the Appeal Case has also 
been disposed of pursuant to a joint memo for 
withdrawal dated 26 March 2025 filed by the 
parties before the Court and a final order dated 
26 March 2025 was passed by the Court disposing 
of the Appeal Case with a direction to refund 
` 8.50 million to the Company.

30. Employee benefits
The Company contributes to the following employee benefits plans.
a) Defined contribution plans:
The contributions paid/payable to employee provident fund, employees state insurance scheme, employees 
pension schemes and other funds, are determined under the relevant approved schemes and/or statutes and 
are recognised as expense in the statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee renders 
the related service.  There are no further obligations other than the contributions payable to the approved 
trusts/appropriate authorities. 
The amount recognised as an expense towards contribution to defined contribution plans for the Company for 
the year aggregated to  ` 1.97 million  (March 31, 2024: ` 1.92 million).
b) Defined benefit plans:
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan 
entitles an employee who has rendered at least five years of continuous service to receive 15 days salary for 
every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months based on the rate of last drawn salary 
(basic plus dearness allowance) by the employee concerned. The Company's liability is actuarially determined 
(using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial gains/(losses) are recognised under 
other comprehensive income in the statement of profit and loss.
Based on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the details of the employee 
benefit obligation and the plan assets as at balance sheet date:

vi. Description of risk exposures:
Valuations are based on certain assumptions, which are dynamic in nature and vary over time. As such, the 
Company is exposed to various risks as follows:
a) 	 Salary increases: Actual salary increases will increase the Plan’s liability. Increase in salary increase rate 
assumption in future valuations will also increase the liability.
b) 	 Investment risk: If plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch and actual investment return on assets 
lower than the discount rate assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability.

Modification of Employee Stock Option Scheme
The Company had made capital restructuring by way of right issues to existing shareholder on March 21, 2017. 
In accordance with the ESOS 2013 scheme, non-discretionary anti-dilution provisions exists, resulting in terms 
of modification of the scheme, there by additional options have been given to option grantees by the Company. 
Due to existence of non-discretionary provision, this has not resulted in any incremental share based payment 
expense reason being the fair value of the options immediately before and after the rights issue were the same.

cash and cash equivalents, bank balances, trade receivables, trade payables, lease liabilities and other financial 
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
a) 	
The fair values of the mutual funds are based on net asset value at the reporting date.

The fair value of derivative asset (options) was measured using monte-carlo simulation to capture the 
present value of the expected future value of the derivative.
d) 	 All other financial assets except mutual funds and financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost. 
Hence, there are no financial assets/liabilities classified under Level 2 and Level 3.
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,

C. Financial risk management
Risk management framework
The Company’s management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk 
management framework.
The Company’s management monitors compliance with the risk management policies and procedures, and 
reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The 
management is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad-hoc 
reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the management.
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise of leases, trade and other payables. The main purpose of 
these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include 
investments, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and security deposits 
that are out of regular business operations.
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
•	
Market risk;
•	
Credit risk; and
•	
Liquidity risk
(i) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices - such as interest rates, equity prices - will affect the Company’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. Material 
investments within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved 
by the appropriate authority.
Foreign currency risk
The Company primarily renders services and avails goods and services in domestic currencies and hence 
exposure to currency risk is minimal.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Equity price risk
The Company's investment in listed and unlisted equity securities are susceptible to market price risk arising 
from uncertainties about the future value of investment in these securities. The Company manages these price 
risks through strategic investments and placing limits on individual investments. The investments reports are 
submitted to the senior management and the Board reviews and approves these investment decisions.
Exposure in mutual funds
The Company manages the surplus funds majorly through investments in mutual fund schemes. The price 
of investment in these mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset 
Management Company on daily basis as reflected by the movement in the NAV of invested schemes. The 
Company is exposed to price risk on such Investments. The investments reports are submitted to the senior 
management and the Board reviews and approves these investment decisions.
Interest rate risk
The Company has no varaible interest rate borrowings and there is no significant exposure to interest rate risk.
(ii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers.
The carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
a. Trade receivables 
b. Unbilled receivables
c. Cash and bank balances
d. Loans receivables
e. Other receivables
f. Other financial assets
Trade receivables and unbilled receivables
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. 
Credit risk is managed through credit approvals and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers 
to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.
The Company individually monitors the sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding balances. Accordingly, 
the Company makes specific provisions against such trade receivables wherever required and monitors the 
same at periodic intervals.
The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect 
of trade receivables and unbilled receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables and unbilled receivables was as follows:

 241.80 
 157.50 
Refer note 11 (b) for movement in the allowance for expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables and 
unbilled receivables during the year.
Management assessment of recoverability of 
trade receivables and unbilled receivables
Trade receivables and unbilled receivables forms 
a significant part of the financial assets carried at 
amortised cost. The Company has performed detailed 
customer wise specific assessment of recoverability of 
the trade receivables and unbilled receivables and has 
accordingly recognised the Impairment loss. Further, 
the Company is closely monitoring the developments 
across various business lines. Basis the aforesaid 
detailed assessment made by Management, provision 
made 
towards 
trade 
receivables 
and 
unbilled 
receivables is considered adequate.
Cash and cash equivalents and other bank 
balances
The cash and cash equivalents and other bank 
balances are held with banks and financial institutions 
counterparties with good credit rating.
Other receivables
These represents mainly reimbursement of expenses 
incurred on Govt business and receivables from self 
funded business.
Loans receivables
These represents loan receivable from Medi Assist 
Insurance TPA Private Limited, which were extended 
to support its working capital requirements.
Other financial assets
The Company has performed detailed party wise 
specific assessment of recoverability of the other 
financial assets and has accordingly recognised the 
impairment loss. Further, the Company is closely 
monitoring the developments across various business 
lines. Basis the aforesaid detailed assessment made 
by management, provision made towards other 
financial assets is considered adequate.
(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter 
difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash 
or another financial asset. The Company’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when they are due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or 
risking damage to the Company’s reputation. 
Exposure to liquidity risk
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts

33. Capital management
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity 
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital 
management is to safeguard the Company’s ability to remain as a going concern and maximise the shareholder 
value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic 
conditions, annual operating plans and long-term and other strategic investment plans. In order to maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders or issue new shares. The current capital structure of the Company is equity based with financing 
through borrowings and leasing. The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Medi Assist Healthcare Services Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Medi Assist Healthcare 
Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”), which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss including 
Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, 
and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including material accounting policy information and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, 
and based on consideration of reports of other 
auditors on separate financial statements and on 
the other financial information of subsidiaries, the 
aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true 
and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act 
read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of 
their consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 
March 31, 2025, and of consolidated profit including 
other comprehensive loss, consolidated changes in 
equity and its consolidated cash flows for the year 
then ended. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) 
of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for 
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group, in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements in terms of the Code of Ethics 
issued by Institute of Chartered Accountant of India 
(“ICAI”), and the relevant provisions of the Act and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained and on 
consideration of audit reports of other auditors 
referred to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” 
section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. 
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to Note 52 to the accompanying 
Statement which describes that search and seizure 
operation was carried out by the Directorate of 
Enforcement at certain offices of a wholly owned 
subsidiary and the management’s assessment thereof 
about the consequent impact on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below 
to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:
Sr.

Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in 
our audit
1.
Revenue/unbilled revenue recognition
The accounting policies relating to revenue 
recognition is set out in Note 3(g) to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. As per the principles of Ind 
AS 115- ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
(“Ind AS 115”).
Our audit procedures with respect to this area 
included, among others, following:
a.	
Evaluated 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
Company’s accounting policy for revenue 
recognition from sale of services to insurance 
companies, government agencies and retail 
customers, in accordance with Ind AS 115.
Sr.  
No.
Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in 
our audit
The Group derives its major revenue from rendering 
Third Party Administration (TPA) services which is 
measured as a percentage of insurance premium 
or rate per member or family covered under the 
policy or contract entered into with insurance 
companies, 
government 
agencies 
and 
retail 
customers. Revenue from the sale of such services 
are recognized over a period of time (pro-rata 
basis during the period of the underlying insurance 
policy), if the necessary conditions/obligations as 
mentioned in the Ind AS 115 are satisfied.
The value and timing of revenue recognition from 
the sale of such services varies depending upon the 
nature of the contract with the customer and the 
activity can span beyond the year end. Significant 
level of judgement and estimate is required in 
respect of contracts/policies entered at or near 
year end and also which are subject to renewal 
or confirmation of customer by way of providing 
premium registers to the Company.
Considering the significance of management 
judgement and estimates involved, as mentioned 
above, and the materiality of amounts involved, 
revenue recognition was identified as a key audit 
matter.
b.	
Obtained an understanding of the systems, 
processes and controls implemented by the 
management for recording and calculating 
revenue.
c.	
Assessed the design and implementation 
of key controls over the recognition of 
contact revenue, completeness and accuracy 
of revenue reports generated from the 
accounting system/other systems and tested 
the operating effectiveness of these controls.
d.	
Verified the year end revenue/unbilled revenue 
computation with the premium registers/
confirmed contracts received subsequent to 
year end. Tested effectiveness of the review 
controls around the computation of such 
revenue.
e.	
Verify the relevant approval of contracts/
policies which are the base for the computation 
of 
revenue/unbilled 
revenue. 
Checked 
renewed/confirmed contracts entered with the 
customer subsequent to year end to confirm 
the revenue recognized as at year end.
f.	
Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2.
Impairment assessment of carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangible assets in 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Medi 
Assist Healthcare Services Limited.
Refer note 2.D, 3(k), 6 and 7 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group as at March 31, 2025 
carries goodwill amounting to ` 1,299.30 million 
and other intangible assets of ` 921.71 million. 
This goodwill was recorded on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries and step-down subsidiaries in the 
previous years. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually at the cash generating unit level, whereby 
the carrying amount of the cash generating 
unit (including goodwill) is compared with the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. 
The recoverable amount is determined on the 
basis of the value in use, which is the present 
value of future cash flows of the cash generating 
unit. The present value is determined by using 
discounted cash flow model. This model requires 
the Company to make significant assumptions 
such as discount rate, near and long-term revenue 
growth rate and projected margins which involves 
inherent uncertainty since they are based on future 
business prospects and economic outlook.
Our audit procedures with respect to this area 
included, among others, following:
a.	
Assessed the appropriateness of the Group’s 
accounting policies relating to the impairment 
of goodwill with Indian Accounting Standard 
36 - Impairment of Assets ('Ind AS 36').
b.	
Obtained an understanding of the process 
followed by the management of the Group 
in respect of performing annual impairment 
analysis and tested the design, implementation 
and operating effectiveness of the relevant key 
controls related to the process of assessment 
of the annual impairment, including controls 
over determination of recoverable amounts of 
CGUs determined by the Company/Group.
c.	
Reviewed the workings issued by management.
d.	
Assessed the reasonableness of the key 
assumptions used in computing recoverable 
amount of CGU, such as, growth rates, 
profitability, discount rates, etc, with reference 
to our understanding of the business and 
historical trends.
e.	
Tested the arithmetical accuracy of the 
computation of recoverable amounts of cash 
generating units.

Key Audit Matters
How the Key Audit Matters was addressed in 
our audit
Due to the materiality of above assets in context 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
sensitivity of discount rate and near and long-term 
revenue growth rate assumptions which are highly 
dependent on management estimates/judgement, 
we have considered the impairment assessment of 
“Third-party administration CGU” to be a key audit 
matter.
f.	
Assessed and validated the adequacy and 
appropriateness of the disclosures made by 
the management as per requirement of Ind AS 
36 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
3.
Assessment of the carrying value of Intangible 
Assets 
(including 
intangible 
assets 
under 
development).
(Refer to Note 3(i), Note 2.D to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements regarding the recognition, 
amortisation of Intangible Asset, ‘Impairment 
Losses’ and ‘Use of estimates and judgements’ 
respectively).
The 
Company 
incurs 
product 
development 
costs and capitalises such expenditure to the 
extent it qualifies for recognition as an Intangible 
Asset (product development). Such expenditure 
includes internal manpower costs and outsourced 
manpower costs specifically incurred on such 
development projects. Up to the stage the products 
are ready for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by the management, the 
Company records the qualifying expenditure as 
‘intangible assets under development’.
The Group has capitalised ` 102.31 million of 
intangibles in the nature of internally developed 
software during the year and has an amount of 
` 38.66 million under development as at March 31, 
2025 for new technology developments. The Group 
has also acquired Intangible assets amounting to 
` 461.75 million during the year ended March 31, 
2025 for digitization of claims processing.
Intangible assets under development are tested for 
impairment on an annual basis. The Company tests 
Other Intangible Assets for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The appropriateness of Intangible assets and 
Intangible assets under development capitalised is 
a key audit matter due to the judgement involved 
in assessing if the cost meets the capitalisation 
criteria, dependency of the business on the 
assets capitalised/under capitalisation and key 
assumptions used in the measurement model for 
impairment. The measurement model used for 
review of impairment of these Intangible assets 
depends largely on management’s assessment with 
regard to the appropriateness of estimated future 
cash flows, and the discount rates used. Hence, 
there are significant estimates and judgements 
involved in determining the above.
Our audit procedures with respect to this area 
included, among others, following:
a.	
We obtained an understanding and assessed 
the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of relevant internal controls with 
regard to the classification of development 
expenditure and their capitalisation and 
evaluation 
of 
impairment 
for 
internally 
generated intangible assets.
b.	
We evaluated management review controls 
over calculations of the future economic 
benefit of the projects.
c.	
We observed management’s validation of 
relevant data elements and benchmarking the 
assumptions.
d.	
We observed management’s assessment of 
sensitivity of the impact of the changes in key 
assumptions.
e.	
We discussed with senior management and 
challenged management assumptions.
f.	
We tested the capitalisation of project related 
expenses incurred during the year with 
underlying documents relating to material 
costs, 
directly 
attributable 
overheads, 
designing cost, software expenses, testing 
charges and related salary cost incurred 
to verify existence and appropriateness of 
classification of research and development.
g.	
We performed sensitivity tests on the model 
by analysing the impact of using other possible 
growth rates and discount rates within a 
reasonable and foreseeable range.
h.	
We inspected the technical team’s approvals 
for initiation of capitalisation.
i.	
We reviewed the central cost allocation for 
the year and determined whether the costs 
capitalised are directly attributable including 
the interest capitalised.
j.	
We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures 
made in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Based on the above procedures performed, 
we did not identify any significant exceptions 
in the management’s assessment in relation 
to the capitalisation of Intangible assets and 
Intangible assets under development.

Financial Statements and Auditor’s

Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information identified above when it becomes 
available and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
When we read the Management report, Chairman’s 
statement, Director’s report if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with 
governance under SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities 
Relating to Other Information’.
Responsibilities of Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is 
responsible for the preparation and presentation of 
these Consolidated Financial Statements in term of the 
requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance, consolidated changes in 
equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective 
Management and Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; the selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
by the Management and Board of Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements,

operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an

assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Holding Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
management and Board of Directors use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the ability 
of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
Consolidated Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the 
Financial Statements of such entities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities or business activities included in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other 
auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for 
our audit opinion. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Holding Company and such other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of 
which we are the independent auditors regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards 
on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the

if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements of the 
Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A 
Company's 
internal 
financial 
control 
with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal 
financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance 
that 
transactions 
are 
recorded 
as 
necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
1. Corporate information
Medi Assist Healthcare Services Limited ("the Company" or "Parent") is a public limited company domiciled in 
India and is incorporated on June 7, 2000 under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. The 
Company received order from the Registrar of Companies with fresh certificate of incorporation upon conversion 
from private company to public company with effect from March 20, 2018. The Company’s registered office is 
situated at AARPEE Chambers, SSRP Building, 7th Floor, Marol Co-operative Industrial Estate Road, Gamdevi, 
Marol, Andheri East, Mumbai - 400059, India. The business operations of the Company are carried out at various 
cities in India.
The Company, and its below mentioned subsidiaries (collectively the "Group"), are mainly engaged in the business 
of providing Third Party Administration (TPA) services. The Group has signed up contracts with several general 
and health insurance companies to manage the requirements of their policyholders, as well as with healthcare 
providers (such as hospitals) to enable a network for policyholders to avail of cashless treatment at pre-negotiated 
tariffs. The Group also provides business support services, health management services, consultancy services 
and contact centre support and other allied services pertaining to the healthcare and health insurance sector. 
The Group primarily derives its income in the form of TPA fees from insurance companies expressed either as 
a percentage of the insurance premium paid by the insured to the insurance company or as a fixed price per 
member/family. The Group also derives income from pre-policy check ups and other allied services provided to 
insurance companies, and for policy administration services rendered to Governments to enable public health 
schemes.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprises the financial information of the Parent and other 
members of the Group as set out below. Unless otherwise stated, they have share capital consisting solely of 
equity shares that are held directly by the Group, and the proportion of ownership interests held equals the 
voting rights held by the Group. The country of incorporation or registration is also their principal place of 
business.

2. Basis of preparation 
A. Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements comprising the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss including Consolidated other comprehensive income, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the notes to Consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended on that date (""consolidation financial statement"") of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with.
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under 
section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and 
presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule 
III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant 
Schedule III), as applicable and other relevant 
provisions of the Act.
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared for the Group as a going concern on the 
basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective at the 
Group’s annual reporting date March 31, 2025. These 
consolidated financial statements were authorised for 
issuance by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 
15, 2025.
B. Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees (` , which is the Parent's functional 
and presentation currency. All amounts have been 
rounded off to the nearest million, up to two decimal 
places, unless otherwise indicated.
C. Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost basis, except for 
the following:
Items
Measurement basis
Certain financial assets 
and liabilities (including 
derivatives instruments) 
Fair value
Share based payments at 
grant date
Fair value
Defined benefit and other 
long-term employee 
benefits obligations
Present value of 
defined benefit 
obligations less fair 
value of plan assets
D. Use of estimates and judgements
In preparing these consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS, management has made 
estimates, judgements and assumptions. These 
estimates, judgements and assumptions affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of 
contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting 
estimates could change from period to period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate 
changes in estimates are made as management 
becomes 
aware 
of 
changes 
in 
circumstances 
surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements in 
the year in which changes are made and, if material, 
their effects are disclosed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised prospectively.
Judgements, estimates and assumptions are 
required in particular for:
(a) Determination of the estimated useful lives:
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives 
are different from that prescribed in Schedule II and 
in case of intangible assets, these are estimated by 
management taking into account the nature of the 
asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating 
conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, 
anticipated technological changes, manufacturers’ 
warranties and maintenance support.
(b) Recognition of deferred tax assets:
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
and their respective tax bases, (and unutilised business 
loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits). 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable income will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, 
unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and 
unused tax credits could be utilised.
(c) Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations:
The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is 
determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and life expectancy. The discount 
rate is determined by reference to market yields 
at the end of the reporting period on government 
bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds 
correspond to the probable maturity of the post-
employment benefit obligations. Due to complexities 
involved in the valuation and its long term nature, 
defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in 
these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting period.
(d) Fair valuation of employee share options:
The fair valuation of the employee share options is 
based on the Black-Scholes Model used for valuation 
of options. Key assumptions made with respect to 
expected volatility, share price, expected dividends 
and discount rate, under option pricing model.
(e) Impairment testing: 
Property, plant and equipment, investments, right-
of-use assets, intangible assets and other assets are 
tested for impairment at least annually and when 
event occur or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the recoverable amount of the asset or cash 
generating units to which these pertain is less than

MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
its carrying value. The recoverable amount of cash 
generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair 
value less cost to dispose. The calculation of value in 
use of a cash generating unit involves use of significant 
estimates and assumptions which includes turnover 
and earnings multiples, growth rates and net margins 
used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-
adjusted discount rate, future economic and market 
conditions.
(f) Business combinations:
Business combinations have been accounted for using 
the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 
103, Business Combinations.
The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at 
the fair value of the assets transferred and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which 
is the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. 
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis. 
Subsequent 
to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling 
interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share 
of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business 
combinations 
between 
entities 
under 
common control is accounted for at carrying value of 
the assets and liabilities in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection 
with a business combination such as finder’s fees, 
legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional 
and consulting fees are expensed as incurred.
(g) Leases
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease based on the requirements of the 
relevant standard. Identification of a lease requires 
significant management judgment. Computation of 
the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets requires 
management to estimate the lease term (including 
anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount 
rate. Management estimates the lease term based on 
past practices and reasonably estimated/anticipated 
future events. The discount rate is generally based on 
the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease 
being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
(h) Expected credit losses on financial assets:
The Group recognises an allowance for expected 
credit losses (ECLs) for all financial assets not held at 
fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the 
difference between the contractual cash flows due in 
accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an 
approximation of the original effective interest rate (in 
case of non current financial assets).
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group 
applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit 
risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group 
has established a provision matrix that is based on 
its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 
forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment.
E. Measurement of fair values
The Group measures certain financial instruments at 
fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
(i)  	 In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
(ii) 	 In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability 
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic best interest.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
- 	
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- 	
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included 
in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices).
- 	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
When the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the DCF model. The inputs to these models 
are taken from observable markets where possible, 
but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement 
is required in establishing fair values. Judgements 
include considerations of inputs such as liquidity 
risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions 
about these factors could affect the reported fair value 
of financial instruments.
Further information about the assumptions made 
in measuring fair values is included in the following 
notes:
- Note 31: Share based payments.
- Note 32: Financial instruments.
- Note 38: Business combinations.
F. Current and non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet based on current/non-
current classification.
An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of 
the following criteria:
- 	
it is expected to be realised in, or is intended 
for sale or consumption in, the Group’s normal 
operating cycle.
- 	
it is held primarily for the purpose of being 
traded;
- 	
it is expected to be realised within 12 months 
after the reporting date; or
- 	
it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any 
of the following criteria:
- 	
it is expected to be settled in the Group’s normal 
operating cycle;
- 	
it is held primarily for the purpose of being 
traded;
- 	
it is due to be settled within 12 months after the 
reporting date; or
- 	
the Group does not have an unconditional right 
to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the reporting date. 
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the 
counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of 
equity instruments do not affect its classification.
Current assets/liabilities include current portion of 
non-current financial assets/liabilities respectively.
All other assets/liabilities are classified as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities (if any) are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
Operating cycle
Based on the nature of the operations and the time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing and 
their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the Group 
has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months 
for the purpose of current/non-current classification 
of assets and liabilities.
3. Summary of material accounting 
policies
The accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently throughout the period presented 
in these consolidated financial statements, unless 
otherwise stated.
a. Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries:
The Group determines the basis of control in line 
with the requirements of Ind AS 110, Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The 
Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated 
from the date that control ceases.
The Group combines the financial statements of the 
parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together 
like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and 
expense. Intercompany transactions, balances and 
unrealised gains on transactions between Group 
entities are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of transferred asset. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted for the Group.
Non-controlling interests ("NCI") in the results and 
equity of subsidiary are shown separately in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss and Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity respectively.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
Where the Group writes a put option over NCI, the 
Group assesses whether it has present access to 
returns associated with the ownership interests 
subject to the put option. If the Group concludes that 
it does not have present access, the NCI are not de-
recognised and continue to receive an allocation of 
profit and loss and other comprehensive income. The 
Group recognises a liability for the present value of the 
put option redemption amount against other equity 
and any subsequent changes are accounted for in 
profit or loss. The put option liability is de-recognised 
on settlement or expiry.
b. Financial instruments
(i) Recognition and initial measurement
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity. Financial 
instruments also include derivative contracts.
Financial instruments also covers contracts to buy or 
sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash 
or another financial instrument, or by exchanging 
financial instruments, as if the contracts were financial 
instruments, with the exception of contracts that were 
entered into and continue to be held for the purpose 
of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in 
accordance with the entity’s expected purchase, sale 
or usage requirements.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instruments. The classification of 
financial assets at initial recognition depends on the 
financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics 
and the Group’s business model for managing them.
Recognition and initial measurement – financial 
assets and financial liabilities:
A financial asset (except for trade receivables and 
unbilled revenue/contract assets) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at 
fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition 
or issue. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at 
FVTPL are recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income consists of interest income on funds 
invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of 
FVTPL financial assets. Interest income is recognised 
as it accrues in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss on the date that the 
Group’s right to receive payment is established, it is 
probable that the economic benefits associated with 
the dividend will flow to the Group, and the amount of 
dividend can be measured reliably.
Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans 
and borrowings and financial liabilities. The costs of 
these are recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method.
(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets
The Group classifies financial assets as measured 
at 
amortised 
cost, 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through 
profit and loss (“FVTPL”) on the basis of following:
- 	
the entity’s business model for managing the 
financial assets and
- 	
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
Amortised cost:
A financial asset is classified and measured at 
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are 
met:
- 	
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVOCI”):
A financial asset is classified and measured at FVOCI if 
both of the following conditions are met:
- 	
the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets 
and
- 	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is 
not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect 
to present subsequent changes in the investment’s 
fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI – equity 
investment). This election is made on an investment 
by investment basis.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
Fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”)
A financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL 
unless it is measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI. 
This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial 
recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a 
financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements 
to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at 
FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial assets: Business model assessment
The Group makes an assessment of the objective of 
the business model in which a financial asset is held 
at investment level because this reflects the best way 
the business is managed and information is provided 
to management. The information considered includes:
- 	
the stated policies and objectives for each of such 
investments and the operation of those policies 
in practice.
- 	
the risks that affect the performance of the 
business model (and the financial assets held 
within that business model) and how those risks 
are managed;
- 	
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of 
financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for 
such sales and expectations about future sales 
activity.
Transfers of financial assets to third parties in 
transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are 
not considered as sales for this purpose, consistent 
with the Group’s continuing recognition of the assets.
Financial assets that are held for trading or are 
managed and whose performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.
Financial assets: Assessment whether 
contractual cash flows are solely payments of 
principal and interest:
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is 
defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial 
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration 
for the time value of money and for the credit risk 
associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and 
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are 
solely payments of principal and interest, the Group 
considers the contractual terms of the instrument. 
This includes assessing whether the financial asset 
contains a contractual term that could change the 
timing or amount of contractual cash flows such 
that it would not meet this condition. In making this 
assessment, the Group considers:
- 	
contingent events that would change the amount 
or timing of cash flows;
- 	
terms that may adjust the contractual coupon 
rate, including variable interest rate features;
- 	
prepayment and extension features; and
- 	
terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows 
from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).
A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely 
payments of principal and interest criterion if the 
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid 
amounts of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable 
additional 
compensation 
for 
early 
termination 
of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset 
acquired at a significant discount or premium to its 
contractual par amount, a feature that permits or 
requires prepayment at an amount that substantially 
represents the contractual par amount plus accrued 
(but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also 
include reasonable additional compensation for 
early termination) is treated as consistent with this 
criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is 
insignificant at initial recognition.
Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at 
FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including 
any interest or dividend income, are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
Financial assets at 
amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Equity investments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised 
as income in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss unless the dividend clearly 
represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses 
are recognised in OCI and are not reclassified to Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.

Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent 
measurement and gains and losses
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified 
as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading, or it 
is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial 
recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured 
at fair value and net gains and losses, including any 
interest expense, are recognised in Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and 
losses are recognised in Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is 
also recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
(iii) Derecognition
Financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive 
the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset are transferred or in which the 
Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not 
retain control of the financial asset.
Financial liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its 
contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, 
or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial 
liability when its terms are modified and the cash 
flows under the modified terms are substantially 
different. In this case, a new financial liability based 
on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. 
The difference between the carrying amount of the 
financial liability extinguished and the new financial 
liability with modified terms is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
(iv) Offsetting financial instruments:
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount presented in the consolidated balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has 
a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and 
it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
c. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the respective functional currencies of the Group 
companies at the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured based on historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated at the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences 
are 
generally 
recognised 
in 
the 
Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Translations of foreign operations
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial 
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
foreign operations that have a functional currency 
other than ` are translated into ` using exchange 
rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and 
expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the year. Exchange differences arising, if any, 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
held in foreign currency translation reserve (‘FCTR’), 
a component of equity, except to the extent that the 
translation difference is allocated to non-controlling 
interest. When a foreign operation is disposed off, the 
relevant amount recognised in FCTR is transferred to 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as part of 
the profit or loss on disposal. 
d. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-
term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less, which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash excluding restricted cash balance and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding 
bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management. Any cash and 
cash equivalents, other bank balances with significant 
restrictions with regards to the Group's ability to freely 
use it is disclosed appropriately by way of a foot note.
e. Cash flow statement
Cash flows are reported using indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts 
or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities of the Group are segregated.
f. Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is computed 
by dividing the net profit after tax for the years 
attributable to equity shareholders of the Parent 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
The weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period and for all periods 
presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus 
shares, stock split, other than the conversion of 
potential equity shares that have changed the number 
of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
The number of shares used in computing diluted 
earnings per share comprises the weighted average 
number of shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per share and also the weighted average 
number of equity shares that could have been issued 
on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as of the beginning of the period unless issued at a 
later date. In computing dilutive earning per share, 
only potential equity shares that are dilutive i.e. which 
reduces earnings per share or increases loss per share 
are included.
Diluted EPS adjust the figures used in the determination 
of basic EPS to consider:
• 	
The after-income tax effect of interest and other 
financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
• 	
The weighted average number of additional 
equity shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
g. Revenue from operations
The Group follows Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers”. Revenue is recognised upon transfer 
of control of promised services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration the Group 
expects to receive in exchange for those services (net of 
goods and services tax).  Revenue is recognised when 
the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the 
entity and specific criteria have been met as described 
below.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration 
received 
or 
receivable. 
Amounts 
disclosed as revenue are net of indirect taxes, trade 
allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf 
of third parties and is not recognised in instances 
where there is uncertainty with regard to ultimate 
collection. In such cases revenue is recognised on 
reasonable certainty of collection.
The Group derives revenue from rendering Third Party 
Administration (TPA) services which is measured either 
as a percentage of insurance premium or amount per 
member/family covered under the policy depending 
on the terms of the contract entered into with 
insurance companies and government agencies. Such 
amounts are recognised as revenue on a pro-rata basis 
during the period of the underlying insurance policy. 
Performance obligations while rendering services 
are satisfied over time, as and when the services are 
rendered since the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits provided by the Group.
The Group derives revenue from rendering healthcare 
management services in accordance with the terms 
of the relevant service agreement entered with 
customers and revenue is recognised at a point in 
time as and when the related services are rendered.
The Group derives revenue from pre-policy health 
check-up services in accordance with the terms of the 
relevant service agreement entered with customers 
and revenue is recognised at a point in time as and 
when the related services are rendered. Since the 
Group acts as an agent while providing such services 
and there exists back to back arrangements in which 
the Group merely acts as a facilitator, the Group 
recognises its margin on these transactions as 
revenue.
Revenue from card processing income are recognised 
at a point in time as and when the related services are 
rendered.
The Group derives revenue from rendering business 
support services in accordance with the terms of the 
relevant service agreement entered with customers, 
being performance obligations are satisfied over the 
contract period as the Group's efforts or inputs are 
expended evenly throughout the contract period.
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains 
""right to use"" is recognised over the access period 
on a straight line basis.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in 
its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Revenue in excess of invoicing are classified as unbilled 
receivables (under trade receivables) where related 
performance obligation are rendered and right to 
consideration is unconditional. Invoicing in excess of 
revenues are classified as contract liabilities. 
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer of 
services to a customer for which the Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Group transfers of services to the customer, 
a contract liability is recognised when the payment is 
made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). 
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when 
the Group performs under the contract.

h. Property, plant and equipment 
Recognition and measurement:
Items 
of 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
are 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost of an 
item of property, plant and equipment comprises:
a) 	
its purchase price, including import duties and 
non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting 
trade discounts and rebates.
b) 	 any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset to the location and condition necessary 
for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management.
c) 	
the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, the obligation for which an 
entity incurs either when the item is acquired or 
as a consequence of having used the item during 
a particular period for purposes other than to 
produce inventories during that period.
An item of property, plant and equipment is eliminated 
from the consolidated financial statements on 
disposal or when no further benefit is expected from 
its use and disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of an 
item of property, plant and equipment is recognised 
in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Group.
The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready 
for intended use before such date are disclosed under 
capital work-in-progress.
Depreciation 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is 
provided on straight-line method over the useful lives 
determined based on internal assessment by the 
management which in certain instances are different 
from those prescribed under Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013 in order to reflect actual usage 
of the assets. The Group estimates the useful lives for 
property, plant and equipment as follows:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the 
lease term or the useful lives of the assets, whichever 
is lower.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis i.e. 
from the date on which asset is ready for use and 
the depreciation charge for the year is recognised in 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The useful lives and methods of depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate.
i. Intangible assets
(i) Recognition and measurement
Acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of 
the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets 
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment loss.
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible 
asset is based on a number of factors including the 
effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and 
other economic factors such as the stability of the 
industry and technology required to obtain the 
expected future cash flows from the asset.
Intangible assets under development
Research 
costs 
are 
expensed 
as 
incurred. 
Development expenditures on an individual project 
are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group 
can demonstrate: 
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that the asset will be available 
for use or sale
•	
Its intention to complete and its ability and 
intention to use or sell the asset 
•	
How the asset will generate future economic 
benefits
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
•	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Amortisation of the asset 
begins when development is complete, and the asset 
is available for use. It is amortised over the period 
of expected future benefit. Amortisation expense is 
recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value 
of another asset. During the period of development, 
the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases the future economic benefits embodied 
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other 
expenditure is recognised in Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the 
date that they are available for use. Management 
believes that period of amortisation is representative 
of the period over which the Group expects to derive 
economic benefits from the use of the assets.
Amortisation methods and useful lives are reviewed 
periodically including at each financial year end. 
Amortisation on additions and disposals during the 
year is provided on proportionate basis. 
The intangible assets are amortised over the estimated 
useful lives as given below:
Asset categories
Useful life adopted 
(in years)
Software

Derecognition of intangible assets
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e., 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss. when the asset is derecognised.
j. Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following 
financial assets and credit risk exposure:
a) 	
Financial assets which are measured at amortised 
cost e.g., loans receivables, deposits and bank 
balance.
b) 	 Trade receivables or contract assets/unbilled 
receivables or another financial asset that result 
from transactions that are within the scope of Ind 
AS 115.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group 
applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit 
risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group 
has established a provision policy that is based on 
its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for 
forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and 
the economic environment. For other financial assets, 
expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal 
to twelve months expected credit loss unless there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk from 
initial recognition, in which case those are measured 
at lifetime expected credit loss.
Write off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written 
off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there 
is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally 
the case when the Group determines that the debtor 
does not have assets or sources of income that could 
generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts 
subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that 
are written off could still be subject to enforcement 
activities in order to comply with Group's procedures 
for the recovery of amount due.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from 
the Group’s balance sheet) when:
a) 	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset 
have expired, or
b) 	 The Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the 
Group has transferred substantially all the risks

For the year ended 31 March 2025

MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the transferred asset 
to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Group has retained.
k. Impairment of non-financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 36, Goodwill is tested 
for impairment at least annually and when events 
occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less 
than its carrying value. 
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment 
testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. The recoverable amount is determined 
for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent 
of those from other assets or Group of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account. If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. These 
calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, 
quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or 
other available fair value indicators.
l. Leases
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Company as a lessee
The Group’s lease asset class primarily consist of 
leases for buildings. The Group, at the inception of 
a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease 
or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Group assesses whether:
(i) 	
the contract involves the use of an identified 
asset;
(ii) 	 the Group has the right to obtain substantially 
all the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use; and
(iii) 	 the Group has the right to direct the use of the 
asset.
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease 
liability at the lease commencement date. The cost 
of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall 
comprise of the amount of the initial measurement 
of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date less any 
lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by 
the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying 
asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which 
it is located. The right-of-use assets is subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation, 
accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The 
right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using 
the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets 
are tested for impairment whenever there is any 
indication that their carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group measures the lease liability at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date of the lease. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If 
that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group 
uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with 
reasonably similar characteristics, the Group, on a 
lease by lease basis, may adopt either the incremental 
borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental 
borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease 
payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease 
payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price 
of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably 
certain to exercise that option and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease 
term reflects the lessee exercising an option to 
terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to 
reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made 
and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any 
reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect 
revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group 
recognises the amount of the re-measurement of 
lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to 
the right-of-use asset and charged to the statement 
of profit and loss depending upon the nature of 
modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further 
reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, 
the Group recognises any remaining amount of the 
re-measurement in Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases 
of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease 
payments associated with these leases as an expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Critical judgements in determining the lease 
term
In determining the lease term, management considers 
all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not 
exercise a termination option. Extension options (or 
periods after termination options) are only included in 
the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be 
extended (or not terminated).
For leases of buildings, the following factors are 
normally the most relevant: 
(a) 	 If there are significant penalties to terminate (or 
not extend), the group is typically reasonably 
certain to extend (or not terminate). 
(b) 	 If any leasehold improvements are expected to 
have a significant remaining value, the group 
is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not 
terminate). 
(c) 	 Otherwise, the group considers other factors 
including historical lease durations and the costs 
and business disruption required to replace the 
leased asset. 
m. Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of receiving employee services are classified 
as short-term employee benefits. These benefits 
include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia. 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for employee 
services is recognised as an expense for the related 
service rendered by employees.
(ii) Post-employment benefits:
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which an entity pays specified 
contributions to a separate entity and has no obligation 
to pay any further amounts. The Group makes specified 
monthly contributions towards employee provident 
fund and employees state insurance to a Government 
administered scheme which is a defined contribution 
plan. The Group's contribution is recognised as an 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss during the period in which the employee renders 
the related service.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s gratuity benefit scheme is a defined 
benefit plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect 
of a defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value.
The present value of the obligation under such 
benefit plan is determined by independent qualified 
actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method which 
recognises each period of service that give rise to 
additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and 
measures each unit separately to build up the final 
obligation. 
The obligation is measured at present values of 
estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used 
for determining the present value are based on the 
market yields on Government Securities as at the 
balance sheet date. The Group classifies the gratuity 
as current and non-current based on the actuarial 
valuation reports or based on expected future cash 
flows. 
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income ('OCI'). Further, the profit 
or loss does not include an expected return on plan 
assets. Instead net interest recognised in Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss is calculated by applying 
the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
The actual return on the plan assets above or below the 
discount rate is recognised as part of re-measurement 
of net defined liability or asset through OCI.
Re-measurements comprising actuarial gains or losses 
and return on plan assets (excluding amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are 
not reclassified to Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss in subsequent periods.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation resulting from plan amendments or 
curtailments are recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as past 
service cost.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
MEDI ASSIST HEALTHCARE SERVICES LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
The Group have considered only such changes 
in legislation which have been enacted up to the 
consolidated balance sheet date for the purpose of 
determining defined benefit obligation.
Compensated absences
The employees can carry-forward a portion of the 
unutilised accrued compensated absences and utilise 
it in future service periods. The Group records an 
obligation for such compensated absences in the 
period in which the employee renders the services that 
increase this entitlement. The obligation is measured 
by independent qualified actuary using the Projected 
Unit Credit Method. Accumulated leave, which is 
expected to be utilised within the next 12 months, is 
treated as short-term employee benefit.
Share-based compensation
Employees of the Group receive remuneration 
in the form of share-based payments, whereby 
employees render services as consideration for equity 
instruments (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined 
by the fair value at the date when the grant is made 
using an appropriate valuation model. Further details 
are given in Note 31.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in employee stock option reserve in equity. 
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded 
manner over the vesting period. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is expensed over the 
vesting period of the respective tranches of such 
grants (accelerated amortisation).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The expense or credit in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss for a period represents the movement 
in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning 
and end of that period and is recognised in employee 
benefits expense.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is 
the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, 
provided the original vesting terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense, measured as at the date 
of modification, is recognised for any modification 
that increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected 
as additional share dilution in the computation of 
diluted earnings per share.
n.Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs 
consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing 
cost also includes exchange differences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
o. Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree. For each business combination, 
the Company elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at 
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed  in 
the periods in which the costs are incurred and the 
services are received, with the exception of the costs 
of issuing debt or equity securities that are recognised 
in accordance with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.
The Company determines that it has acquired a 
business when the acquired set of activities and 
assets include an input and a substantive process 
that together significantly contribute to the ability to 
create outputs.  The acquired process is considered 
substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue 
producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include 
an organised workforce with the necessary skills, 
knowledge, or experience to perform that process or 
it significantly contributes to the ability to continue 
producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce 
or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, 
or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets 
acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at their acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, 
the liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities 
representing 
present 
obligation 
and 
they 
are 
measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective 
of the fact that outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits is not probable. 
However, the following assets and liabilities acquired 
in a business combination are measured at the basis 
indicated below: 
i) 	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the 
liabilities or assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with Ind AS 12 Income Tax and Ind AS 
19 Employee Benefits respectively.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
ii) 	
Potential tax effects of temporary differences 
and carry forwards of an acquiree that exist at 
the acquisition date or arise as a result of the 
acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind 
AS 12.
iii) 	 Liabilities or equity instruments related to share 
based payment arrangements of the acquiree 
or share – based payments arrangements of the 
Company entered into to replace share-based 
payment arrangements of the acquiree are 
measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 Share-
based Payments at the acquisition date.
iv) 	 Assets (or disposal Companys) that are classified 
as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non-
current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that 
Standard. 
v) 	
Reacquired rights are measured at a value 
determined on the basis of the remaining 
contractual term of the related contract. Such 
valuation does not consider potential renewal of 
the reacquired right.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If 
the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of 
the aggregate consideration transferred, the Company 
re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of 
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed 
and reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. 
If the reassessment still results in an excess of the 
fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate 
consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised 
in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. 
However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain 
purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in 
equity as capital reserve, without routing the same 
through OCI.
p. Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent it 
relates to items directly recognised in equity or in 
other comprehensive income. 
Current income tax 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income for the year and any 
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect 
of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects 
the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be 
paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if 
any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax 
rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset 
only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise 
the assets and settle the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried 
forward tax losses and tax credits (if any). Deferred tax 
is not recognised for:
- 	
temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and that 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss at the time of transaction
- 	
temporary differences related to investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, when the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which they can be used. The existence of 
unused tax losses is strong evidence that future 
taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case 
of a history of recent losses, the Group recognises 
a deferred tax asset only to the extent that it has 
sufficient taxable temporary differences or there 
is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available against which such deferred tax 
asset can be realised. Deferred tax assets recognised 
or unrecognised are reviewed at each reporting date 
and are recognised/reduced to the extent that it is 
probable/no longer probable respectively that the 
related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. The measurement of deferred 
tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Group expects, at 
the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend

to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net 
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised 
simultaneously.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside 
profit or loss is recognised in other comprehensive 
income (OCI) or directly in equity. Deferred tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
q. Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if it 
is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily 
through sale rather than through continuing use. 
Such assets are generally measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
Losses on initial classification as held for sale and 
subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are 
recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are 
presented separately from the other assets in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The liabilities classified 
as held for sale are presented separately from other 
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity 
that has been disposed of or is classified as held for 
sale and that represents a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of operations, is part 
of a single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line 
of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results 
of discontinued operations are presented separately 
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations 
and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the 
measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the 
disposal of the assets constituting the discontinued 
operation shall be disclosed separately as a single 
amount in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
An analysis of the single amount into the revenue, 
expenses and pre-tax profit or loss of discontinued 
operations, the related income tax expense as required 
by Ind AS 12 and the gain or loss recognised on the 
measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the 
disposal of the assets constituting the discontinued 
operation along with the related income tax expense 
thereon as required by Ind AS 12 may be presented in 
the notes or in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
r. Provisions (other than for employee 
benefits) and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised when there is a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
The expenses relating to a provision is presented in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss net of 
any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance 
cost.
A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the 
present value of the lower of the expected cost of 
terminating the contract and the expected net cost 
of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is 
established, the Group recognises any impairment 
loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may, but will probably not, require an outflow of 
resources. When there is a possible obligation or a 
present obligation in respect of which the likelihood 
of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
A contingent asset is not recognised but disclosed in 
the Group financial statements where an inflow of 
economic benefit is probable.
Provisions, contingent assets, contingent liabilities and 
commitments are reviewed at each reporting date.
s. Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group 
that engages in business activities from which it 
may earn revenues and incur expenses (including 
revenues and expenses relating to transactions with 
other components of the Group), whose operating 
results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief 
operating decision maker to make decisions about 
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess 
its performance, and for which discrete financial 
information is available. Operating segments of the 
Group are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker.
t. Cash dividend
The Group recognises a liability to make cash 
distributions to equity holders when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 March 2025
discretion of the Group. As per the corporate laws in 
India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved 
by the shareholders (in the case of interim dividend 
it is approved by Board of Directors. A corresponding 
amount is recognised directly in equity.
u. Recent pronouncement on Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS)
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 
31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance 
Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, 
relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable 
to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Company has 
reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its 
evaluation has determined that it does not have any 
significant impact in its financial statements.

Impairment testing for goodwill:
For the purpose of impairment testing, entire goodwill is allocated to the health benefits administration and 
health management services which is considered as a cash generating unit (CGU).
The recoverable amount of the CGU is based on value in use, estimated using discounted cash flows.
The key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below. The value assigned to 
the key assumptions represents management's assessment of future trends in the relevant industries and have 
been based on historical data from both external and internal source.

* EBITDA refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The discount rate is a post-tax measure estimated based on the historical industry average weighted-average 
cost of capital.
The cash flow projections includes specific estimates for five years and a terminal growth rate thereafter. The 
terminal growth rate has been determined based on management's estimates of long-term compound annual 
EBITDA growth rate.
Budgeted EBITDA has been estimated taking into account past experience derived as follows:
(i) 	 Revenue growth has been projected taking into account the average growth rate levels experienced over 
past five years and the estimated sales volume and price growth for the next five years. It has been assumed 
that the sales price would increase in line with forecast inflation over the next five years. 
(ii) 	 Based on the assessment, the Group determined that the estimated recoverable value of the CGU is higher 
than its carrying cost and consequently, the Group has not recorded any impairment loss following the 
guidance under Ind AS 36 “Impairment of Assets”.

Nature and purpose of reserves
(i) Employee stock option reserve
Equity stock option reserve is used to recognise the 
grant date fair value of equity settled share based 
payments provided to the employees. For further 
details refer Note 31 for Employee stock option 
schemes. 
(ii) Securities premium
Securities premium is used to record premium 
received on issue of shares. The reserve is utilised 
in accordance with the provisions of Companies 
Act, 2013. 
(iii) General reserve
Under the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, general 
reserve was created through an annual transfer of 
net income at a specified percentage in accordance 
with applicable regulations. The purpose of these 
transfers was to ensure that if a dividend distribution 
in a given year is more than 10% of the paid-up capital 
of the Company for that year, then the total dividend 
distribution is less than the total distributable 
results for that year. Consequent to introduction of 
Companies Act 2013, the requirement to mandatorily 
transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to 
general reserve has been withdrawn. However, the 
amount previously transferred to the general reserve 
can be utilised only in accordance with the specific 
requirements of Companies Act, 2013.
(iv) Demerger deficit balance
The reserve arising on account of Demerger of 
Consumer health business division during 2019-
20 as per Sections 230 to 232 and Section 66 of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
(v) Other equity
Preference shares and debentures were initially 
recognised as financial liability in accordance with the 
nature of the instrument at fair value. The difference 
between fair value and transaction price was 
accounted under other equity.
(vi) Retained earnings
Retained earnings are the profits that the Company has 
earned till date less dividends or other distributions 
to shareholders. Retained earnings includes re-
measurement loss/(gain) on defined benefit plans, 
net of taxes that will not be reclassified to statement 
of profit and loss. Retained earnings is a free reserve 
available to the Company.
(vii) Foreign currency translation reserve 
("FCTR")
Exchange differences relating to the translation of 
the results and net assets of the Company’s foreign 
operations from their respective functional currencies 
to the Company’s functional and presentation currency 
are recognised directly in OCI and accumulated in 
the Foreign currency translation reserve. When a 
foreign operation is disposed off, the relevant amount 
recognised in FCTR is transferred to the consolidated 
profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(viii) Equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income
The Group has elected to recognise the changes in 
fair value of certain investments in equity securities 
in other comprehensive income. These changes are 
accumulated within equity instruments through OCI 
within equity. The Group transfers amount to retained 
earnings when the relevant equity securities are de-
recognised.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Notes:
(a) 	 The Payment of Bonus (Amendment) Act, 2015 
was notified by the Government of India with 
retrospective effect from 1 April 2014. The 
Honourable High Court, Karnataka based on the 
writ petition no 5272/2016 and 5311/2016, has 
vide its order dated 2 February 2016, stayed the 
operation of the said notification for the financial 
year 2014-15. The obligation to pay the bonus for 
the financial year 2014-15 will arise only if the High 
Court disposes off the writ petition in favour of 
the Government. Hence, the Company has taken 
a view and an amount of ` 6.15 million which is 
the approximate statutory bonus liability, for the 
eligible employees in respect of financial year 
2014-15, has been considered as a contingent 
liability.
(b) 	 As per Income tax assessment order, the 
Assessing Officer has disallowed u/s 40(a)(ia) 
payments made to various hospitals during the 
financial year 2007-08 and 2008-09 totalling to 
` 118.92 million and ` 964.75 million respectively 
and accordingly raised a demand of ` 29.71 
million and ` 435.25 million u/s 143(3) of the 
Income-tax Act respectively against Dedicated 
Healthcare Services TPA (India) Private Limited 
(DHS). DHS filed an appeal against these above 
Orders as the payments to hospitals made from 
the funds received from insurance companies 
were an advance and all payments were adjusted 
against the advance received. The payments were 
not claimed as an expenditure, hence, these 
cannot be disallowed under the section. The 
DHS received favourable orders from CIT(A) on 
8 August 2012, ITAT on 10 December 2014, and 
the High Court on 30 November 2015. However, 
the IT department has filed an appeal with The 
Honourable Supreme Court of India. Further, 
the subsidiary company (MATPA) had acquired 
DHS on 30 September 2016 and pursuant to the 
merger order dated 6 April 2018, DHS merged 
with the subsidiary company from the appointed 
date specified in the Scheme i.e. 1 October 2016. 
(c) 	 In the light of judgment of Honourable Supreme 
Court dated 28 February 2019 on the definition 
of “Basic Wages” under the Employees Provident 
Funds & Misc. Provisions Act, 1952 and based 
on Group’s evaluation, there are significant 
uncertainties 
and 
numerous 
interpretative 
issues relating to the judgement and hence it is 
unclear as to whether the clarified definition of 
Basic Wages would be applicable prospectively 
or retrospectively. The amount of the obligation 
therefore cannot be measured with sufficient 
reliability for past periods. The Group will evaluate 
its position and update its provision, if required, 
on receiving further clarity on the subject. The 
Group does not expect any material impact of the 
same.
(d) 	 The Company had filed a statement of claim 
before 
the 
Arbitration 
Centre, 
Bangalore 
comprising a Sole Arbitrator on 30th March 
2023 against an ex-employee of the Company 
(“Respondent”) for breach of confidentiality 
and other violations (“Arbitration Case”). The 
Respondent filed a counter claim of ` 8.50 million 
against the Company towards employee stock 
options/vesting of shares and compensation. 
Consequently, the Sole Arbitrator passed an 
order dated 29th December 2023 (“Interim Arbitral 
Order”) restraining the Company from making 
any changes or alterations in its share holding 
pattern and listing the shares of the Company 
before stock exchanges pending disposal of the 
Arbitration Case. Company filed an appeal before 
The City Civil and Sessions Court, Bangalore 
(‘Court”) seeking stay on the Interim Arbitral 
Order and also deposited ` 8.50 million as deposit 
for the appeal (“Appeal Case”). The said Arbitral 
Order was stayed by the Court pursuant to its 
order dated 05 January 2024 pending disposal 
of Appeal Case. The Arbitration Case has now 
been amicably settled between the parties and a 
final Compromise Arbitral Award dated 14 March 
2025 was passed by the Sole Arbitrator effectively 
disposing of the Arbitration Case.
	
In view of the amicable settlement of the 
Arbitration Case, the Appeal Case has also 
been disposed of pursuant to a joint memo for 
withdrawal dated 26 March 2025 filed by the 
parties before the Court and a final order dated 
26 March 2025 was passed by the Court disposing 
of the Appeal Case with a direction to refund 
` 8.50 million to the Company.
(e)	 In respect of the contingent liabilities set out 
above, pending resolution of the respective 
proceedings, it is not practicable for the Group to 
estimate the timings of cash outflows, if any.

30. Employee benefits
The Group has the following employee benefit plans:
a) Defined contribution plans:
The contributions paid/payable to Employee Provident Fund, Employees Pension Schemes, 1995 and other 
funds, are determined under the relevant approved schemes and/or statutes and are recognised as expense in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss during the year in which the employee renders the related service. 
There are no further obligations other than the contributions payable to the approved trusts/appropriate 
authorities.
The Group makes contributions, determined as a specified percentage of employees salaries, in respect of 
qualifying employees towards provident fund and employees state insurance, which are defined contribution 
plans. The Group has no obligation other than to make the specified contribution. The contributions are charged 
to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as they accrue. The amount recognised as an expense towards 
contribution to defined contribution plan of the Group for the year amounts to ` 125.63 million (31 March 2024: 
` 114.97 million).
b) Defined benefit plans:
The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan entitles an 
employee who has rendered atleast five years of continuous service to receive 15 days salary for every completed 
year of service or part thereof in excess of six months based on the rate of last drawn salary (basic plus dearness 
allowance) by the employee concerned. The Group's liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit 
Credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial gains/(losses) are recognised under other comprehensive 
income in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
The Group has considered only such changes in legislation which have been enacted up to the Balance sheet 
date for the purpose of determining defined benefit obligation
Based on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the details of the employee 
benefit obligation and the plan assets as at balance sheet date:

vi. Description of risk exposures:
Valuations are based on certain assumptions, which are dynamic in nature and vary over time. As such Group is 
exposed to various risks as follow:
a) 	 Salary Increases: actual salary increases will increase the Plan’s liability. Increase in salary increase rate 
assumption in future valuations will also increase the liability.
b) 	 Investment Risk: if plan is funded then assets liabilities mismatch and actual investment return on assets 
lower than the discount rate assumed at the last valuation date can impact the liability.
c) 	
Discount Rate: reduction in discount rate in subsequent valuations can increase the plan’s liability.
d) 	 Mortality: actual deaths & disability cases proving lower or higher than assumed in the valuation can impact 
the liabilities.
e) 	 Withdrawals: actual withdrawals proving higher or lower than assumed withdrawals and change of 
withdrawal rates at subsequent valuations can impact Plan’s liability.
31. Employee share based payment
31. (a) 2013 plan
The Company has introduced Employee Stock Option Scheme 2013 (“ESOS 2013”) with effect from October 01, 
2013 to enable the employees of the Company to participate in the future growth and success of the Company.

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
There has been no transfer between levels during the current year or the previous year.
* FVTPL - fair value through profit and loss.
** FVOCI - fair value through other comprehensive income.
# The management assessed that other current financial assets (loans to employees, security deposit etc.), 
cash and cash equivalents, bank balances, trade receivables, trade payables, borrowings, lease liabilities and 
other financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these 
instruments. 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
a) 	
The fair values of the units of mutual fund schemes are based on net asset value (NAV) at the reporting date.
b) 	 The fair values of the equity shares invested in 'The New India Assurance Co Ltd' is as per the closing market 
price at the reporting date.
c) 	
During the current financial year, management has carried out a detailed assessment on the performance 
of Healthvista India Private Limited and basis such assessment (considering the erosion of net worth, past 
losses and low likelihood of future profits) have determined the fair value of such investment to be NIL. 
Consequently, in accordance with Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, the Company has recognised fair value 
changes of ` 54.93 million in the OCI.
d) 	 The fair value of Put option liability over NCI was measured using monte-carlo simulation to capture the 
present value of the expected future value of the option liability.
e) 	 All other financial assets except mutual funds and financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost. 
Hence, there are no financial assets/liabilities classified under Level 2 and Level 3.
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

significant impact in the fair value of the financial instrument.
C. Financial risk management
Risk management framework
The Group’s management has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management 
framework.
The Group’s management monitors compliance with the risk management policies and procedures, and reviews 
the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The management is 
assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the management.

financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include investments, 
trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and security deposits that are out 
of regular business operations.
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
•	
Market risk;
•	
Credit risk; and
•	
Liquidity risk
i. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as interest rates and equity prices – will affect the 
group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management 
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
Material investments within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are 
approved by the appropriate authority.
Foreign currency risk

Strategic Review
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Equity price risk
The Group's investment in listed and unlisted equity 
securities are susceptible to market price risk 
arising from uncertainties about the future value of 
investment in these securities. The Group manages 
these price risks through strategic investments 
and placing limits on individual investments. The 
investments reports are submitted to the senior 
management and the Board reviews and approves 
these investment decisions.
Exposure in mutual funds
The Group manages the surplus funds majorly through 
investments in mutual fund schemes. The price of 
investment in these mutual fund schemes is reflected 
though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset 
Management Group on daily basis as reflected by 
the movement in the NAV of invested schemes. The 
Group is exposed to price risk on such Investments. 
The investments reports are submitted to the senior 
management and the Board reviews and approves 
these investment decisions.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group’s fixed rate fixed deposits are carried 
at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject 
to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since 
neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows 
will fluctuate because of a changes in market interest 
rates.
The Group’s borrowings are at fixed rate of interest 
and therefore any change in the base interest rate 
will not have any impact of Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if 
a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises 
principally 
from 
the 
Group's 
receivables 
from 
customers.
The carrying amount of following financial assets 
represents the maximum credit exposure:
a. Trade receivables
b. Unbilled receivables
c. Cash and bank balances
d. Other receivables
e. Other financial assets
Trade receivables and unbilled receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly 
by the individual characteristics of each customer 
and the geography in which it operates. Credit risk is 
managed through credit approvals and continuously 
monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to 
which the Group grants credit terms in the normal 
course of business.
The Group companies individually monitors the 
sanctioned credit limits as against the outstanding 
balances. Accordingly, the Group makes specific 
provisions against such trade receivables wherever 
required and monitors the same at periodic intervals.
The Group also establishes an allowance for 
impairment that represents its estimate of expected 
losses in respect of trade receivables and unbilled 
receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables and unbilled receivables was as follows:

Total 
 2,321.51 
 1,881.10 
Refer note 12(b) for movement in the allowance for expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables and 
unbilled receivables during the year.
Management assessment of recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables forms a significant part of the financial assets carried at amortised cost. The Group has 
performed detailed customer wise specific assessment of recoverability of the trade receivables and has 
accordingly recognised an impairment loss. Further, the Group is closely monitoring the developments across 
various business lines. Basis the aforesaid detailed assessment made by Management, provision made towards 
trade receivables is considered adequate.
Unbilled receivables
Unbilled receivables forms a significant part of the financial assets carried at amortised cost.  The Group has 
performed detailed customer wise specific assessment of recoverability of the unbilled receivables and has 
accordingly recognised the Impairment loss. Further, the Group is closely monitoring the developments across 
various business lines. Basis the aforesaid detailed assessment made by Management, provision made towards 
unbilled receivables is considered adequate. 
Cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances
The cash and cash equivalents and other bank balances are held with bank and financial institution counterparties 
with good credit rating.
Other receivables
These represents mainly reimbursement of expenses incurred on Govt business and receivables from self 
funded business.
Other financial assets
The Group has performed detailed party wise specific assessment of recoverability of the other financial assets 
and has accordingly recognised the impairment loss. Further, the Group is closely monitoring the developments 
across various business lines. Basis the aforesaid detailed assessment made by management, provision made 
towards other financial assets is considered adequate.
iv. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are 
due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group reputation. 
Exposure to liquidity risk

Financial Statements
The acquired business has been included in the Group's financial statements with effect from November 25, 
2022, being the date on which the Group acquired control over the business. 
The Group has elected to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value."
Under the terms of the SPA, the seller has the right to exercise a put option that would require the Company to 
purchase the seller's remaining 40% ownership interest in NCI. The terms of SPA also include a reciprocal call 
option, which would require the sellers to sell their 40% ownership interest to the Company.
Put option liability over NCI is initially recognised as a financial liability at fair value with a corresponding amount 
of ` 67.74 million in other equity. It is initially recognised under equity attributable to owners of the Company as 
the risks and rewards of the ownership of the NCI interest remain with the NCI until such time as the option is 
exercised and settled. 
The put option liability has been classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy that is measured at fair value, 
which is equal to the present value of the future estimated redemption amount. The fair value of put option 
liability as at March 31, 2023 has been determined as ` 73.36 million (Refer note 16(b)).
The acquisition was executed through a share purchase agreement for a consideration of ` 128.64 million. Under 
the agreement, there are no other forms of variable consideration/contingent consideration arrangements. 
The excess of the purchase consideration paid and the NCI measured at fair value over the fair value of assets 
acquired has been attributed to goodwill. Goodwill majorly includes the value expected from increase in revenues 
from various streams of business, addition of new customers, and estimated synergies which does not qualify 
as an Intangible asset.  
The transaction costs of ` 5.22 millions related to the acquisition have been included in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2023.
The primary reasons for the acquisition of Mayfair We Care Limited were to get access to Mayfair UK contracts 
with corporate customers and estimated synergies from the acquisition.

Explanatory Statement Pursuant to Section 102 of the Companies Act, 2013
The following statement sets out all material facts relating to the special businesses mentioned in the 
accompanying Notice of the 25th Annual General Meeting:
Item No. 3: Approval of payment of 
commission to Independent Directors of 
the Company
The Company has reported a strong annual and 
quarterly results laying the foundation for promising 
profit-led growth in the future. The Independent 
Directors constitute more than 50% of the composition 
of the Board of the Company, bringing independent 
judgment to Board deliberations. The Independent 
Directors 
have 
devoted 
considerable 
time 
to 
deliberate strategic and critical matters relevant for 
the Company. The Company has immensely benefitted 
from their significant professional expertise and rich 
experience across various functional areas.
During the previous Financial Year 2023–24, the 
Company conducted an internal benchmarking study 
on the basis of industry, size, and effective governance 
and accordingly, paid a commission of ` 8 lakhs each 
to its Independent Directors, particularly in relation to 
the successful listing of the Company.
For the year under review, the Board of Directors has 
proposed to pay the same amount of commission to 
each continuing Independent Director, taking into 
account the overall performance of the Company 
and the contributions made by them during the 
year. Further, the Board was strengthened with the 
appointment of new Independent Directors, during 
the year under review. The commission proposed 
to be paid to these newly appointed Directors is 
proportionate to the number of Board meetings 
attended by them during their respective tenures.
Accordingly, the Members of Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee, Audit Committee and the 
Board of Directors at their meetings held on May 
15, 2025, recommended the proposal for payment 
of remuneration, by way of commission, a sum 
of ` 26,80,000/- (Rupees Twenty Six Lakhs Eighty 
Thousand Only) in aggregate to the Independent 
Directors of the Company for the financial year 2024-
25 which is equivalent to 0.59 % of the net profits of 
the Company for the said financial year computed 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 198 
of the Companies Act, 2013. The payment of such 
remuneration shall be in addition to the sitting fees 
paid to the Independent Directors for attending the 
Board/ Committee meetings.
The Commission proposed to be paid to each Independent Director is as follows:

These Directors’ collective knowledge plays a vital role 
in setting the Company's strategic direction, mitigating 
risks and ensuring optimal resource utilisation. Given 
the enhanced expectations, the valuable time and 
expertise they dedicate to the affairs of the Company, 
the Board of Directors considers to be prudent and 
appropriate to remunerate the Independent Directors 
by way of commission.
The approval of Members is being sought by way of an 
Ordinary Resolution for payment of remuneration, by 
way of commission, to the Independent Directors as 
mentioned aforesaid.
None of the Promoters, Directors other than the
