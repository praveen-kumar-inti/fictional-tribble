Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Energy management represents a dual 
challenge and opportunity for the Company 
amid an evolving energy landscape.
Risk: Inefficient energy use and reliance 
on fossil fuels expose the Company to 
operational and financial vulnerabilities, 
such as fluctuating energy prices that can 
inflate production costs and threaten profit 
margins.  Stricter regulations on carbon 
emissions can pose compliance challenges, 
with potential legal penalties and damage to 
the Company’s reputation. Fluctuating energy 
prices can lead to increased production costs, 
impacting profit margins. The Company’s 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources 
could negatively impact its brand image 
among stakeholders.
Opportunity: There is a significant opportunity 
for the Company to unlock long-term value 
through a strategic approach to energy 
management. By adopting energy-efficient 
technologies and optimizing consumption 
patterns, the Company can reduce operational 
costs while improving overall performance and 
resilience. A proactive shift toward renewable 
energy sources—such as solar, wind, or 
hybrid systems—positions the Company as 
a leader in sustainable operations, aligning 
with stakeholder expectations and regulatory 
trends. This will enable the company to lower 
its carbon footprint, create competitive edge, 
and enhance the Company’s sustainability 
credentials.
Developed 
a 
comprehensive 
energy 
management 
strategy 
focused on optimizing energy 
consumption, improving efficiency, 
and reducing operational costs.
Committed 
to 
minimizing 
environmental impact by aligning 
energy practices with sustainability 
goals and regulatory expectations.
Installed solar power plants as 
a renewable energy source to 
diversify the Company’s energy 
mix and reduce dependence on 
fossil fuels.
Enhanced energy efficiency across 
operations through the adoption of 
energy-saving technologies and 
process improvements.

Opportunity
The Company views the reduction of carbon

with evolving environmental expectations 
and market demands. With sustainability 
increasingly becoming a priority in the 
manufacturing sector, the company is 
dedicated 
to 
investing 
in 
low-carbon 
technologies and eco-friendly processes.
Beyond the positive environmental impact, 
the company focuses on emission reduction 
to deliver meaningful cost savings and 
operational efficiencies. The company aims 
to adopt energy-efficient technologies, waste 
reduction initiatives, and improve operational 
efficiency, to achieve both environmental 
responsibility and long-term financial benefits.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, 
transportation, or logistics can result in 
significant losses in productivity and revenue. 
Additional factors such as market volatility, 
political instability, and natural disasters 
emphasize the need for strong and adaptable 
supply chain strategies. The company may 
suffer amplified procurement risk by relying 
heavily on a small number of suppliers or 
vendors. This could jeopardize business 
continuity, affect operational resilience and 
impact profitability.
The Company has developed 
strong, long-term relationships with 
a diverse network of suppliers and 
vendors. 
Prioritizing 
communication 
and 
regular discussions to ensure a 
seamless production process and 
timely availability of necessary 
supplies.

Risk 
Management 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
The Company may be exposed to cyber 
attacks, data breaches, and ransomware, 
which 
can 
lead 
to 
financial 
losses, 
operational disruptions, reputational damage, 
data compromise, and loss of customer 
trust. Recognizing and addressing these 
cybersecurity risks is essential to safeguarding 
operations, maintaining consumer confidence, 
and ensuring long-term business continuity.
The Company has established a 
comprehensive Risk Management 
Policy 
to 
proactively 
identify, 
assess, and mitigate a broad 
spectrum of risks. The policy 
provides a structured framework for 
effectively managing risk-related 
challenges across the organization.

been 
implemented, 
prioritizing 
the identification and resolution of 
potential cybersecurity threats.

Policy, reinforcing efforts to prevent 
incidents and minimize potential 
damage.

Water 
Management
Opportunity
Water pollution and scarcity pose significant 
operational and environmental risks. Water 
management will enable the Company to 
reduce water consumption, lower costs, and 
minimize environmental impact.
Along with optimize and efficient use of water 
resources the company can ensure alignment 
with regulatory compliance, strengthens 
its 
reputation, 
and 
enhances 
market 
competitiveness, while positioning itself for 
long-term sustainability.

Labor 
Practices and 
Human Rights
Risk
Fair labour practices, respect for human rights, 
and compliance with labour laws are essential 
to maintaining a motivated and productive 
workforce. Upholding these principles is 
crucial for avoiding legal, reputational, and 
operational risks. By prioritizing ethical labour 
practices, the Company ensures a positive 
work environment, strengthens its reputation, 
and mitigates potential risks, contributing to 
long-term business success and sustainability.
The Company has established 
clear, well-defined policies to 
prioritize and safeguard human 
rights, 
integrated 
into 
the 
Company’s Code of Conduct.
Comprehensive training is provided 
to employees, specifically focusing 
on human rights issues, ensuring 
awareness and compliance across 
all levels of the organization.

Product 
Quality and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Ensuring product safety, meeting quality 
standards, and offering transparent product 
information are critical to building consumer 
trust, maintaining brand reputation, and 
ensuring regulatory compliance. Any product 
defects or safety concerns can result in 
costly recalls, additional cost of managing 
the recalled products, legal liabilities, and 
significant damage to the brand’s reputation. 
Prioritizing these elements helps mitigate 
risks, safeguard the Company’s standing, and 
foster long-term customer loyalty.
The Company follows strict quality 
control procedures at every stage 
of production to ensure product 
consistency and safety.
The Company complies with all 
relevant safety regulations and 
industry 
standards 
to 
ensure 
products meet the highest safety 
criteria.
Products undergo thorough testing 
to identify potential issues and 
ensure they meet quality and safety 
requirements before reaching the 
market.
The Company provides clear, 
honest 
product 
information, 
ensuring consumers are fully 
informed about product safety and 
quality.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste:
	
Jai Corp Limited places a strong emphasis on sustainability and responsible waste management across its 
operations. While the Company does not yet have a formal process for reclaiming its products for reuse, 
recycling, or disposal at the end of their life Cycle, it is committed to minimizing environmental impact through 
strategic partnerships with authorized vendors who specialize in recycling and waste disposal services.
	
a.	
Plastics: The process follows segregating 
plastic waste based on type and ensuring 
proper collection and storage. The Company 
strives towards developing and enhancing its 
recycling capabilities ultimately transforming 
collected plastic waste into valuable resources 
for reuse. This helps the Company to reduce 
the overall consumption of virgin plastic for 
product development. Currently, Jai Corp 
Limited is exploring innovative strategies 
to reduce plastic packaging, encouraging 
the adoption of recycled materials and 
participating in circular economy initiatives. 
	
b.	
E-waste: 
The 
Company 
follows 
strict 
protocols for the collection, storage, and 
transportation 
of 
e-waste, 
ensuring 
all 
items are handled in an environmentally 
responsible manner to completely commit to 
the sustainable management of electronic 
waste (e-waste) at the end of its product life 
cycle. Through collaboration with certified 
e-waste recyclers who use eco-friendly 
techniques, the company ensures the safe 
recovery of valuable components and the 
proper management of hazardous substances 
in e-waste. The company maintains full 
Compliance with all relevant regulations to 
guarantee the responsible disposal, recovery 
of valuable resources, and recycling of 
electronic products. 
	
c.	
Hazardous 
Waste: 
A 
well-structured 
comprehensive 
procedure 
for 
managing 
hazardous 
waste 
generated 
during 
its 
manufacturing processes is established by 
the Company. These procedures include 
identifying, 
segregating, 
and 
storing 
hazardous materials in designated containers 
to ensure safety. The Company works 
with licensed waste management vendors 
who handle the collection, transportation, 
treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste in 
strict compliance with safety regulations and 
legal requirements. These trusted vendors 
employ approved methods to minimize 
environmental impact while ensuring the safe 
disposal of hazardous substances.
	
d.	
Other Waste: Beyond plastics, e-waste, and 
hazardous materials, the Company takes a 
holistic approach to waste reduction across 
all aspects of its operations. The Company 
continuously develops strategies to optimize 
processes, 
improve 
resource 
efficiency, 
and minimize overall waste generation. By 
actively implementing waste segregation and 
recycling practices wherever possible, the 
Company ensures that non-hazardous waste 
is properly sorted, collected, and disposed of 
in accordance with relevant regulations. 
	
	
As an additional measure, the Company 
responsibly disposes of surplus materials by 
auctioning non-hazardous waste through the 
MSTC (Metal Scrap Trade Corporation) portal 
to authorized government agencies. 
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities 
(Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection 
plan is in line with the Extended Producer 
Responsibility 
(EPR) 
plan 
submitted 
to 
Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps 
taken to address the same.
	
Although the Company’s activities fall under 
the scope of Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR), it sells its plastic packaging products to 
registered vendors who act as brand owners 
and have formally assumed the EPR obligations; 
therefore, the Company does not bear any direct 
obligation for managing plastic waste under the 
EPR framework.
