1
Digitalization
Opportunity
Digitalization has played an important role in 
shaping the music industry. The digitization 
development led to a continuously declining 
sale of music in physical formats and to 
vanish of numerous record stores. Music 
streaming, downloads, Internet radios and 
other subscription-based music services 
have become an important channel for the 
distribution of music. Digital technologies 
and processes have changed the landscape 
within the music industry by altering ways 
in which revenue is generated.

Artificial 
Intelligence 
(AI)
Opportunity 
and Risk
AI-generated music can be both a boon and 
a bane for the music industry. On one side, 
it opens up new avenues for creativity and 
democratizes music production, while on 
the other, it brings forth challenges related 
to copyright, royalties, and the value of 
human-created recorded music.

strengthen 
copyright 
protection and adapt legal 
frameworks to address the 
challenges posed by AI-
generated music.

Unauthorised use of copyrighted works
We have a dedicated team

The risk of non-compliance
