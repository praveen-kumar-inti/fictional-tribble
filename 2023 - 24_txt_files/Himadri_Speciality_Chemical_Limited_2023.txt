Preface
As one of the largest speciality chemical companies 
in India and Asia, Himadri recognizes its role in setting 
industry benchmarks. We are dedicated to deliver the 
best-in-class performance, in all aspects of sustainability 
and we take full responsibility for our actions, being 
accountable to all our stakeholders.
At Himadri, we recognize that our comprehensive 
sustainability framework presents us with an opportunity 
to pioneer innovative solutions and forge a harmonious 
relationship with our society and planet. It urges us to 
progress sustainably, preserving vital resources for future 
generations. As a responsible corporate entity, we believe 
in maintaining a balance between business development 
and environmental preservation, recognizing that human 
well-being and prosperity are intricately linked with the 
health of our planet. Our aim is to cultivate a sustainable 
future, where our people, communities and ecosystems 
will thrive in harmony.
As we embark on our sustainability journey, we understand 
that our commitment goes beyond responsible actions 
and involves identifying and seizing opportunities. Many of 
the challenges that our customers face are sustainability-
related and our ability to innovate and develop 
tailor-made product to meet these challenges is crucial. 
By preserving resources throughout our value chain and 
embracing the circular economy, we create continuous 
value and ensure our business is future-ready.
Through 
innovative 
chemistry 
and 
cutting-edge 
technology, we aim to positively impact the various 
aspects of our daily lives in a sustainable manner. Our 
sustainability goals unite us and drive us to deliver the 
best for our employees, customers, stakeholders and the 
planet as a whole.
Sustainability is not just a policy for us; it's a set of 
foundational principles that guides us to conduct our 
business and operations every day. At Himadri, our 
business is aligned with the current global priorities and 
direction. This alignment validates the principles that drive 
our business practices, highlighting our full commitment 
to 
ethical, 
progressive 
conduct, 
and 
responsible 
management. To turn this policy into action. In 2023 
Himadri made a significant commitment by endorsing 
and becoming a global signatory of the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC). Since then, we have started to 
align our initiatives to promote the timeless principles of 
the UNGC which include Human Rights, Labor Standards, 
Environmental stewardship, and Anti-Corruption.
As a leader in the speciality chemical sector, Himadri 
focuses its sustainability efforts on Planet, People, 
Communities and Governance. Throughout our journey, 
we continuously innovate and strive to enhance our 
ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives, 
supported by our management and dedicated workforce. 
These efforts have enabled Himadri to gain global 
recognition from EcoVadis, a third-party assessor of 
ESG performance. In our inaugural EcoVadis submission, 
Himadri proudly secured a silver medal, positioning 
itself amongst the Top 23% of the organizations 
assessed by EcoVadis.
As an environmentally conscious organization, Himadri 
has developed its business model around recycling 
and upcycling. The raw materials that are used for 
our production are basically by-products of steel and 
petrochemical sectors. Through innovative techniques 
and integrated systems, Himadri transforms these by-
products into value-added products. Furthermore, we 
utilize by-products from our own production processes 
and extract value from them. For example, waste gas from 
carbon black production is used to generate electricity. 
We not only power our operations with this electricity 
but also export it to the grid, achieving a zero emission 
under Scope 2 category. From the business model level, 
we strive to further 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(UNSDGs). As a responsible corporate citizen, Himadri 
has established a structured organizational framework 
to actively pursue the attainment of Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
At entity level we have fully adopted SEBI mandated 
BRSR 
(Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Reporting) Framework as well in all layers of value chain 
as relevant setting key objectives for short & long-term 
with comprehensive action plan with defined timeline.

Value Creation through Captive Power Plant 
and Lowering GHG Emission
At Himadri, we have installed a power plant of 28 MW 
capacity which is completely meeting our power 
requirement to operate. This captive power plant runs to 
utilise waste gas temperature. By implementing a process 
that circulates and feeds off-gas into power generation, 
we have significantly contributed towards evading 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.
Fuel Switch to Achieve Higher Energy Efficiency 
and Lower Carbon Emission Intensity
At Himadri, we have successfully implemented a 
high-performance multifunctional fuel additive across 
our reduction processes. This specially formulated 
fuel additive can be dissolved in aromatic solvents 
and is readily soluble in fuel oil. It facilitates the rapid 
oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons during heavy fuel oil 
combustion, effectively addressing GHG emissions as 
well as air emissions by reducing carbon deposits, soot, 
and particulate matter.
Benefits:
 
 
No imported power requirement
 
 
Exported 80,523  MWH electricity to state grid in 
the last financial year
 
 
Effectively reduced consumption of conventionally 
produced electricity and  GHG emission
Benefits:
 
 
Enhanced fuel efficiency due to accelerated 
oil combustion
 
 
Considerable reduction in soot formation
 
 
Reduced air emission
 
 
It is cost effective as 4% of the fuel got saved.
 
 
4.7% carbon emission (per ton production) 
got reduced.
 
 
Heat transfer efficiency has improved, leading to 
reduced heat loss though heat transfer surfaces
Reduction of Water Consumption using Efficient 
Equipment and Technology
At Himadri, we have implemented an efficient condensate 
recovery system, which enables operation to recover 60% 
of the low-pressure (LP) steam used in all equipment, 
line tracing and coils. Through an efficient vapour trap 
system, we condense water from LP vapour, effectively 
reducing our groundwater usage.
During the current reporting year, we have increased Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant’s capacity. The recovered 
water will be utilized in domestic usages which will 
further reduce dependency on freshwater. Additionally, 
our management has included water consumption in KPIs 
for monthly review.
Benefits:
 
 
The 
power 
factor 
improved 
significantly 
from 0.94 to 0.99
 
 
Current distortion reduced from 4.4% to 3.3%
 
 
The input KVA also experienced a significant 
reduction, dropping from 1311 to 1191 KVA, which 
meant a direct reduction of 120KVA
 
 
It is saving the annual energy by approximately 
9,50,400 
KVAH 
(approximately 
considering 
330 working days.
Value creation through equipment upgradation: 
Harmonic Filter
The LT feeders of the plant were consuming high levels 
of voltage and current, mainly due to the significant 
impact of LT motors. After a thorough understanding 
of the problems, the objectives were set to address the 
issues effectively. The primary goals were to reduce input 
current harmonics to less than 5% and improve the power 
factor from 0.75 to a desirable 0.98. To achieve these 
goals, an active harmonic filter (AHF) with a closed-loop 
active filter was introduced as a potential solution.
goes beyond energy conservation at Himadri. We proactively minimize resource consumption and promote a 
circular economy through both the ends of our supply chain, encompassing both upstream and downstream 
activities. These initiatives specifically target the reduction of resource consumption and wastages.

contribute towards a more sustainable future for all.

As part of our commitment to decarbonisation, Himadri 
is actively addressing scope 3 emissions within our 
supply chain. We are employing a dual approach, using 
both activity-based data and spend data, to map our 
scope 3 emissions in detail. This will help us to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of how our suppliers’ 
greenhouse gas emissions impact our environmental 
performance, while aligning with our net-zero target.
To guide these efforts, we are conducting hotspot 
analysis and developing strategic roadmaps. This 
two-pronged approach allows us to prioritize and focus on 
achieving our net-zero ambition effectively. We recognize 
that certain categories within scope 3 emissions will 
require specific attention and we will strategically shift 
from using spend data to activity-based data where 
necessary. This transition will enable us to create key 
Business Value Chain
we prioritize leveraging our influence and partnering with 
our value chain partners. We actively engage with our 
customers to collaborate on developing products that 
offer sustainability benefits, such as increased durability 
and energy efficiency. Additionally, we support and 
collaborate with our suppliers to help them improve their 
sustainability performance continuously. Our ability to 
enhance the overall impact of our value chain relies on 
our close collaboration with our customers and suppliers. 
Together, we seek innovative solutions to enhance our 
collective sustainability performance and address today's 
key sustainability challenges.

Creating Customers’ Value by New Products
Himadri offers a wide range of clean blacks under the 
brand name of KLAREX series, specially designed for 
industrial rubber products.  These blacks are very clean 
in terms of sieve residue, ash content and other chemical 
impurities, which reduces the extrusion based chocking; 
thereby increasing productivity and reducing scrap 
generation by producing blemish free smooth surface 
extrudate tapes. This has a direct impact on enhanced 
product quality, higher productivity and less power usage.
Himadri has a wide range of very clean JETEX blacks 
which are used  primarily in Films & general plastics and 
pressure pipe application. These blacks offer very good 
UV protection, thereby increasing the life of pressure pipe 
impacting the environment positively. Thin films made 
with these grades offer good mechanical properties 
enhancing lifetime and reducing plastic scrap generation 
& less power consumption.
Himadri also have ELECTRA series which helps to reduce 
volume and surface resistivity while incorporating 
polymer matrix. Generally, ELECTRA series is used for 
154
Annexure IX
of the Board’s Report (Contd.)
cable, ESD, antistatic and battery applications. A high 
conductive speciality carbon black ELECTRA 295 has 
been developed which provides better conductivity at 
lower carbon black loading. It requires lower amount of 
polymer for cleaning purpose which reduces polymer 
wastage and power consumption.
Basically, lowering polymer wastage, scrap generation & 
power consumption indirectly reduces carbon emission 
and positively impact on the environment.
Robust Corporate Governance
At Himadri, we uphold highest standards of ethical 
business practices, which form the foundation of the 
values we deliver to our stakeholders. Our commitment 
to sustainability is guided by our core values of integrity, 
respect, and responsibility. Our governance framework 
is based on the timeless principles of the UN Global 
Compact and is supported by a set of compliance and 
accountability policies and practices.
Himadri serves as a beacon of ethical corporate 
governance, promoting innovation and sustainable 
growth. Rooted in trust, our unwavering commitment 
to the highest standards of integrity has earned the 
confidence of stakeholders, attracting capital and top-tier 
talent. Upholding the values of Integrity, Commitment, 
Passion, 
Seamlessness,

we 
prioritize 
excellence in governance. Our diverse Board, consisting 
of both Executive and Independent Directors, provides 
comprehensive guidance, aligning resource utilization 
with our vision. A robust governance and compliance 
culture ensures adherence to regulations, strengthens 
relationships, fosters trust, and sustains our organization 
for the long term.
Our key deliverables in these perspectives are:
 
 
Promoting anti-bribery and anti-corruption culture
 
 
Maximizing data security and transparency
 
 
Establishing ourselves as the industry standard for 
ethical business conduct
Promoting Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Culture
As the purveyor of highest standard of business 
ethics, Himadri expects all employees, suppliers, and 
customers to conduct business in accordance with the 
highest ethical standards and in full compliance with all 
applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. To reinforce 
this expectation, we have developed detailed policies, 
compliance procedures, and training programs. All 
employees are required to undergo annual training on 
all the mandatory topics which include Anti-Bribery and 
Anti-Corruption among many others.
Furthermore, we see both an opportunity and a 
responsibility to make a positive impact on the upholding 
of timeless principle of UN Global Compact within 
our direct supply chain. We require our suppliers to 
underscore our commitment to respecting ethical 
business conduct. As outlined in our Code of Conduct, 
suppliers must adhere to our Business Ethics, which 
in some instances sets higher standards than those 
mandated by laws of the land.
Maximizing Data Security and Transparency
The digitization of global economy is highlighting the 
significance of data ethics, as our customers depend on 
partners with the highest ethical standards. Our goal is 
to be a trusted entity that safeguards and respects the 
data of our customers, business partners, and employees. 
Himadri’s data ethics strategy strikes a balance between 
seizing opportunities and managing risks. We aim to 
develop innovative products for our customers while 
ensuring compliance and ethical practices. Additionally, 
we leverage technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to 
advance our decarbonisation ambitions.
The rapid advancement of AI represents a defining moment 
for us being guided by our data ethics principles: Respect, 
Security, Transparency, and Innovation. We are enhancing 
our existing governance framework by automating 
preventive 
controls, 
embedding 
risk 
management 
institutionally, and exploring governance technologies in 
anticipation of AI regulation. Our governance practices 
are already being applied in generative AI tools that 
support Operation and our People function. During the 
current reporting year, Himadri has earned ISO 27001 
certification which underscores our robust practices 
involving cyber security.

compliance program that assists us to promote 
sustainable 
business 
and 
equal 
opportunities

not aligned with our purpose, core values and internal 
governance structure on business ethics.

of business operations. It clearly articulates Himadri's 
expectations regarding various risk areas, including fare 
competition, international trade laws, conflicts of interest, 
gifts and entertainment, proper use of social media,

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Our Sustainability initiative focuses on addressing our most significant sustainability challenges and opportunities. 
We use an ongoing double materiality methodology, based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standard 
(ESRS) to determine these issues. This methodology prioritizes issues based on their impact on the environment, 
society and  Himadri’s business, creating financial risks and opportunities.
	
Our materiality assessment is integrated into our risk management processes, which consider both immediate 
risks and long-term macro trends. These trends include the electrification of light vehicles, increasing demand for

in the workplace, 
recognizing that 
any lapses in 
these areas could 
have serious 
consequences.
At Himadri, we 
maintain strict 
adherence to 
health and safety 
protocols across 
all our plants and 
office locations. Our 
commitment to safety 
is demonstrated by 
our ISO 45001:2018 
certification. We 
regularly conduct 
health and safety 
training for employees 
and workers, 
supplemented by 
periodic audits and 
surprise checks to 
ensure full compliance 
with all protocols.
While an accident 
may cause damage 
to reputation and 
incite potential 
legal actions by 
local authority, 
practicing / 
delivering best 
in class HSE 
performance has 
created positive 
differences to all 
direct and indirect 
stakeholders of the 
company. It has

GHG Emissions/ 
Energy 
Management
Risk/Opportunity
By recognizing the 
adverse impact of 
GHG emissions on 
the global climate, 
we acknowledge 
this as a shared 
risk as well as 
an opportunity. 
As a corporate 
entity, we are fully 
committed to 
making  a positive 
contribution in this 
regard.
Himadri diligently 
monitors its Scope 
1 and 2 emissions, 
striving to enhance 
energy efficiency. 
The company is 
actively evaluating 
its emissions and has 
established short-
term and long-term 
plans with defined 
objectives to improve 
energy intensity and 
reduce its carbon 
footprint.
Additionally, we have 
initiated evaluating 
our Scope 3 or value 
chain emissions 
which impacts our 
business activities. 
Subsequently, we 
will engage with 
relevant stakeholders 
to mitigate Scope 3 
emission.
There is an 
immense positive 
impact of reducing 
GHG emissions, 
improving energy 
efficiency and air 
quality, eventually 
contributing to 
climate control 
initiatives.

Water 
Management
Opportunity
Several processes 
in our operations 
require water. 
Recognizing the 
significance of this 
finite resource, 
we are committed 
to reducing  
freshwater usage 
and optimizing  
our operations.
Himadri has 
strategically 
implemented Zero 
Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) to effectively 
manage water 
consumption, 
treatment, and 
recycling for internal 
use. This initiative 
aims to continuously 
improve our water 
consumption intensity.
Going beyond 
commitments, we are 
currently expanding 
our ZLD plant’s 
capacity to increase 
water recyclability 
and reusability.
There are many 
positive financial 
/ non-financial 
implications 
from reduction 
in freshwater 
consumption 
considering quality

All have been met
Our ISO certification is a proof that we comply with a global 
management standard. It shows our key stakeholders that 
we have a well-run business that has a structure, is stable 
and ready for growth – this helps an applying for finance 
from banks, impressing potential investors, or eventually 
selling. To achieve ISO Certification, we have to prove that 
our business meets the requirements of the standard.
ISO certification is an internationally recognized standard 
that proves our company meets rigorous quality 
management requirements. Here are just a few of the 
benefits of pursuing this distinction:
Improved Business Process Efficiency
ISO accreditation is an excellent way for companies 
to improve their business objectives, processes, and 
procedures. When our processes and procedures are 
certified to meet ISO standards, it becomes easier for our 
employees to work together effectively and efficiently. 
Sustainability
ISO standards help businesses to show that they care 
about their environmental impact by proving their 
commitment to deal with environmental challenges by 
assisting them to look at how much resources are being 
used, energy spent, or any other type of impact on our 
planet’s natural systems. Through these environmental 
goals like efficient product lifecycles and sustainable 
use of natural resources, businesses can improve 
reputation & benefits.
Reduced Expenses
ISO certification is a great way to reduce expenses, which 
helps us to earn higher profits. When we improve  our 
financial performance, we save on expenditures, reducing 
waste within our business. Reduced expenses also 
correlate to distribution & delivery, strict packing. Strict 
packing and shipping standards for businesses & ensure 
undamaged delivery and greater customer satisfaction.

Annual Report 2023-24
Annexure IX
of the Board’s Report (Contd.)
Improved Communication and Corporate Culture
Our 
employees 
will 
better 
understand 
their 
job 
requirements and quality objectives with an effective 
management system. The ISO 9000 family is a set of 
international quality management standards that have 
been proven to improve business efficiency and provide 
organizations with the tools they need for success. 
These tools also guide to accomplish strategic goals 
while delivering continual Improvement feedback on 
performance if maintained. 
Innovation
ISO 
standards 
help 
to 
commercialize 
emerging 
technologies and benefit any organization by establishing 
what makes one product different from another. The 
benefits include demonstrating our company’s credibility 
with customers, employees, or other stakeholders 
through the products/services we provide for them. 
Risk reduction
ISO standards provide a way to prepare our organization 
for any risks and turn them into opportunities. When 
problems arise, we will be better equipped because these 
standards ensure success in managing or mitigating those 
situations, so that they don’t become disasters.
Increased Confidence from Customers
Another benefit of being ISO certified is proving to our 
customers that we are a reliable and reputed company. 
Customers look for companies they can trust and being 
ISO certified is a validated way to demonstrate our 
commitment to product and process quality. For example, 
the ISO 9001 standard is based on practical quality 
management principles and customer requirements that 
show that we constantly working to improve customer 
experiences with the products and services they receive 
from our business. 
During the current reporting year,	 we have achieved an 
array of ISO certifications. The details are described below - 
ISO 9001 : 2015 certification (Quality)
This is the basis for most management systems. 
Consequently, its main benefits have been identified 
with the general benefits referred to earlier.  It’ll also 
help us to continually assess and improve what we do 
and result in fewer returned products and complaints 
about our services.
ISO 14001 : 2015 certification (Environment)
This Is a systematic way to discover and control the 
effects of our company on the environment.  It’ll help us 
to detect ways to minimize waste and dispose it more 
effectively as well as learning how to use energy more 
efficiently.  ISO 14001 verifies that our current policies 
and practices comply with current legislation and makes 
insurance cover more accessible.
ISO 20400 (Sustainable procurement) certification
ISO 20400:2017 provides guidance to organizations, 
independent of their activity or size, on integrating 
sustainability indicators within procurement policies. It 
is intended for stakeholders involved in, or impacted by, 
procurement decisions and processes.
ISO 26000 : 2010 standard (Social responsibility)
ISO 26000 emphasizes stakeholder engagement and 
compliance with international norms, fostering a holistic 
approach to sustainable development. It encourages 
organizations 
to 
integrate 
responsible 
behaviour 
throughout their operations and relationships, promoting 
long-term societal and environmental well-being.
ISO 27001 : 2013 certification (Information Security)
Demonstrates that we’ve addressed, implemented and 
controlled the security of all the important information 
that we need to run our business.  It’ll help us to safeguard 
our valuable data and intellectual property and avoid 
the financial penalties and losses associated with data 
breaches.   This provides comfort to our customers, 
employees, trading partners and stakeholders – in the 
knowledge that our management information and 
systems are secure.
ISO-37001 : 2016 (Anti-bribery)
Protection of the organization’s assets, shareholders and 
management from the adverse effects of bribery and 
corruption is another benefit associated with the ISO 
anti-bribery management system. Often, the negative 
effects of corruption are economic in nature.
ISO 45001 : 2018 certification (Health & Safety)
Provides guideline to meet the requirements of Health 
& Safety legislation.  The setting of targets through a 
Health and Safety policy, together with the ongoing 
measurement against it, also ensures a process of 
continual improvement.  Downtime due to incidents and 
ill health will be reduced.
ISO 50001 : 2018 certification (Energy management)
ISO 50001 identifies the risk and opportunity associated 
with energy consumption. The certification process also 
shares areas of significant energy use and opportunities 
for improvement, by providing a better understanding of 
the energy profile of our organization.
SA8000 (Social accountability) (Stage 2 Completed)
It measures the performance of companies in eight 
areas which are important for social accountability in the 
workplace: child labour, forced labour, health and safety, 
free association and collective bargaining, discrimination, 
disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation.

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? - Yes
	
	
Sustainability is the one of key fundamentals 
upon which Himadri has operated since its 
inception. Our raw materials are derived from 
the by-products of other industries such as 
steel and petro-chemical. However, due to novel 
development and increasing market demand 
of our products we seldom source few virgin 
materials for our production processes. But 
the percentage contribution of these materials 
is nearly trivial when compared to non-virgin 
materials. Our robust supply chain model 
ensures that all the sourced materials should 
have minimal detrimental effect on natural and 
societal resources. In lieu with our commitment, 
we have already designed and deployed “Model 
Code of Conduct for Value Chain Partners” 
and 
“Sustainable 
Procurement 
Policy”. 
Both the policies are non-negotiable during 
implementation. From Himadri's perspective, 
sustainable procurement is not just a practice; 
it's a commitment to responsible sourcing 
that considers the environmental, social, and 
economic impacts of our supply chain. Our 
approach to sustainable procurement is rooted 
in our core values, where we strive to minimize 
negative impacts on the environment, support 
local communities, and promote ethical business 
practices. Through sustainable procurement, 
we aim to drive positive change and contribute 
to a more sustainable future for all. 
	
	
Going 
ahead, 
our 
goal 
is 
to 
develop 
comprehensive strategies for implementing 
and optimizing sustainability practices within 
the supply chain. We will also actively engage 
in collaborative initiatives with our suppliers to 
promote the adoption of sustainable practices 
and products throughout the supply chain. 
Our commitment will extend to strengthen 
our suppliers’ capabilities, providing training 
and awareness on sustainable practices, and 
emphasizing their pivotal role in reducing 
carbon emissions.
	
	
Details of our policies concerning sustainable 
sourcing are available on our website.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?
	
	
More than 95% of inputs were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and 
(d) other waste.
	
As Himadri supplies its products as intermediary raw 
materials to businesses for manufacturing their end 
products, our products cannot be reclaimed from the 
customers. However, the company is in the process 
of taking a project to reclaim carbon black from used 
tyres and introducing the same in our value chain.
	
Additionally, we are committed to researching 
and developing sustainable packaging options 
that are suitable for our product to support our 
sustainability goals.

We are dedicated to advancing our environmental protection initiatives. To turn our commitment into action, we 
are in a process of setting up a project to create and apply a re-usable packaging solution that could remove 
plastics and wood from our packaging . Guided by the UNSDGs, which serve as a fundamental framework for our 
daily operations, we aim to promote “Responsible Consumption” and a circular economy within our operations 
and throughout our value chain. Consequently, we are exploring various alternative materials to replace plastic 
packaging. Additionally, in alignment with our net-zero roadmap, we aim to eradicate the use of virgin plastic from 
our operations.

Overall, prioritizing employee well-being not only enhances individual satisfaction and retention but also 
contributes to the overall success and sustainability of the organization
	
	
We recognize that ensuring the well-being of our employees goes beyond the provision of safe working 
conditions and the prevention of occupational diseases. In line with our organizational principles, employee, 
workers and in few instances family members of staff are provided with routine health checks, and additional 
mental health and well-being support.
	
	
At Himadri, we consider the well-being of employees within an organisation is crucial for both individual 
satisfaction and overall productivity. Here are several key aspects that contribute to employee well-being and 
our actions towards each activity.
Physical Health: 
Himadri promotes a healthy work 
environment by offering ergonomic 
workstations, encouraging regular 
breaks, and providing access to 
wellness programs. Additionally, we 
provide quality food in our canteens.
Mental Health: 
Mental well-being is equally important. Himadri fosters 
a supportive culture where employees feel comfortable 
discussing mental health concerns. Providing access 
to counselling services, promoting work-life balance, 
and offering stress management workshops can help 
employees cope with workplace stressors.
Work-Life Balance: 
Encouraging work-life 
balance is essential for 
preventing burnout and 
maintaining overall well-
being. Flexible work 
arrangements, such as 
remote work options or 
flexible scheduling, can 
empower employees to 
manage their personal and 
professional responsibilities 
more effectively.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
worker? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
	
At Himadri, we believe that implementing an effective grievance redressal mechanism is essential for addressing 
employee concerns and maintaining a positive work environment. Here are some key steps that Himadri has taken 
to establish such a mechanism.
	
Policy development: We have a strong policy to address all sorts of  grievances we get from  various stake holders.
	
We have multiple channels to report the grievances like, online portal, one-point contact to HR representative, 
anonymous Hot line, etc. We understand, offering various reporting options ensures that employees can choose 
the method they feel most comfortable with.
	
Our policy clearly speaks about the time bounding closure of the grievances and we maintain utmost confidentiality 
on whereabouts of the employee.
	
We have trained and experienced HR Professional who investigates the grievances and depending upon the 
weightage of grievances, we have a committee to take care of the Grievances.
	
We maintain detailed records of all grievances reported, including the nature of the grievance, steps taken to 
investigate, and the outcome of the resolution process. This helps  to track trends, identify recurring issues, and 
demonstrate compliance with legal requirements. We also use the documents to check and take steps for continual 
improvement of the mechanism.

Career Development: At Himadri, we believe in  providing 
opportunities to our internal talent pool to broaden their 
horizon which refers to the advancement or development 
of an individual’s career over time. We design and 
offer various leadership training programs, coaching & 
mentorship sessions, and other individualistic career 
development programs to boost employee morale.
	
For this, we have developed a program called Pragati.

at the right time is vital for fostering a positive work 
environment, motivate employees, improve job satisfaction, enhance performance and commitment & loyalty 
towards the organization. Regular feedback, performance evaluations, and employee recognition programs can 
help employees feel valued and motivated which results in higher productivity.

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, coverage such system?
	
	
To ensuring the health and safety of our employees, customers and stakeholders, our entity has implemented 
a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS). This system is designed to identify, 
assess and mitigate risks associated with our operations, thereby creating a safe and healthy work environment 
for everyone involved.
	
	
The implementation of our OHSMS began with a thorough assessment of our workplace hazards and risks. 
This involved identifying potential sources of harm, such as machinery, hazardous materials, ergonomic 
challenges and environmental factors. Through a systematic and comprehensive approach, we evaluated the 
likelihood and severity of all the associated risks (routine and non-routine activities), prioritizing them based 
on their potential impact (as per the high Risk Priority Number).
	
	
Following the risk assessment, we developed and implemented comprehensive Policies and Standards aimed 
at controlling and minimizing these risks. These policies and Standards cover a wide range of areas, including 
but not limited to:
Personal 
Protective Equipment
Accident and 
Incident Reporting
Lock, Tag and Try
Machine Safety

but also demonstrating our commitment to 
prioritizing the well-being of our workforce 
and the communities in which we operate. 
Health and safety are integral parts of our 
organizational values and we strive to uphold 
these principles in everything we do.

persons affected by our activities. In this year we 
have launched our Zero Accident/Incident vision 
to become a zero-accident company ensuring 
sustainability and a best-in-class organization 
for safety performance and leadership. Our 
approach is to identify, eliminate, reduce or 
control all workplace risks in order to achieve 
this  an ongoing system of training, assessment 
and improvement is in place.	
	
	
	
Our revised Policy on Health & Safety has 
strong foundation for upcoming actions to 
make Himadri best in class in terms of Health & 
Safety standards.
	
	
The Board of Directors provides invaluable 
direction and assistance to the Management 
to 
ensure 
that 
safety 
and 
sustainability 
implications are accurately included in all new 
strategic initiatives, budgets, audit activities, 
and improvement plans. They also monitor 
quarterly and monthly reports on  safety and 
health performance. 
	
	
We believe:
	
	
. 	
Good Health and Safety is  Good Business.
	
	
. 	
Safety is everybody’s responsibility.
	
	
. 	
Working safely is a condition of employment.
	
	
. 	
All work-related injuries and work-related 
ill-health are preventable 
	
	
As 
part 
of 
our 
zero 
incident/accident 
vision, we have introduced various non-
negotiable standard. 
	
	
These standards cover various aspects of 
occupational health and safety, including safe 
work 
practices, 
equipment 
requirements, 
chemical 
handling 
procedures, 
emergency 
preparedness, and ergonomic considerations. 
These standards played a critical role in 
safeguarding employee health and safety, 
reducing risks and hazards, and promoting 
a culture of safety and responsibility in all 
facets of business.
	
	
This year we introduced  a training program 
for our Leadership team. H&S Leadership 
Development Program includes a strong focus 
on the standardization of all our repetitive 
activities. It also integrates good management 
practices in the workplace, with a strong 
emphasis on developing an organization that 
enables everyone to deliver high standards in 
safety performance.
	
	
There is a continual  decrease in LTIFR (Lost 
time injury frequency rate per million man-
hours) since the launch of our programs on Zero 
Accident & Incident vision. Our current LTIFR 
is very close to one and has reduced by 48% 
from Last year.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
There are several processes which are used to 
identify work-related hazards such as:
	
	
1.	
For all routine activities, we have the 
below process in place to address the 
work-related hazards in daily activities.
	
	
a)	
Risk assessment standard
	
	
b)	
Machine Risk Assessment Standard 
	
	
Salient features of this methodology are 
	
	
•	
Process takes place in 5 steps 
	
	
•	
Involves line managers, worker and subject 
matter experts.
	
	
•	
Outcome 
of 
assessment 
are 
rated 
in 
three 
different 
categories. 
(Red, 
yellow and green)
	
	
•	
Open points in Red & yellow category are 
reviewed on a weekly basis by KMP’s and 
on a Monthly basis by ESG council.
	
	
•	
For mitigation of work-related hazards, we 
follow hierarchy of controls.
	
	
For all routine activities we have implemented 
Safe Working Instruction with an OK TO START 
procedure which were audited on weekly 
and monthly basis to identify any SIO (Safety 
Improvement Opportunity) and closure there 
off. These safety audits are carried out by all 
layer of employees in the organization.
188
Annexure IX
of the Board’s Report (Contd.)
	
	
2.	
For non-standard processes, deployment 
of permit to work (PTW) system is 
ensured considering the nature of job 
and risk involved. Risk assessment of job 
under comprehensive PTW system is an 
intrinsic process to address all the work 
related hazards.
	
	
Salient Features of PTW System:
	
	
•	
Risk checklist based approach to identify 
work related hazards.
	
	
•	
Involves only trained and authorized 
employee to carry out work.
	
	
•

report the work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, Himadri has several processes and forums 
for workers to report work-related hazards 
formally/informally. One such tool, that our 
employees use at workplace is Safety Audit 
Tool. On a weekly basis all employees of Himadri 
participate in the workplace audit and escalate 
to the concerned department for its correction. 
To ease the employees’ reporting process, we 
have launched a QR Code based reporting 
system to raise work related hazards.
Safety Audit               
	
	
All the reported work place related hazards are 
reviewed on a weekly basis by the concerned 
departments HOD and internally by the HSE 
team also. Category of the such findings are 
analyzed and focused actions are initiated 
for the critical points and ensured that 
those are closed.
	
	
Apart from all the standards in place to report 
hazards and risks workers can follow right to stop

related matters, the Company has widened the scope of the OHC to include non-occupational medical/ health 
related matters as well. After the introduction of the non-occupational health matters, several employees have 
availed these services from the OHC directly.
	
	
Apart from the regular OHC activities, we also support our employees with newly appointed Dieticians and 
therapists. Their role is to carry out surveys and support employees to recover themselves from personal or 
occupational illness.
	
	
We are having regular eye testing facility inside our factory premises for employees and workers. We also 
have a tie up with the nearest local nursing home to address all non-occupational health care as well. 
	
	
Our plant is equipped with Ambulance to address any emergency and our paramedics provide service 
24X7 for 365 days.

12.	  Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure 
a safe and healthy work place
	
The Company’s plants, facilities and equipment are 
designed based on careful consideration of statutory 
requirements, applicable Indian and International 
Standards for a healthy and safe workplace. One of 
the key focus areas is the safety of employees by 
investing in technologies and processes to avoid and 
minimize the manual interfaces with machines. 
	
An OH&S Management System Manual has been 
prepared and successfully deployed. Regular training 
is conducted for the management representatives as 
mentioned under the guidelines of ISO 45001. The 
Company has a systematic process for identification 
of work-related hazards. On a regular basis, the 
Company provides training in Health Identification 
and Risk Assessment to all concerned employees. 
The Company has a mechanism for identification of 
fire hazards, preparation of action plan for control 
system and plans to mitigate or eliminate hazards. 
	
We have also certified first aid providers at Plant 
level who are competent enough to give first aid 
treatment in case of any incident.
	
Moreover, Himadri conducts different Wellness 
Program to promote good health. Wellness programs 
includes inviting guest speakers, organizing events, 
sponsoring teams / outdoor activities, supporting

food in the canteen etc.,
	
Every business facility has an appointed health and 
safety professional, who works with management 
and all employees to review site health and 
safety, assessed training needs, and develops and 
implements safety standards. These local health

population performed routine safety audits every 
month. This generated an average of more than six 
implemented safety improvement opportunities per 
person from more than 2033 employees, resulting 
in an overall improvement in worker safety. This 
audit programme involves employees – from the Top 
Management and HSE Staffs  to  line managers and

Himadri operates a robust and comprehensive 
process for the timely reporting of incidents 
including fires, explosions and any material spill or 
other chemical releases. In our internal standards, we 
use more stringent definitions for Lost Time Injuries 
(LTIs) and ‘severe accidents’ than the definitions 
used by many regulatory bodies, and we also require 
all our manufacturing plants to report on all Medically 
Treated Injuries (MTIs),, to maintain the focus on 
safety, with investigation extended to all  Dangerous 
Occurrences and  MTIs.
	
Himadri has set an intermediate target to reach an 
LTIFR below 1.0, under pinning Himadri’s commitment 
to ensure the safety of the Group’s employees and 
the objective of zero accidents.
	
Organization does detailed investigation for any 
safety related incidents which includes accidents & 
serious dangerous occurrences. 
	
Our accident/Incident investigation (Example-LTI/
Dangerous occurrence) is done  following 8D PPS 
methodology and reports are reviewed during ESG 
Council meeting followed by circulation of safety 
alert/red stripe and lesson learnt sheet to ensure 
all the counter measures are closed along with 
horizontal deployment of learnings. In 2023-2024, 
Himadri completed 16 8D PPS projects on H&S front 
and deployed all the permanent corrective actions 
to prevent  re-occurrence.
	
We have special focus on Dangerous Occurrences/
near miss & First aid cases. We believe that solving 
all the DO’s and first aid cases ensure that it will not 
turn into a  big accident.
	
To make life easy, we made the QR code based 
Analysis tool to solve all such minor injuries and DO’s.

The Board provides the strategic oversight and 
has constituted an ESG Committee to provide 
guidance and monitor the ESG progress. The ESG 
Committee of the Board has delegated the process 
of undertaking consultations with stakeholders to 
the management. Feedback from such consultations 
is shared with the Committee and the Board.

Himadri has undertaken a comprehensive 
materiality 
assessment 
and 
stakeholder 
engagement exercise to identify Environmental, 
Social 
and 
Governance 
(ESG) 
topics 
of significance.
	
	
As a part of this exercise, Himadri along withan 
external agency, with requisite experience, 
engaged with the key internal and external 
stakeholders to understand their concerns 
and incorporate their views into materiality 
assessment, 
for 
prioritizing 
ESG 
topics 
and frameworks.
	
•	
•	
Insights gathered through stakeholder 
engagement were analysed to develop the 
materiality matrix and arrive at the final list of 
ESG focus areas. The result of this assessment 
was presented to the ESG Committee and the 
Board. The outcome is being considered for 
defining ESG objectives of the Company.
2.

support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were

business 
partners, 
community, 
employees, 
customers etc. for business and management 
updates. Himadri adopts a responsible approach 
towards its stakeholders and ensures transparency 
in its disclosures concerning business matters. We

by doing investor presentations at regular intervals 
thereby helping them to make informed decisions. 
A formal Stakeholder Engagement Process involving 
direct

detailed 
consultation 
with 
different 
stakeholder groups helps us in identifying the critical 
issues that need our immediate attention. The inputs 
received through stakeholder consultation process 
are presented to the Board Level Management 
Committee which plays a crucial role in the 
development and implementation of strategies, 
policies, and objectives related to economic, 
environmental, and social topics.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to 
the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
	
While handling complaints which form a part of the

all paperwork and information exchanged in the 
process confidential. 
	
All genuine complaints, in good faith, can be made

coercive action, dismissal, or victimization. All actual 
violations are dealt seriously on the principles of 
natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non-
retaliation, and fairness while addressing the concern.

As one of the energy audit recommendations, it was 
noted that the LT Feeders of the plant exhibited 
notably high levels of Total Voltage and Current 
Harmonic Distortion (THDV & THDI), impacting most 
LT motors due to various odd-order harmonics. This 
situation led to a significant increase in line losses. 
Furthermore, the LT Capacitors in the Automatic 
Power Factor Control Panels experienced dangerous 
harmonic resonance, occasionally causing drops in 
the power factor at the LT Power of Control Centre of 
Transformers. Measurements in Feeders and Motors 
indicated that the power factor at motor terminals 
dropped due to the harmonic effect. The issues 
caused by harmonic currents were concerning, 
resulting in overloading of neutrals, overheating of 
transformers, nuisance tripping of circuit breakers, 
and over-stressing of power factor correction 
capacitors. Additionally, there were concerns related 
to the skin effect. Harmonic voltages resulted in 
voltage distortion and zero-crossing noise, further 
complicating the situation. The effects of these 
harmonics were widespread, causing overheating 
and failure of electric motors, power factor 
correction capacitors, distribution transformers, and 
neutral conductors. It also reduced the efficiency of 
power generation, transmission, and utilization, while 
prematurely aging the electrical plant components 
and shortening their lifespan. Moreover, electronic 
equipment malfunctioned, metering equipment 
experienced 
high 
measurement 
errors, 
and 
protective equipment showed spurious operation.
	
To address these issues, the primary goals were set 
to reduce input current harmonics to less than 5% 
and improve the power factor from 0.75 to a more 
desirable 0.98. For this purpose, an active harmonic 
filter (AHF) was introduced as a potential solution. 
The AHF panel was equipped with impressive 
features, including a closed-loop active filter with 
source current sensing, harmonic attenuation of 
up to 96%, programmable selective harmonic 
elimination, and PF compensation that worked for 
both leading and lagging power factors. It enabled 
switching between PF and harmonic compensation, 
relying on IGBT-based inverters and offering the 
option for multiple paralleling. Notably, the AHF 
panel was equipped for shunt operation and had 
self-current limiting capabilities.
	
The implementation of the AHF panel, together with 
the Capacitor Bank, produced remarkable results. 
The power factor improved significantly, going 
from 0.94 to 0.999 Additionally, the input current 
distortion was impressively reduced from 4.4% 
to a mere 3.3%. The input KVA also experienced a 
significant reduction, dropping from 1311 to 1191 
KVA, which meant a direct reduction of 1311 KVA. 
Moreover, the implementation of the AHF panel and 
Capacitor Bank held the potential for substantial 
energy savings, with an estimated annual energy 
saving potential of approximately 9,50,400 KVAH, 
considering 330 working days.

internal domestic needs can be fulfilled by the processed waste water.
5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.
	
For our wastewater recycling and ZLD system, Himadri has installed a Water Recovery Plant (WRP) which is the 
final recovery part of the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Treated wastewater from ETP, DM plant backwash, RO 
plant reject water, and cooling tower blow down water are stored in our WRP feed tank. From there, the water is 
directed to a clarifier after the dosing of dolomite, polyelectrolyte, Sodium Hypochlorite, Caustic, and coagulant. 
Suspended solids accumulate and settle at the bottom of the clarifier. The TSS-free water is then forwarded to 
the clarified tank. Subsequently, the water from the clarifier tank goes through a mixed grabbles filter (MGF) to 
remove any residual TSS after the addition of Hydrochloric Acid (HCL). Following this, the TDS water is forwarded 
to an Ultrafiltration unit which separates rejected and permeated water, storing them in their respective tanks. The 
water from the permeate tank is then directed to a two-stage reverse osmosis unit (1st stage with 5 candles, 2nd 
stage with 2 candles) through a Carbon filter after dosing with HCL, sodium meta-bi-sulphate, and anti-scalant. 
The rejected water from the RO unit is stored in the Reject tank, while the permeated water is temporarily stored 
in an intermediate permeate tank. Before reaching the final permeate tank, the water passes through a De-Gasifier 
unit to remove any excess Carbon Dioxide, which might affect the pH of the water. The final permeated tank water, 
with a daily generation capacity of 300 KL, is used for cooling tower makeup, process utilization, and feeding the 
RO plant. On the other hand, the water from the final reject tank, with a daily generation capacity of 130 KL, is 
used for road washing and CBD process quenching. This effective recycling of water from wastewater significantly 
reduces the consumption of groundwater.

replaced with fresh liquid. The scrubber unit uses a packed tower where the gas enters from the bottom and the 
scrubbing liquid enters from the top, leading to absorption and condensation of vapors. To maintain the liquid 
temperature, a cooling coil with circulating water is employed. The unit follows a daily checklist, monitoring the 
level and temperature of the scrubbing liquid. If the temperature exceeds the limit, the water inlet valve is adjusted. 
Additionally, the cloud point of the liquid is tested, and if it goes beyond the specified temperature, the liquid is 
replaced. The optimal level range of the scrubbing liquid is 40% to 60%, with a temperature range of 45°C to 55°C 
and a cloud point of 35°C.
	
To control vapour emissions from light oil tanks, a nitrogen blanketing system is installed, reducing air pollution. 
The nitrogen pressure is regulated to maintain controlled pressure inside the tank. If the pressure increases, the 
tank vent actuator releases the excess pressure to the atmosphere. On the other hand, if the pressure decreases, 
the nitrogen actuator opens to introduce nitrogen and maintain the set tank pressure. The presence of nitrogen in 
the tank reduces air pollution by exhausting nitrogen first during vapour release, leading to the condensation of 
light oil vapour into liquid inside the tank.
	
The NOx Abatement Process at Himadri aims to reduce NOx emissions from the cellulose nitration reactors at 
the site. The process consists of two main components: a scrubber/absorber tower and a reaction vessel with a 
catalyst bed. The scrubber/absorber tower contacts NOx-laden fumes with water, producing nitric acid through 
absorption. Moreover, we regularly monitor POP across all our plants.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
At Himadri, we fulfill 90% of our power requirements through our 28MW capacity power plant, showcasing our 
dedication to environment preservation. To reduce waste gas and off-gas venting during carbon black production, 
we’ve implemented an innovative process that recirculates and feeds off-gas into power generation, significantly 
lowering Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Our power plant features three boilers that adequately meet the 
energy demands of our West Bengal unit, with surplus electricity being sold to the local grid. In fact, we’ve sold 
80,523 MWH of electricity to the local grid after meeting our own needs.
	
The power generation process involves three waste heat recovery water tube boilers, two with a capacity of 
40tph and one with a capacity of 75 tph. Off-gas generated during carbon black production is fed into an external 
combustor chamber. The resulting flue gas is piped to generate steam, which occurs through flue gas circulation 
206
Annexure IX
of the Board’s Report (Contd.)
on the shell side and water circulation on the tube side of a panel tube. The steam is collected in a common steam 
header and distributed to three turbines for power generation of 28MWH Capacity.
	
Our commitment to sustainability is further exemplified by our use of process emissions for power generation, reducing 
our reliance on conventionally produced electricity and showcasing our dedication to environmental stewardship.
	
Moreover, we identify that plantation drives offer a valuable opportunity to expand green spaces and promote 
environmental awareness. Himadri has initiated a significant plantation drive in collaboration with the forest, 
environment, and climate change department, aiming to enhance the green cover of the village by planting 
various tree species.
	
The plantation of 10,500 saplings this year is a remarkable achievement. The community’s active involvement in 
this initiative is truly commendable as it contributes to creating a greener environment. These trees will not only 
provide shade and clean air for future generations but also enhance the overall health of our ecosystem.
	
Additionally, we regularly organize training for internal stakeholders and awareness campaigns for the external 
stakeholders on climate change and its effects.
