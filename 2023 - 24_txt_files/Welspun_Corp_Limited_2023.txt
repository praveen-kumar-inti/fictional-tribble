Our organization has formed a dedicated Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) team committed to maintaining a safe 
and secure workplace. This team is essential in actively detecting potential risks and hazards related to safety within 
our company. Through consistent assessments, inspections, and evaluations, they pinpoint critical areas and swiftly 
implement corrective actions. Collaborating closely with different departments and staff across the organization, the EHS 
team collects insights and feedback on safety matters. They scrutinize data, perform risk analyses, and devise strategic 
plans to reduce risks and bolster safety initiatives. Moreover, they offer guidance and training to staff on safety best 
practices, protocols, and correct usage of protective gear. The EHS team also keeps track of pertinent laws, industry 
benchmarks, and novel safety techniques to ensure compliance and integration of the most effective safety protocols. 
Their contribution is crucial in fostering a culture that prioritizes safety and encourages a working environment where 
everyone feels secure, valued, and confident in voicing safety concerns.

Independent Assurance Statement to Welspun Corp Limited on select non-financial disclosures in the Business Responsibility 
& Sustainability Report for the financial year 2023-24.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Welspun Corp Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) (the ‘Report’) 
based on the BRSR reporting guidelines prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The reporting criteria have been derived from the 
Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The BRSR will be part of the Company’s Annual Report 2023-24.
BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to provide independent limited assurance on select non-financial 
information in the Report for the financial year 2023-24.
The Company’s responsibilities
The Report content and its presentation are the sole responsibilities of the management of the Company. The Company 
management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation 
of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
BDO’s responsibilities
BDO India LLP responsibility, as agreed with the management of the Company, is to provide assurance on the Report content as 
described in the ‘Scope & boundary of Assurance’ section below. We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance a third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.
Assurance standard
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, 
“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board. We 
applied the criteria of ‘Limited’ assurance.
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured the select indicators in the Report pertaining to the Company’s non-financial performance covering its 
operations for the period 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024. The indicators under the scope of assurance are listed in 
Appendix 1.
Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entails conducting procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered in 
the assurance scope. We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, and 
a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review process included:
• 	
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the select BRSR indicators in the Report;
• 	
Review of consistency of data/information within the Report as well as between the Report and source;
• 	
Engagement through discussions with personnel at the corporate level who are accountable for the data and information 
presented in the Report;
• 	
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, and 
aggregation;
• 	
Review of data collection and management procedures, and related internal controls.
• 	
Verification of non-financial/sustainability performance data, on sample basis, based on our professional judgement, was 
done for Anjar and Bhopal locations only.

Limitations and exclusions:
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, including, for example, the use of judgement and selective testing 
of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material misstatements in the Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope excludes:
• 	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024)
• 	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting is based; 
we have been informed by the Company that these are derived from the Company’s audited financial records;
• 	
The Company’s statements and claims related to any topic other than those listed in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’ 
and the indicators listed in Appendix-1;
• 	
The Company’s statements that describe qualitative/quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, inference, 
aspiration/targets, expectation, aim or future intention.
Our observations
We have reviewed the disclosures in the “Report” for the reporting period from 1st April 2023 through 31st March 2024. The 
disclosures of the Company, covered under the ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly reliable.
Our conclusions
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained as defined under the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the disclosures of the Company is presented fairly in accordance with 
the relevant reporting guidelines/standards.
