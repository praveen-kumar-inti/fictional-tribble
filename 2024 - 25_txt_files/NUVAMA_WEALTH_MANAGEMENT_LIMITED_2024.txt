related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed

of this disclosure)
Dear All,
It’s a proud moment for us to present the second edition of Nuvama’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the year 2024–2025. With 
each passing year, our sustainability journey becomes more purposeful — and this 
report is a reflection of that progress.
At Nuvama, we’ve always believed in doing things the right way — not just in how we 
serve our clients or build our business, but in how we show up for our people, our 
communities, and the planet. Over the past year, we’ve moved from intent to action. 
We’ve rolled out new sustainability policies, seen real reductions in emissions and 
waste, and continued embedding ESG deeper into the way we operate.
Our ESG and CSR Committees have played a key role in this — bringing in sharper 
oversight, meeting regularly, and ensuring that our actions are both meaningful and 
measurable. We also took a significant step forward this year by conducting ESG 
training for our Board, strengthening our commitment from the top.
This year’s BRSR brings to life our work across all three ESG dimensions — 
Environmental, Social, and Governance. It captures the changes we’re making 
within our operations, but just as importantly, how we’re contributing to the world 
around us.
Our CSR theme, “Investing in making ‘the children – the future’ more capable,” 
remains close to our hearts. We truly believe that enabling young minds today 
builds a stronger, more equitable tomorrow. At the same time, we’ve continued our 
focus on environmental stewardship, and we’re proud of the collective impact our 
teams and partners have made on ground.
As we look ahead, our commitment remains steady — to grow responsibly, stay 
transparent, and keep learning. Thank you for your continued support and belief in 
our journey.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
While the entity does not currently have a formal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for sustainable 
sourcing, we have taken steps in the year that reflect our commitment to environmental stewardship. These 
include initiatives such as procuring recycled paper and curating sustainable gifts for employees. The entity is 
gradually embedding sustainability considerations into its procurement decisions and aims to formalize these 
efforts through defined procedures over time.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
As a financial services company, Nuvama’s core operations are service-oriented and inherently low in resource 
intensity. 	However, we continue to integrate sustainability considerations wherever relevant. We prioritize 
energy efficiency in the procurement of electronic and electrical equipment such as laptops, computers, 
lighting systems, and air conditioning units. These decisions are guided by performance and environmental 
standards to ensure minimal environmental impact.
	
	
Furthermore, our corporate office at Inspire BKC is US GBC LEED Gold certified for interior design and 
construction for commercial interiors and operates out of a LEED Gold-certified green building, as accredited 
by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering a modern, 
future-ready workplace where sustainability and innovation come together to enhance employee well-being 
and operational efficiency.
	
	
This year we have introduced recycled paper for stationery and tissue papers at the Head Office. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the

Nuvama’s operations do not generate hazardous waste. The primary types of waste produced include paper, 
plastic, and electronic waste. We ensure the safe and compliant disposal of electronic waste by partnering with 
government-authorized e-waste recyclers and dismantlers. In addition, we continue to actively reduce our plastic 
footprint by identifying and eliminating single-use plastics across our offices and operations.
	
To drive behavioural change, we conducted several employee awareness initiatives during the year, including a 
dedicated Zero Waste Week campaign. This campaign focused on reducing waste at source, responsible disposal, 
and conscious consumption, and included activities such as waste segregation drives, collection bins for plastic, 
metal and e-waste, and internal communication campaigns across locations.
	
Efforts to reduce paper usage through digitization and to encourage recycling of office waste are ongoing. For 
further details on our paper reduction and recycling initiatives, please refer to Principle 6.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) does not apply to our activities due to the nature of our operations.

Details of measures for the well-being of employees
	
	
At Nuvama, employee well-being is a top priority. We offer a comprehensive suite of benefits designed to 
support the physical, mental, and financial health of our workforce. These include Mediclaim policies, personal 
loan assistance, happiness time-off, parental leave benefits, health counselling, and annual health check-ups. 
All employees are covered under health, term life, and accident insurance. 
	
	
We also recognize the importance of flexibility and work-life integration. While we do not have a formal policy, 
employees are allowed to work from home on a need basis—such as during maternity, health-related recovery,

family responsibilities, or personal emergencies—depending on business requirements and role feasibility. 
	
	
To ensure the safety and convenience of employees, we provide bus pick up and drop facility from the 
nearest railway stations at our corporate office. Furthermore, timely internal advisories are issued in case of 
disruptions such as severe weather conditions, heavy traffic, public events, or any situations that could affect 
safe commute or office accessibility. 
	
	
Moreover, we conducted the VoiceItRight employee satisfaction survey to gather actionable insights on key 
focus areas such as work-life balance, recognition, and learning opportunities. The survey achieved a strong 
response rate of 79.2%, a Pulse Score of 83/100, and a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +45, reflecting overall 
employee confidence and engagement. Based on this feedback, we structured our people-first strategy 
around three pillars: Work-Life Balance, Recognition, and Learning & Upskilling. Initiatives under these pillars 
include the launch of the Nuvama Cares wellness program, the Applaud recognition platform, leadership 
development programs in collaboration with reputed B-Schools, and regular townhalls to celebrate employee 
contributions.

wellness), CultFit (fitness), and Mediclaim (health insurance), ensuring seamless support for health needs 
beyond the workplace.

check-ups, focusing on non-occupational health. 
	
	
•	
Annual Health Check-ups: Comprehensive yearly health screenings are conducted for all employees. 
	
	
•	
Wellbeing Wednesdays & Women’s Day Programs: These initiatives promote emotional and preventive 
wellness, extending beyond job-related health concerns. 
	
	
•	
Cohort-Specific Interventions: Based on Health Index Reports, targeted actions are taken to provide 
personalized healthcare support. 
	
	
•	
Fitness Corporate Membership: Encourages regular physical activity and preventive health practices,

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Nuvama places a strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement as a crucial aspect of its operations. The company 
recognizes that engaging with its stakeholders is essential for understanding their needs, addressing concerns, and 
building long-term relationships based on trust and mutual benefit. The ongoing stakeholder consultations were 
vital in identifying the Company’s key environment and social concerns. The results from these consultations were 
integral in shaping Nuvama’s ESG policy framework, which clearly outlines the company’s commitment to prioritize 
areas such as environmental stewardship and social responsibility. This framework guides all corporate actions and 
policies, ensuring that stakeholder insights directly influence the company’s strategic initiatives and operational 
practices. As part of its ESG journey, the company embarked on a comprehensive stakeholder engagement program 
to identify critical material topics. Our first materiality assessment, which involved both internal and external 
stakeholders, was completed in Jan-23. As an outcome of this process, the company identified nineteen (19) 
material ESG topics that remain a cornerstone of the company’s ESG strategy. Furthermore, we have established an 
ESG policy framework that articulates our commitment to the identified focus areas and material topics, ensuring 
our strategic alignment with our sustainability objectives.

15.2%
17%
	
	
Note: The percentage of total wages paid to female employees for the current financial year stands at 15.2%. This figure is 
primarily influenced by the fact that approximately 49% of our female workforce received prorated salaries, either due 
to joining after the start of the financial year (post 1st April) or exiting during the year. These employment timelines 
have significantly impacted the overall wage distribution, and should be considered when interpreting the gender-
based wage ratio.
4.	
Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues 
caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, we have Grievance committee. The Human Resources team is responsible to protect Human Rights across all 
employees. The company is committed to upholding human rights and ensures the same by promoting fairness, 
equality, and safety across all its operations. The company fosters an inclusive work environment and encourages 
open communication. In addition, the ESG committee is mandated to review and assess the company’s performance 
on ESG goals as well as addressing any impacts or issues concerning ESG including human rights.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Nuvama has established robust internal mechanisms to redress grievances related to human rights issues like 
misbehaviour, discrimination based on gender, caste, sex and sexual harassment of employees. The company’s 
framework includes several policies aimed at protecting human rights and facilitating grievance resolution:
	
•	
Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH): This policy, in compliance with national laws, addresses sexual 
harassment at work, providing clear protocols for handling complaints. In addition, the company also provides 
mandatory POSH training for all its employees reiterating its commitment to human rights and prevention of 
sexual harassment.
	
•	
Whistleblower Mechanism: Enables employees and stakeholders to report unethical behavior or violations 
anonymously and securely.
Nuvama Wealth Management Limited
176
	
•	
Disciplinary Mechanism: Ensures prompt and effective action against human rights violations and breaches 
of company policy.
	
•	
Equal Opportunity Policy: Upholds principles of non-discrimination and equality, ensuring all employees are 
treated fairly regardless of their background.
	
•	
No-Retaliation Policy: The company also enforces a strict no-retaliation policy, which is clearly outlined in 
its Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) and Whistleblower policies.
	
Nuvama prioritizes continuous communication and education to foster awareness among employees about these 
policies and their rights. An independent redressal process, supported by these frameworks, helps ensure that 
the workplace remains safe and respectful for all employees. All human rights related grievances are centrally 
managed by the ESG committee.

emissions. However, we actively contribute to GHG reduction through the use of HVAC systems with refrigerants 
that have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and low global warming potential (GWP), thereby minimizing their 
environmental impact. Moving forward, the company is committed to furthering its environmental conservation 
efforts by establishing a baseline for greenhouse gas emissions, which will aid in the development of targeted 
initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. Some of the existing measures implemented by the company that aid in 
indirect reduction of GHG emissions include energy efficient lighting and use of renewable power in the offices.

Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format
	
As part of its waste management efforts, Nuvama undertakes initiatives to reduce, reuse, and responsibly dispose 
waste generated across its operations. In addition to ongoing measures such as e-waste disposal through certified 
vendors and digitization to reduce paper waste, the company also focuses on innovative and awareness-driven 
actions. We have hand dryers in washrooms and pantry at all our larger offices.
	
During the year, Nuvama collaborated with partners to upcycle used shoes and other discarded materials into 
school kits for underserved children, giving a second life to waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. This 
initiative not only supported circularity but also contributed to educational access for marginalized communities.
	
To further promote responsible consumption and disposal, Nuvama organized a waste collection drive across its 
offices, encouraging employees to deposit segregated plastic, metal, and electronic waste. This was complemented 
by internal awareness campaigns aimed at sensitizing employees to the importance of individual action in 
minimizing waste and supporting sustainable practices.

years. Additionally, it targets CSR projects with budgets of INR 1 crore or more that have been completed a year 
prior to the assessment. Nuvama’s CSR expenditure does not meet this threshold, hence the SIA was not required.
