GHG emissions. Selected initiative are
	
-	
Our share of renewable electricity has increased to 31.52%. Higher procurement of wind and solar 
power from the PPA agreements by our Chemical Business led to the increase.
	
-	
We continue to increase the use of biomass in our operations
	
-	
Our energy efficiency measures include
	
	
o	
In the Chemical Business, our initiatives such as optimisation and improvement of chiller operation 
by doing common brine network circuit, replacement of cooling tower fan with energy efficient fan 
and existing motors with energy efficient motors resulted in savings of more than 25 lakh kWh. 
	
	
o	
In the TTB, we were able to save more than two lakh kWh through the installation of a “Direct 
Evaporative cooling unit”, resulting in reductions in energy consumption and operational costs.
	
	
o	
In the PFB, we replaced chilled water with additional closed loop cooling tower line from Resin 
Plant, improving flow and cooling efficiency. Further, the frequency of our cooling water pump 
was brought down from 50Hz to 40Hz, saving around 360 kWh per day.

strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
At SRF, environmental and social responsibility are one of our Aspirations 2030. As part of the environmental 
and social responsibility, we are committed to manage our waste effectively through our 3R approach – 
Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Our efforts focus on minimizing waste generation at the source, promoting 
the reuse of materials wherever feasible, and maximising the recycling of remaining waste streams. 
Accordingly, we work towards integrating circularity across our operations and strive to function within a 
‘closed loop’ in our operations. 
	
We have significantly advanced our 3R capabilities by investing in the required infrastructure and 
processes, such as:
	
•	
We place a strong emphasis on efficiently using virgin raw material and increasing our recycled input 
material from our total raw material consumption.
	
•	
The total recycled input material used in PFB was approximately 3,450 MT (including PET 
chips & PP chips).
	
•	
During the year, we implemented several initiatives such as recycling paper tubes and shell rolls in our 
Technical Textile Business. We were able to recycle 60% of paper tube and 89.8% of shell roll.

Independent Assurance Statement on Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Report 
(BRSR) disclosures and Integrated Annual 
Report (IAR) for the financial year 2024-25.
Introduction and objective of engagement
SRF Limited (the 'Company') has developed its 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(‘BRSR’) including the BRSR Core Indicators1, based 
on the BRSR reporting guidelines prescribed by SEBI 
for listed entities. The reporting criteria have been 
derived from the Principles of National Guidelines 
on Responsible Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), 
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard.
BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to 
provide independent assurance on select non-financial 
sustainability disclosures in the BRSR (the ‘Report’) 
for the period 1st April 2024 to 31st March 2025.
The Company’s responsibilities
The content of the Report and its presentation are 
the sole responsibilities of the Management of the 
Company. The Company’s Management is also 
responsible for the design, implementation, and 
maintenance of internal controls relevant to the 
preparation of the Report, so that it is free from 
material misstatement.
BDO’s responsibility
BDO’s responsibility, as agreed with the Management 
of the Company, is to provide assurance on the BRSR 
Core Indicators as described in the ‘Scope & boundary 
of assurance’ section below. We do not accept or 
assume any responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person or organization. Any reliance 
a third party may place on the Report is entirely 
at its own risk.
Assurance standard and criteria
We conducted our assurance engagement in 
accordance with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information”, and ISAE 3410, “Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement”, issued 
by the International Auditing and Standards Board. 
We applied the criteria of ‘Reasonable’ Assurance 
for non-financial Core Indicators of BRSR (Business 
Responsibility & Sustainability Report).
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured the BRSR Core Indicators1, (as set 
out under Appendix 1 to this statement), pertaining 
to the Company’s non-financial performance for the 
period 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025.
The reporting scope and boundary cover the 
Company’s operations.
Assurance methodology
Our 
assurance 
process 
entailed 
conducting 
procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability 
of the disclosures covered in the assurance scope. 
The physical & virtual verification on sample basis was 
carried out at the following locations:
•	
Corporate Office, Gurugram;
•	
Chemical Business: Dahej Site & Bhiwadi Site;
•	
Performance Films & Foil Business: Indore Site 
[Domestic Tariff Area 1 (DTA1), Domestic Tariff 
Area 2 (DTA2) & Special Economic Zone (SEZ)].
These manufacturing facilities, combined, represent 
approximately 80% of the revenue generated by the 
Company. We conducted a review and verification 
of 
data 
collection, 
collation, 
and 
calculation 
methodologies, and a general review of the logic 
of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ 
data in the Report.
We used our professional judgement as Assurance 
Provider for selection of sample of the Company’s 
locations/facilities and non- financial information for 
the verifications.
We conducted a review and verification of data 
collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, 
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
40
and a general review of the logic of inclusion/omission 
of relevant information/data in the Report. 
Our review process included:
•	
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the 
quantification methods used to arrive at the 
non-financial/sustainability information of the 
BRSR Core Indicators;
•	
Review of consistency of data/information 
within the Report as well as between the 
Report and source;
•	
Engagement through discussions with personnel 
at both corporate and plant/facility levels who 
are accountable for the data and information 
presented in the Report;
•	
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data 
streams, to determine the level of accuracy in 
collection, transcription, and aggregation;
•	
Review of data collection and management 
procedures, and related internal controls.
Limitations & exclusions
There 
are 
inherent 
limitations 
in 
assurance 
engagement, including, for example, the use 
of 
judgment 
and 
selective 
testing 
of 
data. 
Accordingly, there are possibilities that material 
misstatements in the sustainability information of the 
Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope specifically excludes:
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting 
period (1st April 2024 to 31st March 2025);
•	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial 
performance indicators’ included in the Reports, 
specifically, the financial information based on 
which such indicators are reported; we have been 
informed by the Company that these are derived 
from the Company’s audited financial records;
•	
The Company’s statements and claims related to 
any topics other than those listed in the ‘Scope 
and boundary of assurance’;
•	
The 
Company's 
statements 
that 
describe 
qualitative/quantitative assertions, expression of 
opinion, belief, inference, aspiration, expectation, 
aim or future intention.
Our observations
Based on our review of the Report, we observed 
that the disclosures of the Company, covered under 
the ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly 
reliable. Certain data collation and compilation 
discrepancies, which were noted during our review, 
were subsequently corrected.
Our above observations, however, do not affect our 
conclusion regarding the Report.
Our conclusions
Based on the scope of our review, we concluded 
that the non-financial sustainability disclosures 
of the BRSR Core indicators as mentioned in 
‘Scope and boundary of assurance’ fairly fulfil the 
criteria 
of 
relevance, 
completeness, 
reliability, 
neutrality, and understandability as per ‘reasonable’ 
assurance criteria.
