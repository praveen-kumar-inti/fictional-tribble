1
Raw Material
Sourcing
Risk
Sugar industry is an agro based 
industry and its main raw material 
is sugarcane. In any year, if 
there is a shortfall in sugarcane 
production on account of adverse 
climatic conditions, the amount 
of sugar produced by the sugar 
mills is affected adversely. Apart 
from 
climatic 
conditions, 
the 
sugar cane crop may also be 
impacted 
by 
the 
occurrence 
of crop disease. Proper water 
management through irrigation 
during the formative stage of 
the cane is critical to the sucrose 
content and overall quality of the 
cane. In case the quality /quantity 
of cane is affected by any of the 
aforementioned conditions, we 
may not be able to optimally 
utilize our crushing capacity. This 
will directly affect our proﬁtability. 
We always make sure 
that sugarcane is sourced 
on time. When the sugar 
season begins we source 
best quality of sugar cane 
for which we conduct 
training of farmers. When 
the season of harvest 
begins we procure the 
sugarcane on time.
Out of our four sugar 
manufacturing units three 
is located in the state of 
Uttar Pradesh and one 
is in Uttarakhand. All the 
units have been located 
at the places where risk 
associated 
with 
sugar 
cane sourcing is minimum. 
Negative 
In case of poor procurement 
of sugar cane, ﬁnancials of the 
company can be impacted. 
Inefﬁcient 
procurement 
practices in raw materials can 
lead to higher procurement 
costs 
and 
affect 
proﬁt 
margins.

Opportunity

the 
blending of ethanol in petrol and 
also provide various beneﬁts to 
increase indigenous  production 
of  ethanol. Beyond 20% blending 
allowable by the Govt, which will 
further improve the results of the 
segment.
Not Applicable.
Positive
Higher proﬁtability alongwith 
increase in proportion of

Water 
Management
Risk
Water being a ﬁnite resource will 
pose a risk to the operations of 
our business. 
Uttam Sugar Mills Limited 
has implemented several 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
the risks associated with 
water management.
The company has taken 
various 
measures 
to 
reduce water consumption 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
process of Sugar.
In Sugar units, Company 
is operating with zero 
ground water extraction. 
The Company has also 
implemented 
rainwater

processes 
and

Climate Risk
Risk
Climate Change can have adverse 
impact on our business and not 
having a correct strategy or its 
right implementation will severely 
affect the business continuity.
Though, we do not have 
any mitigation measures 
to tackle climate change 
related 
risk. 
However, 
we make sure that our 
production process is not 
hampered, 
and 
timely 
production and delivery

Processes and Systems are in 
place to ensure maximum energy 
efﬁciency and reducing emissions. 
This will also result in reduce 
its operational costs, improve 
its environmental impact, and 
potentially beneﬁt from incentives 
and carbon credits.
At Uttam, we have taken 
various steps to reduce the 
greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHG)and increase usage 
of Solar panels, LEDs 
etc. to manage energy 
efﬁciently. 
Additionally, 
under 
the 
power 
purchase 
agreement 
we 
are 
generating revenue by 
selling 
excess 
energy 
back to the grid.
Positive
Any cost, put for improving 
the energy management and 
processes to reduce the GHG 
Emissions will fetch positive 
outcomes and reduced cost in 
the long run.

Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The production of Sugar from Sugarcane is an eco- friendly virtuous cycle. All the by-products generated during
the manufacturing process are to be productively utilised viz. bagasse is utilised for power generation; molasses
is utilised to produce distillery products and other wastes generated like press mud and ash generated from
incineration boilers are utilised for manufacture of organic manure as wells as of Potash. The Company has also
issued guidelines to every units of the Company on the waste management to monitor performance for each
unit on a regular basis.
