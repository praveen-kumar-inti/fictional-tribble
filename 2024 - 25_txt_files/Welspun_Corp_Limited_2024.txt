of concern and promptly implement corrective actions. By collaborating with various departments and engaging with 
employees, the EHS team gathers valuable insights and feedback on safety-related issues. They analyze data, conduct 
risk assessments, and develop strategic plans to mitigate risks while strengthening safety protocols. Additionally, the 
team provides comprehensive training and guidance to staff on best practices, safety protocols, and the proper use of 
protective equipment. The EHS team stays up-to-date with relevant laws, industry standards, and emerging safety trends

WCL effectively manages waste at all its locations through a comprehensive waste management system. Waste is 
categorized and handled based on its type, either non-hazardous or hazardous. Each plant has a designated storage yard 
for different waste categories. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed to ensure smooth operations, 
handling, and transportation. After segregation, waste is transported to vendors or recyclers authorized by Pollution 
Control Boards.
	
Most of the hazardous waste generated is either recycled or co-processed through authorized agencies to ensure 
minimization of environmental impact caused due to disposal to landfill.

Independent Assurance Statement to Welspun Corp Limited on select non-financial disclosures in the Business Responsibility 
& Sustainability Report for the financial year 2024-25.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Welspun Corp Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) (the ‘Report’) 
based on the BRSR reporting guidelines prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The reporting criteria have been derived from the 
Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The BRSR will be part of the Company’s Annual Report 2024-25.
BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to provide independent limited assurance on select non-financial 
information in the Report for the financial year 2024-25.
The Company’s responsibilities
The Report content and its presentation are the sole responsibilities of the management of the Company. The Company 
management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation 
of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
BDO’s responsibilities
BDO India LLP responsibility, as agreed with the management of the Company, is to provide assurance on the Report content as 
described in the ‘Scope & boundary of Assurance’ section below. We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance a third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.
Assurance standard
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, 
“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board. We 
applied the criteria of ‘Limited’ assurance.
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured the select indicators in the Report pertaining to the Company’s non-financial performance covering its 
operations for the period 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. The indicators under the scope of assurance are listed in 
Appendix 1.
Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entails conducting procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered in 
the assurance scope. We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, and 
a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review process included:
• 	
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the select BRSR indicators in the Report;
• 	
Review of consistency of data/information within the Report as well as between the Report and source;
• 	
Engagement through discussions with personnel at the corporate level who are accountable for the data and information 
presented in the Report;
• 	
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, and 
aggregation;
• 	
Review of data collection and management procedures, and related internal controls.
Independent Assurance Statement
Annual Report 2024-25

• 	
Virtual verification of non-financial/sustainability performance data, on sample basis, based on our professional 
judgement, for the corporate office and following manufacturing facilities:
- Welspun Corp Limited, Line Pipe Division, Anjar
- Welspun Corp Limited, Metallic Division, Anjar
- Welspun Corp Limited, Steel Division, Anjar
- Welspun Corp Limited, Bhopal
Limitations and exclusions:
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, including, for example, the use of judgement and selective testing 
of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material misstatements in the Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope excludes:
• 	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2024 to 31st March 2025)
• 	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting is based; 
we have been informed by the Company that these are derived from the Company’s audited financial records;
• 	
The Company’s statements and claims related to any topic other than those listed in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’ 
and the indicators listed in Appendix-1;
• 	
The Company’s statements that describe qualitative/quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, inference, 
aspiration/targets, expectation, aim or future intention.
Our observations
We have reviewed the disclosures in the “Report” for the reporting period from 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. The 
disclosures of the Company, covered under the ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly reliable.
Our conclusions
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained as defined under the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the disclosures of the Company is presented fairly in accordance with 
the relevant reporting guidelines/standards.
