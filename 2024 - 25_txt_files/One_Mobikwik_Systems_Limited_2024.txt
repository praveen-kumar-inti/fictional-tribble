Leadership Reflections 
Dear Stakeholders,
We are pleased to present MobiKwik’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the financial 
year 2024-25. This report reflects our continued 
commitment to operating with integrity, responsibility, 
and transparency as we empower millions across India 
through digital financial solutions.
As a homegrown fintech platform serving over 180 
million users and 4.6 million merchants, we recognize 
that true progress is not defined by innovation alone, it is 
measured by how responsibly and inclusively we build the 
digital economy.
Our payments business witnessed strong growth 
in 
transaction 
volumes, 
supported 
by 
increased 
adoption among both users and merchants. Even amid 
macroeconomic headwinds, our resilience has been 
shaped by aligning business strategies with evolving 
consumer needs and long-term value creation. Looking 
ahead, we are confident that our strengthened credit 
models and disciplined governance practices will help 
restore healthy margins by the second half of FY 2026.
Sustainability continues to be a strategic priority for us. 
We are deepening our ESG practices by advancing data 
protection measures, promoting ethical lending, and 
ensuring responsible energy consumption across our 
operations. While we operate primarily in the digital space, 
we remain conscious of our environmental footprint and 
are actively exploring ways to reduce it further.
We are equally committed to fostering an equitable 
and inclusive workplace. Our people are our greatest 
strength. We strive to create a culture that values diversity, 
nurtures employee well-being, encourages continuous 
learning, and provides equal opportunities for growth. Our 
community engagement and CSR efforts continue to align 
with national priorities such as financial literacy, digital 
empowerment, and education.
This report outlines our efforts across the key principles 
of responsible business conduct, in alignment with SEBI’s 
BRSR framework. We have also initiated third-party reviews 
of key disclosures to enhance transparency and credibility.
At MobiKwik, we believe in building a future that is not 
just digitally empowered, but also environmentally and 
socially responsible. We extend our sincere gratitude to 
all our stakeholders for their continued trust and support 
in this journey.
Warm regards,
Upasana Taku

*One MobiKwik Systems Limited has established a robust, multi-channel grievance redressal framework to address concerns from the broader community.
This includes direct access via the Legal and Compliance Officer’s email, and a helpline. 
**Investors have multiple avenues to raise their concerns. They can directly contact the Company Secretary & Compliance Officer or the Investor Relations 
Head using the contact details, including email IDs and phone numbers, which are regularly updated on the company’s website. Investors can also seek 
assistance through the company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). Furthermore, they have the option to register complaints or escalate issues using 
SEBI’s SCORES Portal, a dedicated platform for grievance redressal. These comprehensive measures ensure that both community and investor concerns are 
addressed transparently and effectively
***The details of grievance redressal mechanism for employees and workers are provided in Principle 3, point No. 6.
**** The various mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer feedback include customer helpline number/Toll-free number, website, App and 
every outlet as provided in Principle 9, point No. 1
https://www.mobikwik.com/grievancepolicy  To uphold the principles of fairness and transparency in complaint resolution, the Company has instituted an 
Internal Ombudsman (IO) mechanism. All complaints that are partially or wholly rejected by the Customer Service team are mandatorily referred to the IO for 
an independent review prior to final closure. This ensures that customer grievances are evaluated objectively and with due diligence. 
In addition, customers retain the right to escalate unresolved or unsatisfactory complaints to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which serves as the Appellate 
Authority. Complaints pending for more than 30 days or those where the resolution is deemed unsatisfactory may be escalated through the following channels:
Complaint lodging portal of the Ombudsman: https://cms.rbi.org.in. 
Toll-Free Helpline: 14448
Postal Address: Reserve Bank of India, 4th Floor, Sector 17, Chandigarh – 160017
***** / Grievances from Value Chain Partners are addressed by relevant departments on a case-to-case basis. No complaints have been received from 
communities and value chain partners during the FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25.

THE INTERNAL COMMITTEE
Composition
The Internal Committee is intended to be an independent, objective and unbiased fact-
finding body set up to investigate complaints of sexual harassment at workplace in a fair, 
reasonable and time- bound manner in a neutral environment. Pursuant to the relevant 
provisions of the Act and the Rules, an IC has been constituted at MobiKwik to prevent 
sexual harassment and to receive and effectively deal with complaints pertaining to 
the same.
Any investigation into a complaint of sexual harassment at the workplace, shall be 
conducted by at least three (03) members of the IC including the Presiding Officer.
Proceedings of the Internal Committee.
The IC shall broadly be governed by the following principles in conducting its proceedings:
i)
The IC shall give reasonable opportunity to the Complainant and the Respondent, for
putting forward and defending their respective cases and ensure that the Complainant
and the Respondent have full opportunity to present their claims, witnesses and
evidence, if any, which may establish or substantiate their claims.
ii)
The Complainant, the Respondent, their witnesses and/ or any other persons that the
IC meets or interacts with, for the purpose of an inquiry into any complaint of sexual
harassment at the workplace, shall be bound by strict confidentiality obligations; such
parties shall not be permitted to discuss the proceedings of the IC with any other
person. Any failure to comply with this obligation shall attract strict disciplinary action
against such a person, where the wrongdoer is an Employee.
iii) The IC shall complete the conciliation process/ enquiry (as applicable) in a time-
bound manner, prepare a report on the complaint and share its recommendations to
the Employer.
COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Raising of complaint:
i)
This is a gender-neutral Policy and any Employee or a Third Party can initiate a
complaint of sexual harassment at workplace against an Employee e.g. MobiKwik’s
customers, employees of MobiKwik’s service partners can also initiate a complaint
of sexual harassment at workplace, against an Employee, if such an Employee has
indulged in a misconduct amounting to sexual harassment at workplace with respect
to such Third Party.
ii)
To raise a complainant of sexual harassment at workplace, the Complainant shall make
a written complaint against the alleged offender i.e. the Respondent (Employee) either
to any of the IC members in terms of this Policy or through an email at the IC email
address i.e. posh@mobikwik.com within the timelines set forth below.
iii) The Complainant shall make in writing, a complaint of sexual harassment within a

iv) three (03) months from the date of last incident. Complaints arising out of incidents
which are more than three (03) months old shall not be accepted.
However, the IC may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend such time limit
of filing complaint up to further three (03) months, if it is satisfied that bonafide
circumstances prevented the Aggrieved Individual from filing complaint within the time
limit mentioned in point (iii) above. The complaint should clearly mention the name and
other available details (such as date, time, place of the alleged incident or incidents,
any witnesses present at the time of incident etc.) of both the Aggrieved Individual and

v)
Where the Aggrieved Individual is unable to make the complaint on account of their
physical or mental incapacity or death or otherwise, their representative, as more fully
described under Rule 6 of the said Rules, may make a complaint.
REDRESSAL PROCESS
Impartiality
i)
Complaints relating to sexual harassment shall be handled impartially and all
investigations will be conducted under the principles of natural justice, basis of
fundamental fairness, in an impartial and confidential manner to protect the identity of
all viz., the Aggrieved Individual, potential witnesses, and the Respondent.
ii)
All efforts shall be taken to ensure objectivity and meticulousness throughout the
process of investigation.
Interim Relief:
During pendency of an investigation, on a written request made by the Complainant, 
the IC may recommend to the Employer to grant interim relief to the Complainant as 
provided below:
i)
Transfer the Aggrieved Individual or the Respondent to any other workplace;
ii) Grant leave to the Aggrieved Individual of maximum of three (03) months, in addition to 
the leave otherwise entitled; or
iii) Restraint the Respondent from reporting on the work performance of the Aggrieved
Individual.
Conciliation:
i)
Before the IC initiates an inquiry, the Complainant may request the IC in writing to take
steps to resolve the matter through conciliation, provided no monetary settlement shall 
be made as a basis of conciliation.
ii)
Where settlement has been arrived at between the Complainant and the Respondent,
the IC will record the settlement so arrived and forward the same to the complainant,
the respondent and the employer.
iii) Where a settlement is arrived in accordance with this provision of the Policy, no further
