JHL has implemented processes to safely reclaim products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of their life. 
These processes include:
	
a Plastics (including packaging): Plastics are segregated, cleaned, and sent to certified recycling facilities.
	
a E-waste: E-waste is collected and processed by authorized e-waste recyclers.
	
a Hazardous waste: Hazardous waste is handled according to regulatory guidelines and disposed of through licensed 
hazardous waste management companies.
	
a Other waste: Other waste, including organic waste, is composted or sent to recycling centres as appropriate.
4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
NO, EPR is not applicable.   For Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL), while Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) might not 
directly apply in the same way as it does for manufacturing industries, there are still relevant aspects. Hotels generate a 
variety of waste types, including:
1.	
Packaging Waste: JHL uses a significant amount of packaging for amenities, food, and beverages.
2.	
E-waste: With numerous electronic devices used in operations and guest rooms, proper disposal of outdated or 
broken electronics is necessary.
3.	
Hazardous Waste: This includes cleaning chemicals, batteries, and other materials.
4.	
Plastics: Single-use plastics are prevalent in amenities, packaging, and other hotel operations.
	
JHL adopts EPR principles voluntarily by implementing waste management programs that focus on recycling and reducing 
waste, working with suppliers to minimize packaging, and ensuring proper disposal of electronic and hazardous waste. In 
summary, while EPR is not traditionally targeted at the hotel industry, JHL can still benefit from adopting its principles to 
improve sustainability and waste management practices. Therefore, the question regarding EPR’s applicability, and the 
alignment of waste collection plans is relevant to the extent that JHL engages in practices that contribute to extended 
producer responsibility.

For Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL), a leading hotel chain committed to sustainability, the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments 
(LCA) approach is highly relevant despite its primary focus on providing services rather than manufacturing products. 
The LCA methodology, typically used to assess the environmental impacts of products from cradle to grave, can also be 
applied to the various aspects of hotel operations, providing significant insights and benefits.
Sustainability Initiatives: JHL is deeply committed to enhancing its sustainability practices. By conducting LCA for its 
services—such as accommodation, food and beverage offerings, and event management—JHL can identify critical areas 
for environmental improvement. This process helps pinpoint where resource usage can be optimized, waste reduced, 
and overall environmental footprint minimized. For example, an LCA could reveal the benefits of using locally sourced, 
organic food items over imported ones, leading to reduced carbon emissions and supporting local communities.
Operational Efficiency: Understanding the life cycle impacts of JHL’s services can lead to more efficient use of resources 
and a reduction in waste. For instance, an LCA might highlight the significant energy consumption associated with 
laundry services, prompting JHL to invest in more energy-efficient laundry equipment or adopt new practices to reduce 
water and energy usage. This not only benefits the environment but also reduces operational costs, enhancing the 
overall efficiency of the hotel operations.
Consumer Transparency: Today’s consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious and value transparency 
regarding the environmental impacts of the services they use. By providing detailed environmental impact information 
derived from LCA, JHL can enhance its transparency and appeal to these consumers. This could involve publishing 
sustainability reports or providing information about the environmental footprint of different services offered, thereby 
building trust and loyalty among guests.
Regulatory Compliance: As environmental regulations become more stringent, having comprehensive LCA data can 
help JHL ensure compliance with current and future regulations. This proactive approach allows JHL to stay ahead of 
regulatory requirements, avoiding potential fines and enhancing its reputation as a responsible and forward-thinking 
company. For example, understanding the full environmental impact of its waste management practices could help 
JHL comply with local and national waste disposal regulations more effectively.
Early Steps in ESG Initiatives: JHL is in the early stages of its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives. 
Recognizing the importance of sustainability and responsible business practices, JHL looks forward to implementing 
LCA techniques in the future. These early steps in ESG initiatives demonstrate JHL’s commitment to continuous 
improvement and its dedication to adopting best practices that will further enhance its sustainability performance.
In conclusion, while Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) are more commonly associated with the manufacturing 
sector, they are equally relevant for the service industry, including hotels like JHL. By adopting LCA, JHL can significantly 
improve its sustainability footprint, enhance operational efficiency, provide greater transparency to its consumers, and 
ensure regulatory compliance, thereby reinforcing its commitment to responsible and sustainable business practices. 
JHL’s early steps in ESG initiatives set a solid foundation for future advancements in environmental stewardship.

Description of the Risk/Concern
Action Taken
While Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL) is in the early stages of its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives 
and has not yet fully implemented Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA), we have identified potential social and 
environmental concerns through other means. Below are some of the key concerns and the actions we have taken to 
mitigate them:
Packaging Waste:
	
a Concern: The significant amount of packaging waste generated from amenities, food, and beverages can contribute 
to environmental pollution.
	
a Action Taken: JHL has introduced initiatives to reduce packaging waste by replacing single-use plastics with reusable 
or biodegradable alternatives. We also encourage suppliers to use sustainable packaging materials.
E-waste:
Concern: The disposal of outdated or broken electronic devices poses a risk to the environment if not managed properly.
	
a Action Taken: JHL partners with certified e-waste recyclers to ensure the safe and responsible disposal of electronic 
waste. We also implement e-waste collection programs at our properties.
Hazardous Waste:
	
a Concern: The use of cleaning chemicals, batteries, and other hazardous materials can result in environmental 
contamination.
	
a Action Taken: JHL follows stringent waste management protocols to handle hazardous waste. This includes training 
staff on proper disposal methods and collaborating with licensed hazardous waste management companies.
Water Usage:
	
a Concern: High water usage in hotel operations, particularly in laundry and landscaping, can strain local water 
resources.
	
a Action Taken: JHL has implemented water conservation measures such as using water-efficient fixtures, recycling 
groundwater for landscaping, and promoting towel and linen reuse programs among guests.
Energy Consumption:
	
a Concern: High energy consumption, especially from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, can 
lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions.
	
a Action Taken: JHL invests in energy-efficient technologies, including LED lighting, energy-efficient HVAC systems, 
and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. We also conduct regular energy audits to identify 
further opportunities for energy savings.
By proactively addressing these concerns, JHL demonstrates its commitment to minimizing its environmental impact 
and promoting sustainable practices throughout its operations. As we advance our ESG initiatives, including the future 
implementation of LCA techniques, we will continue to identify and mitigate additional risks to ensure our operations 
contribute positively to society and the environment.

Source Segregation: Waste management at JHL begins with the segregation of waste at the source. We ensure that 
wet and dry waste is never mixed. Dry waste is further categorized into paper, plastic, and other recyclable materials to 
maximize recycling and reuse efforts .
	
Construction & Demolition (C&D) Waste: We adopt a meticulous approach to managing C&D waste by categorizing 
items such as white goods, loose furniture, cables, conduits, various metals, and carpets separately from construction 
debris. These components are then sold to agencies for reuse and recycling, minimizing waste .
	
Food Waste: Food waste is segregated into dry, wet, and plastic categories at the hotel level. Dry waste and plastics are 
sent to municipal corporations for recycling, while wet waste is processed using Organic Waste Compost (OWC) machines 
to produce compost. This approach ensures that food waste is never mixed with dry waste, maintaining the integrity of our 
recycling processes .
	
Plastic Waste: We have implemented initiatives to reduce plastic use across our operations, including replacing plastic 
water bottles with glass ones and eliminating plastic cutlery, straws, and packaging materials. We also use coffee cups 
without plastic linings and substitute plastic packaging with paper alternatives .
	
Liquid Waste: Liquid waste, including sullage and sewage, is directed to our Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) for treatment. 
The recycled water from the STP is used for landscaping and cooling towers, with evaluations for potential use in flushing 
systems for new projects. The resultant solid waste post-STP treatment is managed responsibly .
	
Upcycling: Linens, toiletries, and upholstery across our hotels are upcycled and donated to charity NGOs, ensuring these 
items find a second life and significantly reduce overall waste .
	
Solid Waste: For specific hotels, solid waste is sent to a BMC-approved agency in Turbhe, Maharashtra, for scientific 
disposal through incineration, preventing soil pollution and ensuring responsible waste management .
	
E-Waste: We are actively exploring opportunities with vendors for the disposal of e-waste. This initiative, while not yet fully 
implemented, is under active consideration to ensure waste management .
	
Strategy to Reduce Usage of Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals
	
JHL is committed to reducing the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes. Our strategy 
includes:
	
Elimination and Substitution: We strive to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals wherever possible. When elimination 
is not feasible, we substitute hazardous chemicals with less harmful alternatives that achieve the same purpose without 
compromising quality and safety .
	
Sustainable Procurement: Our procurement strategy prioritizes eco-friendly products and materials. This includes 
sourcing biodegradable toiletries, organic food items, and using eco-friendly cleaning agents that do not harm the 
environment .
	
Employee Training and Awareness: Regular training programs are conducted for our staff to promote safe handling and 
disposal of hazardous materials. This ensures that all employees are aware of best practices and safety protocols related to 
hazardous chemicals .
	
Vendor Collaboration: We collaborate with vendors and suppliers who adhere to sustainable practices and provide 
products that meet our stringent environmental standards. This includes working with suppliers who offer environmentally 
safe chemicals and materials .
	
Waste Treatment and Disposal: Hazardous wastes are treated and disposed of according to regulatory requirements. 
We engage certified hazardous waste management companies to ensure safe and compliant disposal of hazardous 
materials.
	
Continuous Improvement: We regularly review and update our chemical usage policies and practices to align with the 
latest environmental standards and technological advancements. This includes adopting new practices and technologies 
that further reduce our environmental impact .
	
By adopting these waste management practices and strategies to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals, 
JHL demonstrates its commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability.
