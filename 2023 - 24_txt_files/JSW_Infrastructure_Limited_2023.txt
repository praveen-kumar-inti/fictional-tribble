1
Air Emissions
R
A key parameter for gauging our 
environmental performance. 
Our systems must be in place 
to maintain emissions within 
the NAAQS.
We are committed to preventing, and reducing 
our air emissions through efficient use of 
technologies, specific policies and strategies. We 
closely monitor our monthly progress and take 
corrective actions as necessary.
Negative

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
R
We aim to achieve zero harm

and Safety are a very important 
part of JSW Group’s values.
We are committed to providing a healthy and 
safe working environment for the employees, 
contractors, business associates and visitors 
on premises and community impacted by our 
operations. We aim to be compliant with all 
applicable health and safety legal requirements. 
Safety is at the utmost priority across all sites, 
and we have stringent safety systems in place 
to achieve and maintain zero harm. From a 
governance standpoint, our senior management, 
along with key plant personnel, assume the 
overall accountability for ensuring the appropriate 
safety practices.
Negative
3
Biodiversity
R
Given the nature of our 
operations, all of our 
locations fall under the 
coastal regulations zone. We 
understand that preserving 
and restoring the biodiversity 
is critical for maintaining a 
balanced ecosystem – and 
even more important is 
ecologically sensitive zones.
We strive to achieve, “No Net Loss” of biodiversity. 
For our greenfield projects, and brownfield 
expansions, we ensure that minimum harm is 
caused to the biodiversity in that area. We are 
continuously increasing biodiversity across all our 
locations.

-
Positive
5
Climate 
Change
R
Our operations are impacted 
by many natural phenomena 
like heavy precipitation, heavy 
winds, etc and consumption 
of resources. Therefore, it is 
not only our responsibility as 
a corporate citizen, but also 
critical for our operations to 
consider the impact of climate 
change.
We have set stringent Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Intensity Targets to quantify our efforts towards 
climate change. We also strive to increase 
our energy efficiency, increase the share of 
renewables in our energy basket, improve the 
current processes, and experiment with blending 
of biofuels. We have already conducted a TCFD 
study for our portfolio in order to mitigate and 
reduce the impacts of identified risks.

perspectives and capabilities 
to our team. We strongly

Sustainable 
Port 
Development
O
Major global trade is carried out 
through the sea route. India 
offers an immense opportunity 
for increase in marine trade 
through development of 
greenfield ports and brownfield 
expansions. Ports are located 
in CRZ and also affect the 
social life around the port; 
accordingly, sustainable port 
development assumes an 
important role.
-

Business 
Continuity
R
Every business is fraught with
