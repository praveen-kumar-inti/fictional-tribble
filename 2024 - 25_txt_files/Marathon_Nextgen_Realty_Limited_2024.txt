Total workers (F + G)
The Company engages contractors under formal agreements, and these contractors, in turn, deploy workers on 
a project-to-project basis, depending on the specific requirements of each site. As these workers are not part of 
the Company’s permanent workforce, quantified data pertaining to them is not consistently available. Due to the 
decentralized nature of their deployment and limited access to uniform records, it is challenging to collate accurate 
and comprehensive information. Accordingly, such details have not been disclosed in this BRSR. Furthermore, 
wherever subsequent sections of the BRSR require specific disclosures related to such non-permanent or contractor-
deployed workers, the same may be marked as “Not Applicable” (NA).

Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or  negative 
implications)
1
Energy 
Management
Risk
The Company’s operations require 
substantial 
energy 
consumption 
across 
various 
processes, 
including 
heating, 
ventilation, 
and air conditioning, lighting, and 
equipment usage. This results in 
exposure to risks associated with 
rising energy costs, dependence 
on non-renewable sources, and 
evolving regulatory requirements 
on energy efficiency and emissions.
The 
Company 
seeks 
to identify and manage 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
its 
energy 
usage 
by 
incorporating 
appropriate 
measures 
aimed at improving energy 
efficiency. These efforts are 
influenced by factors such 
as property design, location, 
regulatory frameworks, and 
the feasibility of integrating 
alternative energy sources.
Negative*
There was no
negative financial
impact in the
reporting year
2024-25.
2
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource in the 
Company’s operations, particularly 
in construction activities and facility 
maintenance. 
Given 
increasing 
concerns around water scarcity 
and stricter regulatory scrutiny, 
inefficient water usage or improper 
wastewater disposal could result 
in environmental and compliance 
risks.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
water 
management 
practices 
that include the use of 
water-efficient 
fixtures, 
proper sewage treatment, 
and techniques to reduce 
dependence on external 
water 
sources 
through 
rainwater harvesting and 
groundwater replenishment 
measures.
Negative*
There was no
negative 
financial 
impact in the reporting 
year 2024-25.
3
Impacts of 
climate change
Risk
Climate change poses potential 
operational and financial challenges, 
particularly 
due 
to 
changing 
weather patterns and the growing 
demand 
for 
environmentally 
resilient 
infrastructure. 
These 
impacts may influence material 
sourcing, construction timelines, 
and operational sustainability.
The Company continues 
to take steps to integrate 
climate-conscious practices 
into its operations, such 
as 
promoting 
energy-
efficient building systems 
and optimizing the use of 
natural resources where 
feasible.
Negative*
There was no
negative 
financial 
impact in the reporting 
year 2024-25
4
Adherence 
to Labour 
Legislation
Risk
Given the labour-intensive nature 
of the industry, the Company is 
subject to extensive labour law 
regulations. 
Challenges 
include 
workforce compliance, health and 
safety considerations, and human 
rights risks, particularly with respect 
to contractual labour and site-based 
operations.
The Company maintains 
compliance with applicable 
labour laws and prioritizes 
creating 
a 
safe 
and 
legally compliant working 
environment. 
It 
has 
systems in place to monitor 
labour practices, address 
grievances, 
and 
ensure 
accurate recordkeeping.
Negative*
There was no negative 
financial impact in the 
reporting year 2024-
25
3 Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-24 version. SASB Standards are maintained and enhanced by 
the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This follows the SASB’s merger with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) into the Value Reporting 
Foundation (VRF) and subsequent consolidation into the IFRS® Foundation in 2022. The latest standards have been accessed at https://sasb.ifrs.org/ on 30th  April,

as

and 
favourable 
demographic 
shifts, 
provide

Company with an opportunity to

6
Land Acquisition
Risk
Land is a core resource for the 
Company’s 
operations, 
and 
challenges such as limited availability 
in key locations, high acquisition 
costs, 
and 
complex 
ownership 
structures can impact business 
expansion and project timelines.
The Company undertakes 
a structured approach to 
land acquisition, including 
preliminary agreements and 
legal safeguards, to ensure 
due diligence and minimize 
potential disputes or delays.

There was no negative 
financial 
impact

Implementation 
of Green 
Building 
Standards
Opportunity
With 
increasing 
emphasis 
on 
sustainable 
construction 
and 
responsible 
resource 
use, 
adherence to globally recognized 
green 
building 
frameworks 
provides the Company with an 
opportunity to align its operations 
with 
evolving 
stakeholder 
expectations. 
The 
Company’s 
projects 
include 
developments 
that are LEED-certified, reflecting 
a commitment to energy efficiency, 
reduced 
environmental 
impact, 
and 
enhanced 
occupant

the Company’s brand credibility 
but also appeals to environmentally 
conscious customers and investors.

Opportunity
The integration of technology in

2
Renewable Energy Integration
Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) solar panels 
have been installed at project sites to 
generate clean electricity. The renewable 
power offsets part of grid dependency 
during construction and is also designed 
to support future operational needs of the 
buildings.
This has reduced Scope 2 emissions, 
promoted the use of renewable energy, 
and created long-term operational savings 
for project occupants.
3
Energy-Efficient Technologies
Conventional energy-intensive systems 
have been replaced with LED lighting, BEE 
5-star rated appliances, variable frequency 
drives (VFDs), and high-performance 
glazing, which are integrated into project 
designs.
These upgrades have resulted in 
substantial energy savings, reduced GHG 
emissions during the building use phase, 
and improved comfort levels for occupants.
4
Sustainable Building Design
Building designs incorporate double-
glazed façades, reflective roofing, 
optimized building envelopes, and 
orientation informed by daylight and heat 
simulations.
These measures have reduced electricity 
consumption for cooling, lowered 
operational carbon footprints, and provided 
better thermal comfort for building users.
5
Clean Mobility Infrastructure
Solar-powered EV charging stations have 
been installed within project premises, 
providing clean transport infrastructure for 
residents and employees.
This has encouraged the adoption of 
electric vehicles, reduced emissions 
associated with conventional fuel-based 
mobility, and supported sustainable 
transportation choices.
6
Waste Management (OWC 
Machines)
Organic Waste Converter (OWC) 
machines are deployed at sites to process 
biodegradable waste into compost, which 
is then reused in landscaping activities.
This has reduced the volume of waste sent 
to landfills, prevented methane emissions 
from organic waste, and produced compost 
for on-site horticulture.
7
Construction & Demolition (C&D) 
Waste Recycling
Construction debris and recyclable non-
biodegradable waste are segregated and 
handed over to authorized recyclers for 
responsible processing.
This has minimized the environmental 
footprint of construction, increased 
recycling rates, and supported circular 
economy practices.
8
Water Conservation through 
STPs
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) with 
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary treatment 
have been established at project sites. 
Treated wastewater is reused for flushing 
and horticulture.
This has reduced freshwater demand, 
promoted circular use of water within 
project premises, and ensured compliance 
with regulatory norms.
9
Rainwater Harvesting
Rainwater harvesting pits are constructed 
at multiple sites to capture and recharge 
groundwater, supplementing water supply 
needs.
This has helped conserve water resources, 
reduced dependence on municipal 
supplies, and improved resilience to water 
scarcity.
10
Afforestation and Green Cover 
Development
Native tree plantations are carried out 
both within project boundaries and in 
surrounding communities to enhance 
biodiversity and improve air quality.
These plantations have increased green 
cover, improved the local microclimate, 
enhanced carbon sequestration, and 
supported biodiversity conservation.
11
Community Plantation & 
Awareness Drives
Initiatives such as seed ball making, 
plantation programs, and school-level 
awareness sessions on single-use plastic 
have been organized to engage the wider 
community.
These programs have raised environmental 
awareness, fostered community 
participation in sustainability, and created a 
positive social and ecological impact.
12
Digitization of Operations
Key processes such as production, billing, 
technical design, and payment systems 
have been moved to digital platforms to 
reduce paper use and enhance efficiency.
This transition has significantly minimized 
paper consumption, streamlined 
administrative functions, and reduced the 
environmental impact of office operations.
