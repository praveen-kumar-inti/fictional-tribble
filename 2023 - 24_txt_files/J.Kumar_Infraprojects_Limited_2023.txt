Yes. JKIL has established procedures to prevent/manage conflicts of interest among board members, aligning with their terms of 
appointment. Directors are obligated to prioritize the Company’s interests, ensuring that any personal or business associations do not 
conflict with Company operations.
This commitment is reinforced through a Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management Personnel, emphasizing avoidance 
and management of conflicts of interest. It requires directors to be prohibited from participating in decisions where conflicts of interest 
arise and are required to disclose relevant facts to the Board or Executive Chairman for further guidance.
Furthermore, while our Company has not yet experienced any conflicts of interest stemming from directors’ engagements with other 
companies or routine business activities, It is fully prepared to handle such incidents should they occur in the future. Directors are urged 
to act in the Company’s best interests, avoiding personal gain and maintaining objective judgment.
Any conflicts with board members are required to be promptly reported to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee or Chairman of the 
Board.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes. JKIL is committed to giving priority to suppliers offering sustainable and eco-friendly materials for construction and 
infrastructure development.
During the course of appointing vendors, a systematic procedure is followed. Upon receiving the contract from clients, the 
technical team conducts thorough checks at the vendor’s offices and manufacturing sites. These checks encompass various 
aspects such as safety norms, sustainable practices, and the vendor’s credentials, including their past collaborations and 
obtained certifications like MORTH, RDSO, and/or ISO. Copies of these certifications are collected and submitted to the clients 
for review. Once all checks are successfully cleared by the vendor, they are appointed onboard.
In the case of MSME vendors, the Company ensures proper documentation, including MSME certificates, is obtained for record-
keeping purposes. This meticulous approach to vendor appointment ensures adherence to safety standards, sustainability 
practices, and regulatory requirements, contributing to the Company’s commitment to responsible and ethical business 
practices.
The Company also emphasizes on compliance with applicable legal and statutory requirements impacting Environment, 
Health, and Safety (EHS) for all contractors, suppliers, vendors, service providers, and business partners.
Moreover, the Company focuses on resource conservation, waste elimination, recycling, and reusing materials without 
compromising safety. Additionally, the Company prioritizes using locally available raw materials and labor for construction 
activities, further contributing to sustainability efforts by minimizing transport requirement.
By employing these sustainable sourcing practices, the Company is committed to responsible and environmentally conscious 
development and strives to deliver projects that prioritize ethical practices, sustainability, and environmental protection.

Approximately, the Company has 25-30 renowned vendors, including JSW Steel, Ultratech Cement, Tata Steel, JSW Cement,

involved in the manufacturing and distribution of products, particularly those that generated significant amounts of plastic waste, 
e-waste, and batteries. Our focus lies in the construction and development of essential infrastructure, where our activities involve the 
use of raw materials for construction purposes rather than the production or disposal of consumer goods. While it remains committed

vis-a-vis the control measures in place. This is done for all routine and non-routine activities.
The Procedure for Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment entails a comprehensive approach covering all activities, products, 
and services within the project, regardless of their routine or non-routine nature. The primary purpose is to identify potential 
hazards and evaluate associated risks to ensure the implementation of necessary control measures. This responsibility primarily

J. Kumar Infra Projects Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) occur at various stages of the project lifecycle, including at the project's 
initiation within 60 working days, before initiating any new activity, or when new Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) hazards 
are identified. The process involves a designated group, comprising the Activity in charge, engineer, safety representative, 
Supervisor, and worker, who review all activities, including those of subcontractors and visitors. They identify hazards, assess their 
severity, and determine risk levels by considering implemented controls and legal requirements. The evaluation encompasses 
an analysis of legislative and regulatory obligations, past incidents of non-compliance, and feedback from audits. Additionally, 
hazards with significant risk are identified, assessing various factors such as physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, and 
behavioral aspects. 
Subsequently, control measures are implemented based on a risk hierarchy, which includes elimination, substitution, 
engineering controls, signage/administrative controls, and personal protective equipment. Periodic reviews and revisions of 
the HIRA are conducted every quarterly or six months to ensure its adequacy, especially in response to reportable incidents/
accidents or changes in laws and requirements.

Moreover, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is systematically conducted to proactively prevent the recurrence of potentially hazardous 
incidents. To ensure proactive monitoring and control of incidents, the Company adheres to Risk Control Methodologies & 
Incident Integration Mechanism. Incident statistics are diligently maintained on-site, facilitating thorough investigations and 
the implementation of necessary corrective actions. 
The Company deploys EHS-conscious workmen at workplaces, empowering them to identify and promptly report any hazards 
for immediate corrective action. Furthermore, worker representatives actively participate in the Project EHS Committee, 
contributing to the identification and resolution of work and health-related concerns at the workplace. Monthly EHS 
Committee meetings provide a platform for workman’s representatives to report hazards and discuss mitigation measures. 
Additionally, the Company has implemented an incident reporting mechanism to address workplace-related injuries and 
near misses promptly. Near-miss reporting junctions are strategically located at project sites, offering employees a convenient 
means to report incidents. Workers can also communicate work-related incidents and concerns through suggestion boxes and 
to their respective line managers.

Yes, at the Company’s worksites, ensuring a safe and healthy environment is paramount. To achieve this, all individuals working 
on the projects undergo comprehensive safety training before commencing work. On-site medical facilities, including doctors 
and first-aid kits, are readily available at each project site office to address any injuries or emergencies promptly.
Additionally, safety drills are conducted quarterly to reinforce safety protocols and preparedness among our workforce. The 
Company prioritizes the well-being of our employees by organizing health check-ups, medical camps, and blood donation 
drives at select site locations.

The Company has established a comprehensive procedure for internal audits concerning Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) 
management systems. This procedure ensures that all site and office activities, along with associated hazards, are within the scope of the 
HSE management system. The purpose of this procedure is to establish a systematic approach to internal audits for HSE management 
systems. The responsibility for conducting these audits lies with the Site Management Representative (MR), HSE Head, and Corporate 
MR. The audit process comprises several sub-processes, including audit planning and scheduling, audit preparation, audit performance, 
audit review, and audit follow-up. During the audit performance phase, trained and qualified auditors conduct audits independently 
of the work being audited, following a predefined audit plan. Audit findings are documented, classified as Non-conformities (NCRs) or 
observations (OBS), and submitted to the Site MR for review. Non-conformities are discussed in detail during the closing meeting, and 
corrective action plans are formulated. The management review meeting, conducted every six months, discusses the results of internal 
audits, ensuring continual improvement of HSE management systems at both project sites and the corporate level.

of the policy, ensuring fair investigations and appropriate disciplinary actions in line with legal requirements. The committee, chaired 
by a senior woman employee and including members with expertise in social work or law, maintains confidentiality and conducts 
thorough inquiries into reported incidents, providing a safe and supportive environment for complainants. The Committee also prepares

Note 1 - The construction waste generated from excavating land at the site is typically managed in the following manner: Initially, the 
waste is stored in designated areas on-site until collection. An authorized third-party agency arranges regular waste collection, usually 
every one to two days. 
For waste oil, dealers refine the oil and reuse it to a certain extent to prevent steel from rusting. 
Additionally, 90% of steel waste is sent to certified scrap dealers, while smaller steel particles may become embedded in the soil on-site. 
As for concrete waste, when the cement-sand mixture is washed, the cementitious material and sand are typically reclaimed and reused.
The Company is in the process of incorporating a mechanism to record the quantity of waste generated at sites in order to align with 
the reporting requirements.
Note 2 - The waste generated, including paper, cardboard, oil cans, and plastic, is sent to a third-party dealer for recycling purposes.

Lithium-ion batteries
Unlike fossil fuels, lithium batteries do 
not emit greenhouse gases during use, 
making them a more environmentally 
friendly option. Additionally, lithium-ion 
batteries are less toxic as they lack materials 
like cobalt, nickel, and manganese. 
Recognizing these advantages,
JKIL has recently acquired approximately 3 
lithium-ion batteries for use in locomotives 
at select construction projects in Delhi.
Reduced emissions to a significant 
extent and lowered the toxicity 
traditionally 
associated 
with 
conventional batteries
