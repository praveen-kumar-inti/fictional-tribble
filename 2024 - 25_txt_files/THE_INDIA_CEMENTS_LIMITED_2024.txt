Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.:
Our company has implemented comprehensive waste management practices aimed at sustainability and environmental 
stewardship. While our products and processes do not generate any hazardous or toxic chemicals, we have adopted an 
innovative approach by utilizing hazardous waste from other industries as an alternative fuel source. This strategy not only 
mitigates the environmental impact of such waste but also enhances the energy efficiency of our operations. In addition 
to this, we have developed effective waste disposal procedures tailored to our specific needs. One key initiative is our 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan, which has been submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). 
Under this plan, we ensure that the equivalent quantity of plastic waste, primarily from HDPE and PP bags used in cement 
packing, is responsibly co-processed in our cement kiln. This practice not only addresses the plastic waste issue but also 
aligns with our commitment to promoting circular economy principles.
