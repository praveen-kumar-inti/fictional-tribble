1
Climate Change 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
NIIT Learning Systems Ltd., recognizes its 
responsibility to build a sustainable future; 
as a leading learning and talent development 
company, we are committed to minimizing 
our environmental footprint by promoting 
digital-first solutions, reducing resource 
consumption, and encouraging eco-friendly 
practices across our operations. Our focus 
on sustainability supports global climate 
goals while aligning with our mission to 
create long-term value for all stakeholders.
Positive
2
Talent Attraction 
and Development
Opportunity
As a talent development corporation, it is 
crucial for NLSL to prioritize the development 
of our own human capital. We have 
established a robust learning culture and 
process within the company.
Additionally, we prioritize and consistently 
invest in cultivating a diverse group of 
leaders. Our company offers executive 
development programs tailored to every 
level, 
including 
individual 
contributors, 
managers, and leaders.
We utilize technological solutions to enhance 
the employee experience. For instance, we 
are currently implementing Success Factors, 
employing an AI BOT for engagement 
surveys, and utilizing an online portal for 
wellness initiatives.
Positive
3
Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
Risk
There are several potential risks associated 
with cyber threats, including malware 
attacks, social engineering attacks, and 
software supply chain attacks. These risks 
pose a significant threat to the company 
as they can result in the theft of sensitive 
customer data. This not only jeopardizes 
data privacy but also poses a reputational 
risk to the company.
NLSL implements various security 
measures such as Segregation 
of Duties (SOD), Multi-Factor 
Authentication 
(MFA), 
disk 
encryption, and USB disablement 
to safeguard against IT risks and 
maintain data privacy. Our robust 
cyber security and data privacy 
policy is designed to promptly 
address threats and effectively 
manage data, mitigating any 
potential risks stemming from 
cyber security and data privacy 
concerns. 
The company also maintains 
audit trails for the standalone 
entity in line with the requirement 
specified by the regulators.
Negative
4
Artificial 
Intelligence
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk exists in the learning content practice 
as customers may opt to use Gen AI for 
content creation. However, customers may 
alternatively opt to invest in more effective 
training at levels 2 and 3.
We have incorporated automation, bots, 
and RPAs into our Learning administration 
processes. AI won’t could revolutionize our 
offerings, it does and  enable us to introduce 
some new products. 
The risk is low for Learning Delivery as 
instructors continue to offer unique value 
towards building proficiency.
Our strategy for future is centered 
around a strong focus on highly 
AI-enabled solutions. We have 
made significant investment in 
FY25 and also plan to continue 
invest significantly in FY26 to 
strengthen our AI capabilities, for 
driving internal efficiencies and 
customer deliverables.
The 
company 
also 
foresees 
reasonable 
opportunity 
in 
consulting and implementation of 
AI initiative with its customer.

5
Employee Health 
and Safety
Opportunity
Poor 
work 
environments 
and 
unsafe 
practices can deter employee retention 
and discourage workplace efficiency or 
productivity. Lost time due to injuries create 
loss of productivity and mental dissatisfaction 
in employees. The new normal of hybrid 
working, employee demands have shifted to 
mental and emotional wellness rather than 
only that of physical.
Employee well-being has been an important 
focus area for NLSL. When COVID first 
impacted us, we already had in place a 
wellness portal called Round Glass which 
was used for various health and wellness 
programs. We also had a panel of experts to 
take care of mental wellness. 
Our online wellness portal has more than 
50% of employees participating in webinars 
on areas related to health and wellbeing. 
We also drive health and wellness initiatives 
through a tie up with external consultants 
and provide free sponsorship of membership 
to our employees. We take continuous 
feedback 
from 
employees 
through 
engagement surveys and feedback to design 
and incorporate new initiatives in the area of 
wellbeing.
Positive
6
Business Ethics 
and Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Business ethics are cornerstone of ensuring 
transparent 
and 
sustainable 
corporate 
governance 
frameworks. 
Upholding 
policies such as code of conduct and anti-
bribery & corruption and good business 
ethics ensure transparent and sustainable 
corporate 
governance 
frameworks 
and 
good-governance measures to effectively 
implement stringent actions, among others. 
NLSL has a Code of Conduct in place 
to ensure compliance with standards of 
business practices and legal requirements 
for all its employees and workers. We also 
have comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-
corruption policy and measures to ensure 
compliance and management of risks. Our 
policies such as whistleblower, related 
party transactions, etc. are also material to 
business.

Customer 
Concentration
Risk & 
Opportunity 
The company functions in multiple sectors 
and is mostly focused on Fortune 1000 
organizations.. The company sets into its 
customer training and upskilling in an integral 
manner, which results in fewer customers 
having a large share or contribution towards 
revenue. Usually, the customer maturity 
process is long-term for the business.
NLSL has grown to earn the trust 
of many Fortune 1000 companies 
in over 55 countries. Trusted by 
the world’s leading companies, 
NLSL 
provides 
high-impact 
managed 
learning 
solutions 
that weave together the best 
of learning theory, technology, 
operations, 
and 
services 
to 
enable a thriving workforce.
The risk of failure of these 
customers is low and there is a 
steep entry barrier.
More and more organizations 
are engaging providers such as 
NLSL for outsourcing; hence 
there are significant opportunities 
in the market. Currently the 
company has a wide customer 
base offering varied services with 
increasing revenue share across 
geographies.
Negative
8
Supply chain 
Management
Opportunity
Supply chain management affects product 
and service quality, delivery, costs, customer 
experience 
and 
ultimately, 
profitability. 
Increased supply chain disruptions at 
the wake of geopolitical transitions, and 
crises such as the pandemic result in loss 
of business continuity. Lack of inclusive 
supply chains creates vacuum at the time of 
crises. A robust supply chain includes local 
sourcing, boosting local economies and 
disadvantaged communities.
NLSL’s operations depend significantly on 
value chain partner, and it maintains a very 
wide base of such partners globally with 
ability to source at very short interval to meet 
customer demands. The value proposition to 
its enterprise customers that the provides is 
the ability to meet certain surges of demand 
, thus not requiring customers to have any 
fixed commitment.
Positive
	
Note: While the material Issues are identified, the company is undergoing detailed assessment of prioritization for driving its long 
term sustainability goals.

NLSL has established a transformational partnership with The Writing Revolution (TWR), a 4-star rated non-profit organization 
dedicated to improving writing and critical thinking skills for underserved students across the United States. This partnership 
demonstrates how commercial technology solutions can drive significant social impact for historically marginalized communities.

transformation roadmap for TWR. This CSR investment established the foundation for a commercial engagement where TWR 
invested in NIIT’s support to develop a bespoke, AI-enhanced educational platform.

students in underserved communities who lack access to quality writing instruction. Current implementations include school 
districts in Louisiana, Baltimore, Arkansas, and Washington DC, with significant documented improvements in student writing 
performance, standardized test results across subjects, and teacher effectiveness.
	
Expected Outcomes FY26:
•	
50,000-100,000 teachers empowered with AI-enhanced tools (10x increase in TWR’s reach).
•	
2-5 million students receiving improved writing instruction.
•	
Measurable gains in writing performance for historically marginalized students.
