regimes, regulatory tightening, 
and volatility in fossil fuel costs. 
Simultaneously, decarbonisation 
and energy efficiency present

competitiveness and align with 
investor expectations.
Deploy energy-
efficient 
technologies, 
integrate 
renewable energy, 
and adopt a 
structured GHG 
monitoring 
framework.
Positive: Cost savings, 
improved ESG scores, 
long-term resilience. 
Negative: Near-term 
capital expenditure.

systems, global 
certifications, 
and customer-
centric innovation 
programs
Positive: Enhanced client 
trust and repeat orders. 
Negative: Quality lapses 
may result in penalties or 
claims.
4
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
R

manufacturing 
process 
involves 
high 
safety 
risks 
including heavy machinery and 
hazardous materials. Any lapses 
may lead to loss of life, regulatory 
sanctions, 
and 
reputational 
damage.
Institutionalise 
OHS management

45001), periodic 
safety audits, 
training, and 
digital safety 
monitoring.
Negative: Accidents 
can lead to downtime, 
medical/legal costs. 
Positive: Robust OHS 
boosts productivity and 
employee morale.
5

progression 
pathways, 
and enhanced 
employee well-
being programs
Positive: Reduced 
attrition, higher 
productivity, improved 
employer brand.
6
Regulatory 
& Legal 
Compliances
R
The 
company 
is 
subject 
to 
evolving 
domestic 
and 
international 
regulations 
on 
environment, safety, labor, and 
trade. Non-compliance exposes 
the business to operational 
disruption, financial penalties, 
and investor scrutiny.

compliance 
tracking, third-
party assurance, 
and board-level 
oversight
Negative: Penalties and 
reputational damage if 
non-compliant.  
Positive: Reduced risk and 
investor confidence from 
strong compliance culture.
7

in 
global 
markets
Implement 
structured 
customer 
satisfaction 
surveys (CSAT/

client feedback, 
and strengthen 
grievance 
redressal systems
Positive: Repeat 
business, stronger client 
relationships, premium 
positioning.

Water 
Management
R&O
Manufacturing is water-intensive 
and often located in water-
stressed regions. Poor water 
stewardship exposes operational 
risk, while efficient usage and 
recycling are increasingly seen 
as ESG differentiators.
Deploy water 
recycling and zero-
liquid discharge 
technologies, 
monitor water 
intensity, and 
prioritise water 
stewardship 
programs.
Positive: Lower operating 
risk, enhanced ESG 
credibility.  
Negative: Capex 
requirement for water 
efficiency infrastructure.
9
Diversity & 
Inclusion
O
Diversity 
and 
inclusion 
are 
strategic enablers of innovation 
and 
social 
equity. 
Global 
investors increasingly expect 
disclosures and progress on 
workforce diversity, particularly 
in 
male-dominated 
heavy 
industries.
Set gender 
diversity targets, 
sensitisation 
training, and 
implement 
inclusive 
workplace policies.
Positive: Stronger talent 
pipeline, enhanced 
innovation, improved ESG 
ratings.
10
Respect 
for Human 
Rights
R
Complex supply chains expose 
the company to risks of child 
labour, 
forced 
labour, 
and 
worker exploitation. Alignment 
with UN Guiding Principles on 
Business & Human Rights is vital 
to safeguard reputation and 
global market access.
Enforce Supplier 
Code of Conduct, 
periodic audits, 
and transparent 
grievance 
redressal across 
the value chain.
Negative: Legal exposure 
and reputational damage 
from violations.  
Positive: Strengthened 
trust with global clients 
and financiers.

Specific commitments, goals and

Man Industries continues to advance its sustainability journey by strengthening 
operational practices and embedding responsible business principles across its value 
chain. Our focus remains on driving efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and 
enhancing social outcomes through a balanced and integrated approach.
We are progressively exploring opportunities to improve resource utilization, 
enhance energy and process efficiency, and adopt innovative practices that support 
our environmental objectives. Our approach also includes ongoing efforts to assess 
and manage environmental and social considerations throughout our operations and 
stakeholder relationships.
People remain at the core of our progress. We continue to invest in fostering a diverse, 
safe, and inclusive workplace, while enhancing employee capabilities through 
continuous learning and skill development. Workplace safety, employee well-being, 
and stakeholder trust remain central to our ethos.
In parallel, we are working towards strengthening our supply chain engagement, with 
an emphasis on responsible sourcing and aligning our partners with our overarching 
values. We also seek to enhance awareness around responsible product use, safety, 
and circularity among our customers and communities.
We are in the process of refining our internal frameworks, policies, and guidelines 
to enable more structured ESG integration over the short, medium, and long term. 
These evolving practices are intended to ensure agility in responding to emerging 
risks and opportunities, while supporting sustained growth and innovation.

Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals 
and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
During the reporting year, Man Industries achieved a substantial reduction in Scope 
1 GHG emissions alongside improvements in waste management, with a notable 
increase in recycling and continued adherence to zero waste to landfill. Water 
consumption rose due to operational activity, though intensity is being closely 
monitored. While overall energy use increased with production, the Company is 
working towards higher renewable energy integration.
Occupational health and safety performance strengthened, with LTIFR reduced by 
more than half and total recordable injuries declining, while maintaining zero fatalities. 
Employee turnover improved significantly, and 100% coverage under provident fund 
and gratuity was maintained. Training participation was lower compared to the 
previous year, but efforts are underway to enhance structured learning. Diversity 
remains an area of focus, with 3% female representation in the workforce and one-
third of the Board comprising women directors.
The Company continues to comply with governance and CSR commitments, ensuring 
statutory contributions and supporting meaningful community programmes. 
Overall, the year reflects steady progress across material ESG parameters, with 
clear opportunities identified to further strengthen renewable energy usage, water 
intensity management, and workforce diversity.

Statement by director 
responsible for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
At Man Industries, our sustainability journey is guided by the belief that responsible 
business practices are integral to long-term value creation. As we enter FY 2024–25, 
we remain focused on strengthening the connection between our growth aspirations 
and our environmental, social, and governance priorities.
The evolving global and domestic landscape continues to present both challenges 
and opportunities. We view these as catalysts for reflection, adaptation, and progress, 
enabling us to refine our approach and remain aligned with the expectations of our 
stakeholders.
Our emphasis will remain on fostering resilience, enhancing stakeholder trust, and 
ensuring that our business conduct reflects the principles of ethics, inclusivity, and 
transparency. By engaging thoughtfully with our stakeholders and remaining alert 
to emerging trends, we aim to contribute meaningfully to shared progress while 
safeguarding our long-term objectives.
Sustainability, for us, is not a standalone initiative but a way of conducting business 
— embedded in our decisions, culture, and relationships. With this perspective, 
we will continue to navigate the year ahead with purpose, agility, and an enduring 
commitment to creating value for all.

Briefly describe the 
waste management 
practices adopted in your 
establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and 
toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and 
the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes
Man Industries has adopted a systematic and environmentally responsible approach to 
waste management across its establishments. 
Waste Management Practices
Waste is segregated at source into general, recyclable, and hazardous categories to enable 
efficient handling. Recyclable materials are reused where feasible, while hazardous waste is 
safely stored and disposed of through authorized Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities 
(TSDFs). Treated wastewater from Effluent and Sewage Treatment Plants (ETP/STP) is reused 
for gardening and utility purposes, supporting our Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) commitment. 
Reduction of Hazardous Chemicals
To minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals, the Company focuses on process 
optimization, use of safer alternatives, inventory control, and periodic audits. Employees 
are regularly trained in the safe handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals, reinforcing our 
commitment to sustainable and safe operations.

In March 2025, a security incident was identified involving unauthorized access 
to our vendor login on a third-party Invoicing Supplier Portal of Vendor. 
The attacker used the compromised credentials to upload forged banking-
related documents. 
Although the breach did not occur within our internal IT infrastructure, the 
following precautionary and corrective actions were taken immediately to 
check our internal IT Security: 
•	
The vendor portal password was reset as part of a dual-authentication 
process. 
•	
All forged documents were replaced with correct and verified versions. 
•	
A forensic investigation was conducted on the user’s laptop to ensure 
there was no internal breach. 
•	
A full VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) scan 
was performed on our firewall and network devices. 
•	
A formal cybercrime complaint was filed with the authorities. 
•	
No internal vulnerabilities were identified; the issue was traced back to 
insufficient security controls on the third-party vendor portal.
