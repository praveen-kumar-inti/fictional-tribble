Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
	
The global landscape of climate change and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations is increasingly 
intertwined. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, presents an existential threat, leading to rising global 
temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise. Recognizing the urgency, governments, businesses, and investors 
worldwide are integrating ESG factors into their strategies and decision-making processes. ESG encompasses a range of non-
financial factors that can have a material impact on an organization’s performance and long-term value. 
138 | Annual Report 2024-25
STRATEGIC REVIEW
CORPORATE REVIEW
FINANCIAL REVIEW
	
The environmental aspect focuses on a company’s impact on the natural environment, including carbon emissions, resource 
use, waste management, and biodiversity. Social factors examine how a company manages relationships with its employees, 
suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates, covering aspects like labour practices and human rights. 
Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights. 
	
The integration of ESG principles is no longer a niche concept but a mainstream approach as stakeholders’ demand greater 
transparency and accountability regarding environmental and social impacts. This shift is driving innovation in sustainable 
technologies, the growth of green finance, and the development of new reporting standards and regulations aimed at fostering 
a more sustainable and resilient global economy.
	
The risks posed by climate change are profound and far-reaching. The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks Report 
2025 highlights the dominance of environmental risks in the long-term global outlook. For the ten-year horizon, the report 
identifies “extreme weather events,” “biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse,” and “critical change to Earth systems” as the 
top three most severe risks. These findings underscore the growing recognition of the potentially catastrophic consequences 
of inaction on climate change. Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms, are already causing 
widespread devastation, impacting infrastructure, agriculture, and human health. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse 
threaten essential ecosystem services, including pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. Critical changes to 
Earth systems could trigger irreversible shifts in the planet’s climate, leading to even more severe and unpredictable impacts. 
The WEF report emphasizes the interconnectedness of these environmental risks with other global challenges, including social 
unrest, economic instability, and geopolitical tensions, painting a stark picture of the potential for a cascading series of crises 
if climate change is not urgently addressed.
	
For India, the path towards sustainability is not merely an option but an imperative for its present and future well-being and 
development. India is actively pursuing renewable energy sources to enhance security and mitigate climate change, setting 
ambitious targets like 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and aiming for net-zero emissions by 2070.
	
At Axis Max Life, we keenly take note of the developments occurring in the ESG space and the best practices followed by 
companies to advance the ESG framework. This year, Axis Max Life received the following rewards and recognitions for its ESG 
practices: 
•	
	Recognition by the Economic Times, as one of the Sustainable Organisation, 2024 for adopting Valuable Sustainable 
Practices.
•	
	Business World ESG Leadership Award, 2025
•	
	Indian Chamber of Commerce Environment Excellence Award, 2024
	
Furthermore, we have launched ESG Evangelist Awards to be presented annually to teams for their ESG contributions. We have 
actively taken efforts to create urban green spaces and to raise awareness of financial literacy among communities. Further, 
to sustain a robust corporate governance structure, emphasis is laid on the composition of directors, including the right mix of 
executive, non-executive and independent directors, the process to adhere to a proper and effective flow of information and 
maintaining diversity to enhance the effectiveness of the Board.
	
We have taken proactive efforts to embed ESG in our culture and imbibe it as a way of doing business rather than looking 
at it as a mere regulatory requirement. For this, we have conducted several healthy dialogues with employees, especially 
the internal stakeholders and the Board, to sensitise them about the importance of ESG. We launched ESG week wherein 
sustainability related activities were curated for engaging employees and to raise awareness.
	
The four pillars of our ESG framework are:
•	
	Working Ethically and Sustainably
•	
	Care for People and the Community
•	
	Financial Responsibility
•	
	Green Operations

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
AMLI:
	
Axis Max Life has a robust grievance redressal process, guided by its grievance redressal policy (which can be accessed here 
https://www.axismaxlife.com/customer-servicing/grievance-redressal). Axis Max Life has created both robust processes and 
systems to receive, assess and respond to each customer complaint as part of its overall service framework, which includes 
specified service parameters in terms of turnaround TATs for each type of request. While the above document describes these 
in detail, broadly our framework for receiving customer complaints and responding to them is as below: 
	
Steps taken to reduce customer complaints:
1.	
In an endeavor to reduce the number of complaints, basis a regular review of complaints received, we have revamped 
our customer onboarding process in the following ways to ensure that before the issuance of a policy, there is proper 
rechecking of the customer’s understanding about the product:
a.	
Need analysis of the prospects before selling as per the Product Suitability Matrix, a tool used to assess which product 
will be suitable to the prospect basis the need of the prospect (customer-product fit). The Investor Risk Profiler(IRP) 
is used in order to facilitate the selection of suitable investment funds for ULIP products.
b.	
Delivery based on OTP verification for physical(paper) policy packs to confirm receipt of the policy pack on time.
c.	
Benefit illustrations are presented with the prospect in order to explain the illustrative benefits of the policy. A copy

of the benefit illustration is included in the policy pack. The policy pack sent to policyholder also contains a key 
features document along with a copy of the signed/authenticated proposal form. Critical information of insurance 
policy (payment term, premium, mode, policy maturity date) shall be made visible prominently in the policy pack in 
order to ensure that customers do not miss important information.
d.	
Pre-issuance verification to confirm the customer’s understanding of the product. Wide range of questions covering 
top reasons cited in mis-selling complaints are asked.
e.	
Increased coverage of video-based verification on new business sales, including in vernacular languages.
2.	
We proactively track for high ageing cases at our end, without a customer complaining, that have breached service TAT 
thresholds and expedite these for closure as well.
	
Receiving consumer complaints:
	
We have a robust customer relationship management (CRM) system for receiving, registering and disposing complaints/
grievances. The Company also has in place systems to receive and deal with all kinds of calls, including voice/e-mail relating to 
complaints/grievances from customers.
1.	
We have various modes by which we accept customer complaints such as email, branch, helpline, and are also working on 
an online form for logging complaints. The head office and each branch office of the Company have a well-defined process 
for receiving and registering grievances. Requisite systems are in place to receive, record and address the same at all the 
touchpoints.
2.	
We also measure our customer satisfaction scores via the NPS framework through which we also receive service detractors. 
Based on the detractor voices we understand the issues faced by customers and use this feedback to identify potential 
improvement areas.
3.	
Requisite processes and systems are in place to address litigations (including appeals) filed by a policyholder before any 
competent authority or courts, including but not limited to Insurance Ombudsman, Consumer Forums, Civil Courts and 
higher courts.
	
Redressal and feedback
1.	
Acknowledgement & Resolution:
	
Grievance acknowledgement: On receipt of a Complaint/Grievance, we first assess it on the basis of its merits and nature. 
Thereafter, we send an acknowledgement, through SMS or email where available, to the customer within 3 working days 
of the receipt of the Grievance.
	
Grievance resolution: We endeavor to resolve the Complaint/Grievance within 14 calendar days of its receipt and each 
redressal or rejection of the issue gets conveyed via email or letter, along with reasons. Such communication will also 
inform the Complainant about how the customer can pursue the Complaint/Grievance, if dissatisfied with the resolution 
provided. We endeavor to resolve all complaints/grievances to the satisfaction of our customers. A grievance is considered 
as disposed of and closed when:
•	
	AMLI has acceded to the request of the customer fully, or
•	
The customer has indicated in writing, acceptance of the response of the Company, or
•	
	The customer has not responded to the Company within 8 weeks of the Company’s written response to the complaint/
grievance
	
After the resolution, if the customer approaches the Company within eight weeks, the original ‘complaint/grievance’ interaction 
will be re-opened for review of the earlier decision. Post reviewing the facts, the suitable resolution will be provided to the

officer/Nodal officer at AMLI. The List of Grievance Officers at Branch Offices is given on the website. If the customer 
remains dissatisfied with the resolution, she/he can further escalate the matter to Grievance Officers at Head Offices.
3.	
We also have created a mediation platform, internal ombudsman where customers can appeal decisions prior to raising it 
to insurance ombudsman or courts.
4.	
If the complaint/grievance is not resolved in favor of the customer or partially resolved in favor of the customer, she/he 
can take up the matter before the Insurance Ombudsman.
5.	
We do thorough RCAs of each complaint received to identity areas of improvement and funnel these learnings into our 
process and technology transformation programs. These are regularly reviewed by our management.

Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and / or services.
	
At Axis Max Life, we believe that it is important that Indian consumers should be aware of the true purpose of life insurance. 
Various surveys by leading research agencies have indicated that, while the majority of Indians are aware of life insurance plans, 
ownership of term insurance is low, and consumers are not aware of the role life insurance can play in building a financially 
secure nation. Axis Max Life led the industry initiative on insurance awareness.
1.	
Campaign on the benefits of life insurance: Axis Max Life is working diligently to drive importance of financial protection 
with life insurance amongst people through varied media that include mass media campaigns, social media, public 
relations, knowledge articles on online portals and Axis Max Life’s website. We also drive insurance awareness through 
our proprietary researches India Protection Quotient & India Retirement Index Survey that we conduct at pre-defined 
intervals.
2.	
Campaign focusing on protection of consumers: Fraudulent activities and spurious calling to defraud life insurance 
consumers are a reality that the life insurance industry is tackling through individual and joint efforts. Messages on protecting 
oneself from such acts are disseminated to our current policyholders by including such messages into the majority of 
customer communication. Similar information is also shared through SMS, Emails and articles with policyholders, along 
with social media campaigns on fraud awareness.
3.	
Campaign for customers: We regularly share relevant details about life insurance through direct mail to our existing 
customer base. Every month, we observe super customer week with an emphasis on increasing customer awareness and 
engagement across branches. By communicating with consumers digitally once a month via various emails and SMSs, 
these sessions have assisted our customers in learning more about the benefits of life insurance.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption / discontinuation of essential services.
	
AMLI:
	
In case of any disruption / discontinuation of essential service:
1.	
We inform our customers via email, WhatsApp and SMS communication. Content is either static or video based.
2.	
Branch walk-in customers are informed by Axis Max Life representatives.
3.	
Advisors/agents are also sent electronic communication who in turn inform their customers and information is also 
displayed on our website and through other social media assets.

details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / 
services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole?

from different sources at the central level. The Company has 
made considerable efforts to ensure consistency of data for

sections and principles are consistent and adequate with 
regards to the reporting criteria of the BRSR.

and 
supervision:

top 
management’s commitment, business model promoting 
inclusive growth, action and strategies, focus on services, risk 
management, protection and restoration of environment, and 
priorities are represented adequately.

identification and engagement is carried out by the Company 
on a periodic basis to bring out key stakeholder concerns as 
material aspects of significant stakeholders.

carried out, based on the requirements of the Assessment

performance indicators as prescribed in the standards in 
accordance with the requirement. In our view the Report meets 
the requirements. 
Reliability: Most of the data and information was verified by the 
assessment team and found appropriate. Minor inaccuracies in 
the data identified during the verification process were found 
to be attributable to transcription and interpretation errors and 
these errors were corrected immediately.
Therefore, in accordance with the ISAE 3000 (Revised) 
assurance engagement, TÜV SÜD concludes that the
