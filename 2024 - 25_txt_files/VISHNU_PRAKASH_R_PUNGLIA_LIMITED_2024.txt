Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Failure to adhere to 
proper Corporate 
Governance standards 
poses significant risks 
for our Building and 
Construction Company. 
Non-compliance with legal 
mandates, negligence 
in meeting stakeholder 
obligations, and instances 
of corruption or bribery 
can lead to severe 
consequences, including 
damage to our reputation, 
financial instability, and 
loss of stakeholder trust. 
Our company’s 
policies are integral 
to fostering effective 
Corporate Governance. 
They encompass 
transparency, 
compliance with 
statutory obligations, 
conflict of interest 
management, anti-
bribery measures, and

protocols. By adhering 
to these guidelines, 
we uphold integrity, 
accountability, and 
ethical conduct, 
mitigating risks

Risk
The nature of EPC 
projects often involves 
high-risk activities, such as

an increased likelihood of 
accidents, injuries, and, in 
the worst cases, fatalities 
among the workforces.

for its pro-fessional 
management team and 
advanced MIS in an 
SAP environment. The
