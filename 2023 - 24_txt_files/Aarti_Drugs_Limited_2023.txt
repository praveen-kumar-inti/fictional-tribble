Note 2:
The Company's capital investments have brought about substantial environmental and social benefits, underscoring its 
commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices. Key benefits include:
1.	
Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction: 
	
Investments in boiler smoke tube replacements and condenser systems have boosted operational efficiency, lowering fuel 
consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These actions help mitigate climate change and support the global 
transition to a low-carbon future.
2.	
Solvent Recovery and Waste Management: 
	
The installation of solvent recovery units and solid waste sheds has cut down on volatile organic compound emissions and 
hazardous waste. This eco-friendly approach conserves natural resources, reduces pollution, and contributes to a healthier 
environment.
3.	
Fire Hydrant and Stack Monitoring Systems:
	
Reliable fire hydrant systems and stack monitoring technology protect against potential environmental damage and 
harmful pollutant emissions. These systems ensure compliance with environmental regulations, maintain air quality, and 
promote public health.
4.	
Closed System Operations and Ultrasonic Cleaning:

designed for higher altitude emissions disperse harmful gases, reducing their impact on the local environment and public 
health.
6.	
Reverse Osmosis for Water Conservation:
	
Reverse osmosis systems not only reduce water consumption but also decrease chemical use, safeguarding water 
resources and promoting responsible water management.
7.	
Air Preheaters and Scrubbers for Cleaner Air:
	
Air preheaters recover waste heat from flue gases, cutting fuel consumption, while scrubbers absorb pollutants, improving 
air quality, mitigating climate change, and enhancing the health of workers and nearby communities.
8.	
Social Benefits:
	
Investments in occupational health centres and safety equipment, such as SCBA sets, reflect the company’s dedication to 
employee well-being. These measures enhance worker health, reduce healthcare costs, and foster a safer, more productive 
work environment.
In conclusion, the Company's capital investments have delivered a range of environmental and social benefits. By embracing 
sustainable practices and advanced technologies, the Company is making meaningful contributions to environmental 
protection, resource conservation, and social well-being. These initiatives align with ESG principles and position the Company 
as a responsible corporate citizen, earning the trust and support of stakeholders and investors.

to minimize waste generation and to ensure that our waste is managed in an environmentally responsible manner. Our 
waste management practices are based on the following principles:
	
a.	
Plastic (Including packaging): Collection and segregation - Plastic waste generated at site is segregated as per 
categories assigned in the plastic waste rule and collected in waste storage area. This collected plastic is sent to the 
certified plastic recycling companies where it is melted down in to new products and recycled. Also, we are following 
the practice for reuse of plastic within the facility such as, reuse bags for same material, re-purposing containers for 
storage etc. All the plastic waste management protocols are followed as per Extended Producer Responsibility.
	
b.	
E-Waste management: E-waste collection points are established within our Company. All the data to product 
sensitive information from e-waste is securely wiped out from collected waste. Then the e-waste is handover to 
certified e-waste recycling companies to recycle electronic components. Inventory of e-waste generated and stored 
for tracking and accountability.
	
c.	
Hazardous waste management: Hazardous waste is collected and stored within dedicated hazardous waste storage 
area at site. This hazardous waste is disposed as per the disposal path and agencies assigned by the pollution control 
boards. All the waste is disposed with compliance to the Hazardous Waste Management and Trans-boundary rule 
2016. Record of hazardous waste disposal is generated online and it is accessible to pollution control board all the 
time.
	
	
In addition to that, we are timely implementing any changes in the rules and acts.

Essential Indicators
PRINCIPLE 4
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
Our Company has a process for identifying key stakeholder groups that is based on the following steps:
	
a.	
We define the Company’s business and its operations. This helps us to identify the groups of people who are most 
directly affected by the Company’s activities.
	
b.	
We identify the groups of people who have a vested interest in the Company’s success. These groups of people are 
likely to be the most important stakeholders, as they have the potential to impact the Company’s performance.
	
c.	
We assess the influence and impact of each stakeholder group. This helps us to prioritise our stakeholder engagement 
efforts.
	
d.	
We develop a stakeholder engagement strategy. This strategy helps us to build relationships with our stakeholders 
and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.
	
We have identified the following key stakeholder groups:
	
	
Employees: Employees are the lifeblood of our Company, and they play a critical role in our success. Employees 
are also the most directly affected by the Company’s activities, so they are likely to be one of the most important 
stakeholder groups.
	
	
Customers: Customers are the people who buy our products or services. Customers are also the ones who are most 
affected by the quality of our products or services. Therefore, customers are another important stakeholder group 
that we need to consider.
	
	
Suppliers: Suppliers provide us with the raw materials and other inputs that we need to produce our products or 
services. Suppliers are also affected by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s demand 
for their products or services.
	
	
Investors and Shareholders: Investors and shareholders are the people who own the Company. They are interested in 
the Company’s performance, as they want to see their investment grow in value. Therefore, investors and shareholders 
are another important stakeholder group that we need to consider.
	
	
Communities: The communities in which we operate are also important stakeholders. These communities are 
affected by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s pollution or its impact on the local 
economy.
	
	
Government and regulatory bodies: Government and regulatory bodies are also important stakeholders, as they have 
the power to regulate the Company’s activities. We need to work with government and regulatory bodies to ensure that 
we are in compliance with the law.
	
We believe that these stakeholder groups are the most important to our Company’s success. We will continue to engage 
with these groups in order to build strong relationships and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.

waste 
management 
Landfilling
Waste - to - 
energy 
This is the hazardous waste reduction technique in which hazardous 
waste is reduced at the source by implementing recycling the reactants 
up to the greater extent, developing the process by research, use of 
reusable products, and reducing packing material.
This involves specialized practices such as, 
(i)	
Assigned dedicated facilities according to categories of wastes.
(ii)	 Safe handling procedures, labelling of HW bags and drums. 
(iii)	 Following manifest system as per MPCB. 
The HW having low calorific value and other parameters within the limit 
of landfilling criteria are sent for CHWTSDF facility & then safely dispose 
of material by burying in to land and covered by soil usually. 
Various hazardous waste generated at our factory is having high 
calorific value are segregated at site and sent to cement industry for 
energy recovery through incineration.
