1
Energy and 
Emission
Risk
In the healthcare 
sector, energy 
consumption and 
emissions pose 
significant risks. 
Hospitals and medical 
facilities operate 
24/7, requiring 
substantial energy for 
medical equipment, 
heating, cooling, and 
lighting. High energy 
consumption leads to 
increased operational 
costs and a larger 
carbon footprint. This 
can result in financial 
strain, particularly 
as energy prices 
fluctuate. Moreover, 
excessive emissions 
may lead to regulatory 
non-compliance and 
reputational damage 
as society becomes 
more environmentally 
conscious.
The Company has 
committed to 
energy conservation 
by entering into 
an agreement for 
captive electricity 
consumption. One of 
our hospitals has been 
recognised with a 
three-star certification 
from the GRIHA 
Council. The Company 
conducts initiatives 
to raise awareness 
among stakeholders 
about responsible 
energy usage. In 
addition, tree-
planting initiatives 
are undertaken 
to enhance the 
microclimate 
surrounding our 
hospitals, contributing 
to the offset of 
carbon emissions. 
By integrating 
energy conservation 
measures, reducing 
gas emissions, 
and engaging the 
community, The 
Company is actively 
striving for a greener 
and more sustainable 
future.
Positive:
•	 Cost Optimization:
	 Energy-efficient 
practices reduce 
longterm 
expenses.
•	 Environmental 
Stewardship:
	 Renewables show 
commitment to 
the environment.
Negative:
•	 High Operational 
Costs: Reliance 
on nonrenewable 
energy raises 
operational 
expenses
2
Water Man­
agement
Risk
Water management 
is a critical risk for 
healthcare facilities. 
These institutions 
require large 
volumes of water 
for patient care, 
sanitation, equipment 
sterilization, and 
various medical 
procedures. Inefficient 
water use or 
contamination
The Company 
addresses water 
management risks 
through conscious 
and responsible 
efforts, guided by 
the 3R model - 
Reduce, Reuse, and 
Recycle. Several 
proactive water-
saving initiatives have 
been implemented, 
including the
Positive:
•	 By fostering 
a culture of 
responsible 
water usage, 
we contribute 
to water 
conservation 
efforts and 
reinforce our 
commitment to 
environmental 
sustainability.

The Company also 
strives to achieve 
water neutrality and

managing water 
resources efficiently 
and offsetting usage 
through sustainable 
initiatives.
Negative:
•	 Water 
management

to financial risks 
arising from

to operational 
disruptions 
caused by water

3
Waste Man­
agement
Risk
Waste management 
is a paramount 
concern in the 
healthcare sector due 
to the generation 
of hazardous, 
biomedical, and 
pharmaceutical waste. 
Improper handling, 
storage, or disposal 
of such waste can 
lead to severe health 
risks, environmental 
contamination, 
and legal liabilities. 
Healthcare facilities 
must comply with 
strict regulations 
regarding medical 
waste disposal, and 
any non-compliance 
can result in hefty 
fines and legal action. 
Moreover, inefficient 
waste management 
practices can increase 
operational costs and 
pose reputational 
risks. As the volume 
of medical waste 
continues to 
grow, healthcare 
organizations face 
increasing pressure 
to implement 
sustainable and safe 
waste management 
practices to mitigate 
these risks.
The Company ensures 
the appropriate 
segregation of 
hazardous waste, 
biomedical waste, 
e-waste, and both 
dry and wet waste. 
The safe disposal 
of biomedical 
waste, e-waste, and 
hazardous waste is 
carried out through 
vendors and recyclers 
authorised by the 
government.
Positive:
•	 By efficiently 
managing waste, 
we not only 
contribute to 
environmental 
preservation but 
also capitalize on 
cost optimization.
Negative
•	 Improper 
waste disposal 
may degrade 
the aesthetic 
appeal of our 
surroundings, 
potentially 
leading to 
community 
dissatisfaction 
and strained 
relationships with 
stakeholders.

Patient 
Care and 
Service 
Quality
Risk
Poor patient care 
can lead to adverse 
health outcomes, 
increased readmission 
rates, and even 
loss of life. This can 
result in malpractice 
lawsuits, damage to 
the organization’s 
reputation, and 
loss of patient trust. 
Maintaining high-
quality standards 
is challenging in 
the face of evolving 
medical practices, 
technological 
advancements, and 
changing patient 
expectations.
The Medical 
Superintendent or 
Facility Directors 
within The Company 
serve as the 
custodians of all 
medical complaints, 
diligently monitoring 
the tracker for the 
resolution of these 
complaints. As per 
the requirements, 
The Company takes 
suitable steps to 
address patient 
complaints, and if 
necessary, develops 
new protocols or 
measures to ensure 
the highest level of 
patient satisfaction.
Positive:
•	 Better Clinical 
Outcomes: 
Emphasizing 
patient safety 
leads to improved 
clinical outcomes, 
reducing medical 
errors and adverse 
events.
•	 Enhanced Patient 
Trust: Prioritizing 
patient safety and 
service quality 
builds trust and 
loyalty among 
patients.
Negative
•	 Any lapses in 
patient safety may 
attract negative 
media attention, 
harming the 
organization’s 
public image.
5
Corporate 
governance 
structures
Risk
Weak governance 
can lead to 
mismanagement, 
financial irregularities, 
and failure to meet 
healthcare standards 
and regulations. 
This can result in 
legal issues, loss 
of accreditation, 
and erosion of 
stakeholder trust. 
Given the sensitive 
nature of healthcare 
services and the 
strict regulatory 
environment, poor 
governance can lead 
to compromised 
patient care, data 
privacy breaches, 
and financial 
mismanagement. 
Ineffective leadership 
and lack of 
accountability can 
also result in poor 
organizational culture, 
affecting staff morale 
and, ultimately, the 
quality of patient care. 
Strong governance 
is essential for 
navigating the 
complex healthcare 
landscape and 
ensuring the 
organization’s long-
term sustainability.
The Board of 
Directors within The 
Company embodies 
the organisation’s 
vision and objectives. 
The establishment 
of Board or internal 
committees is 
undertaken to 
delineate hierarchy 
and accountability. 
Key management 
personnel and board 
members act in the 
interests of investors 
and stakeholders, 
ensuring their 
concerns are duly 
represented and 
addressed.
Positive:
•	 Ethical Decision-
Making: Strong 
governance 
structures ensure 
ethical decision-
making, fostering 
a culture of 
integrity and 
responsible 
business 
practices.
•	 Transparency and 
Accountability: 
Effective 
corporate 
governance 
promotes 
transparency and 
accountability, 
enhancing 
stakeholder trust 
and confidence.
Negative
•	 Ineffective 
governance 
can expose to 
reputational risks, 
leading to loss of 
stakeholder trust 
and confidence.
