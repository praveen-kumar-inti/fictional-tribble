FOR REMOTE E-VOTING:
i.	
The e-voting period shall commence on 
July 14, 2024 (Sunday) at 9:00 A.M. (IST) 
and ends on July 16, 2024 (Tuesday) at 
5:00 P.M. (IST). During this period members of the 
Company, holding shares either in physical form 
or in dematerialized form, as on the cut-off date

cast their vote electronically. The e-voting module 
shall be disabled by CDSL for voting thereafter.
ii.	
Members who have already voted prior to the 
meeting date would not be entitled to vote at the 
meeting venue.
iii.	
Pursuant to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/
CMD/CIR/P/2020/242 dated December 09, 2020 
and Regulation 44 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, the listed entities are required to provide 
remote e-voting facility to its shareholders, in 
respect of all shareholders’ resolutions. However, 
it has been observed that the participation by 
the public non-institutional shareholders / retail

Currently, there are multiple e-voting service 
providers (ESPs) providing e-voting facility 
to listed entities in India. This necessitates 
registration on various ESPs and maintenance 
of multiple user IDs and passwords by the 
members. In order to increase the efficiency 
of the voting process, pursuant to a public 
consultation, SEBI has been decided to enable 
e-voting to all the demat account holders, by way 
of a single login credential, through their demat 
accounts/ websites of Depositories/ Depository 
Participants. Demat account holders would be 
able to cast their vote without having to register 
again with the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating 
seamless authentication but also enhancing 
ease and convenience of participating in e-voting 
process.
iv.	
In terms of SEBI circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD/

Management Discussion and Analysis
Indian economy 
Amidst 
an 
uncertain 
and 
challenging 
global 
macroeconomic environment, the Indian economy 
presents a picture of confidence, positivity and 
optimism. It is estimated that the GDP growth in 
2023-24 will be 7.8%, which is the fastest growth 
among all major economies.
The GDP growth in the country for 2024-25 is projected 
to be 6.8% based on a reasonable monsoon, an 
uptick in both household consumption & private 
capex cycle and the government’s continued spend 
on infrastructure. There is a national election at the 
beginning of the year and it is expected that growth 
momentum will continue post formation of the new 
government.
Strong domestic demand remains the main driver of 
growth, although there has been some improvement 
in the Indian economy’s global integration through 
trade and financial channels. Higher reliance on 
domestic demand cushioned India from multiple 
external headwinds.
India’s CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 percent for 
2023-24. With a normal monsoon forecasted for 
next year, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 
4.5 percent. 
Global economic growth 
In 2024, national elections will be conducted in nations 
across the world with a population of 4 billion. There 
are considerable geopolitical risks and conflicts in the 
world. There is persistent inflation and high interest 
rates across geographies. It is expected that global 
GDP will, despite these challenges, grow at 3.2% in 
2024, similar to growth in 2023.
Business
The domestic wheel market for the company saw 
subdued demand in FY24.
In the medium and heavy commercial market there 
was marginal growth in FY24 while there was a 
marginal reduction in requirements from the light 
commercial vehicle segment. Within these segments, 
there was a strong demand for buses and a preference 
for the prime mover and trailers vis-a-vis the multi axle 
vehicles. Your company’s production was affected 
briefly as we standardized manufacturing processes 
across wheel plants. There were also disruptions in 
production due to the Chennai floods in December. 
Your company’s focus on air suspension and the 
trailer market contributed in FY24. The commercial 
vehicle market is expected to be flat in the coming 
year. The demand for buses is expected to remain at 
decent levels.
The tractor output saw a decline in volumes in FY24, 
due to erratic and untimely weather patterns affecting 
agricultural output and higher interest costs. This 
affected your company who are major suppliers to 
24
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
the domestic agricultural tractor industry. While there 
are hopes for a good monsoon in the coming year, 
volumes are expected to be subdued. Your company 
has made some inroads into export opportunities with 
major global tractor manufacturers that should hold it 
in good stead in the years to come.
The passenger vehicle market saw growth in FY24 
with stronger preference for sports utility vehicles 
over cars. There is expected to be some growth in the 
coming year, as well. In the cast aluminum business, 
while we started supply to vehicle manufacturers, 
the volumes were muted. In the first quarter of the 
coming year, we will start supplies to a large Indian 
vehicle manufacturer that should help us get closer to 
breakeven volumes for the plant.
There was reasonable growth in the construction 
equipment industry both domestic and exports in 
FY24. However, in the mining sector we saw declining 
demand in the second half of the year partly due to 
upcoming elections in major mining nations. This 
affected our fabrication business servicing domestic 
construction equipment manufacturers. The demand 
is expected to be muted in the first half of the coming 
year with some pickup expected later in the year. 
Post the NCLT approved merger of Sundaram 
Hydraulics with your Company in September, the 
hydraulic cylinder business grew and was profitable 
on the back of export business. The hydraulic cylinder 
business is expected to show good growth in the 
coming year as well.
The demand for windmill components was muted 
in FY24. At the same time, we were able to ramp 
up volumes at our Thervoy Kandigai plant where 
we machine large castings. In the coming year, we 
see some demand kicking in from machining of 
large castings and components for offshore windmill 
platforms, in the coming year.
Your company saw strong growth in exports driven 
by the export of aluminum and earthmover wheels. 
The coming year is expected to see muted growth in 
exports as new programs are only expected to start at 
the latter part of the year.
Performance
Your company’s sales in FY24 was in line with the 
market, with air suspension, hydraulic cylinders, export 
markets and machining of large castings contributing 
to growth in both sales and profitability of the company, 
in an otherwise subdued market for your company’s 
main product segments.
The coming year will once again follow the market 
expectations highlighted above. We may see only 
marginal growth in export markets in the coming year 
as most of the new business we expect will only come 
on stream in the latter part of the year. Markets aside 
we plan to show considerable growth in the hydraulic 
cylinder business in the coming year.
In FY24, your company struggled with effective cost 
management with one-time provisioning affecting 
profitability. Your company has tried to manage its 
free cash flows through its operations and exercising 
control over non-project capex. We have adequate 
processes in place to better manage costs in the 
coming year where we expect commodity markets to 
be more subdued.
Your company’s subsidiary, WIL Car Wheels Ltd. 
had a difficult year, despite some growth in sales, 
as steel wheel fitment is progressively reducing 
affecting capacity utilization. Your company has taken 
some steps at cost rationalization and other steps 
at improving the profitability of the business. The 
effects of actions taken just started having effect at 
the end of FY24. We expect to continue to drive these 
improvements into the coming year which should 
reflect in a better performance.
Your Company has incorporated a subsidiary, in USA 
in the name of WIL USA Inc. and intends to form a 
subsidiary in Europe as well, to give further thrust to 
the business development in these geographies and 
this is consistent with your Company’s commitment to 
grow the export business.

Auditor’s responsibility 
Based on audit, our responsibility is to express an opinion on the compliance with the applicable laws and 
maintenance of records by the Company. We conducted our audit in accordance with the auditing standards 
CSAS 1 to CSAS 4 (“CSAS”) prescribed by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (“ICSI”). These standards 
require that the auditor complies with statutory and regulatory requirements and plans and performs the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about compliance with applicable laws and maintenance of records. 
Due to the inherent limitations of an audit including internal, financial and operating controls, there is an unavoidable 
risk that some misstatements or material non-compliances may not be detected, even though the audit is properly 
planned and performed in accordance with the CSAS. Our report of even date is to be read along with this letter.

responsibility is to express an opinion on these secretarial records based on our audit.

about the correctness of the contents of the Secretarial records. The verification was done on test basis to 
ensure that correct facts are reflected in secretarial records. We believe that the processes and practices, 
we followed provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
Several trends, national and international, are influencing our ESG priorities. Apart from NDC (Nationally 
Determined Contribution) on climate action & regulatory requirements, supply chain sustainability is a key 
business metric for all our customers both in India & globally. On the export front, we see challenges and 
opportunities from EU policies like CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS), Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) & Corporate Sustainability 
Due Diligence Directive (CSDD) of EU. We have drawn up the following environmental road map to integrate 
ESG in our strategy & operations and also meet requirements of stakeholders like regulators, customers, 
investors etc.
1.
RE75 - 75% electricity from renewable sources by 2026
2.
Carbon neutral by 2033 (scope 1 & 2)
3.
Water neutral by 2027
4.
Zero waste to landfill by 2030
A 5 % YOY reduction in energy intensity (power & fuel), decarbonization by substituting fossil fuels with 
renewable energy through new and emerging technologies like heat pumps, IoT for energy efficiency are 
key initiatives towards our carbon neutral goals. Despite an increase in production quantity per rupees of 
turnover owing to reduction in steel prices on an average by about 5% in 2023-24 compared to 2022-
23, energy intensity was lower this year by 0.5% per crore rupees of turnover due to process innovations 
& several energy efficiency / conservation measures elaborated under Principle 6 of this BRSR. Water 
intensity is also lower by 2.40%. Several projects have been identified with Capex allocation to sustain and 
improve energy intensity, water intensity, GHG intensity and renewable energy usage in 2024-25. Water 
conservation, recycling, ground water re-charging through rainwater harvesting, reducing waste intensity are 
also key focus areas. Significant R&D spend was made in the development of a innovative manufacturing 
process to enhance resource efficiency in material and energy.
Integrity is a core value in the conduct of our business. Our policies and procedures are continuously reviewed 
for adequacy and updated for legal compliance and enhanced governance. We are also working with our 
supply chain to cascade the BRSR principles. Information security is assured through TISAX AL3 label from 
TUV SUD as part of our business responsibility to value chain.
Our people centric policies are reinforced through employee engagement / development through quality 
circles, suggestion schemes, events on safety and environment for employees and their families and 
learning & development programs. We are striving to enhance gender diversity with a goal of 10% women in 
our workforce. We are using technology for social impact in our CSR activities enumerated under Principle 8 
of this BRSR. Our supplementary education programs for underprivileged children in rural / backward areas 
promote e-learning through use of digital apps & tablets. We are supporting small and marginal farmers to 
better cope with climate change through village knowledge centers equipped with computers / internet, village 
weather stations digitally linked to farmers through SMS services enabling them to better plan agricultural 
activities, rejuvenation of village ponds and promoting ecological and integrated farming techniques.
BRSR has initiated the process to embed ESG in our business, offering challenges and opportunities.

documentation and adherence to our supplier sustainability policy. This policy outlines the requirements 
for suppliers in their corporate activities, serving as the foundation for maintaining successful business 
relationships.
	
To maintain our high standards, we rigorously screen all our business partners based on our supplier / vendor 
policy. This comprehensive policy encompasses criteria such as providing high-quality service, compliance 
with environmental, health and safety regulations, as well as adherence to labor, employee and human 
rights regulations. Additionally, we prioritize sourcing the majority of our workforce from local areas, ensuring 
sustainable and responsible sourcing of services.

a Self-Assessment Questionnaire with them for analysis, followed by conducting second party audits to 
ensure adherence to the requirements specified in the contract. Additionally, we leverage sustainability 
reports from third party audits performed by independent organizations such as registrars, certification bodies 
or regulators.

encompasses guidelines for the proper handling and disposal of various materials, including plastic waste,

have established a well-documented standard operating procedure (SOP) for material and packaging usage 
in our products, with a focus on continuous improvement in environmental, social and governance aspects 
while meeting sustainability expectations and customer demands.
	
On the other hand, our E-waste policy specifically targets the systematic disposal of outdated computer 
peripherals, such as CPUs, monitors, keyboards, mice, and internal accessories. This policy outlines a 
clear procedure for the removal and storage of e-waste in a designated "red-tag storage area," followed by 
transportation to the scrapyard. Proper entries are recorded in a logbook to maintain an accurate record of

and group insurance policy.
	
To prioritize employee well-being, we operate an occupational health center that provides a wide range of 
services. These services encompass employee medical care, counseling, awareness programs, participation 
in health audits, walkthrough surveys, canteen surveys, pre-employment examinations, periodic examinations, 
first aid, and health promotional activities, among others. These initiatives underscore our dedication to 
fostering a safe and healthy work environment for our employees.

The entity also emphasizes the importance of noting safety observations to analyze and address potential 
hazards.
	
Even during times of heightened caution, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various 
measures. Routine cleaning and sanitization of factories were scheduled regularly. Workforce members were 
screened for symptoms and temperature monitoring was conducted. Health standards, including physical 
distancing, were strictly enforced. Moreover, standard operating procedures were reinforced for offices, shop 
floors and other accessible areas.

Yes. Domestic effluent is treated in sewage treatment plants and the treated water quality is ensured for 
recycling in-house in gardens & toilet flushing. Process effluents are treated in conventional effluent treatment 
plants followed by advanced treatment for re-use in the process. The advanced treatment comprises UV 
filtration, 3 stage RO, silica treatment, multi-effect evaporators (MEE), agitated thin film dryer (ATFD). Treated 
water from ATFD is fit for re-use in the process. Rejection from ATFD as powder is disposed as chemical 
sludge to authorized facilities.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide 
details.
	
GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSION PROJECTS:
	
At Wheels India, we are dedicated to continuously improving the efficiency of our energy, water, waste 
management, and greenhouse gas emissions. We have successfully utilized off-site wind and solar energy, 
which now accounts for 26.6% of our total power consumption, equating to 31,475 MWh. Our goal for the 
next 2-3 years is to significantly increase our use of renewable energy sources, aiming to meet 70% of our 
electrical requirements primarily through wind and solar power.
	
To achieve energy savings, we have implemented several initiatives. These include the adoption of 
variable speed drives and efficient motors, the optimization of lighting systems and the automatic shutdown 
of equipment during idle periods. We are also in the process of transitioning from pneumatic to electric 
equipment, optimizing air pressure levels and addressing compressed air leakages. For example, at our 
Chennai Padi plant, we have installed compressed air distribution headers equipped with airflow meters and 
implemented IoT-enabled monitoring systems, which have notably reduced air leakages and consumption.
	
Furthermore, we are exploring ways to recover waste heat from screw air compressors for process heating 
and are investigating decarbonization projects such as utilizing heat pumps for process heating to reduce 
our reliance on fossil fuels. We are also replacing diesel-powered forklifts with battery-operated ones and 
collaborating with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to conduct detailed energy audits. These audits 
will help us identify additional energy conservation projects for future implementation.
	
Overall, these efforts underscore our commitment to enhancing our operational efficiency and reducing our 
environmental impact through sustainable practices and innovative solutions.

WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone Ind

(including Other Comprehensive Income), statement 
of changes in Equity and statement of Cash Flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone 
Ind AS Financial Statements, including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other explanatory

In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
Act) in the manner so required and give a true and

generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at March 31, 2024, and Profit and 
Other Comprehensive Income, changes in Equity and

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards 
on Auditing 
(SAs) 
specified 
under 
section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company 
in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
of the current period. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the Standalone Ind AS 
financial statements, as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. We have determined that 
there are no key audit matters to be communicated in 
our report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of Wheels India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
112
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Ind AS 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of Management for Standalone Ind 
AS Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation 
of these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the 
Company in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of 
the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and 
design, 
implementation 
and 
maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statement that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
In preparing the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements, management is responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these Standalone Ind AS 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also: 
a)	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
113
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
b)	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls. 
c)	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 
d)	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
e)	 Evaluate 
the 
overall 
presentation, 
structure 
and content of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements, including the disclosures, and whether 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
Ind AS financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

65TH ANNUAL REPORT
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”) 
We have audited the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of Wheels India Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with 
our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls 
The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by ICAI 
and the Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and 
deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the Ind AS financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting.

65TH ANNUAL REPORT
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the Company 
has, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
such internal financial controls over financial reporting 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based 
on the internal financial control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

shares issued for bonus issue, rights issue, business combination are considered as it it had been issued at 
beginning oft the earliest reported period
p)	
Income taxes
	
Current tax is the amount of tax payable on the taxable income for the year and is determined in accordance 
with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amount.
	
Deferred tax assets in respect of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses are recognised only 
if there is virtual certainty that there will be sufficient future taxable income available to realise such assets. 
Other deferred tax assets are recognised if there is reasonable certainty that there will be sufficient future 
taxable income available to realise such assets.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

3B.	 GOODWILL
	
Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its 
carrying amount.
	
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for 
impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment 
of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity 
analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit.
	
The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 2.00% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to 
the forecast period of 3 years and a discount rate of 8.5%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters 
(operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable 
scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.
Carrying amount of Goodwill is as follows

Impairment of goodwill
	
The Company estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current 
economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory 
conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted 
average cost of capital.

Fair value hierarchy
	
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that 
are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:	
	
	
	
Level 1 hierarchy - Includes Financial Instruments measured using quoted prices in the active market.
	
Level 2 hierarchy - The Fair value of Financial Instruments that are not traded in an active market, is determined 
using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data.

for accounting policy on Financial Instruments.
	
ii)	 Other Financial Assets:
	
	
The Company has exposure in Cash and cash equivalents and term deposits with banks. The Company’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31st March, 2024 is the carrying value of each class of financial 
assets as on that date.

Rationale for Amalgamation
	
1.	 The amalgamation will enable product diversification and growth to the Transferee company
	
2.	 This will facilitate expansion of the business of Transferor company by using the customer base of the 
Transferee company.
	
3.	 As a combined entity, the amalgamation will help in widening the product offering to the existing strategic 
customers of both the transferor as well as the transteree company.
	
4.	 Will help in achieving consolidation, greater integration and flexibility that will maximize overall 
shareholder’s value and improve the competitive position and negotiating power of the combined entity.
	
5.	 Improves organizational capability and leadership, arising from the pooling of human capital who have the 
diverse skills, talent and vast experience to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive industry
	
6.	 Cost savings are expected to flow from more focused operational efforts, rationalization, standardization 
and simplification of business processes, elimination of duplication and rationalization of administrative 
expenses.
	
7.	 The amalgamation will result in reduction of multiplicity of entities, thereby reducing compliance cost 
of multiple entities viz., statutory flings, regulatory compliances, labour law/ establishment related 
compliances.
	
Accordingly, effective the appointed date 1st October, 2021, the amounts have been restated, after recognizing 
the effect of amalgamation.
	
Pursuant to Ind AS 103 and as per the accounting treatment approved by NCLT, the Company has recognised 
the difference between the consideration paid and aggregate fair value of net assets taken over, as on the 
appointed date as goodwill.
	
The effect of amalgamation in the amounts of Total Income and Profit after Tax (PAT) published in the previous 
periods are given below:

incorporate Wholly-Owned-Subsidiaries (“WoS”) in the United States of America and Germany. The 
primary purpose of WoS is to support the parent Company in business development and supply chain 
activities in US & European region. It will also help in gaining full control on the export market, leading 
to export growth and expansion in the operations. It will enable to maintain high level of consistency and 
coordination in its global strategy.
	
	
Accordingly, the Company has incorporated a WoS in the name of M/s. WIL USA Inc., in the State of 
Delaware, USA on January 26, 2024. The Company has not subscribed towards share capital of WoS 
and hence, the books of M/s. WIL USA Inc., have not been considered for the purpose of consolidated 
financial statements of WIL. The Company is in the process of incorporating a WoS in Germany.
	
b)	 Previous year’s figures have been regrouped wherever necessary to conform to this year’s classification.

WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Ind 
AS Financial Statements of Wheels India Limited(“the 
Holding Company”) and its subsidiary (together 
referred as “Group”), including an associate company, 
which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as 
at March 31, 2024, and the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss (including other comprehensive 
income), Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for 
the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as “Consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based 
on the consideration of reports of other auditors on the 
financial statements of the Subsidiary and Associate, 
the aforesaid Consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of 
affairs of the Group and it’s Associate as at March 31, 
2024, of consolidated profit and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated changes in equity and its 
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards 
on Auditing 
(SAs) 
specified 
under 
section 143(10) of the Companies act, 2013. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Ind AS financial statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Group and its 
Associate in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance 
in our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements, as a whole and in forming 
our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. We have determined that 
there are no key audit matters to be communicated in 
our report in respect of Wheels India Limited.
Information Other than the Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in 
the Holding Company’s Annual Report, but does not 
include the Consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial 
Statements does not cover the other information and 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of Wheels India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS financial statements
165
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are 
responsible for the preparation and presentation of 
these consolidated Ind AS financial statements in term 
of the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 that 
give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income and consolidated cash 
flows of the Group including its Associate in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Accounting Standards specified 
under section 133 of the Act. The respective Board 
of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
and of its associate are responsible for maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used 
for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind 
AS financial statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, the respective Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group and of its 
associate are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group and of its associate to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of it’s associate are 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the Group and of its associate.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
a)	 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
166
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
	
b)	 Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the 
company has adequate internal financial 
controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
c)	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management in Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
	
d)	 Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and 
its associate and to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associate to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
	
e)	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the Consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
Consolidated 
Ind AS 
financial statements represent the under lying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
	
f)	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the 
entities or business activities within the Group 
and its associate to express an opinion on the 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such entities included in the 
Consolidated Ind AS financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. For 
the other entities included in the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other 
auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision, performance and opinion in 
respect of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Holding Company and such other entities 
included in the Consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
167
WHEELS INDIA LIMITED
65TH ANNUAL REPORT
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matters

subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect 
total assets of Rs. 259.55 Crores as at March

company have been audited by other auditors 
whose reports have been furnished to us by the 
Management and our opinion on the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements, in so far as it relates 
to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of these subsidiary and associate and our report in 
terms of subsection (3) of Section 143 of the Act, 
in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary

65TH ANNUAL REPORT
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Ind 
AS financial statements of the Group as of and for 
the year ended March 31, 2024, we have audited the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting of 
Wheels India Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the 
Holding Company”) and its subsidiary company and its 
associate company which are companies incorporated 
in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
company, its subsidiary company, its associate 
company which are companies incorporated in India, 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the respective Companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting 
of the based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to 
be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls over financial reporting was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors 
of the subsidiary company and associate company, 
which are companies incorporated in India in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial 
“Annexure - A” to the Auditors’ Report
Referred to in Paragraph 1(f) under Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements section of our report of even date
Report on the Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting with reference to aforesaid Consolidated 
Ind AS Financial Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-Section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies, Act, 2013 
(“the Act”)

WHEELS INDIA LIMITED

controls system over financial reporting of the Holding 
Company, its subsidiary company and its associate 
company, which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based 
on the consideration of the reports of the other 
auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, the Holding Company, its subsidiary company 
and associate company, which are companies 
incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and such internal financial controls 
over financial reporting were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal 
financial control over financial reporting established 
by the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
insofar as it relates to subsidiary company and one 
associate company, which are companies incorporated 
in India, is based solely on the corresponding reports 
of the auditors of such companies incorporated in 
India. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above 
matters.

Consolidated - Notes on Accounts
A.	
Principles of Consolidation
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) relate to Wheels India Limited (‘the Company) and the 
Company’s subsidiary and the share of profit in its associate (jointly considered as “Group” hereinafter). The 
CFS have been prepared on the following basis:
	
a)	 Subsidiaries
	
	
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity.
	
	
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the CFS from the date on which control is acquired 
until the date on which control ceases to exist. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account 
for business combinations by the Group.
	
	
The Group combines the financial statements of the Parent (WIL) and its Subsidiary line by line adding 
together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Inter-Group transactions, balances 
and unrealised gains on transactions between Group Companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.
	
	
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated 
Statement of profit and loss, Consolidated statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively
	
b)	 Associates
	
	
The CFS include the Share of profit of an associate company which have been accounted for using equity 
method as per “Accounting Standard (IndAS) 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” in CFS. 
Accordingly, the share of profit of the associate company has been added to the cost of investments.
	
	
The difference between the cost of investments in the associate and the share of net assets at the time of 
acquisition of shares in the associate is identified in the CFS as Goodwill or Capital Reserve as the case 
may be.
	
	
The financial statements of an Associate and Subsidiary used in the CFS are drawn upto the same 
reporting date as that of the Company i.e. 31st March, 2024
	
	
The CFS have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances and are presented to the extent possible, in the same manner as the Company’s 
separate financial statements.
	
	
Following entities have been considered in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements:

The Assets and Liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal 
operating cycle and other criteria as set out in the Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. The 
Company’s normal operating cycle has been ascertained as 12 months based on the nature of products and

liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when

The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable

including appropriate overheads) or net realisable value whichever is lower.

of which will be confirmed only by the occurence or non-occurence of one or more uncertain future events not

Current tax is the amount of tax payable on the taxable income for the year and is determined in accordance 
with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognised for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amount.
	
Deferred tax assets in respect of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses are recognised only 
if there is virtual certainty that there will be sufficient future taxable income available to realise such assets. 
Other deferred tax assets are recognised if there is reasonable certainty that there will be sufficient future 
taxable income available to realise such assets.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

3B.	 GOODWILL
	
Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its 
carrying amount. 
	
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. 
The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment of the 
discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If 
the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit.
	
The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 2.00% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to 
the forecast period of 3 years and a discount rate of 8.5%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters 
(operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable 
scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

Impairment of goodwill
	
The Company estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current 
economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory 
conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted 
average cost of capital.

faced by the Company, to set and monitor appropriate risk limits and controls, periodically review and reflect 
the changes in the policy accordingly.	 	
	
	
a)	 Management of Liquidity risk
	
	
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial 
liabilities. The Company’s approach in managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to 
meet its liabilities . In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions.
	
	
The Company regularly monitors the rolling forecasts and the actual cash flows to service the financial 
liabilities on a day-to-day basis through cash generation from business and by having adequate banking 
facilities.

b)	 Management of Market risk:
	
	
The Company is exposed to the following market risks which affects the value of the Financial instruments:
	
   1. Currency risk;	
	
	
	
   2. Interest rate risk
	
	
i)	 Foreign currency risk
	
	
	
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of or future cash flows of an exposure will 
fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates. As at 31st March, 2024, the net 
un-hedged exposure to the Company on holding such financial assets and liabilities amounts to 
Rs. 101.36 Crores.
	
	
	
The Company manages currency exposures by continuously monitoring the Foreign currency rates 
with the transaction rate and takes steps to mitigate the risk using Forward/ Derivative contracts. 
	
Sensitivity to risk
	
A 5% strengthening of the INR against foreign currencies to which the Company is exposed (net of hedge) 
would have led to approximately an additional Gain of Rs.4.83 Crores in the Statement of Profit and Loss. A 
5% weakening of the INR against these currencies would have led to an equal impact but with opposite effect.

Interest rate is the risk that the Fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Company has Rs. 39.29 Crores Borrowings at Floating 
rate of Interest as at 31st March, 2024 (previous year Rs. 100.88 Crores).
	
Sensitivity to risk
	
An increase in interest rate of 1% will likely to affect the profit negatively by Rs. 0.39 crores and a decrease 
of 1% would have led to an equal impact but with opposite effect.
	
c)	 Management of credit risk
	
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if the other party to the financial assets fails to meet 
its contractual obligations.
	
i)	 Trade Receivables:
	
	
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited as the customers are predominantly 
original equipment manufacturers (OEs). All trade receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on a 
quarterly basis. Our historical experience of collecting receivables is that credit risk is low. Refer Note (e) 
for accounting policy on Financial Instruments.
	
ii)	 Other Financial Assets:
	
	
The Company has exposure in Cash and cash equivalents and term deposits with banks. The Company’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31st March, 2024 is the carrying value of each class of financial 
assets as on that date.
