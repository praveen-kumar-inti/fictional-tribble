Mrs. Bectors Food Specialities Limited 
	
26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
IN FY 2022- 2023, MBFSL carried out the materiality assessment to identify ESG material issues and understand 
the relative importance of these issues to its stakeholders. For all the material issues, there are specific 
initiatives and indicators to track the issues identified

Is it risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1.
Food Safety 
and Quality for 
consumers
Risk and 
opportunity
Risk: As a food product company, MBFSL 
must uphold stringent standards of food 
quality and safety. Failure to meet these 
standards could pose health risks to 
consumers, resulting in dissatisfaction, 
complaints, and potential legal actions 
against the company.
Opportunity:
Securing internationally recognized 
certifications for food quality and safety 
would enhance our brand reputation and 
position MBFSL as a preferred choice 
among customers.
Implementing food 
safety and quality 
management systems 
along with conducting 
regular audits for food 
safety and quality 
assurance across all 
manufacturing units.
Negative:
Breach of any safety standard 
would hamper the company’s 
reputation and finances
Positive:
Proper compliance of 
regulations would enable us to 
grow our business
2.
Waste 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Rapidly changing regulations around EPR 
in India and non-compliance risk of such 
regulations
Opportunity:
Embracing more efficient resource 
utilization to curtail waste generation 
could pave the way for realizing a circular 
economy.
Adopt measures to 
collect waste and 
segregate it by waste 
type. Ensure that all 
types of waste are 
diverted from landfill 
by recycling or reusing 
the waste
Positive:
Innovative waste-
reduction solutions and the 
implementation of the 3R 
waste-management philosophy 
(Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) 
may result in resource 
optimization and cost savings.
Negative:
Any mismanagement of 
hazardous trash may endanger 
people’s health or result in 
noncompliance. The outcome 
may have a negative financial 
impact.
3.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Strong and efficient senior management 
would enable us to achieve our goals 
promptly and swiftly
Establishment of a 
committee which 
is responsible 
for overseeing 
sustainability 
initiatives and ensuring 
the achievement of 
sustainability targets 
and goals.
Positive:
Robust governance practices 
will drive our business towards 
excellence and growth.
4.
Emissions and 
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
MBFSL primarily relies on grid power, 
diesel, and gas to meet its energy 
demand, all of which contribute to 
significant greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. With tightening regulations 
and national emission reduction targets, 
the company will need to transition to 
renewable energy sources and reduce 
emissions from its operations.
Opportunity:
To address climate change, there is 
potential for progressing towards energy 
efficiency, adopting renewable energy 
sources, improving material utilization, 
and implementing hybrid technologies.
Transitioning to 
solar energy, electric 
vehicles and other 
adoption of energy 
efficiency measures 
across the operations
Positive:
Green energy technology 
investments are growing 
due to environmental and 
sustainability concerns, offering 
cost-effective and long-term 
solutions.
Negative:
To align with the government’s 
goal of achieving net-zero 
GHG emissions, we’re reducing 
reliance on fossil fuels, which 
requires additional investments.

5.
Human rights & 
Fair Labor Practices
Risk
Taking responsibility for identifying and 
managing human rights risks within its 
operations and supply chain, along with 
mitigating potential negative impacts 
and associated damages. Additionally, 
navigating evolving human rights 
regulations presents a challenge.
Ensure that the 
workforce is trained in 
human rights, and the 
training is extended to 
value chain partners 
as well. Address any 
human rights issues 
arising through a 
grievance mechanism 
and conduct due 
diligence across 
operations in the near 
future
Negative:
Any violation could endanger 
the organization’s reputation 
and financial stability.
6.
Sustainable 
Agriculture & 
Sourcing
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The absence of ethical and sustainable 
ingredients may disrupt operations. 
Additionally, fluctuations in the price and 
availability of raw materials pose a risk to 
the company.
Opportunity:
Acquiring internationally recognized 
certifications for governing food quality 
and safety would enhance our brand 
value and position us as a preferred 
choice for customers.
Boost the utilization of 
sustainable ingredients 
through investment 
in research and 
development. Launch 
initiatives to educate 
farmers on sustainable 
agricultural practices.
