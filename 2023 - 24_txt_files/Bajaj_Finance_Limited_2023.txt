Product governance refers to 
companies’ management of the 
quality of financial products and 
services offered, as well as the way 
they are marketed. Retail finance

their business model of lending. 
Types of misconduct include 
discriminatory lending practices, 
false marketing, predatory lending, 
misleading investors through poor 
disclosure and illegal foreclosure 
practices.
The company has a strong 
marketing and product 
offering programme that 
assesses responsible 
marketing aspects. The 
company has preparedness 
measures to address 
Product Governance 
issues. BFL Group follows 
a strict Code of Conduct

feel safe and healthy at work, they 
are more likely to be engaged, 
motivated, and productive. This can 
lead to higher job satisfaction and 
lower turnover rates.

for selected sites of BFL and its subsidiaries. For limited level of verification, we adopted a risk-based approach, 
that is, we concentrated our assurance efforts on the issues of high material relevance to the Company’s 
business and its key stakeholders. We carried out the following activities:

Report – Limited Level of Assurance

encompassing the framework for assurance consisting 
of a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under 9 
ESG attributes. The format of BRSR Core is used as a 
basis of reasonable level of assurance
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR reporting 
guidelines. Our focus included general disclosures, 
management processes, principle wise performance 
(essential indicators, and leadership indicators) and 
any other key metrics specified under the reporting 
framework. The BRSR reporting format used a basis 
of limited level of assurance.
Evaluation of the design and implementation of 
key systems, processes and controls for collecting, 
managing and reporting the BRSR Core indicators
Understanding the key systems, processes and 
controls for collecting, managing and reporting the 
non-financial quantitative disclosures in BRSR report.

on a sample basis, the processes used to adhere to 
and evaluate adherence to the reporting principles.

ensuring a detailed examination of BRSR Core 
indicators. Engaged directly with internal stakeholders 
to gather insights and corroborative evidence for each 
disclosed indicator.
Collect and evaluate documentary evidence and 
management representations supporting adherence 
to the reporting principles.

DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for data 
testing and also, to assess the uniformity in reporting 
processes and also, quality checks at different locations 
of the Company. Sites for data testing and reporting 
system checks were selected based on the %age 
contribution each site makes to the reported indicator, 
complexity of operations at each location (high/low/
medium) and reporting system within the organization. 
Sites selected for audits are listed in Annexure-II.
DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for 
corporate offices and sites. Sample based assessment 
of site-specific data disclosures was carried out.

of Completeness.

Conclusion
Reasonable level of Assurance- BRSR 9 Core Attributes
Based on our review and procedures followed for reasonable level of assurance, DNV is of the opinion that, in 
all material aspects, the BRSR 9 Core Attributes (as listed in Annexure I of this statement) for FY 2023-24 are 
reported in accordance with reporting requirements outlined in BRSR Core (Annexure I of SEBI Circular dated 
12 July 2023).
Limited Level of Assurance- BRSR Reporting Format 
On the basis of the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the BRSR 
disclosures of Bajaj Finance Limited as mentioned under section ‘Scope’ do not properly adhere to the reporting 
requirements as per BRSR reporting guidelines (Annexure II of SEBI Circular) for FY 2023-24.
Statement of Competence and Independence
DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, which are based on the 
principles enclosed within ISO IEC 17029:2019 – Conformity assessment – General principles are requirements 
for validation and verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control 
including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We have complied with the DNV Code of Conduct1 during the assurance engagement and maintain 
independence wherever required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an 
independent team of sustainability assurance professionals. During the reporting period i.e. FY 2023-24, DNV, 
to the best of its knowledge, was not involved in any non-audit/non-assurance work with the Company and 
its Group entities which could lead to any Conflict of Interest. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any 
statements or data included in the Report except for this Assurance Statement for internal use of Bajaj Finance 
Limited. DNV maintains complete impartiality toward stakeholders interviewed during the assurance process. To 
the best of our knowledge, we did not provide any services to Bajaj Finance Limited in the scope of assurance 
for the reporting period that could compromise the independence or impartiality of our work.

of management of the Company and solely for the purpose for which it is provided. To the fullest extent

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
•	 Verification of GHG Scope 3 emissions data from various activities for FY 2023-24 for limited level 
of verification
•	 Other Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) arising from value chain covering three categories as 
per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting. Categories reported are-
	» C1: Purchased Goods and Services- procurement of office supplies
	» C6: Business Travel- air, road & train travel, hotel stay and guest house stay
	» C9: Downstream transportation and distribution- relocation, freighting courier
Boundary
Boundary covers the performance of BFL and its 2 subsidiaries viz., Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL) 
(Corporate Identity Number U65910PN2008PLC132228) and Bajaj Financial Securities Limited (BFSL) 
(Corporate Identity Number U67120PN2010PLC136026) operations in India that fall under the direct 
operational control of the Company’s Legal structure. Based on the agreed scope with the Company, the 
boundary of verification covers the operations of BFL Group across all locations in India.
Review of emission sources under BFL Group’s operational control including review of the Company's internal 
GHG inventory and processes related to the collection and collation of its GHG emissions sources.
Limitation(s):
•	 The verification engagement considers an uncertainty of ±5% based on materiality threshold for estimation/
measurement errors and omissions.
•	 DNV has not been involved in evaluation or assessment of any financial data/performance of the company 
and its subsidiaries.
•	 The assessment is limited to data and information within the defined Reporting Period. Any data outside this 
period is not considered within the scope of verification.
•	 Data outside the operations specified in the verification boundary is excluded from the verification, unless 
explicitly mentioned otherwise in this statement.
•	 The verification engagement is based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the 
Company are complete, sufficient and authentic.
•	 No external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this verification engagement.
Verification Methodology:
We planned and performed our verification work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide 
reasonable & limited level of verification. In case of limited level of verification, we adopted a risk-based 
approach towards selection of samples for assessing the robustness of the underlying data management 
system, information flow and controls.
We carried out the following activities:
•	 Desk review of the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions activity and associated data for the period - 1st 
April 2023 – 31st March 2024 captured in bespoke spreadsheets.
•	 Review of the standard operating procedures (‘SOPs’) for GHG Management System as well as the 
Company’s GHG data management processes used to generate, aggregate, and report the GHG data, as well 
as assessment of the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the data.
•	 Reviews of GHG data aggregation system in place including formats, assumptions, as well as associated 
emission factors and calculation methodologies.
•	 Sampling of activity data for verification in line with the requirements for verification.
•	 Onsite visits to corporate office and selected branches/sites in India as listed out in Annexure II for verifying 
the identified activities and emission sources and related evidence at the site level on a sample basis.
•	 Interaction with key managers and data owners to review data systems related to the GHG inventory 
including reviews of emission factors and assumptions used in calculation methodology.

Conclusion
Reasonable level of verification- Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions
On the basis of our verification methodology and scope of work agreed upon, DNV is of the opinion that, in all 
material aspects, the reported Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions as brought out below and in Annexure I are materially 
correct and fair representation of Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions of BFL Group for the reporting period.
Limited Level of verification- Scope 3 GHG emissions 
On the basis of our verification methodology and scope of work agreed upon, nothing has come to our attention 
to suggest that the GHG emissions as brought out below and in Annexure I are not materially correct and is not 
a fair representation of the Scope 3 GHG emissions of BFL Group for the reporting period.
In both cases, some data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to 
transcription, interpretation and aggregation errors and the errors have been corrected.
