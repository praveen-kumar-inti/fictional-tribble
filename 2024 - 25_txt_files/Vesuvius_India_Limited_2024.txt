A brief on types of customers
Vesuvius products play a vital role in driving performance and efficiency across a wide range of high-temperature 
industries, while supporting customers in their de-carbonisation journey through energy-efficient technologies and 
sustainable solutions:
•	
Steel Producers: Vesuvius is a trusted partner for steel manufacturers, supporting their operations with high-
performance refractory products for furnaces, ladles, and tundishes. Designed to endure extreme temperatures, 
these solutions ensure safe, efficient, and reliable steel production. By enhancing molten metal flow control, minimising 
heat loss, and optimising operational performance, Vesuvius helps steelmakers achieve superior productivity, quality, 
and safety. Additionally, Vesuvius’ energy-efficient refractories and flow control solutions help steelmakers reduce 
fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions, supporting their transition to greener production methods.
•	
Foundries and Aluminum Smelters: Vesuvius brings precision and efficiency to metal casting operations. In foundries, 
their advanced refractory linings enable accurate casting and prevent metal contamination, ensuring high-quality 
output. For aluminum smelters, Vesuvius solutions enhance electrolytic cell performance, reduce energy consumption, 
and maintain metal purity. These innovations contribute to cost savings, sustainable operations, and consistent 
production outcomes. Vesuvius also offers thermal management solutions that help foundries and smelters lower 
energy usage, contributing to their decarbonisation goals.
•	
Cement and Lime Plants: Cement and lime producers rely on Vesuvius for robust refractories that line rotary kilns 
and support critical calcination processes. Engineered to withstand intense heat, chemical reactions, and abrasion, 
Vesuvius solutions extend equipment life, minimise downtime, and promote efficient clinker production. Vesuvius’ 
advanced refractory technologies help reduce heat loss and optimise fuel efficiency, enabling cement and lime plants 
to lower their carbon footprint and achieve more sustainable operations.
•

petrochemical plants, and non-ferrous metal producers, including those in copper, aluminum, and nickel industries. 
Built for durability in aggressive chemical environments and high-temperature operations, these products enhance 
process efficiency, reduce emissions, and extend equipment lifespan. Vesuvius also supports these industries with 
innovative materials that improve thermal efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduce carbon intensity, 
advancing their de-carbonisation efforts.

26. Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
The Company’s sustainability initiatives are driven by a commitment to addressing our most impactful sustainability opportunities 
and challenges. We leverage a robust double materiality methodology, aligned with the European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ESRS). Following the approach adopted by Vesuvius plc, we assess and prioritise sustainability topics through two 
key dimensions: the impact of our activities on the environment and society, and their influence on our business, highlighting 
both financial risks and growth opportunities.
Our materiality assessment is deeply integrated into our risk management framework, enabling us to identify both immediate 
risks and emerging macro trends that could shape our future. Key trends we monitor include the rise of electric vehicles, increasing 
demand for renewable energy, technological advancements in iron and steel production, and evolving policies on CO₂ emissions. 
We also closely align with India’s progressive sustainability initiatives, such as the Ministry of Steel’s newly introduced “Green 
Steel Taxonomy”, aimed at accelerating de-carbonisation in the steel sector.
Materiality remains central to our sustainable strategy, guiding us to focus on the issues that matter most to our business, 
stakeholders, and the planet. By addressing these priority topics, we enhance transparency, support informed decision-making, 
and ensure our resources drive meaningful impact.
Our approach aligns with global reporting standards and is strengthened through active stakeholder engagement. We gather 
valuable insights through regular surveys and dialogues with our operational teams, covering key areas such as environmental 
management, safety, human resources, and societal impact. This inclusive approach ensures our sustainability initiatives are 
comprehensive, relevant, and impactful.
The Company remains dedicated to advancing a sustainable future by turning emerging challenges into opportunities and 
driving positive change for society and the environment.

We are proud to present Company’s 3rd Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the Financial 
Year ended December 31, 2024, highlighting our unwavering commitment to sustainability, ethical business practices, 
and societal well-being. This report reflects our performance and progress in serving our employees, customers, and 
the communities where we operate. We remain deeply aligned with the UN Global Compact (UNGC), UN Sustainable

At the core of our sustainability vision is our pledge to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. We are making 
steady progress by integrating eco-friendly solutions, such as expanding renewable energy consumption and enhancing 
energy efficiency, which have already contributed to a significant reduction in our carbon footprint. Demonstrating our 
commitment to environmental stewardship, we voluntarily purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to offset 
emissions from electricity consumption. Our proactive approach not only reduces our environmental impact but also 
supports our customers on their de-carbonisation journey, further cementing our leadership in sustainable solutions.
For our Company sustainability is more than a responsibility—it is an integral part of our business strategy. Our actions 
today shape the future of our Company, its customers, the community, and the planet. This report provides a comprehensive 
account of how we embed sustainability into our business operations and corporate culture.

*At Vesuvius, we prioritise occupational safety and are dedicated to fostering a safe working environment for all, including our 
critical manpower suppliers and on-site contractors. Every on-site contractor receives comprehensive training on Health, Safety, 
and Environment (HSE) standards, ensuring they are well-equipped to uphold our safety values.
During the current reporting year, we significantly enhanced our commitment to safety by increasing HSE awareness sessions 
for our critical manpower suppliers by an impressive 59%. These sessions are conducted not only at our own manufacturing 
sites but also at customer locations, extending our safety culture beyond our operations. Additionally, we collaborate with 
external agencies to deliver expert-led training whenever required, further strengthening the effectiveness of these programs.
As outlined in our Group-level objectives, occupational safety remains a top priority for the Company. Through these proactive 
initiatives, we continue to empower our workforce, promote a culture of safety, and drive continuous improvement in HSE 
performance across our operations and partnerships.

At Vesuvius, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct, and our Conflict-of-Interest Policy 
plays a vital role in upholding transparency and integrity across all our operations. This policy applies to all employees and 
provides clear guidance on managing sensitive transactions and associations with relevant entities, ensuring that business 
decisions are made in the best interests of the company and our stakeholders.
To foster awareness and promote ethical behavior, we regularly conduct training sessions to educate employees on 
identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, our comprehensive Code of Conduct outlines clear 
do’s and don’ts regarding conflicts of interest, reinforcing our commitment to fair and responsible business practices.
Through these initiatives, we empower our employees to act with integrity, safeguard stakeholder trust, and uphold 
Vesuvius’s values of honesty, transparency, and ethical excellence.

*Our commitment to environmental and societal well-being is deeply embedded in our business decisions. We ensure that every 
capital expenditure aligns with our sustainability targets, driving long-term value for our business and stakeholders. As part of 
our evaluation process, we conduct environmental impact analyses for all capital projects, recognising that these key decisions 
play a crucial role in enhancing our future sustainability performance, particularly in reducing CO₂ emissions.
During the reporting period, while the percentage of capital expenditure (CAPEX) allocated to sustainability decreased 
due to investments in greenfield projects, we achieved a significant milestone by nearly doubling our absolute spending on 
sustainability initiatives. This increase reflects our continued dedication to environmental stewardship and our proactive 
approach to integrating sustainable solutions into our growth strategy.
With sustainability at the core of our investment decisions, we remain steadfast in driving long-term positive impact on the 
environment, society, and our business.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
	
Yes
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Our Company is committed to promoting sustainable and ethical business practices across our supply chain. The 
Sustainable Procurement Policy, issued by Vesuvius Group has been adopted by the Company which reflects our 
commitment to these goals. It applies comprehensively to the Company’s operations and its suppliers, ensuring 
responsible sourcing across our value chain.
To maintain high compliance standards, we conduct regular reviews of our purchasing portfolio, aligning with 
applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, supplier adherence to sustainability standards is systematically 
evaluated through third-party independent assessments, managed under the oversight of the Vesuvius plc purchase 
team. The supplier sustainability assessment methodology complies with international standards (e.g. ISO 26000, 
GRI, ILO, UN Global Compact). It includes the assessment of policies, measures, certifications and reporting, along 
with the endorsement of external CSR initiatives and principles.
Supplier assessments are carried out via a combination of questionnaires completed by suppliers, the collection 
of supporting documents and evidence, and the monitoring of a large number of sources (government agencies, 
compliance databases, sustainability networks, international organisations, NGOs, trade unions and specialised 
press).
The rigorous evaluation process ensures that our suppliers meet our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
standards, reinforcing our commitment to responsible sourcing and sustainable business growth. Through these 
initiatives, the Company continues to drive supply chain excellence, promote ethical partnerships, and advance our 
global sustainability goals.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company is committed to sustainable waste management practices, integrating reuse, recycling, and resource recovery 
into our operations. Our comprehensive approach ensures that all waste generated from our processes—including plastic, 
wood, batteries, metal, and plastic drums—undergoes initial segregation to identify opportunities for reuse and recycling.
•	
Reintegration into the Value Chain: Reusable materials are reintroduced into our production processes, contributing 
to a more circular economy.
•	
Recycling with Certified Partners: Recyclable materials are responsibly managed through authorised recyclers, 
ensuring compliance with environmental standards.
•	
Safe Disposal Practices: Used lubricants are treated through our on-site Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) before being 
safely disposed of via certified vendors, maintaining the highest standards of environmental safety.
In line with our commitment to sustainable innovation, the Company is exploring the transition from wood-based packaging 
to paperboard alternatives. As a forward-looking organisation, we have already taken a proactive step by mandating that 
the proposed paperboard be produced through the recycling of wastepaper, further reducing our environmental footprint.
These initiatives reflect our dedication to circular economy principles, resource efficiency, and a greener future, positioning 
the Company as a responsible industry leader in environmental stewardship.

Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following 
format?
The Company is committed to creating market-leading sustainable products that deliver superior environmental 
performance throughout their lifecycle. To support this commitment, we have developed a Product Sustainability Benefits 
Scorecard, a comprehensive tool to evaluate the sustainability impact of our products across their entire lifecycle—
from raw materials and manufacturing to transportation, use, and end-of-life management. As the World Refractory 
Association (WRA) is currently designing the general guidelines for refractory products life cycle assessment regarding 
scope and boundary, we are following the aforementioned internal tool. However, we remain committed to conduct LCA 
of our products as soon as the WRA guidelines are made available.
Our scorecard assesses products against industry standards, focusing on key criteria such as:
•	
Health and Safety
•	
Environmental Impact
•	
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
•	
End-of-Life Processing
In line with our goal to reduce CO₂ emissions—both within our operations and for our customers—GHG emissions and 
environmental impact are given significant weighting in the evaluation process. Additionally, our methodology highlights 
and rates products for their outstanding performance in reducing CO₂ emissions, aligning with our commitment to climate 
action and sustainable innovation.
Sustainability is embedded into our Research & Development (R&D) and new product development processes. Using the 
Product Sustainability Benefits Scorecard, we conduct thorough assessments of our entire R&D pipeline from the design 
stage. This ensures that all projects are aligned with our sustainability ambitions, particularly in contributing to the fight 
against climate change through CO₂ reduction.
The insights from these assessments guide us in refining priorities, allocating resources effectively, and accelerating the 
development of innovative, high-performance sustainable solutions.
We define ‘market-leading sustainable products’ as those that demonstrate clear and measurable sustainability 
advantages over standard market offerings. These products represent our commitment to providing value-enhancing 
solutions that empower our customers to achieve their sustainability goals, reduce their environmental footprint, and 
advance their de-carbonisation journey.
Through this proactive and purpose-driven approach, the Company is leading the way in sustainable innovation, delivering 
impact, and driving positive change for our customers, communities, and the planet.

reuse packaging materials by transitioning from wooden boxes to reusable metallic boxes. Currently, metallic boxes are in 
circulation for few of the selected products, contributing to waste reduction and sustainable resource management. We are 
in the process of gathering additional data points to assess the project’s performance, scalability, and long-term impact.
This initiative reflects our dedication to innovative, sustainable solutions that minimise environmental impact while driving 
operational efficiency.

10.	  Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
Safety is our number one priority. Our approach is to 
identify, eliminate, reduce or control all workplace risks, 
and an ongoing system of training, assessment and 
improvement is in place to focus on achieving this. We 
remain fundamentally committed to protecting the health 
and safety of employees, contractors, visitors, customers 
and any other persons affected by our activities
Our employees are highly supportive of the company’s 
efforts to improve workplace safety and acknowledge 
how seriously we take this issue. In the 2024 I-Engage 
employee engagement survey, 86% agreed that the 
Company would address safety concerns if they were 
raised, which was consistent with 2023.
We want to become a zero-accident company and are 
striving to become a best-in-class organisation for safety 
performance and leadership.
Organisation and responsibilities

mainstream management responsibility. Executives 
and line managers are directly responsible for 
health and safety matters in operations under their 
control. Management is accountable for health and 
safety performance against objectives
•	
All employees have a responsibility to take care of 
themselves and others whilst at work. We expect 
everyone to participate positively in the task of 
preserving workplace health and safety
•	
We will encourage our suppliers to adhere to the 
same health and safety standards as we do
Our beliefs
•	
Good health and safety is good business
•	
Safety is everybody’s responsibility
•	
Working safely is a condition of employment
•	
All work-related injuries and work-related ill-health 
are preventable
Our aims
•

the frequency and severity of injuries, improve 
workstation ergonomics, prevent exposure to 
hazardous substances and minimise the risk of 
occupational diseases
•	
We will ensure awareness about health and safety 
issues and provide training for all new employees 
and contractors, and then at least annually, to 
ensure that they understand their responsibilities 
and are able to act accordingly
•	
Every business facility will have an appointed health 
and safety manager
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
The Company addresses this aspect through a 
comprehensive set of processes for Risk Assessment. 
It proactively identifies hazards (known as Safety 
Improvement Opportunities, or SIO) and mitigates them 
with permanent actions (known as SIOPA) on a fast-
track basis.
The processes are detailed below:
Risk Assessments: The Company routinely conducts 
risk assessments to identify and evaluate hazards, 
implementing protective measures to minimise exposure. 
These measures include:
•	
Engineering solutions to eliminate or reduce risks
•	
Procedural measures, such as training and auditing
•	
Work instructions, developed with employee 
involvement, including illustrations and translations 
into local languages
•	
Providing personal protective equipment to 
employees free of charge
Identification of Work-Related Hazards (SIO) & 
Mitigation (SIOPA) The Company regularly identifies and 
STATUTORY REPORTS

mitigates hazards, implementing protective measures to 
minimise exposure. A digital platform known as VSAT is 
used to manage this efficiently.
Additionally, our Senior Leadership Group conducts 
regular Executive Safety Walks. These walks foster 
dialogue with staff, set action points for discussion and 
implementation, and provide visible safety leadership on 
the shop floor at our sites and customer locations. Along 
with daily safety audits, these walks are a central pillar of 
our Safety Breakthrough initiative.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to 
report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the Company has a structured approach for 
workers to report work-related hazards and remove 
themselves from such risks. There are multiple ways to 
involve workers in improving the Occupational Health 
& Safety Management System and eliminating risks 
from operations.
•	
Safety Audits, VSAT & Line PPS: Workers are 
routinely engaged in safety audits and can raise 
concerns during these audits. VSAT, a mobile digital 
platform, is used to capture hazards and remove 
them from the work area or process. Workers without 
access to VSAT can raise their concerns through the 
Line PPS Board or the Toolbox Talk register.
•	
Take 2: This process empowers workers to make 
safety decisions. Our Take 2 initiative ensures that 
employees double-check safety requirements 
before performing any high-risk or non-standard 
activity. Essentially, employees take two minutes 
to discuss the task, identify any hazards, and 
determine how to prevent accidents before starting 
work. This process allows the team to consider and 
reflect on hazards and the necessary controls before 
commencing work
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access 
to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, employees and workers have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services through 
the Group Mediclaim Policy and ESI. We have tie-ups 
with hospital networks across India to ensure immediate 
access during emergencies.
Additionally, Vesuvius conducts various wellness 
programs to promote good health. These programs 
include inviting guest speakers, organising events, 
sponsoring teams and outdoor activities, supporting 
employees in quitting smoking, losing weight, and 
exercising more, and offering healthy food options in 
the canteen.

The Company has implemented a series of measures 
to ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our people. 
Some of these measures include:
SSIP (Site Safety Improvement Plan): Each business 
facility has a designated health and safety professional 
who collaborates with management and employees 
to review site health and safety, assess training needs, 
and develop and implement site safety improvement 
plans. These local health and safety professionals are 
further supported by corporate HSE members in terms 
of resource allocation, training and development, and 
sharing best practices.
Development of Risk Assessments & Safe Work 
Instructions (SWI): Every site routinely conducts risk 
assessments to identify and evaluate hazards/risks and 
implement protective measures to minimise exposure. 
VESUVIUS INDIA LIMITED

Additionally, sites develop and deploy Safe Work 
Instructions for all routine/standard activities.
Training Employees : Based on the training needs and 
competencies required to manage business activities 
efficiently, the Company conducts multiple training 
sessions covering everyone from the senior management 
team to frontline workers. The Company has a training 
matrix that defines the training needs for all levels of the 
organisation. Training program calendars are created 
and deployed both site-wise and centrally with defined 
timelines. While most of our training is conducted offline, 
the online platform V-Learn is also used to promote 
safe learning opportunities regarding health and 
safety standards.
Over the years, Company has developed a set of Safety 
Policies and Standards. These are regularly reviewed and 
updated, based on the best practices implemented in sites 
and learnings from incident investigations and Training 
on applicable standards are imparted to employees and 
frontline workers.

Safety Audit- The Company has a dedicated team responsible 
for its Sustainability, HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment), 
and Quality goals. This team ensures the implementation and 
continuous application of the Group’s standards and policies 
across our locations, including manufacturing sites, R&D 
facilities, and customer locations where many of our employees 
work daily. The audit also assesses the site’s HSE leadership.
Following each audit, site management teams create action 
plans to address identified issues, and progress is regularly 
assessed. Observations from audits are used to improve 
training programs and enhance health and safety standards. 
The results of HSE audits and the progress of action plans 
addressing critical issues are reported to the Management 
Team. Sites are encouraged to conduct self-assessments using 
the safety audit compliance checklist to monitor their progress.
HSE Campaigns- The Company has an HSE Campaign 
calendar based on past near misses and incidents to enhance 
workplace safety awareness. Each month, the calendar 
focuses on specific HSE topics to effectively engage employees 
and promote a culture of safety, prioritising topics based on 
their impact, frequency, and severity. Activities aligned with 
the monthly theme include:
•	
Training sessions: Conducting workshops, webinars, or 
toolbox talks related to the topic.
•	
Safety posters: Creating visually appealing posters 
highlighting key safety messages.
•	
Safety drills: Organising fire drills, evacuation exercises, 
or first aid demonstrations.
•	
Toolbox meetings: Engaging employees in discussions 
about safety practices.
•	
Competitions: Running safety quizzes, slogan contests, 
or safety-related challenges.

PRINCIPLE 9:
Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
The Company manages customer complains through a very robust system which starts with initiation of “Customer 
corrective action request (CCAR)” in our CCAR database (centralised platform to register, monitor and close CCAR) 
followed by high quality time bound closure of the issue through the well-established 8D process.
	
CCAR Procedure
Initiation- A CCAR can be recorded by any Vesuvius employee for any product or service that has been provided to the 
Customer. Sales is responsible for ensuring that the issue is communicated immediately and that actions are taken to define 
and contain the issue within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. The CCAR should be formally submitted within 4 days 
of learning of the occurrence. The principle is that any customer issue linked to our product, its application or our service 
at the customer, direct or indirect should lead to a CCAR. In any case, a CCAR must be submitted in any of the following 
circumstances, regardless of whether we think the problem is our responsibility:
•	
Any written customer complaint formally communicated to us.
•	
Any phone call from the customer requesting an urgent visit for a quality related issue.
•	
Any verbal expression of dissatisfaction by the customer during a visit; only exception: – if this relates to the application 
of our product and can be resolved during the same visit, then a CCAR is not needed, but nevertheless, be mentioned 
in the visit report. – If a further visit is needed to resolve the issue, than a CCAR is required
•	
Any incident where our product is involved
•	
Any free of charge replacement of product already received by the customer if quality related. • Any credit note(s) if 
quality related.
•	
Any product non-conformance discovered at the customer site (delivery, packaging, broken pcs, specification…)
Containment actions- As soon as we learn about an incident, customer protection is an absolute priority. It includes but 
is not limited to:
•	
Immediate visit to the customer
•	
Quarantine and replacement of doubtful products all along the supply chain.
•	
Inspection and sorting of the quarantined products; this may require third-party involvement. • Adequate 
communication with the customer to protect the relationship. The removal of products in customer hands must be 
considered as a mandatory containment action to protect the customer. It does not entail acknowledgement of our 
responsibility. The immediate containment actions have in any case to be implemented before the next shipment.
Repeats- A repeat CCAR is required for any similar problem with a similar product at the same customer, for any subsequent 
shipment within 24 months. The statistics count only repeats within 12 months. Exception is when the customer or the 
Group Quality Director formally grants a concession for a defined time or number of shipments. In such circumstances, an 
additional repeat CCAR shall be raised each month for any additional customer rejects. In the case of the trial to confirm 
corrective actions (D7) failing.

•	
if the execution of the trial was a failure, then a CCAR is needed.
•	
if however the result of the trial is that the proposed fix did not work, then that is not a CCAR
Severity- Assigning Severity to a CCAR is mandatory, and is defined as follows:
Severity 1: an injury; a dangerous occurrence that could result in a severe accident/incident*; a problem at our external 
customer’s customer, Another significant customer disruption or potential financial impact*
Severity 2: a production/installation stoppage at our customer; delivery issues stopping the customer or forcing him to 
change his production schedule.
Severity 3: other dangerous occurrences; reduced service life of the product; significant delivery issues; other failures.
Severity 4: other product or service issues; other delivery timing/quantity issues
CCAR is handled, resolved with proper root cause analysis using 8D PPS (8-Discipline of practical problem solving) 
methodology and learning of it is implemented to prevent recurrence and further shared for horizontal deployment at 
other Vesuvius plants and locations.
