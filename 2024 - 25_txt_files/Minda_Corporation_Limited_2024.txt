Energy 
Management
Risk
	
Æ Automotive 
manufacturing 
(Die 
Casting business) is energy-intensive, 
and thus, fluctuations in, or sustained 
energy prices increments can increase 
operational costs and affect profit 
margins.
	
Æ Non-Compliance with the increasing 
government regulations on energy 
efficiency & carbon emissions can 
result in penalties, legal liabilities, and 
hamper market reputation.
	
Æ MCL has made 
substantial investments 
in renewable energy, 
particularly solar, and is 
committed to reducing 
fossil fuel dependence 
by integrating energy 
management into our 
sustainability journey.

Opportunity
	
Æ However, 
Energy 
efficiency 
and 
Renewables pose opportunities of 
considerably reducing operational 
costs and enhancing sustainability 
performance.
	
Æ Efficacy in energy management would 
provide MCL a competitive edge and 
also enable them to anticipate energy 
supply disruptions.
	
Æ Proactive energy management can 
help MCL qualify for government 
incentives, tax benefits, and green 
certifications.
	
Æ We 
have 
successfully 
achieved 
EnMS 
certification 
at 
select 
units and are actively 
expanding 
this 
best 
practice 
across 
all 
remaining 
units 
to 
strengthen our energy 
management efforts.
	
Æ We are driving energy 
efficiency 
across 
all 
units through initiatives 
like 
improving 
Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness 
(OEE), 
reducing 
cycle 
times, 
transitioning 
diesel 
generators 
to 
dual-fuel systems, and 
replacing 
conventional 
UPS with energy-efficient 
alternatives.
	
Æ We’re 
also 
expanding 
renewable energy use 
via green power and 
PPAs, upgrading energy-
intensive assets, adopting 
cleaner 
fuel 
furnaces, 
improving power factor 
to cut electrical losses, 
and replacing high-GWP 
refrigerants to lower our 
environmental footprint.
Positive
2
Materials 
Efficiency
Opportunity
	
Æ Improving material efficiency can 
bring a significant decline in raw 
material consumption and waste 
generation, leading to substantial cost 
savings.
	
Æ Efficient use of materials supports 
sustainability 
goals 
and 
helps 
comply with increasingly stringent 
environmental regulations, improving 
brand reputation and market access.
	
Æ Adoption of advanced lightweight 
materials to help MCL streamline 
the operation with OEMs’ evolving 
requirements.
Lean manufacturing, 
recycling scrap, material 
substitution, increasing 
recycled material use and 
designing for recyclability 
reduce dependence on 
critical raw materials.

Waste 
Management
Opportunity
	
Æ Waste 
reduction 
and 
recycling 
programs carry the potential of 
optimizing 
resource 
utilization 
and operations, thereby, reducing 
operational costs.
	
Æ Recycling of all wastes such as 
plastics, e-waste, metals, oil would 
provide 
MCL 
an 
opportunity 
to generate additional revenue 
stream, and enhance reputation by 
promoting circularity.
	
Æ Follow 
the 
Waste 
Management hierarchy 
priority list for disposal 
of waste in the following 
order 
– 
Prevention, 
reduce 
and 
reuse, 
recycle, waste to energy 
incineration, landfill.
	
Æ Disposal to Pollution 
Control 
Board 
Authorised vendor as 
per HWM Rules.
	
Æ Target 
for 
Reduction 
of Hazardous waste in 
each FY with respect to 
sale.
Positive
Risk
	
Æ But, Inefficient waste management 
can cause soil, water, and air 
pollution due to leaks, spills, or 
improper storage of hazardous 
substances, 
causing 
long-term 
environmental damage 
	
Æ Mishandling 
waste, 
especially 
hazardous substances, puts the 
health of employees and workers in 
jeopardy. This can potentially lead 
to injuries and serious workplace 
accidents.
	
Æ Improper disposal of waste pose a 
reputational and non-compliance 
risk due to violation of environmental 
laws.
Negative

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Opportunity
	
Æ Superior product quality & safety 
reduce defects, recalls, and failures, 
leading 
to 
higher 
customer 
satisfaction, repeat business, and 
stronger 
long-term 
relationships 
with OEMs.
	
Æ Consistency in delivering automotive 
components of optimum quality 
and safety provides competitive 
advantage.
	
Æ Meeting or exceeding international 
safety and quality standards enables 
MCL to supply to global OEMs, enter 
new geographies, and participate 
in premium or safety-critical vehicle 
programs.
MCL 
is 
dedicated 
to 
upholding 
the 
utmost 
quality and safety standards 
of its products, aligning 
with the best practices 
worldwide. 
Furthermore, 
MCL intends to improve 
its management systems 
to ensure product safety, 
effectively 
address 
any 
non-compliance concerns, 
and ensure the provision 
of premium products for 
secure 
utilization. These 
investments will not only 
boost customer confidence 
but also strengthen the 
overall value chain.

Risk
	
Æ However, Failure to meet quality/
safety standards risks customer 
dissatisfaction, 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, and legal penalties, 
potentially 
causing 
“substantial 
financial losses”. This includes costs 
from recalls, litigation, and lost 
contracts.
	
Æ Compromised 
product 
safety 
directly threatens brand credibility 
and customer trust. MCL notes that 
lapses could diminish “customer 
satisfaction” and disrupt “supply and 
value chains,” impacting long-term 
market competitiveness.
	
Æ Inadequate 
quality 
control 
heightens vulnerabilities in MCL’s 
supply chain, where disruptions (e.g., 
raw material shortages, geopolitical 
conflicts) could halt production. The 
company explicitly links product 
safety to ”uninterrupted business 
operations”
Negative
5
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
	
Æ Use of heavy and complex machinery 
in some of the businesses, moving 
equipment, and manual handling 
may increase the susceptibility of 
the workers to severe injuries and 
workplace accidents. The probability 
increases in case of non-compliance 
to the safety protocols.
	
Æ Non-compliance with occupational 
health and safety regulations can 
result in significant fines, legal action, 
and even operational shutdowns, 
impacting business continuity and 
reputation.
MCL 
conducts 
regular 
safety inspections internally 
and externally, and upholds 
specialized 
committees 
to 
ensure 
the 
welfare 
and protection of its staff 
and employees at all its 
sites. 
Additionally, 
MCL 
possesses the necessary 
safety certifications such 
as ISO 45001:2018 that are 
essential for maintaining a 
safe working environment.

Business 
Ethics
Opportunity
	
Æ Possessing 
a 
strong 
business 
character 
and 
upholding 
transparent practices is instrumental 
in building trust across the entire 
stakeholder strata, leading to long-
term associations and loyalty.
	
Æ Demonstrating 
ethical 
practices 
is the doorway for MCL to acquire 
new business opportunities and 
preferred supplier status.
	
Æ Strong 
organizational 
behavior 
makes it easier for MCL to retain 
talent who value integrity and 
corporate responsibility.
	
Æ Business ethics can be a strategic 
lever for growth, resilience, and 
competitive advantage for MCL.
MCL prides itself on having a 
robust and comprehensive 
internal 
governance 
structure. By implementing 
initiatives 
such 
as 
the 
Whistleblower 
Policy, 
Prevention of Insider Trading, 
Related Party Transactions, 
and Grievance Redressal 
for all stakeholders, MCL 
ensures a workplace culture 
that is grounded in ethical 
principles. The MCL Code of 
Conduct for employees and 
board members upholds 
transparency and ethical 
standards in all business 
dealings.
Positive
7
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
	
Æ Resilient 
Supply 
chain 
is 
a 
determinant of business continuity 
during adversities.
	
Æ Advance SCM solutions, such as, AI 
& analytics, enhance MCL market 
adaptability, accuracy in demand 
forecasting.
	
Æ Reliable, transparent, and efficient 
supply chains improve on-time 
delivery 
and 
responsiveness, 
enhancing MCL reputation with 
OEMs.
	
Æ Integrated SCM systems provide 
real-time tracking and visibility 
across the supply chain, enabling 
better 
traceability, 
faster 
issue 
resolution, and improved supplier 
quality 
management, 
which 
strengthens customer trust and 
product reliability.
MCL is presently enhancing 
agile and robust supply 
chain management systems 
to ensure uninterrupted 
business operations despite 
potential disruptions in the 
supply chain. This involves 
identifying key suppliers at 
Tier 1, 2, and Tier 3 levels 
to understand the origins 
of our raw materials and 
the overall value chain of 
our products. Inadequate 
supply chain management 
could lead to financial 
setbacks 
and

Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available, provide a web

Minda Corporation Limited has adopted a comprehensive Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Policy and a formal Code of Conduct, 
underscoring its zero-tolerance approach toward bribery, fraud, and unethical practices. These policies are applicable to all employees, 
directors, and associated third parties, setting clear expectations for ethical behavior and regulatory compliance.
Corruption risks are identified through internal audits, third-party due diligence, and ongoing oversight by the Risk Management 
Committee and Internal Audit team. Preventive measures include regular employee training, structured dissemination of policies, 
and enforcement led by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Ethics & Compliance Committee. The Whistleblower mechanism, 
administered by the Ethics Officer, ensures a confidential and retaliation-free channel for reporting misconduct.
 All reported instances are dealt with in accordance with the stipulated mechanism and are thoroughly investigated by the Compliance 
Officer in consultation with the Legal and Audit departments. Based on findings, appropriate corrective actions—including disciplinary 
measures and process enhancements—are implemented. MCL remains firmly committed to fostering a culture of ethics, integrity, 
and transparency throughout its operations.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
As an auto component manufacturer, MCL plays a critical role in supporting the circular economy through responsible operations 
and by enabling recyclability through product design. However, since our products are supplied to OEMs and integrated into larger 
vehicle assemblies, the end-of-life management, dismantling, and reclamation of these components are typically undertaken by the 
OEMs or authorized recyclers of the final vehicle.
	
Nonetheless, MCL ensures that the materials and design of its components align with OEM requirements for dismantling and 
recycling, thereby supporting the overall circularity goals of the automotive value chain.
	
From an operational perspective, MCL has robust waste management processes in place. For plastics (including packaging), the 
plastic waste generated from our operations is handed over to authorized vendors. A portion of this plastic is processed into 
reusable plastic granules, while the remainder is responsibly recycled or disposed of using approved methods.
	
At the end of their lifecycle, e-waste and hazardous waste generated in our operations are disposed of through authorized waste 
vendors, ensuring full compliance with regulatory norms. For other waste, materials such as carton boxes are reused wherever 
possible, and the remaining waste is routed to authorized vendors for recycling and reclamation.
	
MCL is committed to ensuring environmentally sound waste handling across its operations while continuing to work with OEMs to 
support their end-of-life and circularity objectives.
4.

collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If

Yes. EPR is applicable to MCL, and a plan has been submitted to the Pollution Control Board.

Leadership Indicator
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or 
for its services (for service industry)? 
	
MCL has not conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products this year but will start reporting in 
coming years.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your 
products/services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly 
describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same. 
	
No concerns identified, as company is not conducting LCA this year.
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry). 
	
The company uses recycled input materials such as aluminum ingots and plastic polymer granules in its production processes. 
However, the percentage (by value) of these reused or recycled materials relative to the total material used is not currently tracked. 
The company acknowledges the importance of this metric and intends to initiate its calculation and reporting in the coming years.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, and safely 
disposed. 
	
The company primarily supplies products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and, as a result, does not have a mechanism 
in place to reclaim products or packaging at the end of their life cycle. Consequently, data on quantities reused, recycled, or safely 
disposed is currently not applicable.
5.	
Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as percentage of products sold) for each product category. 
	
As the company operates largely as a component supplier to OEMs, it does not directly reclaim products or their packaging materials 
post-consumer use. Therefore, the percentage of reclaimed products and packaging materials is not reported.
Principle 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their 
value chains.

Disabilities (Saksham), MCL promotes inclusive development. Aakarsshan focuses on skill-building for underprivileged youth and 
women by offering vocational training in areas such as IT, tailoring, and beauty & wellness—enabling formal employment or self-
employment and contributing to livelihood enhancement.
Saksham, an MCL initiative, is dedicated to the empowerment of PwDs. Through Saksham centers and empowerment camps across 
various locations, the program facilitates access to assistive aids, UDID registration, skill training, and employment opportunities. It 
embodies the belief that abilities matter more than disabilities and works toward building an inclusive and equitable society. MCL 
prioritizes inclusive hiring practices based on skill sets to ensure workplace diversity.
To support community health, MCL conducts regular check-up drives offering services like eye screenings, diabetes testing, and 
general wellness care—strengthening preventive healthcare access for underserved populations.
MCL has also established a multi-level grievance redressal mechanism at all CSR centers, including suggestion boxes, local and central 
email channels, and designated SPOCs, ensuring accessibility and timely resolution of community concerns.
MCL has reached out to over 80,000 people through its strategic CSR initiatives. These structured engagements reflect MCL’s strong 
commitment to equity, empowerment, and inclusive community development.

investigation. Following this, the Head CAG presents the investigation findings to a cross-functional committee, which reviews the 
report and suggests necessary actions. Based on these recommendations, the Group Chief Human Resource Officer (GCHRO) is 
responsible for implementing appropriate corrective measures.
This process guarantees a fair, transparent, and timely resolution of human rights-related grievances.

processed through authorized vendors and recyclers. We maintain comprehensive records on the type, quantity, recovery, and 
disposal of waste to ensure transparency and accountability.
	
As part of our commitment to reduce environmental impact, various recycling initiatives have been introduced. Recyclable materials 
such as aluminum ingots and plastic polymer granules are reused in operations, while leftover plastics are handed over to authorized 
vendors for responsible processing. Paint sludge is recovered and reused where feasible.
	
To minimize hazardous chemical usage, MCL is progressively shifting to low-impact substances and adopting cleaner production 
technologies. A key achievement includes the in-house recycling of contaminated paint thinner, eliminating the need for disposal, 
reducing hazardous waste, and resulting in notable cost savings. Our strategic drive also focuses on diverting hazardous materials 
away from landfills and incineration, aligning waste reduction efforts with broader sustainability goals.

Recycling and Circular Material Use: We promote the use of recycled materials such as aluminium ingots, plastic polymer granules, 
and recovered paint. Paint sludge from our paint shops is processed to recover reusable paint, reducing waste and raw material 
consumption.
	
Solvent Recovery and Hazardous Waste Management: Waste thinner from paint shop flushing is recycled through an on-site 
solvent recovery system. This has been successfully piloted and is being deployed across all plants.
	
Plastic Waste Reduction: Biodegradable bags have replaced polythene in wiring harness packaging, reducing single-use plastic.
	
Organic Waste Composting: Organic waste is being converted into compost, achieving zero landfill
	
Packaging Optimization and Reuse:  Foam-based bin partitions and an in-house bin repair system, taken on pilot basis, substantially 
reduced packaging waste and enabled reuse. These improvements have been extended to more similar functional units to replicate 
the results.
	
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) Policy: ZLD systems have been implemented at most of the company’s manufacturing units to ensure 
that no industrial wastewater is discharged into the environment. This initiative has significantly reduced effluent discharge and 
supported circular water usage within the plants.
	
Water Conservation Initiatives: The Company has installed sensor-based taps in toilets and washrooms at several locations, resulting 
in measurable reductions in freshwater consumption.

recovery measures to reduce operational and financial impact. It is reviewed regularly to remain current and effective. Additionally, the 
BCP incorporates advanced cybersecurity protocols to enhance resilience against digital threats and data breaches.
	
In parallel, MCL has established a comprehensive Disaster Management framework through its Onsite Emergency Plan (OEP), 
implemented across all locations to ensure site-level preparedness and rapid response. Floor-wise Emergency Plan is also available at 
all units at the site of maximum visibility to ensure compliance. The plan covers potential emergencies such as fire, electrical hazards,

help identify areas for improvement. In addition, targeted customer surveys are conducted periodically to gain insights into service 
quality and customer expectations.
