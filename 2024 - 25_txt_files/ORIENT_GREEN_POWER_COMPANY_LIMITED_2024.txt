Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG
related challenges, targets and achievements
Power sector plays a vital role in achieving economic growth but 
conventional power is known for emissions causing environmental 
concerns. Generation of power from renewable energy sources such 
as wind avoids usage of depleting scarce resources such as fossil fuel 
or water and it does not cause any emissions. OGPL is in the business 
of generation of power from renewable energy sources and thus not 
only contributes to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but also 
play its role to propel economic growth in a greener manner. OGPL is 
conscious of its responsibility to the society and has deeply embedded 
Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) principles in its process 
and all activities are carried out in a responsible manner following these 
principles. We at OGPL constantly strive to improve the processes and 
contribute to society for a better future. We also help our customers 
meet their goals to reduce carbon emissions and help them achieve 
growth without any adverse environmental impacts.
