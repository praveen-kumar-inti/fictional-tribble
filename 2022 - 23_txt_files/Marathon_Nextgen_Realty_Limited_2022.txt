implications of the

(Indicate positive or

implications) 
1 
Energy 
Management  
Risk 
The Company consumes significant amounts 
of energy for space heating, ventilating, air 
conditioning, water heating, lighting and 
using equipment and appliances. The 
Company understands type and magnitude of 
energy used and strategies for energy 
management are dependent upon the real 
estate asset class, among other factors. The 
Company uses grid electricity which is the 
predominant form of consumed energy, 
through on-site fuel combustion.  
The Company assesses the ecological consequences 
resulting from significant energy consumption and 
subsequently implements essential measures to 
reduce these risks. However, enhancing energy 
efficiency relies on specific factors like property 
characteristics and location, adherence to local 
construction regulations, viable options for 
implementing decentralized renewable energy, the 
capacity to monitor energy usage, and the current 
inventory of buildings, among various other 
considerations. 
Negative  
2 
Water 
Management  
Risk 
The Company's buildings utilize substantial 
volumes of water during their operations, 
primarily for water fixtures, building 
machinery, appliances. The expenses 
associated with water consumption are 
contingent upon the type of property, the 
geographical location, and other determining 
factors.  
The Company has a well-built system of water 
management which helps the Company to achieve 
sustainable usage and consumption of water:  
 
Water Efficient Chrome Plated Fittings that 
are used during its construction activities 
 
Sewage 
Treatment 
and 
Rain 
Water 
Harvesting 
that 
maximizes 
reuse 
and 
recycling of water 
Negative 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 | P a g e  
 
 
As a part of sustainable sourcing the 
Company tries to reduce dependency on 
external water sources through concentrated 
efforts on ground water replenishment by 
rain water harvesting and planned bore well 
digging 
3 
Impacts of 
Climate Change  
Risk 
The impact of climate change on the 
Company’s operations is evident through 
recurring or severe extreme weather 
occurrences and shifts in climate patterns. 
Impact of climate change can affect the 
increasing usage of heat and water resistant 
construction material which may incur 
environmental, labour and monetary cost.  
The Company recognizes the significant impact of 
the Climate Change being in a business that readily 
uses materials that could lead to negative climatic 
changes. However, the Company is taking few steps 
to try and curb such impacts:  
 
Usage of Sustainable HVAC (Heating, 
Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system 
that provide comfort and ample amount of 
fresh air that even helps reducing CO2  
 
By using solar panels the Company has saved 
around 20-22% in their projects with almost 
50% reduction in potable water consumption.
 
Negative 
4 
Adherence to 
Labour 
Legislations   
Risk 
Considering the Company’s operations, it 
faces various complexities and legal 
challenges with respect to adherence of 
Labour Legislations. Labour law-related risks 
in this industry are significant due to the high 
dependency on a diverse and often transient 
workforce, as well as the potential for 
accidents and workplace hazards.  
The Company follows all the necessary legal 
compliances with respect to the Labour laws. It 
ensures to maintain a safe & healthy workplace, 
takes strict actions against human right violence, 
maintains proper record keeping along and 
redresses grievances of their stakeholders.   
Negative 
5 
Economic 
Uncertainties 
Opportunity  
India's economy is predominantly focused on 
domestic factors, making it relatively less 
NA 
Positive  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 | P a g e  
 
 
vulnerable to the effects of a global economic 
slowdown. This is clearly evident in the current 
context, where India is driving global economic 
growth. Furthermore, the Indian real estate 
sector is supported by robust underlying 
drivers. 
These 
include 
rising 
incomes, 
favorable demographic trends, urbanization, 
and the preference for nuclear families. 
6
Land 
Acquisition  
Risk
Land stands as the paramount foundational 
resource for the Company’s operations. The 
lack of availability of land with reasonable 
valuation in lesser-represented micro-markets 
might influence the Company’s expansion 
prospects. 
The Company enters into the Memorandum of 
Understanding and make advances for the land or 
land development rights prior to entering into any 
definitive agreement with the party. The Company 
ensures that negotiations might result in either a 
transaction for the Land Acquisition or Land 
Development Rights or revenue sharing.

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? 
The Code of Conduct, POSH Policy and Whistle Blower Policy provides the mechanism to 
prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.   
The Company effectively handles grievances by employing HR-related policies, including 
POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment), Code of Conduct, and a Whistleblower mechanism. 
It emphasizes strict adherence to these policies by all employees, assuring that their rights are 
safeguarded in case of any concerns. Moreover, the Company fosters an open-door culture, 
promoting a sense of security and approachability for employees to seek assistance from 
relevant authorities when addressing distress or concerns. This ensures a supportive and 
transparent work environment. 
At present, the Company's business agreements and contracts do not explicitly incorporate 
human rights requirements. Nevertheless, the Company acknowledges the significance of 
human rights considerations in its operations. To address this concern, the Company is actively 
engaging in internal deliberations and exploring the possibility of including human rights 
requirements in its future business agreements and contracts. This demonstrates the Company's 
commitment to integrate human rights principles into its practices going forward.
