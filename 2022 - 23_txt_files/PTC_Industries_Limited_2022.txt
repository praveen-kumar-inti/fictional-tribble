to resolve the issue, and the employee believes his or her complaint has progressed 
to the level of a grievance, the employee may file a formal grievance as stated in the 
policy in order to seek a fair resolution.
There is a grievance form and which available on-line and in physical form to raise 
grievances and which are resolved by the grievance addressal process.

Has the Company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
PTC Industries has effectively controlled the industrial wastewater generated by its activities, products, and services, and formulated 
waste management systems for handling wastewater properly. The Company makes the best utilisation of the  wastewater treatment 
system and as a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant, the Company is not discharging wastewater as well as treated water.  ZLD is an 
approach to water treatment where all water is recovered, and contaminants are reduced to solid waste. While many water treatment 
processes attempt to maximize the recovery of freshwater and minimize waste, ZLD is the most demanding target since the cost and 
challenges of recovery increase as the wastewater gets more concentrated. Salinity, scaling compounds, and organics all increase 
in concentration, which adds costs associated with managing these increases. ZLD is achieved by stringing together water treatment 
technology that can treat wastewater as the contaminants are concentrated. Since PTC Industries has installed ETP & STP plants to 
treat its generated wastewater, the treated wastewater is recycled for use to reduce the consumption of freshwater.

7.	
Does the Company have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details. 
	
PTC Industries is committed to continuous improvement and innovation to reduce consumption and emissions in its manufacturing 
processes. The company has undertaken several projects to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:
	
a.	
Renewable Energy Utilization: PTC Industries has made significant use of solar electricity (897.58 MWh) and electricity from 
wind-based turbines (365.71 MWh). Additionally, the company is actively working on a de-carbonization plan that focuses on 
improving the energy mix by adopting renewable energy sources and replacing fossil fuels with options that have comparatively 
lower emissions.
	
b.	
Transition to Cleaner Fuels: PTC Industries recognizes the environmental and cost benefits of using PNG (Piped Natural Gas) and 
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) systems over diesel-powered ones. The company has installed in its castings and heat treatment 
furnace pipelines, using furnaces with natural gas. This shift not only provides a cleaner alternative with higher energy-saving 
potential but also helps reduce GHG emissions. Natural gas combustion emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when 
used in new systems.
	
c.	
Efficient Heating Solutions: The company employs induction heaters instead of electric furnaces to heat castings during the 
machining process. This switch effectively reduces power consumption, contributing to overall energy efficiency.
	
d.	
LED Lighting Implementation: PTC Industries recognizes the benefits of LED lighting, including enhanced luminous efficiency 
and improved safety. LED lights significantly reduce CO2 emissions by minimizing fuel consumption compared to conventional 
lights. To further mitigate its carbon footprint, the company has launched a program to retrofit existing machinery and fuel 
systems, enabling them to operate on less carbon-intensive fuels. This initiative has resulted in a considerable reduction in 
the consumption of LDO (Light Diesel Oil) while increasing the utilization of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), a fuel with lower 
energy intensity. Consequently, PTC Industries has successfully reduced carbon emissions from its manufacturing processes by 
replacing equivalent energy sources with CNG, aligning with its commitment to environmental sustainability.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in 
your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
	
PTC Industries has prioritized waste management by 
integrating the principles of the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) 
waste management approach into its decision-making 
processes. By adhering to the solid waste management 
hierarchy, the company encourages its teams to innovate and 
find ways to divert waste.
	
A key focus for the company is the reduction of both hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste across its manufacturing sites. 
Various measures have been implemented throughout the 
year, such as recycling waste oil through alternative disposal 
pathways to minimize the hazardous waste load. Additionally, 
the company has taken steps to recycle ETP (Effluent 
Treatment Plant) sludge, reducing the need for disposal 
in landfills. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
company's waste profile, its sites have meticulously mapped 
waste generation and disposal methods. Furthermore, 
the company has enhanced its data collection systems, 
incorporating waste volumes into its monthly environmental 
dashboard. Through these initiatives, the company has 
identified three primary barriers that impede waste diversion 
from landfills: cost constraints, regulatory challenges, and 
limited resources. PTC Industries continues to address these 
barriers to further enhance its waste management practices 
and achieve its sustainability goals.
	
1.	
 Managing Hazardous Waste
	
	
PTC Industries ensures proper handling of hazardous 
wastes in accordance with regulatory requirements, 
and maintains a comprehensive waste registry. These 
hazardous wastes are transported to authorized agencies 
that specialize in their appropriate handling.The company 
diligently complies with all rules and regulations set 
forth by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) 
regarding the storage, handling, transportation, and 
recycling of hazardous products. This adherence aims 
to minimize potential exposure and ensure the highest 
level of safety. Additionally, PTC Industries adheres 
to applicable international standards that govern its 
operations in the respective locations where it operates.
	
2.	
Managing Non- Hazardous Waste
	
	
PTC Industries places significant emphasis on waste 
reduction at the source for non-hazardous waste by 
adopting a proactive approach. The company achieves 
this by purchasing and bringing into its facilities only 
what is necessary, thereby minimizing waste generation.
	
	
To accomplish this, PTC Industries has implemented 
practical and cost-effective solutions that align with both 
environmental and business objectives. Remarkable 
achievements have been made through these initiatives. 
For instance, recycled cardboard boxes are utilized 
as filler for packing materials, reducing the need for 
additional packaging materials. Reusable pallets have 
been introduced for parts delivery from vendors, as well 
as product delivery to dealers, eliminating the reliance 
on wood pallets. Furthermore, recycling initiatives have 
been implemented for paper and plastic waste generated 
in offices and break rooms.
	
	
These shared successes demonstrate PTC Industries' 
commitment to sustainable practices, where waste 
reduction 
strategies 
are 
implemented 
without 
substantial investments. The company strives to make 
environmentally conscious decisions that align with its 
business goals, creating a positive impact on both the 
environment and its operations.

At PTC Industries, we do have a preferential procurement 
policy that emphasizes supporting local suppliers and 
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 
We believe in nurturing local economies and promoting 
sustainable growth within the communities where we 
operate. As part of our commitment to responsible 
sourcing, we actively seek opportunities to collaborate 
with local suppliers and MSMEs, providing them with a 
platform to showcase their products and services.
	
	
However, it is essential to clarify that while we prioritize 
local and MSME suppliers, we do not give preference to 
suppliers based on marginalized or vulnerable group 
status. Our procurement decisions are primarily driven by 
factors such as quality, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and 
the ability to meet our specific business requirements.
	
	
While we firmly believe in fostering diversity and inclusivity 
within our workforce and supply chain, we acknowledge 
that in certain cases, suppliers from marginalized or 
vulnerable groups may not have the necessary capacity 
or specialization to form an effective supply chain for 
certain items being procured by the company. Our focus
