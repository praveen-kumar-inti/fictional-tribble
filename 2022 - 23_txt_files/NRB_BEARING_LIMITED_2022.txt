Business 
Continuity
Risk
Changing consumer 
preferences is driving change 
in India’s automotive industry. 
Consumer preferences and 
demand for two-wheeler 
vehicle and and the 
discontinuation of certain 
vehicle models will have 
an impact on the existing 
business model, product 
offerings and overall cost to 
company. 
As a strategy to adapt 
DQGIXO¿OWKHGHPDQG
of the consumers, we 
have undertaken process 
improvement and invested 
into development of new 
products.We are in the 
process of automating 
product manufacturing 
processes which will lead 
to development of new 
SURGXFWVPRUHHI¿FLHQWO\
We are expanding in newer 
geographies and penetrating 
newer segments to stay 
competitive in the industry 
and abreast with latest 
technology.
Development of 
newer models with 
latest technology 
and in line with 
customers’ demand 
will result in 
attracting of new 
customer base 
while retaining the 
existing customers. 
This will result in the 
increased revenue 
and market presence.
2
Changes in 
technology
Risk
Shifting demand for more 
sustainable alternatives,- 
there is an increased 
demand for electric vehicles. 
Increasing usage of electric 
vehicles in commercial 
vehicles will affect business of 
the Company. 
We are rapidly transforming 
our processes and adapting 
by developing products 
which are agnostic to the 
type of engine used in the 
vehicle. The Company is also 
vigorously working on new 
product development for 
manufacture of products for 
electric and hybrid vehicles.
Due to increasing 
usage of electric 
vehicles, there is a 
risk of reduction in 
Company’s revenue in 
the short term.

Procurement 
of raw 
materials and 
Supply Chain
Risk
Raw materials are the most 
important component in 
the production of goods. 
Procurement of raw materials 
are subject to market 
volatility, resulting from 
supply chain disruptions, 
increased demand with 
VLJQL¿FDQWLQFUHDVHLQWKH
price.
We ensure optimal supply of 
goods and services, focusing 
on quality, cost and delivery 
performance. Multiple product 
sourcing and localisation 
options are continuously 
explored. 
Fluctuations in raw 
material prices and/
RUVXSSOLHU¶V¿QDQFLDO
conditions could have 
an impact on the 
Company’s earnings.
We rely on a network of 
suppliers across various 
geographies to source raw 
materials, and various parts 
used in the manufacturing 
of bearings. Supply chain 
disruption may adversely 
impact the total production 
volume, loss of revenue, 
increased cost, loss of 
customer and reduced

Moreover, since our suppliers 
are spread across various 
geographies, ongoing

great threat to commodity 
price stability along with 
various regulatory restrictions 
DQGFXUUHQF\ÀXFWXDWLRQV
By negotiating prices and 
utilising economic synergies, 
we are largely able to obtain 
competitive prices. We also 
analyse the operations of 
our suppliers, by deploying 
dedicated personnel 
performing quality checks, 
for early signs of distress 
so that interventions can be 
made to secure its interests.
Representations are made to 
relevant authorities to ensure 
timely clearance of import 
consignments

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste
Plastics: Plastic wastes are generated from our manufacturing and packaging materials used in our products. We 
acknowledge that the plastic used in product packaging has an impact on the environment. We make reasonable 
efforts to keep track of all the products used and have implemented a robust internal waste management system 
of collection, segregation, storage, and disposal. As a part end-of-life product management, we are continuously 
working on improving our product’s circularity. Currently, we are in the process of complying with the requirements 
of the EPR registration.
E-waste: Since, our main product category is bearings. This is not applicable. However, as an effort to manage 
e-waste, which comprises of electronic devices, their components and IT assets which are discarded after their 
useful life or due to obsolescence, it is disposed only to authorized re-cyclers.
Hazardous waste: Since, our main product category is bearings, this is not applicable. Hazardous waste generated 
from manufacturing locations is safely disposed of to an authorized recycler.
Other waste: Since, our main product category is bearings, this is not applicable.
4.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
We are subject to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations under The Plastic Waste Management and 
Handling Rules, 2016 (as amended), falls within the category of ‘producer’ or ’brand owner’. Plastic is used for 
packaging balls and bearings as well as in the manufacturing of certain types of bearings.
Thus, we are in the process to develop a waste collection plan in line with EPR guidelines to submit to Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Health and safety management system:
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes. We are committed to provide safe and healthy working conditions to all its employees and workers. We believe 
that creating and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment is a pre-requisite for employee well-being, and 
the adoption of best practices in occupational health and safety is critical to attain business excellence. Our EHS

locations. We have an occupational health and safety policy in place which acts as a guideline and commitment 
towards the management of key HSE aspects.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
We have implemented EHS management system which helps in identifying occupational health and safety risks

framework which enables our employees and workers to identify and contain work-related risks which pose a threat. 
The carried-out assessment is followed up with documentation of risks and hazards present within our environment, 
their root causes, associated consequences and risk and hazard containment strategy and recommendations.
We have also appointed safety committee at each plant site headed by the plant head to identify and mitigate 
the risks associated with health and safety. Our Health and Safety Committee ensures proper establishment, 
implementation, maintenance, and continual improvement of processes needed for the elimination of hazards and 
minimization of actual and potential risks.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes. Workers are encouraged to report work-related hazards through established mechanism at each plant. To 
promote  safety culture, we have established a drop box system across all plants which enables our employees and
