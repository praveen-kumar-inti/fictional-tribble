Climate Change 
(Emissions, Water 
Consumption, 
Energy Efficiency)
R
Climate-related factors 
such as emissions, water 
usage, and energy 
efficiency can disrupt 
business operations and 
regulatory compliance, 
especially during natural 
calamities or power crises.
Tanla uses renewable energy 
sources at critical sites and 
ensures continuity through 
alternate power solutions like 
UPS and diesel generators. 
Proactive environmental 
planning and infrastructure 
are in place to avoid reactive 
measures post-calamity.
Investment 
in resilient 
infrastructure helps 
maintain operations, 
ensure compliance, 
and minimize 
long-term business 
disruption. [GRI 201-2]

Employee 
Engagement 
and Talent 
Retention
R & O
Attracting, engaging, and 
retaining talent is critical 
for sustaining innovation, 
growth, and operational 
continuity, especially in a 
competitive technology 
environment.
Strengthening L&D programs, 
implement employee 
engagement surveys, promote 
internal mobility, conduct 
regular skip-level meetings, 
and offer competitive 
compensation to retain talent 
and reduce attrition
Investment 
in learning, 
development, and 
benefits enhances 
retention and 
reduces rehiring and 
productivity loss 
costs.
3
Labour Practices 
and Diversity & 
Inclusion (D&I)
O
Non-compliance with 
labor norms and lack of 
focus on D&I may lead 
to reputational damage 
and legal exposure. On 
the other hand, promoting 
diversity and ethical 
practices strengthens 
innovation, employer 
branding, and stakeholder 
confidence.
Ensure compliance with 
labor laws, uphold ethical 
labor practices, and promote 
diversity and inclusion across 
the organization.
Enhanced 
innovation, brand 
reputation, and 
access to wider 
talent pools.

R
Any breach of customer 
data can severely impact 
Tanla’s brand trust, result 
in regulatory penalties, 
and affect customer 
retention.
Strengthen data security 
protocols, ensure compliance 
with privacy laws, maintain 
transparency in data handling 
practices. Conduct Privacy 
Impact Assessments (PIA), 
implement DLP solutions, and 
enforce privacy-by-design 
principles.

churn and loss 
of revenue due 
to reputational 
damage. Investment 
in data privacy 
solutions is essential 
to avoid regulatory 
fines and maintain 
long-term business 
sustainability.

and IT Security
R
Cybersecurity threats 
pose significant 
operational, reputational, 
and compliance risks. Any 
breach could compromise 
sensitive data, disrupt 
services, and affect 
Tanla’s market credibility. 
Data compromise 
can lead to risks that 
can impact beyond a 
company.
A robust IT security 
infrastructure including SOC 
implementation, Zero Trust 
Architecture, regular VAPT, 
encryption at rest and in 
transit, security awareness 
training for employees, and 
tabletop exercises for senior 
management has been 
prioritized. These are aligned 
with ISO 27001, SOC2, and 
DPDP frameworks to strengthen 
resilience and ensure proactive 
mitigation.
Significant 
investment required 
for infrastructure, 
tools, and training. 
These initiatives 
prevent costly 
breaches, improve 
regulatory 
compliance, reduce 
business disruption, 
and reinforce long-
term customer and 
investor confidence
6
Customer 
Relationship 
Management
R & O
Strong customer 
relationships drive 
retention, loyalty, and 
revenue growth, while 
weak engagement can 
result in customer churn 
and lost opportunities.

Customer Success function, 
ensure timely grievance 
redressal, and conduct 
regular customer reviews and 
feedback sessions.

improved trust 
and relationship 
management.

Corporate Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR)
R & O
CSR reflects Tanla’s 
commitment to ethical 
practices and social 
good. A lack of visible 
CSR initiatives can 
impact reputation and 
stakeholder trust, while 
active programs enhance 
community relations and 
brand value.
Align CSR initiatives with 
community needs and 
sustainability goals, ensure 
transparency in CSR reporting, 
and engage employees in 
volunteering and social impact 
programs.
Allocation of 
resources & 
investment for 
CSR strengthen

engagement, and 
support long-
term sustainability 
objectives, 
contributing to 
social license to

2. Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
Tanla has institutionalized a structured framework to proactively prevent, identify, and manage conflicts of interest the 
Board level. Our approach is anchored in ensuring that all decisions are made objectively, in the best interest of Tanla 
and its stakeholders.
All members of the Board are required to annually declare any financial, personal, or other interests that may give rise 
to conflicts, in line with the Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management, which sets clear expectations for 
ethical conduct and transparency. Directors are also expected to promptly disclose any emerging situations that may 
present a conflict during the course of the year. These declarations are reviewed by the Company Secretary and placed 
before the Board, ensuring complete transparency and regulatory compliance.
Additionally, our Whistleblower Policy provides an independent channel for reporting any concerns relating to potential 
conflicts, ensuring such matters are escalated directly to the Audit Committee or the Board, as applicable, and dealt 
with in a fair and unbiased manner.
These mechanisms collectively reinforce Tanla’s commitment to fostering the highest standards of governance, integrity, 
and accountability at the leadership level.

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. [GRI 3-3, GRI 306-2]
Given the nature of Tanla’s operations, which are predominantly digital and service-oriented, the generation of end-
of-life waste is limited to internal IT hardware, office consumables, and incidental materials. Nevertheless, We instituted 
structured processes to ensure responsible disposal, recycling, and management of all such waste in compliance with 
applicable regulations.
a. Plastics (including packaging):
Tanla does not produce or distribute products involving plastic packaging. Additionally, as part of our commitment to 
environmental stewardship, we adopted a strict ‘No Single-Use Plastic’ policy within the office premises. Any plastic 
waste generated from external packaging (e.g., office supplies) is responsibly segregated and disposed through 
authorized recycling partners.
b. E-waste:
All obsolete or end-of-life IT and electronic equipment, including laptops, servers, networking devices, and peripherals, 
are disposed through certified e-waste recyclers in compliance with the E-Waste Management Rules, 2022, ensuring 
safe recycling and recovery of materials.
c. Hazardous Waste:
Tanla’s operations do not generate hazardous waste as defined under the Hazardous and Other Wastes 
(Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016.
 
d. Other Waste:
Office-generated waste, including paper, packaging, and organic waste, is segregated at source and handed over to 
authorized municipal agencies or recyclers. Tanla actively promotes paperless and digital-first processes to minimize 
overall waste generation.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
No, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable to Tanla’s activities.
Given the nature of Tanla’s business as a digital communications and technology services provider, we do not 
manufacture or sell any products that fall under the purview of EPR regulations, such as plastic packaging, electrical 
and electronic equipment, or batteries.
However, Tanla remains committed to responsible waste management and ensures that any e-waste or incidental 
waste generated from office operations is disposed through authorized recyclers in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations.
Leadership Indicators
1.	 Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
No. Tanla mainly operates in digital communication and platform services and does not deal with manufacturing or 
physical products. Therefore, using a full life cycle approach for its core operations has limited relevance.
However, Tanla applies the life cycle approach to the products and services it buys for its own use. Most of these are 
ready-made, standard items. Tanla includes green practices while making purchase decisions—such as checking for 
environmental impact—and ensures proper disposal or recycling at the end of their use to reduce waste.
2.	 If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal 
of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other 
means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
Tanla provides digital communication solutions and cloud-based platform services. The nature of its offerings does 
not give rise to any direct social or environmental concerns. Information on the environmental impact of Tanla’s 
operations, along with the measures taken to reduce it, is disclosed under Principle 6.

Recycled or re-used input material to

It is currently difficult to quantify the amount of reused or recycled input 
materials due to the following reasons:
•	 Water usage: Water consumption in office premises is minimized through 
water-efficient fixtures and reuse of treated water for landscaping.
•	 E-waste management: Obsolete IT hardware is responsibly recycled through 
authorized e-waste recyclers.
•	 Packaging material: Limited packaging waste generated from office supplies 
is recycled through certified vendors.
