Positive
Company has reduced the 
Carbon footprint from Scope 
2 emission at Madurai plant 
by 21 % comparison to last 
year.
Usage of 100% biomass fuel

in Boilers in this plant.
Zero water pollution due to 
maintaining 
zero 
liquid 
discharge in Madurai plant.
Negative
Risk of non achievement of 
financial goals because of 
exposure to concentrated 
business 
segments 
and 
geographies.
Positive
The initiatives taken by the 
company 
provide 
the 
opportunity to expand its 
business 
into 
a 
larger 
number of segments and 
geographies.
Negative
Raw material and commodity 
pricing 
fluctuations 
have 
direct corelation with the 
profit margins.
Positive
The company has a strong 
development 
/ 
research 
programs in place to address 
emerging

This 
should 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
revenue 
and 
profitability.
In the past, the company's 
operations 
have 
been 
concentrated in a few segments 
and geographies.
• Raw material price volatility can 
affect budgeted product costing.
• Disturbances in global economy 
could lead to supply chain 
disruption, thereby impact 
on-time delivery of raw materials
The 
market 
is 
dynamically 
changing, rising demand for more 
sustainable materials usage, rising 
EV 
segments, 
stringent 
performance 
requirements, 
increasing demand to delivery in 
short time frame provides an 
opportunity to deliver innovative 
products and services.
Demand-Supply mismatch, global 
economic policy changes leading 
to surge in raw material prices and 
reducing company's contribution.
The company has taken initiatives 
to align its organisation structure, 
build organisation capabilities and 
engage with employees.
Standardisation, more of 
commodity inputs that are 
locally available rather than 
speciality 
materials 
and 
cost competitive imports 
from FTA countries are few 
of the business approaches 
done by the company to 
control input costs.
Negative
Lower market demand, Stiff 
competition and inability to 
pass-on 
the 
input 
cost 
increases in full affects the 
company's earnings.
Positive
The actions initiated are 
targeted at fulfilling the twin 
objectives 
of 
business 
success and an engaged 
workforce.
The 
company 
has 
embarked on a program to 
enlarge its presence in a 
larger number of segments 
(product 
as 
well 
as 
customer). 
In 
addition, 
greater focus on global 
markets has also been 
initiated.
• The company optimises its 
cost by Strategic sourcing 
of seasonal inputs and 
entering long term 
contracts with key 
suppliers. 
• Supply security is 
protected with maximising 
domestic business share 
and on-boarding multiple 
vendors for each raw 
material.

1 and 2 audit through external 
consultant and worked out the

sources. The renewable power 
consumption in Madurai plant 
increased from 74% to 80 %.
3. Company successfully uses 
100% biomass fuel for steam 
generation in the Uttarakhand 
plant. 
4. Company successfully 
completed 1MW roof top plant 
in UKD plant #2.

reduced the Specific power 
consumption by 3 % in Madurai 
facility.

1. Wastewater coming out of cooling towers is treated by an ETP. The reject water from the ETP is further treated through evaporator. 
The reject is converted into the form of salts through the evaporator. The result is the maintenance and sustenance of zero liquid 
discharge.
2. Wastewater from toilets is treated in the STP and recycled. This also contributes to zero liquid discharge.
3. All our boilers are equipped with ESPs to significantly reduce particulate emission and maintain green chimneys.
4. Solid wastes generated from rejected tyres in process defective materials are disposed of through specified recycling contractors.
5. Generated sludge is stored and sold through TNPCB authorized disposal agencies.
6. Ash generated from boilers is sold to fly ash brick manufacturers as raw materials.
7. To prevent the bad odor from chemical wet sludge generated from ETP process, we have installed sludge dryer machine to make 
the sludge into powder form, as well as weight reduction to reduce disposal cost.
8. To improve the water treatment quality, we have provided one additional aeration tank in STP.
