essential products forming part of basic rather than discretionary spending. Customers recognise us as a one-stop retail 
store chain for daily needs at value for money prices.

1
Talent 
Management
Opportunity 
and Risk
Talent attraction: Retail being 
a service industry attracts talent 
naturally due to comfortable 
working environment, local 
recruitment opportunities and 
competitive wages. At the same 
time, the industry also requires a 
significant amount of hard work and 
rigour.
Diversity and Inclusion: We 
attract a high share of women 
employees vis a vis other industries 
through our geographical spread 
of stores. Safe and comfortable 
working environment along with 
less commute to work are the key 
factors.
Local Community Development: 
Retail offers local communities 
good entry-level jobs at competitive 
wages which allows community 
members to acquire skills and 
an opportunity to advance to 
higher wages and better careers, 
especially in smaller towns.
Learning and Development 
(L&D): Our strong emphasis on 
L&D leads to enhanced career 
opportunities and helps us build 
employee loyalty.
Employee Voice and 
Engagement: Our corporate 
culture emphasizes all employees 
to raise any concerns / feedback 
directly with the Management. An 
independent Ethics Helpline is also 
available.
The inherent advantages 
of the industry ensure 
continuous availability of 
talent at junior to mid-level 
positions. However, at times 
there are challenges in hiring 
industry appropriate senior 
leadership positions.
Diversity and inclusion 
enables equitable 
development, improved 
performance and retention of 
our culture & values.
Local community 
development augurs well 
for the reputation and brand 
image of our organisation.
A strong L&D programme 
enables us to internally 
fill a significant portion of 
mid-level positions through 
promotions and internal job 
postings.
Employee voice allows for 
actionable insights and better 
decision-making based on 
employee feedback.

Customer 
Experience
Opportunity 
and Risk
Value Retailing: Our business 
model is based on the concept 
of offering value retailing to our 
customers using the Every Day 
Low Cost / Every Day Low Price 
(EDLC/EDLP) strategy. The EDLC/
EDLP strategy is based on offering 
low prices on an everyday basis 
by achieving low procurement 
and operations cost rather than 
as special promotion limited to 
certain products or to a particular 
day, week or any other specific 
period in the year. However, 
competitive intensity in the country 
can adversely affect our strategy as 
more players adopt similar business 
models through their operations.
Optimal Product Assortment: 
We sell a wide range of goods and 
merchandise across our product 
categories. We have an extensive 
network of suppliers and we 
endeavour to source our products 
from regions where they are widely 
available or manufactured. We 
also consciously focus on local 
assortment in each area.
Customer Feedback: Our store 
personnel interact with customers 
frequently to understand their 
experience and take feedback on 
our services. We also encourage 
our customers to share their 
valuable feedback with us and have 
made available several channels 
which they can use to reach us.
Our EDLC / EDLP model 
ensures that customers 
always get good quality 
products at great prices 
throughout the year. This 
ensures customer loyalty and 
repeat purchases.
Competitive intensity from 
existing retailers (including 
E-retailers) and prospective 
entrants and consequent 
pricing pressures may impact 
our business, financial 
condition and results of 
operations.
Our extensive assortment 
ensures that customers are 
provided quality products.
Procurement of products 
from closer to our distribution 
centres / stores allows us to 
reduce costs. Further, our 
focus on local assortment 
enables development of local 
vendors in each area.
Continuous feedback from 
customers enables us to 
improve our service quality 
and enhances customer 
satisfaction.

Climate 
Change
Opportunity 
and Risk
Extreme Weather Events: Rising 
temperatures and changes in 
weather patterns could impact and 
disrupt our business operations.
Value Chain Impact: Climate 
change could also potentially 
impact the business operations 
of our supply chain and sourcing 
partners leading to product 
availability and increase of products 
and services cost.
Resource Availability: There 
could be challenges in availability 
of resources including water which 
could impact our business and 
those of our value chain partners.
Climate Regulations: Increasing 
shift towards a low-carbon 
economy could trigger several 
changes in Climate Regulations 
potentially leading to higher cost 
of compliance and new ways of 
conducting business.
Value Retail as an industry is 
significantly less resource intensive. 
Our efficient cost and agile 
operations allows us to adapt / 
change multiple levers of cost, risk 
and business opportunities in the 
context of adverse effects of climate 
change.
Considering the overall development 
of the country, the emission per 
person and the nature of our 
business model, we have developed 
a matrix for our go to market 
strategy to address risks from 
climate change. This has helped 
us to integrate and deploy several 
best practices that help in areas 
of energy conservation, water 
conservation, use of sustainable 
building materials, recycling / reuse 
of materials and transportation 
efficiency.
Climate Change may result in 
lower sales, lesser profits and 
/ or increased investments 
in the short to medium‑term. 
However, the operating 
efficiencies of our business 
allow for limited impact 
compared to other formats of 
retail / similar industries.
Further, any potential change 
in Climate related regulations 
may lead to higher cost of 
compliance.

Care and Truth which are a guiding light for all our activities. We continue to strengthen our approach to sustainability through 
various means that would have a meaningful long-term positive impact to our company, its employees, the environment and all 
other stakeholders. Considering the overall development of the country, the emission per person and the nature of our business 
model, we have developed a matrix for our go to market strategy on sustainability. It is an approach that is practical and 
appropriate. It is not aggressive or path breaking; however it is contextual to deliver incremental results over a long period of time.  
	
Retail needs a lot of hard work from our employees and partners, precision systems and a competent workforce. Hence our focus 
on recruiting locals in every location and then upskilling them and grooming them to become leaders of tomorrow is very intrinsic 
to our model of efficient operation and long-term competitive advantage. Our endeavour is also to nurture local products and local 
businesses so that they too can compete with minimal costs to launch their products.
	
We believe that as a company we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to make meaningful contributions to the lives of

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
B. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs was sourced sustainably? 
	
	
The Company has a structured procedure which is followed before collaborating with any business partners/ associates. Our 
team visits their facilities to assess and evaluate them on health and safety parameters. 
	
	
Further, the Company is aiming to reduce its fuel consumption in transportation by operating through common distribution 
centres in vicinity of our store locations, wherever feasible. This minimises the distance to transport goods to our stores and 
helps us consolidate multiple trips by individual suppliers to our various stores, thus reducing fuel consumption. For details 
please refer to our section ‘Environmental Focus at Dmart’ on pg 12 of this Annual report.
	
	
With a view to empower our customers, we continued our interactions with our large suppliers to introduce products that 
reuse materials thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint. To this end we have taken small steps and introduced some 
articles which use recycled materials in a few large categories. Our endeavor is to further partner with our vendors and make 
available products which are economically viable and environmentally sustainable.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company’s principle nature of business is to provide everyday use products to end consumers. However, one of our subsidiary 
Company procures, processes and repacks certain products which are provided to end consumers through our stores. Owing 
to the nature of our business we generate very limited amount of waste. The plastic packaging and paper waste generated at 
our stores / packaging units is segregated at source and stored in a secure place. This waste is then handed over to authorised 
recyclers. We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 71 locations. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no 
loose plastic littering, good hygiene and reduced transportation frequency.  This initiative helps in reducing the number of truck trips 
for the recycler and thus reduces Scope 3 emissions to that extent.

and other relevant stakeholders. The said policy mandates to abide by all applicable labour laws and regulations in our business 
operations. It also provides a robust grievance mechanism which addresses complaints and issues pertaining to human rights and 
is accessible to all relevant internal and external stakeholders. The policy also encourages all our value chain partners to support 
us and avoid any situation of human rights violations.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Our Vigil Mechanism / Whistle-Blower Policy provide a robust framework for dealing with concerns and grievances raised by any 
stakeholder confidentially and anonymously, without fear of any retaliation. Further, we have engaged a reputed third party which 
runs an independent Ethics Helpline (Web based complaints, toll-free telephone number, email, fax and post complaints can be 
logged by all employees). All our employees are free to connect with the helpline. It is ensured that all engagement is completely 
confidential and is only shared with Senior Management of the Company. This helps employees report any grievance / complaint / 
issue that they may face at any time during employment. 
	
Adequate communication boards are placed at all premises which provide the contact details of this helpline. We have further 
provided a platform through our website where all stakeholders can directly share feedback. This feedback can be shared 
anonymously and is accessed directly by a small team at the Central Corporate Office. Key points / issues / suggestions are then 
directly shared with the Management Team to further direct appropriate changes in line with our culture and values.
	
Additionally, all Women are comprehensively protected against any form of sexual harassment through a comprehensive policy 
under “The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013”. The purpose of this 
policy is to provide protection against acts of sexual harassment of women at workplace and for the prevention and redressal of 
complaints of sexual harassment in addition to the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

a sexual harassment concern is subject to any form of reprisal. Any act of reprisal is subject to disciplinary action. The Company

with complaints of sexual harassment against women. Further, our policy mandates that the identity and address of the aggrieved 
woman, respondent, and witnesses, any information relating to conciliation and inquiry proceedings, recommendations and the 
action taken by the management will not be published, communicated or made known to the public, press, media in any manner 
and any person contravening the confidentiality clauses will be subject to disciplinary action.
	
Similarly, no unfair treatment is meted out to a Whistle Blower by virtue of his/ her having reported a Protected Disclosure under 
our Vigil Mechanism policy. The company does not tolerate any kind of discrimination, harassment, victimisation or any other unfair 
employment practice against Whistle-Blowers. Complete protection is given to Whistle Blowers against any unfair practice like 
retaliation, threat or intimidation of termination / suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion 
or the like including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the Whistle Blower’s right to continue to perform his duties /
functions including making further Protected Disclosure. Our policy also considers anonymous complaints. Further, the policy also

The Company’s principle nature of business is to procure everyday use products from reputed brands / manufacturers and provide 
the same to end consumers. Given this nature of business, our water consumption is primarily for drinking, personal hygiene 
and general cleaning purposes. However, we understand the importance of water conversation and therefore We have installed 
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) at 144 locations. The wastewater generated is treated and reused for flushing toilets in our 
washrooms. This helps us to reduce our fresh-water requirement and intake. 37.2% of our total water usage at these premises is 
through recycled water. We estimate to have reduced usage of 111,690 kiloliters of fresh water.
	
We have also started using Pressure Washers at our premises. Water is released with pressure from the nozzles of this equipment 
which helps in efficient cleaning at significantly lower water consumption. The equipment also has an integrated auto-stop system 
which enhances energy efficiency. Further, we have installed low-flow water efficient fixtures at our stores. These have aerators 
fixed by default to maintain and regulate water flow. We have developed Rainwater Harvesting system comprising of 322 pits / 
tanks with a designed cumulative capacity of 8,115 cubic meters per day.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Solar Energy: We have commissioned 190 solar plants with cumulative capacity of 27.8 MW from these installations. Of the total 
energy requirement at these premises, 22% is met through Solar Energy. Subject to on-ground feasibility, it is our endeavour to 
ensure that all our new premises have a solar plant installed. We have also commenced installing rooftop solar plants at some of 
our distribution and production centres. Further, we have installed car ports at 22 stores during the year. We have 40 stores as of 
March 2023 that use more than 50% of their total electricity requirement through Solar Energy. Further, during the year we have 
initiated a pilot of installing solar lights in open spaces within our premises at a few locations.
	
Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less energy in comparison to 
conventional air conditioners. We have also commenced using energy efficient inverter air conditioners at select locations.
	
We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 71 locations. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic 
littering, good hygiene and reduced transportation frequency. This initiative helps in reducing the number of truck trips for the 
recycler and thus reduces Scope 3 emissions to that extent.
	
Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring several of our energy 
consuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible breakdowns and energy conservation 
possibilities.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Waste Management is one of the most critical processes that we have established in the organisation. We have a space to keep the 
cartons and plastic scrap. This is segregated at the store level. This segregated scrap is then compressed using baling machines 
as available. This scrap is then stored at a dedicated location and then sustainably disposed through authorised channels. We have 
installed hydraulic baling machines at 71 locations. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, 
good hygiene and reduced transportation frequency. This initiative helps in reducing the number of truck trips for the recycler and 
thus reduces Scope 3 emissions to that extent.
