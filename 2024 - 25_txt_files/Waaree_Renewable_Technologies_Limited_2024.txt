26.	 Overview of the Entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental 
and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, 
approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format.

Financial 
implications of the

(indicate positive

1
Customer 
experience & 
satisfaction
Risk
Poor quality of services 
and products can lead to 
customer dissatisfaction, 
potential 
loss 
of 
customers, and damage 
to 
brand 
reputation. 
Maintaining 
high 
standards 
of 
customer 
experience is crucial for 
retaining customers and 
ensuring repeat business.
To mitigate this risk, we actively use 
multiple channels to engage with 
our 
customers, 
such 
as 
surveys, 
reviews, social media, and direct 
communication. This allows us to 
gather 
continuous 
and 
real-time 
feedback, which helps identify issues 
early and enables us to take corrective 
actions quickly. We also focus on staff 
training, quality control, and process 
optimization to ensure the delivery of 
top-notch products and services.

2
Safeguarding 
Biodiversity
Risk
Our 
operations 
and 
services 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
negatively 
impact biodiversity and 
ecosystem services. Such 
impacts could result in the 
loss of protected species, 
habitat 
fragmentation, 
and 
the 
disruption 
of 
critical 
ecological 
functions. This not only 
poses 
environmental 
risks but can also lead 
to reputational damage 
and 
jeopardize 
our 
social license to operate, 
particularly 
in 
regions 
with strict environmental 
regulations or sensitive 
ecosystems.
We 
proactively 
manage 
our 
environmental footprint by closely 
monitoring 
and 
mitigating 
any 
negative 
impacts 
on 
biodiversity. 
Our approach includes conducting 
thorough biodiversity risk assessments 
during the planning stages of key 
projects. Additionally, we ensure that all 
projects adhere to a robust Biodiversity 
Management Plan, which aligns with 
global best practices and industry 
standards. This includes minimizing 
habitat 
disruption, 
preserving 
endangered species, and taking steps 
to 
restore 
impacted 
ecosystems 
whenever possible.
Negative
3
Employee & 
workforce 
engagement, 
welfare
Risk
Higher employee turnover 
can lead to a decrease in 
overall productivity and 
the loss of valuable tacit 
knowledge, which is often 
not easily transferred. This 
turnover can also disrupt 
team dynamics, reduce 
morale, 
and 
increase 
recruitment and training 
costs. Additionally, the loss 
of experienced employees 
can affect the quality and 
continuity of work, leading 
to potential delays and 
operational inefficiencies.
To mitigate this risk, we prioritize 
employee 
engagement 
and 
satisfaction by implementing various 
strategies 
aimed 
at 
improving 
retention. 
These 
include 
refining 
recruitment and onboarding processes 
to ensure the right cultural and 
professional fit, offering competitive 
compensation packages and benefits, 
providing 
continuous 
development 
opportunities, and promoting a healthy 
work-life balance. Furthermore, we 
conduct thorough exit interviews to 
gather insights and feedback, helping 
us address potential issues before 
they result in turnover. These proactive 
measures are designed to foster a 
supportive work environment, improve 
job satisfaction, and ultimately retain 
talent.

4
Health & safety
Risk
Ensuring 
the 
safety 
and well-being of our 
employees, who are our 
most 
valuable 
assets, 
is 
critical. 
Failure 
to 
manage 
health 
and 
safety 
risks 
effectively 
could lead to workplace 
accidents, 
injuries, 
or 
long-term health issues 
for 
employees. 
These 
incidents not only affect 
the individuals involved 
but can also result in 
legal liabilities, regulatory 
fines, 
reputational 
damage, and disruptions 
to operations, ultimately 
affecting the company’s 
financial 
performance 
and stakeholder trust.
To address this risk, Waaree RTL 
has 
implemented 
a 
robust 
and 
comprehensive 
Health, 
Safety, 
and Environment (HSE) policy and 
procedure that applies across all 
operations. 
We 
conduct 
regular 
assessments 
to 
identify 
potential 
health and safety hazards and take 
proactive measures to control or 
eliminate them. This includes providing 
ongoing 
training 
and 
awareness 
programs for employees, promoting 
a culture of safety, and conducting 
periodic reviews to ensure compliance 
with evolving safety standards. These 
efforts are overseen by the Board to 
ensure accountability and continuous 
improvement in safety practices.
Negative
5
Human rights 
& labour 
conditions
Risk
Violations 
of 
human 
rights and poor labour 
conditions can severely 
damage the company’s 
reputation 
and 
brand 
integrity. These violations 
can 
lead 
to 
negative 
media 
attention, 
loss 
of customer trust, legal 
actions, 
and 
even 
boycotts. As stakeholders 
increasingly 
prioritize 
ethical practices, failing 
to uphold human rights 
standards 
could 
result 
in a loss of business 
opportunities 
and 
partnerships, and make 
it difficult to attract and 
retain talent.
To mitigate this risk, we conduct 
thorough human rights assessments 
for all our operations and supply 
chains. This includes ensuring that 
our business practices comply with 
national and international labour laws, 
as well as adopting fair treatment, 
non-discrimination, 
and 
ethical 
labour practices across all levels of 
our organization. We also implement 
regular audits and collaborate with 
external 
stakeholders 
to 
identify 
and address potential human rights 
concerns, ensuring that we maintain a 
high standard of ethical conduct and 
respect for workers’ rights.

Climate action
Risk
The 
risks 
associated 
with 
climate 
change, 
including more frequent 
and 
severe 
weather 
events, are increasingly 
affecting 
businesses 
worldwide. 
These 
risks 
can disrupt operations, 
damage 
infrastructure, 
and lead to increased 
costs, 
potentially 
impacting the company’s 
profitability 
and 
long-
term 
sustainability. 
Failure 
to 
adequately 
manage 
these 
climate 
risks could also result in 
non-compliance 
with 
evolving 
environmental 
regulations and a loss of 
stakeholder trust.
To address and mitigate climate 
change 
risks, 
we 
follow 
a 
comprehensive approach outlined in 
the Board’s Risk Policy. This includes the 
identification of climate-related risks, 
systematic control measures, and the 
development of adaptation strategies. 
We 
focus 
on 
reducing 
emissions 
through 
targeted 
sustainability 
initiatives, 
including 
energy-
efficient technologies and resource 
optimization. Additionally, we engage 
stakeholders to ensure transparency, 
compliance with policies, and proactive 
management 
of 
climate-related 
risks. Part of our efforts also involves 
investing 
in 
resilient 
infrastructure 
development to withstand the impacts 
of adverse weather events and other 
climate challenges.
Negative
7
Diversity, 
inclusion 
& equal 
opportunity
Risk
Diversity and inclusion are 
crucial aspects of being 
an 
equal 
opportunity 
employer. 
With 
the 
growing 
emphasis 
on 
unique skill sets from a 
diverse 
workforce, 
this 
area represents
a significant reputational 
risk factor.
We promote workplace diversity by 
improving representation at all levels 
and fostering an inclusive culture 
through effective policies and practices. 
This ensures equal opportunities for 
growth and development across the 
organization.
Negative

Data security, 
privacy, and

from 
unauthorized 
access and ensure data integrity.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
1.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by 
the Entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
	
	
Yes, the organization has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
Management System that covers all construction project sites, operations and maintenance (O&M) 
activities, and office locations. This system is aligned with the Waaree RTL Health, Safety, and Environmental 
(HSE) Policy and adheres to the ISO 45001:2018 standard, an international benchmark for managing 
occupational health and safety risks.
	
	
The OHS Management System sets out mandatory requirements for the systematic management and 
execution of health and safety protocols across the organization. It ensures that potential risks are identified, 
assessed, and controlled to prevent workplace accidents and injuries, fostering a strong safety culture.
	
	
Additionally, the company’s Integrated HSE Management System is accredited by internationally recognized 
certification bodies, further demonstrating its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of safety 
and health in the workplace. This accreditation confirms the organization’s adherence to global safety 
practices and regulatory requirements, ensuring a safe working environment for all involved.
	
2.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the Entity?
	
	
Waaree RTL has established a systematic and proactive risk management process designed to identify 
and control hazards in both routine and non-routine activities across construction project sites, O&M 
operations, and office locations. This process is centred around key procedures, including Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and the Permit to Work system, all of 
which are mandatory for any activity. These procedures ensure that all risks are rigorously assessed and 
approved before work commences, promoting a culture of safety.
	
	
The risk assessment and management process actively involve relevant stakeholders such as construction 
engineers, design and planning engineers, EHS team members, and workers. Their collective input ensures 
comprehensive risk evaluations and the implementation of appropriate control measures. Additionally, 
all risk assessment records are carefully maintained, ensuring easy accessibility and transparency 
for all involved parties. This thorough documentation supports effective monitoring and continuous 
improvement of the risk management process, providing stakeholders with clear insights into safety 
practices and decisions.
	
3.	
Whether you have processes for Workers to report work related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks.
	
	
Reporting workplace hazards plays a vital role in improving Health & Safety performance. We strongly 
urge all personnel involved in project execution, including the workforce of our contractors, to proactively 
identify hazards and report them promptly using our designated reporting procedures. Each reported 
hazard is carefully monitored until it is resolved, and comprehensive preventive measures are put in place 
to prevent future occurrences.
	
4.	 Do the Employees/Workers of the Entity have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services?
	
	
Yes, employees and workers are covered under Mediclaim/ESIC policies for non-occupational 
medical services.

as toilets and wash stations used by our workforce. Even this volume is minimal and poses no significant 
environmental impact.
	
To further reduce our water footprint, we have proactively implemented the use of dry portable urinals 
wherever feasible across our project sites. This initiative not only conserves water but also supports our broader 
sustainability goals by minimizing the generation of domestic wastewater.
	
Our approach aligns with best practices in water conservation and underscores our dedication to continuous 
improvement in environmental performance.

Does the Entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide 
details.
	
At Waaree RTL, we are firmly committed to reducing our environmental impact by actively addressing both 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. A key component of this effort is the strategic integration of 
solar energy systems at our construction sites, significantly minimizing our dependence on conventional diesel 
generators. This transition not only results in a substantial reduction in diesel consumption but also contributes 
directly to our overarching goal of lowering our operational carbon footprint.
	
In alignment with our sustainability objectives, we have also prioritized the use of 5-star rated energy-efficient 
electrical appliances across our sites and facilities. These appliances are designed to consume less power, 
thereby enhancing overall energy efficiency and supporting our commitment to two critical United Nations
