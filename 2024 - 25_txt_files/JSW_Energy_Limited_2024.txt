10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, At JSW Group we are committed towards the Health & Safety of the employees and workmen. 
JSW Energy is certified with “Occupational Health and Safety Management System” and aligned with 
ISO 45001:2018 standards applicable to all the operations of the Company. We have also implemented 
the Safety Governance System i.e. various safety committees at all operational and projects sites for 
Monitoring and enhancing the safety culture of the plant and sites. JSW Energy safety management 
system is committed to prevent all injuries and work-related illnesses. The Group integrates health and 
safety as a core aspect of its operations, promoting a “Zero Harm” culture. Aspiring to exceed statutory 
health and safety requirements, the Group sets the highest standards and provides comprehensive 
training to employees, associates, contractors, and suppliers for safe working practices. The system 
facilitates risk assessment and implements controls for health and safety hazards in operations and 
activities. Regular audit and assurance programs are conducted, with timely actions taken to address 
identified issues. JSW Energy has implemented a safety software i.e. MySetu system to ensures prompt 
incident reporting, thorough root cause investigations, and the dissemination of lessons learned across 
all Group companies. Our safety management system has various tools to control and measure the 
safety performance of the sites i.e. Safety Procedures, legal monitoring, hazard identification procedure, 
change management and monitoring checklist etc.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
	
JSW Energy has a very well-defined Safety Systems to identify the work related hazards and risk at 
sites. We have implemented various systems i.e. Permit to Work System, Safety observation system, 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment procedures are in place. Some of them are enlisted below: 1) 
Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment. (HIRA) 2) Barrier Health Management (BHM) 3) Quantitative Risk 
Assessment (QRA) 4) Job Safety Analysis (JSA) 5) Hazard and Operability Study 6) Safety Inspections 7) 
Safety Audits – Internal & External 8) Safety Observation System 9) Work place monitoring 10) Various 
Safety Committee Safety is reviewed by the Board as an important part of the Operations review every 
quarter. The safety performance of all locations is reviewed on a monthly basis by the Corporate Safety 
team and Senior Management of the Company.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks.
	
	
Yes, JSW has a robust management procedure and system for reporting the workplace related hazards. 
The JSW Group has developed the safety cardinal rules to require all employees, business associates, and 
contractors to follow the “10 JSW CRITICAL SAFETY RULES” to reduce injuries and illnesses. These rules 
encourage safety discussions and improvements. The company employs a software system i.e. Mysetu 
for logging safety observations, where employees report unsafe acts, unsafe conditions, near-misses, 
21
BRSR
hazards, injuries, and accidents on monthly basis. These reports trigger alerts for mitigation, monitored 
weekly by the safety team and reviewed in monthly safety meetings. JSW expects all management 
levels and employees to proactively address hazards and halt unsafe work. The Safety Observation (SO) 
program engages the workforce, with leadership mandated to conduct shop floor walkthroughs. High-
risk operations are improved using Risk Rating methods, brainstorming with teams, new technologies, 
safety barriers with engineering controls and administrative controls. Each major plant has enhanced 
at least 20 high-risk operational processes through the Barrier Health Management system. Every plant 
has conducted the risk assessment for each and every activity by involving the shop floor workmen and 
employees frequently.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services?
	
	
Yes, Jindal Sanjivani hospital (JSH) and (Occupational Health Centre) is available at most of the locations 
along with adequate personnel and equipment where the worker has access to all available medical 
healthcare services. Locations where JSH is not there, the organization usually has tie-ups with local 
hospitals for healthcare. Every Site has an ambulance and emergency vehicles available along with 
suitable trained personnel to handle any emergency.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
The company prioritizes a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, workers, and third-party stakeholders. 
The leadership team of JSW Energy is very conscious about the safety and health of the employees and 
workmen. During the year, the Company conducted a ‘Safety Culture Survey’ by an external agency at various 
sites to understand the level of safety and areas of improvement. In FY 2025, major plants identified 25 high-
risk scenarios through the Barrier Health Management tool, mitigating these risks with new safety systems 
to reduce their risk rating to below 8. Across all plants, employees reported and corrected over 102483 
unsafe acts and conditions, preventing potential injuries and accidents. For wind turbine projects, Incident 
investigation, GWO and BBS training were completed for employees and workers. Additionally, we have also 
conducted the Subject Matter Expert (SME) training for more than 200 employees. Under the Contractor Safety 
management procedure, every contractor is assessed through the PQA (Pre-Qualification Assessment) and 
JSW CARES (Contractor Assessment & Rating for Excellence in Safety) program and continuous handholding 
is done by the Contractor Safety Management (CSM) team enabling the contractor to achieve a 5-star rating. 
Some of the other measures taken at the plants are as below: OHS Policy OHS Induction & OHS Trainings 
• Motivational Programs • Standard Operating Procedure • Occupational Health & Safety Committees • Mass 
Safety Tool Box Talks • Permit to Work • LOTO (Lock out Tag out) • Confined Space Entry • QRA (Quantitative 
Risk Assessment) • Manual Material Handling Assessment • Industrial Hygiene Survey • OHS Inspections 
• Barrier Health Management • Safety Kaizen • Hazardous Area Classification • Gas Monitoring • Near Miss

locations eg. Baramati, Chakan and Ingole in Maharashtra, Nellore in AP and Trichy in Tamil Nadu. Here, the 
JSW Energy team does regular Safety Pep Talks, Tool Box Talks (TBT) with vendor teams.  All contractors and

practice enables the value-chain partner to enhance their safety systems, practices and training parameters.

working within the plant premises helps to identify gaps in their safety systems and guides them to improve 
safety. This further improves their Star ranking amongst all the contractors, highest being 5 STAR. The 5 STAR 
rated contractor becomes a preferred contractor across the JSW Group.

generation process at JSW Energy does not involve any toxic chemicals, reflecting the company’s commitment 
to minimizing environmental impact.
	
Furthermore, JSW Energy emphasizes continuous improvement in its waste management practices. The 
company engages in regular audits and monitoring to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and 
strives to adopt best practices in waste reduction and recycling. By prioritizing eco-friendly operations, JSW 
Energy not only reduces its environmental footprint but also sets a benchmark for sustainable practices in the 
energy sector
