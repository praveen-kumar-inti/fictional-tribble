6.    Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

The Company has a “Grievance Redressal Policy” applicable to all permanent employees. It seeks to 
promote pracƟces and procedures that ensure creaƟon and sustenance of healthy relaƟonships and 
expediƟous seƩlement of employee grievance, thereby improving producƟvity and overall eﬃciency of 
the organisaƟon.
As per the policy there are three stages to addressing an employee grievance:
Stage I: The grievance must be submiƩed with requisite documents to the aggrieved employee's immediate 
supervisor (“relevant authority” at this stage). On receipt, the supervisor will discuss the maƩer with the aggrieved 
employee and redress the grievance if it is within their power to do so. A formal response has to be communicated to 
the employee within ten days of receipt of the grievance with a copy to the HR department.
Stage II: If at Stage I the aggrieved employee is not saƟsﬁed with the outcome, they can approach the Department/ 
FuncƟonal/Business Unit Head (“relevant authority” at this stag ing the grievance to the next stage have to be 
indicated clearly in the prescribed form. The relevant authority will also meet the aggrieved employee to discuss the 
grievance in detail. Within ten days of receipt of the grievance the relevant authority has to communicate their 
response to the employee with a copy to the HR department.
Stage III: If dissaƟsﬁed with the outcome at Stage II, the employee can approach the Grievance Redressal CommiƩee 
within seven working days of receipt of formal communicaƟon of the outcome, clearly staƟng the reasons. This 
CommiƩee will further discuss the maƩer in detail with the employee. The CommiƩee has to respond within thirty 
working days of receipt of the grievance with a copy to the HR department.
The decision of the CommiƩee in Stage III is ﬁnal, and no further appeal can be entertained against their decision. 
However, unresolved grievances recorded in the monthly reports have to be referred to the CEO for a ﬁnal decision.
 
Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
