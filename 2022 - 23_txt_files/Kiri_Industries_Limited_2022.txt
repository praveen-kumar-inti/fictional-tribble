Water
Management
Risk
Increased water 
consumption and 
constrained water supply 
are among the most critical 
global risks. Considering 
our dependency on 
water for the viability of 
our operations, we have 
identified it as a material risk 
for us.
The Company’s Intermediates 
facility has Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) facilities and in future the 
Company is planning to make all 
its manufacturing facilities to run 
through ZLD.
Following the treatment process, 
we endeavour to maximize the 
utilization of the treated water 
for internal purposes whenever 
feasible, promoting sustainable 
water management practices.  
Further, the Company was 
awarded as Best Effort for Water 
Conservation in Year 2023.
