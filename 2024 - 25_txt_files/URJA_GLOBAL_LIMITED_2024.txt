COMPLIANCE OFFICER
Dear Stakeholders,
We present the Annual Report for the year 2024–25 with 
great pride and gratitude.
The global energy landscape is undergoing a rapid 
transition, with clean technologies such as solar, hydrogen, 
storage, and electric mobility becoming the cornerstone of 
future energy systems. In 2024, solar energy installations 
globally reached unprecedented levels and energy storage 
solutions emerged as key enablers for grid stability and 
round-the-clock renewable power. Similarly, the electric 
vehicles (EV) sector witnessed exponential growth, 
supported by increased investment in charging 
infrastructure and supportive policy frameworks.
India, too, stood at the forefront of this transition, with 
ambitious national targets and rising public-private 
collaboration in renewable and electric mobility sectors. 
This momentum creates a fertile ground for innovation, 
investment, and impact—one that we have embraced with 
vision and commitment.
In line with the national momentum 2025, URJA has 
obtained Solar PAN-India registration, enabling us to serve 
customers and partners across the country. We have also 
expanded our EV manufacturing footprint beyond our 
existing facilities in the North and West. This strategic 
expansion not only enhances our production capabilities 
but also ensures faster delivery, saving in cost, localized 
support, and better alignment with regional energy needs.
Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities in 
the Projects under implementation i.e. “URJA Kendra’s” 
“Didi Ki Mahima”, “Yuva Jyoti”. 
As the demand for clean energy continues to grow, we are well-positioned to capitalize 
on emerging trends and technological advancements. Our strategic initiatives will drive 
our future growth and create sustainable value for public at large focusing on scaling its 
Green energy, Storage system, Electric Vehicles and Charging Stations. 
In support of the “Vocal for Local” movement, we are proud to offer the opportunities to 
establish Urja Kendra’s at Gram Panchayats across the country. By engaging local 
communities and employing rural youth, we aim to empower villages and boost local 
economies. We appeal to support and use our products, which are not only of better 
quality but also available at affordable prices. With the launch of our nationwide 
distributorship channel, we are making our products more accessible than ever for 
building a self-reliant India.
We extend our heartfelt appreciation to employees, Business partners, Board members 
and Government authorities and most importantly stakeholders. Your trust, resilience, 
and shared vision continue to fuel our journey to reform, perform and transform with the 
commitment of sustainability, innovation with customer centric approach. 
We thank you for continued support and trust with the invitation to join the mission 
“URJA”.

For & on Behalf of Board

company has initiated the opening of Urja Kendras in various districts across India. These centers aim to raise awareness about the 
benefits and usage of solar and LED products, aligning with the national mission of energy conservation.
The innovative products developed by Urja Global, under the concept of “Urja Banao Urja Bachao Paise Kamao" (Generate Energy, Save 
Energy, Earn Money), are designed to enlighten every home in rural India. These efforts are a testament to Urja Global’s dedication to

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW 
India continued to demonstrate resilience in FY 2024–25, registering an estimated real GDP growth of approximately 6.5%. Although 
this marks moderation from the 9.2% growth witnessed in the previous fiscal year, it affirms the country’s position as one of the fastest-
growing major economies globally. Inflation remained well within the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target band of 4% ± 2%. Retail 
inflation eased to around 3.2–3.4% by the end of FY 2024–25, aided by stable food prices and effective monetary policy. Encouraged by 
this moderation, the RBI reduced the benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points in June 2025 to 5.50%, signaling a shift towards a more 
accommodative stance.
India accomplished a significant milestone, with the sale of one lakh electric vehicles (EVs) in FY25. According to NITI Aayog and the 
Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), India’s EV finance industry is likely to reach ₹ 3.7 lakh crore by 2030. The Indian automotive market is 
expanding, driven by rising income levels, urbanization and increasing consumer purchasing power. Initiatives like Production linked 
incentive scheme are aiding several auto makers to invest in EV segment. The industry is focusing on reducing emissions and integration 
of advanced technologies like connectivity and smart mobility solutions.
FY 2024–25 was a year of consolidation and cautious optimism for the Indian economy. With inflation under control, interest rates 
beginning to ease, and public capital expenditure remaining strong, the macroeconomic environment provided a supportive backdrop 
for business recovery and long-term investment.
CONSUMER GOODS INDUSTRY IN INDIA
The Indian consumer goods sector demonstrated resilience and gradual growth despite macro-economic headwinds. The industry 
recorded an 11% year-on-year increase in value sales in Q4 (January–March 2025), comprising 5.6% price inflation and 5.1% volume 
growth. Notably, rural markets, which contribute over one-third of overall sales, led the recovery—posting 8.4% volume growth, nearly 
four times faster than urban areas at 2.6%.
ITC reported that consumer spending on its FMCG products reached over ₹ 34,000 crore in FY25, up about 4.6% from ₹ 32,500 crore 
in FY24. Despite challenges in urban consumption and competitive pressures, small and regional players posted strong performance, 
growing nearly 17.8% in value during Q4 2025, significantly faster than established players.
The consumer goods industry in India is expected to sustain its growth trajectory, backed by demographic dividends, rising incomes, 
urbanisation, and digital penetration. Continued focus on rural market development, innovation in value-driven offerings, and investment 
in digital infrastructure will be critical to capturing incremental demand.
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO BOOST DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING
The Government of India continued its strong push toward self-reliance and industrial development during FY 2024–25 through targeted

expanded. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, covering over 14 strategic sectors including electronics, EVs, solar modules, 
textiles, and specialty steel, gained further traction. As of March 2025, the government had approved investments exceeding ₹3.2 lakh 
crore under various PLI schemes, with disbursements and production commitments accelerating year-on-year. Initiatives such as the 
Make in India 2.0, National Manufacturing Policy, and PM Gati Shakti focused on improving logistics efficiency, reducing compliance 
burdens, and streamlining infrastructure development. Collectively, these initiatives are expected to drive long-term investment, create 
employment, and position India as a resilient and globally competitive manufacturing hub.

RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES MARKET OUTLOOK
The global rechargeable battery market witnessed significant momentum in FY 2024–25, driven by the accelerating global shift toward 
clean energy, electric mobility, digitalization, and decarbonization. The market size was valued at approximately USD 128–135 billion in 
2024 and is projected to exceed USD 225 billion by 2030. Electric vehicles (EVs) remain the largest end-user segment, accounting for over 
60% of global lithium-ion battery demand.
Electric vehicles (EVs) remain the largest end-user segment, accounting for over 60% of global lithium-ion battery demand. The demand 
for energy storage systems (ESS) is rising globally, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, as utilities and industries 
transition to intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.
Rechargeable batteries have emerged as one of the most critical enablers of the global transition towards a cleaner, more sustainable 
energy future. Rechargeable batteries—particularly lithium-ion variants—have become central to this transformation, powering a wide 
range of applications from electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems to portable electronics and industrial automation.
The global market for rechargeable batteries is experiencing a strong and sustained growth trajectory, underpinned by a surge in electric 
vehicle adoption, expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, and the proliferation of smart devices. Governments across the world are 
promoting clean technologies through supportive policies, tax incentives, and regulatory mandates, creating a favorable environment for 
battery innovation and investment. Rechargeable batteries are expected to play an increasingly strategic role in global energy systems.
SOLAR- RENEWABLE ENERGY TARGET
In 2023, global renewable energy capacity additions surged by nearly 10%, reaching approximately 350 GW—a new record driven 
primarily by continued growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Solar energy continues to be the standout performer, accounting 
for more than two-thirds of total capacity additions due to declining technology costs, simplified permitting processes, and strong policy 
support. 
Global solar energy targets are becoming increasingly ambitious as nations race to meet climate goals and ensure long-term energy 
security. Countries like China are leading the way—aiming for 1,200 GW of combined solar and wind capacity by 2030. India has 
set a target of 500 GW of total renewable energy capacity by 2030, of which nearly 300 GW is expected to come from solar alone. As 
governments enhance policy support and invest in technologies such as battery storage and grid modernization, solar energy is expected 
to remain the leading force in renewable capacity expansion well into the 2030s.
ELECTRIC VEHICLES NEED
In fiscal year 2024–25, India crossed the significant milestone of selling over one million electric vehicles, with total EV registrations 
for the year climbing to approximately 1.97 million units—a robust 16.9% year‑on‑year increase over FY 2023–24, when 1.68 million 
electric vehicles were registered. Electric two‐wheelers led the growth, with sales of around 1.15 million units, up 21.2%, representing 
more than half of total EVs. Passenger electric three-wheelers (E3W) saw sales of around 700,000 units, rising about 10–11%, while 
electric passenger cars reached roughly 100,000 registrations, up 18.2%.
India’s cumulative EV registrations by the end of FY 25 stood at approximately 6.166 million units, underlining the accelerating transition 
to electric mobility in response to policy incentives like PM E‑DRIVE, growing consumer awareness, and expanding infrastructure support.
The need for electric vehicles (EVs) has become increasingly urgent in the face of rising environmental concerns, urban air pollution, 
and the global push toward decarbonization. The transport sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and 
transitioning to electric mobility is crucial for countries like India to meet their climate commitments and improve public health.
The Indian government has taken proactive steps to accelerate EV adoption through a series of supportive policies and incentives. Key 
among them is the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, which has reduced the upfront 
cost of EVs through direct subsidies. Additionally, initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Advanced Chemistry 
Cell (ACC) battery manufacturing and the expansion of EV charging infrastructure under the PM e-Bus Sewa and PM e-Drive programs 
are paving the way for a robust ecosystem.
DIGITIZATION OF HEALTHCARE
The COVID-19 pandemic served as a powerful catalyst for the digitization of healthcare, accelerating the adoption of digital tools across 
the care continuum. In early 2020, as lockdowns and safety concerns limited in-person visits, hospitals and clinics rapidly shifted toward 
digital platforms, embracing teleconsultations, e-pharmacies, electronic health records (EHRs), and remote patient monitoring. This 
transformation was driven by three key enablers:
1.	
A dramatic rise in patient openness to digital health services,
2.	
Healthcare providers’ urgent need to digitize workflows for continuity of care, and
3.	
Regulatory flexibility that allowed faster integration of digital health into mainstream systems.
Digital health evolved from a supplemental service to a core component of care delivery. Digital health has transitioned from being 
a supplementary channel to becoming an integral pillar of healthcare delivery. This shift has not only improved accessibility and 
convenience for patients but has also enhanced clinical efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and long-term cost optimization. The 
Company continues to invest in digital infrastructure, partnerships, and innovation to remain at the forefront of this evolving landscape.

COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE REVIEWS
During year 2024-25, Urja demonstrated resilient performance amid a dynamic business environment marked by evolving market 
demands and technological advancements.  
In FY 2024–25, Urja Global Limited reported a strong increase in revenue on consolidated basis, growing by approximately 51% 
year-on-year. The company’s total consolidated revenue rose from ₹44.47 crore in FY 2023–24 to ₹67.25 crore in FY 2024–25. This 
substantial growth suggests improved sales performance and possibly increased demand for its renewable energy products and services.
Solar power in India has now become more cost-effective than electricity produced from diesel generators. Furthermore, the support 
and incentives provided by both the Central and State governments for the solar energy sector are steadily strengthening, fostering 
accelerated growth and adoption across the country.
Urja Global had a strong year in terms of revenue growth, reflecting good market performance or increased product demand. The 
improvement in operating profits and margins, especially in the March quarter, shows that the company made efforts to improve efficiency. 
However, the sharp decline in net profit and Q4 PAT highlights ongoing challenges in converting revenue into sustained earnings, possibly 
due to higher input costs, depreciation, interest expenses, or tax outflows.
In short, FY 2024–25 was a year of expansion in revenue but pressure on profits, showing that while growth opportunities exist, cost 
management and profitability remain key areas for improvement.

10.	 Health and safety management system: 
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system? 
	
Yes, an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System has been implemented in our entity in alignment with the 
nature of our operations, which include the assembly of electric two-wheeler scooters and the installation of solar panels.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
Our entity follows a systematic approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-routine 
bases, particularly focused on our key operations — the assembly of electric two-wheeler scooters and the installation of solar 
panels.
1. 		
Routine Risk Assessment Processes:
•	
Daily Safety Inspections: Supervisors conduct daily checks on the shop floor and installation sites to identify 
common hazards like loose tools, electrical faults, or improper use of equipment.
•	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA): Before any job starts, especially in assembly or field installation, a JSA is performed to 
assess potential hazards and ensure mitigation controls are in place.
•	
Checklists and SOPs: Standard operating procedures and checklists are in place for assembly line activities, wiring, 
battery handling, and rooftop installation work.
2. 		
Non-Routine Risk Assessment Processes:
•	
Pre-task Risk Review: For non-routine or first-time tasks (e.g., installation on high-rise buildings or working with a 
new battery model), a risk review is conducted before commencement.
•	
Permit to Work System: High-risk activities such as electrical panel integration, rooftop work, or welding are carried 
out only under a permit-to-work system with specific safety measures outlined.
•	
Emergency Drill & Scenario Testing: Regular fire, electrical hazard, and fall-from-height drills are conducted to 
prepare for non-routine emergency events.
3. 		
Hazard Reporting and Review:
•	
Employee Feedback Mechanism: A structured channel is available for workers to report observed hazards or unsafe 
practices.
	
Incident Investigation: Any accident or near miss is investigated thoroughly, and the findings are used to update risk 
assessments and preventive measures
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Yes/No)
		
Our entity has established clear processes that allow workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
potentially dangerous situations without fear of retaliation.
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25

Key Measures in Place:
•	 	
Hazard Reporting Mechanism: Employees can report unsafe conditions verbally to supervisors or in writing through 
safety logs or designated forms.
•	 	
Open-door Policy: Supervisors and safety officers are accessible and responsive to concerns raised by workers.
•	 	
Right to Refuse Unsafe Work: Workers are encouraged and empowered to stop or avoid tasks they believe pose an 
immediate risk to their health or safety, in line with our safety-first policy.
•	 	
Follow-up Action: Reported hazards are investigated promptly, and corrective measures are taken to mitigate the risk 
before work resumes.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the Members of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Report on audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
1.	
Qualified Opinion
	
We have audited the accompanying Standalone financial statements of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Standalone Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), 
the Statement of Changes in Equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as ‘the standalone 
financial statements’).
	
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, except for the possible effects of 
the matters described in the ‘Basis of Qualified Opinion’ paragraph below, the aforesaid Standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its profit 
(including other comprehensive income), the changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
2.	
Basis of Qualified Opinion
	
We draw your attention to the following matters:
A.	
The Company has not done GST Input Tax Credit Reversals against dues of Rs.36,77,65,614/- as on 31.03.2025, due to non-
payment to sundry creditors within the stipulated time as prescribed in terms of 2nd proviso to section 16(2) of CGST Act, 
2017. Non-reversal of GST credits will result in availment of wrong amount of GST Input credits against GST liability.
B.	
There is no documentary evidence made available for Investment in Mines Projects and also, the project progress has been 
classified under ‘Property Plant and Equipment’ as capital work in progress, amounting to 46,35,28,484/ as on 31.03.2025 and 
also Further, no documentary evidence available with respect to Loans and Advances granted by the Company as on date.
	
According to the information and explanations given to us, the GST department raided the Company’s premises on 20-07-2021 and 
took all records. Accordingly, documents relating to
	
projects, terms of agreement and signed balance confirmation with respect to loans and advances are not available and shall be 
sought from parties.
	
However, In the absence of necessary documents, recoverability of loans and advances, impact on the carrying value of investments 
and consequential impact on profit is not determinable. We are also unable to comment upon the compliance of the applicable 
provisions of the Companies act 2013.
	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion on the financial statements.
3.	
Key Audit Matters
	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
	
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report for the year ended 31 March 2025.
4.	
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon
	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Board’s Report including Annexure(s) to Board’s Report, but does not include the Financial Statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon.
	
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
5.	
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements
	
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance (including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
	
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
	
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
6.	
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
	
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
a.	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
b.	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on 
whether the company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
c.	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
d.	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
e.	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
	
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.
	
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planne
	
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
	
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
Corporate overview

regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
	
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

“Annexure B” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in Paragraph 7 of our report of even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED on the accounts for the 
year ended March 31, 2025
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED (“the Company”) for the year ended on March 31, 2025 
in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and specified under sub-section 10 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s 
internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, maintained adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting as of March 31, 
2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India except for the effects/possible effects of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the 
Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as of March 31, 2025.
We have considered the material weakness identified and reported above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit 
of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025, and the material weakness doesn’t affect our opinion on the standalone 
financial statements of the Company.

Notes to financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
(All amounts in Rs. lakhs, unless otherwise stated)
1.1
Corporate information
Urja Global Limited was incorporated in India on May 29, 1992 and is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956. 
The registered office of the Company is located at 487/63, 1st Floor, National Market, Peeragarhi, New Delhi-110087 India. 
The principal place of business of the Company is in India.
The Company is primarily engaged in the business of “Design, Consultancy, integration, supply, installation, commissioning 
& maintenance of off-grid and grid connected Solar Power Plants and decentralized Solar Application and trading & 
Manufacturing of solar products, Batteries, Electric vehicles.
1.2
Statement of Compliance 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Ind AS as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) as amended from time to time.
1.3
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on an accrual basis and under the historical cost convention 
except for certain financial instruments (including derivative instruments) and defined benefit plans which have been 
measured at fair value.The accounting policies are consistently applied by the Company to all the period mentioned in the 
financial statements.

Summary of material accounting policies
2.1
Current versus non-current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is 
treated as current when it is:
►   Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
►   Held primarily for the purpose of trading
►   Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
►   Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
► It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
► It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
► It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
► There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
2.2
Fixed Assets
Tangible Assets
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment 
recognised as at 1 April 2016 measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the 
property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of 
property, plant and equipment includes interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of qualifying assets up to the date 
the asset is ready for its intended use and other incidental expenses incurred up to that date. Subsequent expenditure relating 
to property, plant and equipment is capitalised only if such expenditure results in an increase in the future benefits from such 
asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. All repair and maintenance are charged to statement of profit 
and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipments have been provided on the basis of straight line method over the useful lives 
of assets as per useful life prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013.  
When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Corporate overview
Statutory reports
Financial section
104
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an tangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognized.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is recognized as an 
intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate all the following:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
• Its intention to complete the asset
• Its ability to use or sell the asset
• How the asset will generate future economic benefits
• The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to 
be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset begins 
when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortized on a straight line basis over the period of 
expected future benefit from the related project, i.e., the estimated useful life of one to five years. Amortization is recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
2.3
Impairment of non-financial assets
For all non-financial assets, the Company assesses whether there are indicators of impairment. If such an indicator exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount for an asset or CGU is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the asset is considered impaired and 
the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the statement of profit and loss. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the asset or CGU are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be 
identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share 
prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to 
project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent 
budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate 
for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions 
used to determine the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is 
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
2.4
Foreign Currency  
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates i.e. the “functional currency”. The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in INR, 
which is also the Company’s functional currency as well as its presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company’s functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at 
the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25
105
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
2.5
Inventories
Raw materials, components, stores and spares are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. However, materials and 
other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which 
they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost
Stock in trade in the books is considered in the accounts where the variance between book stock and measured stock is upto 
+/- 5%, and in case where the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured stock is considered. Such stocks are valued at lower 
of cost and net realizable value. 
2.6
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account 
contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized.
(i)
Sale of Goods:
Revenue from Sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivereed and titles have passed, at which time all the conditions 
are satisfied : 
 -    the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which in general 
coincides with the invoicing of goods.
 -   the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold.
 - the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
 - it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company.
 - the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
(ii)
Income from services:
Service revenue is recognised on completion of provision of services which in general coincides with invoicing to customers. 
Revenue, net of discount, is recognised on transfer of all significant risks and rewards to the customer and when no significant 
uncertainty exists regarding realisation of consideration.
Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs are 
incurred. Revenues from time bound fixed price contracts, are recognised over the life of the contract using the percentage 
of completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion. Foreseeable losses on such contracts are 
recognised when probable.
(iii)
Interest Income: 
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using effective interest rate (EIR) method.  EIR is the rate that exactly 
discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter 
period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. 
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual 
terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income 
in the statement of profit and loss.
2.7
Taxes on income
Current tax
Provision for current tax is made as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. The Company has opted New Tax 
regime under section 115BAA.Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is not applicable on Companies opting Section 115BAA. .

Financial section
106
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any 
unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is 
realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in 
equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
2.8
Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
►   Debt instruments at amortised cost - The Company has Investments , loans, Other Financial Assets, Inventories, cash 
& cash equivalents, security deposits, other bank balances, trade receivables, bank deposits for more than 12 months 
classified within this category.
►   Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - The Company does not have any financial 
asset classified in this category.
►   Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - The Company does not 
have any investment classified within this category. 
►   Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - The Company does not have 
any financial asset classified in this category.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
a)   The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows,
b)   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25
107
Debt instrument at FVTPL
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In addition, the company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI 
criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). The company has designated Investments as at 
FVTPL.
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) when:
1.   The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
2.  The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
(a)  the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, 
the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis 
that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., deposits, trade receivables, unbilled 
revenue and bank balance.
The company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on Trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component.
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Financial liabilities
The 
Company’s 
financial 
liabilities 
include 
trade 
and 
other 
payables 
and 
employee 
related 
liabilities. 
At the time of initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings or trade and other payables (payables).
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.9
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities And Contingent Assets
Provisions:
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
Corporate overview
Statutory reports
Financial section
108
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
2.10 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for the purpose of cash flow statement comprise cash at banks.
2.11
Leases
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is,or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To 
assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
*     The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically 
distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive 
substation right, then the asset is not identified;
*     The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period 
of use; and
*     The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision making rights 
that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used.
*     In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the 
right to direct the use of the asset if either:
− The Company has the right to operate the asset; or
− The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used.
As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any 
lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical expedient. At 
inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the consideration in the 
contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-
ofuse asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any 
lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated 
dilapidation costs, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the 
straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the period of lease. If ownership of 
the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is 
reflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful 
life of the leased asset.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date, 
discounted using, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. It is re measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The Company has elected not to 
recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases 
of low value assets  . The Company associates the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
Lease payments include fixed payments, i.e. amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value 
guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option 
and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that the Company shall 
exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises of amount of initial 
measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated dilapidation costs.

Earnings per Share
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number 
of Equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential Equity shares into Equity shares.

Note: Deferred tax asset has been recognised only to the extent of the deferred tax liabilities as this amount is considered to be 
virtually certain of realisation.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss.Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms 
of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
**Service revenue is recognised on completion of provision of services which in general coincides with invoicing to customers. Revenue, net 
of discount, is recognised on transfer of all significant risks and rewards to the customer and when no significant uncertainty exists regarding

**Note: Rent expenses are under short-term leases as well as lease amounts less than those defined in IND AS 116., so, a lessee 
elects not to apply the requirements in paragraphs 22–49 to either short-term leases or leases for which the underlying asset 
is of low value, the lessee shall recognise the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on either a straight-
line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis. The lessee shall apply another systematic basis if that basis is more 
representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit.

B    Fair value hierarchy
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other financial assets and liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Also, since security deposits and 
borrowings are measured at fair value only on initial recognition, disclosure requirements for the valuation techniques, inputs used 
to develop those measurements and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorised 
in their entirety are not applicable.
Level 1 -  Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 -  Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part 
using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions 
in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. 
The following table presents fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of 31 March 2025:

Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the company’s  financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require 
a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Judgements
In the process of applying the company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, 
are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market 
changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 
when they occur.
Taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred 
tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax 
planning strategies.

Management’s Views: 1. The qualification regarding the reversal of input tax credit first came to our attention 
during the statutory audit for the fiscal year 2021-22. Now, the Statutory Auditor has quantified the amount of input 
tax credit reversal in their report Less than Rs 697.00 Lakh for the quarter Dec 31, 2024. The company is in the 
process of paying creditors outstanding for more than 180 days & after paying the creditor input tax credit can be 
availed and utilized again.
e.	
For Audit Qualification(s) where the impact is not quantified by the auditor:
(i)      Management’s estimation on the impact of audit qualification.
(ii)  If management is unable to estimate the impact, reasons for the same: The qualification pertains to the 
absence of documentary evidence available for investment in projects. These projects are, predating FY 21-22. 
As the management diligently gathers the necessary documents, so it is crucial to recognize that the potential 
implications and their subsequent impact on the unaudited financial results, are currently uncertain.

We draw your attention to the following matters:
A.	
The Company has not done GST Input Tax Credit Reversals against dues of Rs.36,77,65,614/- as on 31.03.2025, due to non-
payment to sundry creditors within the stipulated time as prescribed in terms of 2nd proviso to section 16(2) of CGST Act, 
2017. Non-reversal of GST credits will result in availment of wrong amount of GST Input credits against GST liability.
B.	
There is no documentary evidence made available for Investment in Mines Projects and also, the project progress has been 
classified under ‘Property Plant and Equipment’ as capital work in progress, amounting to 46,35,28,484/ as on 31.03.2025 and 
also Further, no documentary evidence available with respect to Loans and Advances granted by the Company as on date.
	
According to the information and explanations given to us, the GST department raided the Company’s premises on 20-07-2021 and 
took all records. Accordingly, documents relating to projects, terms of agreement and signed balance confirmation with respect to 
loans and advances are not available and shall be sought from parties.
	
However, In the absence of necessary documents, recoverability of loans and advances, impact on the carrying value of investments 
and consequential impact on profit is not determinable. We are also unable to comment upon the compliance of the applicable 
provisions of the Companies act 2013.
	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.
3.	
Key Audit Matters
	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
	
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report for the year ended 31 March 2025.
4.	
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon	
	
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Board’s Report including Annexure(s) to Board’s Report, but does not include the Financial Statements

Corporate overview
Statutory reports
Financial section
124
	
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
	
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
5.	
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements
	
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance (including 
other comprehensive income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
	
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
	
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
6.	
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
	
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
a.	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
b.	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on 
whether the company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
c.	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
d.	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
e.	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
f.	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, 
and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the Consolidated financial statements of 
which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors or are Management certified, such other auditors/ management remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision, and performance of the audits/ certifications carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
	
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that 
the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative 
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25
125
materiality and qualitative factors in
(i) 	 planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the financial statements.
	
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
	
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
	
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
7.	
Other Matters
	
The consolidated financial results include the financial results of three subsidiaries (namely Urja Batteries Limited, Urja Digital 
World Limited and Sahu Minerals & Properties Limited) which have been certified by their management and whose financial results 
reflect total revenue of Rs. 7,862.41 Lakhs and total net profit from operations before tax of Rs. 174.04 Lakhs for the year ended 
March 31, 2025. We did not Audit the financial Statements of these subsidiaries and the same have been

“Annexure A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in Paragraph 8 of Our Report of Even Date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of URJA GLOBAL LIMITED (“the Company”) for the year ended on March 31, 2025 
in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of 
its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and specified under sub-section 10 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s 
internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, maintained adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting as of March 
31, 2025, based on the internal control over
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India except for the effects/possible effects of the 
material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company’s internal financial controls over financial 
reporting were operating effectively as of March 31, 2025.
We have considered the material weakness identified and reported above in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit 
of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025, and the material weakness doesn’t affect our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company.

1.2
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments 
which are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period as explained in the accounting policies below.
The consolidated financial statements include Urja Global Limited and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by 
the Company. Control exists when the Company (a) has power over the investee, (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and (c) has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct 
relevant activities of the investee. Relevant activities are those activities that significantly affect an entity’s returns. The 
Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements listed above. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable and other 
contractual arrangements that may influence control are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition and up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Inter-company transactions and balances including unrealised profits are eliminated in full on consolidation 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the 
Company’s equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement 
basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the noncontrolling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income 
is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are 
adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of 
the Company.
When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the 
aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying 
amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit 
or loss) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of.
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value 
on initial recognition for subsequent accounting or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an 
associate or jointly controlled entity.

Summary of material accounting policies
2.1
Current versus non-current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An asset is 
treated as current when it is:
►   Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
►   Held primarily for the purpose of trading
►   Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
►   Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after 
the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
►   It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
►   It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
►   It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
►   There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
2.2
Fixed Assets
Tangible Assets
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment 
recognised as at 1 April 2016 measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of the 
property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of 
property, plant and equipment includes interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of qualifying assets up to the date 
the asset is ready for its intended use and other incidental expenses incurred up to that date. Subsequent expenditure relating 
to property, plant and equipment is capitalised only if such expenditure results in an increase in the future benefits from such 
asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. All repair and maintenance are charged to statement of profit 
and loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipments have been provided on the basis of straight line method over the useful lives 
of assets as per useful life prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013.  
When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them 
separately based on their specific useful lives.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial 
year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an tangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognized.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is recognized as an 
intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate all the following:
•    The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
•    Its intention to complete the asset
•    Its ability to use or sell the asset
•    How the asset will generate future economic benefits
•    The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset
•     The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
       Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset 
to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization of the asset 
begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortized on a straight line basis over the 
period of expected future benefit from the related project, i.e., the estimated useful life of one to five years. Amortization 
is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment 
annually.

2.3
Impairment of non-financial assets
For all non-financial assets, the Company assesses whether there are indicators of impairment. If such an indicator exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount for an asset or CGU is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the asset is considered impaired and 
the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the statement of profit and loss. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the asset or CGU are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be 
identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share 
prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to 
project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent 
budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate 
for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in 
which the asset is used.
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions 
used to determine the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is 
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
2.4
Foreign Currency  
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates i.e. the “functional currency”. The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in INR, 
which is also the Company’s functional currency as well as its presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company’s functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at 
the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised 
in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
2.5
Inventories
Raw materials, components, stores and spares are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. However, materials and 
other items held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which 
they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost
Stock in trade in the books is considered in the accounts where the variance between book stock and measured stock is upto 
+/- 5%, and in case where the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured stock is considered. Such stocks are valued at lower 
of cost and net realizable value. 
2.6
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account 
contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognized.
(i)
Sale of Goods:
Revenue from Sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivereed and titles have passed, at which time all the conditions 
are satisfied : 
URJA GLOBAL LIMITED
Annual report 2024-25
135
 -   the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which in general 
coincides with the invoicing of goods.
 -   the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold.
 -     the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
 -     it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company.
 -     the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
(ii)
Income from services:
Service revenue is recognised on completion of provision of services which in general coincides with invoicing to customers. 
Revenue, net of discount, is recognised on transfer of all significant risks and rewards to the customer and when no significant 
uncertainty exists regarding realisation of consideration.
Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs are 
incurred. Revenues from time bound fixed price contracts, are recognised over the life of the contract using the percentage 
of completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion. Foreseeable losses on such contracts are 
recognised when probable.
(iii)
Interest Income: 
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using effective interest rate (EIR) method.  EIR is the rate that exactly 
discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, 
where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When 
calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms 
of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in 
the statement of profit and loss.
2.7
Taxes on income
Current tax
Provision for current tax is made as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity. Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. The Company has opted New Tax 
regime under section 115BAA.Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is not applicable on Companies opting Section 115BAA. .
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any 
unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or in 
equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
►   Debt instruments at amortised cost - The Company has Investments , loans, Other Financial Assets, Inventories, cash 
& cash equivalents, security deposits, other bank balances, trade receivables, bank deposits for more than 12 months 
classified within this category.
►   Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - The Company does not have any financial 
asset classified in this category.
►   Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) - The Company does not 
have any investment classified within this category. 
►   Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) - The Company does not have 
any financial asset classified in this category.
Debt instruments at amortised cost
A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
a)   The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and
b)   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.
Debt instrument at FVTPL
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization 
as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In addition, the company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI 
criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition 
inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). The company has designated Investments as at FVTPL.
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) when:
1.    The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
2.  The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
(a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the 
Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of 
impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., deposits, trade receivables, unbilled 
revenue and bank balance.
The company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on Trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component.
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
Financial liabilities
The 
Company’s 
financial 
liabilities 
include 
trade 
and 
other 
payables 
and 
employee 
related 
liabilities. 
At the time of initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings or trade and other payables (payables).
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.9
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities And Contingent Assets
Provisions:
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
2.10 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for the purpose of cash flow statement comprise cash at banks.
2.11
Leases
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is,or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
* The contract involves the use of an identified asset – this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically 
distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substation 
right, then the asset is not identified;
* The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
* The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision making rights 
that are most relevant to changing how and for what purposes the asset is used.
* In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the 
right to direct the use of the asset if either:
Corporate overview
Statutory reports
Financial section
138
− The Company has the right to operate the asset; or
− The Company designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purposes it will be used. 
 As a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any 
lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Company has not used this practical expedient. At 
inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the consideration in the 
contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-ofuse asset is initially 
measured at cost, which comprises of the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and estimated dilapidation costs, less any lease incentives received. The 
right-of-use asset is subsequently amortised using the straight-line method over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset 
or the period of lease. If ownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a 
purchase option is reflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is amortised on a straightline basis over the expected useful 
life of the leased asset.
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date, 
discounted using, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. It is re measured when there is a change in future lease payments. The Company has elected not to 
recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases 
of low value assets  .
The Company associates the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease 
term.
Lease payments include fixed payments, i.e. amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value 
guarantee, the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option 
and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term considered reflects that the Company shall 
exercise termination option. The Company also recognises a right of use asset which comprises of amount of initial 
measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct cost incurred by the Company and estimated dilapidation costs.
2.12
Earnings per Share
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average 
number of Equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number 
of Equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Equity shares that would be issued on 
conversion of all the dilutive potential Equity shares into Equity shares.

The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future 
cash flows, after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and 
anticipated future economic conditions. The management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions 
would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit.The recoverable value 
was also determined using the Fair value less cost of Disposal, using Comparable Company Market Multiple method which is 
significantly higher than the carrying amount.

Note: Deferred tax asset has been recognised only to the extent of the deferred tax liabilities as this amount is considered to 
be virtually certain of realisation.
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss.Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

*Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking 
into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. 
**Service revenue is recognised on completion of provision of services which in general coincides with 
invoicing to customers. Revenue, net of discount, is recognised on transfer of all significant risks and 
rewards to the customer and when no significant uncertainty exists regarding realisation of consideration. 
Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs are 
incurred. Revenues from time bound fixed price contracts, are recognised over the life of the contract using the percentage 
of completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion. Foreseeable losses on such contracts are 
recognised when probable.

**Note: Rent expenses are under short-term leases as well as lease amounts less than those defined in IND AS 116., so, a lessee 
elects not to apply the requirements in paragraphs 22–49 to either short-term leases or leases for which the underlying asset 
is of low value, the lessee shall recognise the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on either a straight-
line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis. The lessee shall apply another systematic basis if that basis is more 
representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit.

B    Fair value hierarchy
The management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other financial assets and liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Also, since security deposits and 
borrowings are measured at fair value only on initial recognition, disclosure requirements for the valuation techniques, inputs used 
to develop those measurements and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorised 
in their entirety are not applicable.
Level 1 -  Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 -  Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part 
using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions 
in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The preparation of the company’s  financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the 
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require 
a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:

when they occur.

d.  For Audit Qualification(s)where the impact is quantified by the auditor-
          Management’s Views: .1. The qualification regarding the reversal of input tax credit first came to our attention during 
the statutory audit for the fiscal year 2021-22. Now, the Statutory Auditor has quantified the amount of input tax 
credit reversal in their report Less than Rs 697.00 Lakh for the quarter Dec 31, 2024. The company is in the process 
of paying creditors outstanding for more than 180 days & after paying the creditor input tax credit can be availed and 
utilized again.
e.	
For Audit Qualification(s) where the impact is not quantified by the auditor:
(i)	
Management’s estimation on the impact of audit qualification.
(ii)	 If management is unable to estimate the impact, reasons for the same: The qualification pertains to the 
absence of documentary evidence available for investment in projects. These projects are, predating FY 21-22. 
As the management diligently gathers the necessary documents, so it is crucial to recognize that the potential 
implications and their subsequent impact on the unaudited financial results, are currently uncertain.
