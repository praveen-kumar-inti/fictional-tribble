1.
Energy 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk- The environmental 
risks 
emphasize 
on 
the 
company’s 
climate 
consciousness and ability 
to manage consequences 
due 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
energy management.
Opportunity- 
Effective 
energy systems improves 
the resource management 
of the company thereby 
improving its performance 
and 
top-line 
growth. 
Comprehensive 
resource 
management 
plans 
in 
alignment 
with 
the 
Company’s 
environment 
conservation strategy will 
highlight the Company’s 
commitment to improving 
environment preservation 
and its contribution toward 
climate change mitigation 
action plans.
KEI is committed to utilising 
technology to empower 
customers 
and 
foster 
collaborative 
efforts 
in 
combatting global climate 
change while promoting 
energy efficiency.
The company is ISO 14001 
certified.
KEI has developed power 
cables, rubber (elastomeric) 
cables, 
solar 
cables, 
that meet the increasing 
demand 
for 
sustainable 
products, reflecting global 
market trends and growing 
ecological 
awareness 
among consumers.  
KEI transition to renewable 
energy sources not only 
addresses 
the 
pressing 
need to combat climate 
change but also brings 
long-term cost savings to 
the organisation. 
Positive- The company’s 
focus 
on 
sustainability 
initiatives 
fosters 
long-
term value-creation and 
enables 
the 
company 
to 
effectively 
respond 
to 
rising 
stakeholder 
demands. 
Negative- Lack of robust 
initiatives 
and 
action 
plans to contribute to ESG 
awareness 
and 
climate 
change could adversely 
impact ESG profile of the 
company.

2.
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk- Workplace hazards 
directly 
hampers 
the 
company’s 
productivity, 
finances and reputation. 
The 
repercussions 
and 
efforts to develop a safe 
environment would take 
time 
and 
resources 
to 
recover 
from. 
Effective 
health & safety practices 
boosts employee morale, 
increases 
productivity 
and promotes corporate 
responsibility.
The company has OHSMS- 
ISO 45001 certification in 
place. Our manufacturing 
facilities 
in 
Bhiwadi, 
Chopanki, 
Pathredi 
(in 
Rajasthan) and Silvassa & 
Chinchpada (in Dadra & 
Nagar Haveli Daman and 
Diu) follow processes as 
per ISO 45001 and adhere 
to the best practices in 
operational 
health 
and 
safety. We provide regular 
health and safety trainings 
to all our employees and 
workers.
Negative- Weak health & 
safety practices directly 
impacts 
the 
company’s 
finance resulting in stunted 
growth. Effective systems 
reduce costs associated 
with 
accidents 
and 
incidents, thereby leading 
to improved confidence 
and lower turnover rates in 
the future.
3.
Human rights 
practices
Risk
Risk- 
Parameters 
on 
human rights such as fair 
working environment, equal 
opportunities, remuneration, 
freedom 
of 
association 
without ethnic discrimination 
will impact the performance 
of the company on the social 
front from the employee’s 
perspective.
Training 
and 
awareness 
of 
all 
the 
employees 
and workers and clause 
related to Human rights 
in value chain agreements 
and 
contracts 
provided. 
The 
Company 
prohibits 
indulgence 
of 
business 
and the value chain with 
any kind of child labor in 
any of its operation. The 
Company is committed to 
fair employment practices 
and freedom of expression.
Negative- Absence of effective 
grievance mechanisms impacts 
commitment towards human 
rights integration within the 
Company’s business model.
4.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk- Well-structured and efficient 
supply 
chain 
management 
mitigates the risks associated with 
procurement, production, strikes 
and labor disputes as well as costs 
which could have a negative impact 
on the business activities.
Opportunities- With a transparent 
and unambiguous value chain 
engagement, 
the 
company 
can optimize efforts, create a 
circular economy and enhance 
profitability. 
Efficacious 
supply 
chain management leads to better 
collaboration, 
improved 
quality 
control, improved risk mitigation, 
eco-friendly 
initiatives 
and 
a 
transparent product procurement.
The organization has long-term 
relationships with our significant 
raw material suppliers, with a 
significant number of our suppliers 
having the best practices for 
sustainability. Our supply chain 
consists of both local and global 
suppliers. 
We have put in practice a necessary 
due-diligence 
process 
before 
engaging with any supplier or 
logistics delivery partner.
Positive- Efficient supply chain 
management ensures that the 
company 
delivers 
maximum 
business value with the least 
possible cost. This in turn results 
from 
reduced 
environmental 
impact and long-term value to 
the company’s sustainability-led 
endeavours.
Negative- A mismanaged supply 
chain leads to ineffective utilization 
of resources, hampers natural 
procurement of materials and 
elimination of waste throughout 
the product lifecycle.

Practices & 
Benefits
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk- Employee development 
programs and provision for 
employee 
benefits 
could 
be considered as incurred 
expenses to the company. 
Opportunities- 
Structured 
employee 
development 
and engagement programs 
accelerate the work satisfaction 
of 
the 
company 
thereby 
enhancing the performance 
and company’s topline. An 
enhanced 
collaboration 
amongst the team members 
lead to better communication, 
trust, talent pipeline, share 
understanding of company’s 
goals 
and 
priorities 
and 
improved employee retention.
To develop the skills of our 
employees 
and 
workers, 
job 
specific 
and 
personal 
development 
trainings 
are provided. A leadership 
development 
program 
is 
crafted as per the strategic 
requirements 
of 
the 
organization 
that 
identifies 
upcoming 
and 
relevant 
development opportunities for 
individuals.
Positive- A strong workforce 
with 
higher 
engagement, 
retention rate and diversity 
in the workforce brings new 
perspectives, 
experiences, 
and 
ideas 
which 
enable 
innovation, 
enhances 
the 
performance 
and 
enables 
a positive culture in the 
organization.
Negative- The inability to 
meet workforce expectations 
may result in adverse impacts 
on workforce, morale and the 
company’s growth plan in a 
long run productivity.
6.
Regulatory 
& Legal 
Compliances
Risk 
Risk- Risk of non-compliance 
exposes the organization to 
legal penalties and financial 
losses resulting from failure 
to comply with the industry 
laws and regulations. More 
compliant companies tend to 
have improved performances 
and better process efficiency. 
Compliance gives assurance 
and provides a broader insight 
to the investors.
The company has code of 
conduct, 
Vigil 
Mechanism/
Whistle Blower Policy and 
insider trading policies to 
safeguard the interests of 
the 
investors 
and 
other 
stakeholders.
Negative- 
Non-compliance 
would 
lead 
to 
loss 
of 
reputation and consequently 
affect the business activities. 
Companies who are compliant 
with the regulatory laws have 
a better ability to manage 
risks and builds a better sense 
of fairness and loyalty among 
employees.
