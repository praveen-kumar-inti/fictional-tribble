Rationale for identifying the

In case of Risk, approach to adapt or

Financial 
Implications of 
the risk or the 
opportunity 
(Negative/ Positive) 
Given 
the 
importance 
of 
water conservation, 
it 
is 
our 
responsibility 
to 
properly 
manage the consumption and 
treatment of the water used in 
our operations. 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) have been 
established at all our manufacturing plants 
to ensure the continuous treatment of the 
water discharged by our activities. We intend 
to pursue opportunities for reducing water 
consumption 
in 
our 
operations 
through 
various innovations and efforts. 
Non-availability 
of 
water 
may 
impact 
the operations of our 
business and 
lead to 
potential 
financial 
loss. 
One 
of 
top 
priorities 
is 
to 
provide 
a 
safe workplace 
for 
our employees and workers. 
It 
is important for the Company's 
long-term performance that we 
ensure the well-being 
of our 
employees and comply with all 
the legal requirements. 
The 
Company 
undertakes 
internal 
and 
external 
audits 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
ISO 
45001:2018 
standard 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation of Occupational Health and 
Safety 
(OHS) Management systems 
within 
the Company's operations. The Company's 
Process 
Safety 
Management 
System 
facilitates the implementation of best safety 
practices. Further, it enables the identification 
of 
work-related 
hazards 
through 
design 
checklists, Hazard, and Operability Analysis 
(HAZOP), 
Hazard 
Identification 
and 
Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) and other consequence 
modelling studies. 
Failure 
in 
the 
safety 
management 
system 
may 
lead 
to 
the 
person-hour loss and 
therefore impact the 
productivity 
of 
our 
operations, leading to 
financial costs. 
Commitment 
to 
provide 
our 
workforce 
with 
equal 
opportunity 
in 
terms 
of 
recognition, 
advancement, 
and 
career 
path, 
regardless 
of their 
origin 
or views 
and 
not 
tolerating 
any 
form 
of 
discrimination 
or 
harassment 
is important for the sustainable 
growth 
of the company. Any 
violation to the human 
rights 
may 
also 
lead 
to 
regulatory, 
legal, and legislative challenges. 
The Company 
has formulated policies and 
procedures around human rights and a code 
of conduct which are regularly reviewed and 
updated under the human rights assessment. 
Further, we have also formulated a Steering 
Committee to ensure all complaints related 
to 
human 
rights 
are 
dealt 
with 
utmost 
priority and sincerity. Regular trainings are 
also provided to our employees and workers 
to make them aware of their basic rights and 
our policies and procedures around human 
rights.

Whether you have 
processes for workers to 
report the work-related 
hazards and to remove 
themselves from such 
risks? (Yes/No) 
AIS has a well-defined process to report work-related hazards, which includes 
the following: 
Kiken Yochi (Danger prediction): This is a systematic tool to identify the danger to the workers and take 
the countermeasure against the potential risk. 
Daily Toolbox meetings: AIS has a robust approach towards Daily Toolbox talks meetings i.e., prior to 
commencing any work-related activity, we explain the activity and the risk associated with that activity to 
mitigate the potential hazards. 
Safety Committee meetings: At AIS, a Safety Committee is an essential component of a healthy workplace 
environment. The Safety Committee develops our safety culture, improves efficiency, and sets and tracks 
safety standards. A system 
is 
in place across 
all manufacturing 
units for workers to spot and report 
work-related and offer suggestions for improvements. Necessary training and awareness sessions are 
organized for all workers and employees to recognize hazards and issues. Joint inspections by management 
representatives and employees on the shop floors are also carried out at regular intervals, and respective 
corrective and preventive measures are undertaken to mitigate the identified risks. To create an open and 
transparent safety culture across AIS, employees are encouraged to participate and discuss safety-related 
issues in forums like periodic Safety Committee meetings and Departmental Open Forums. 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment: We have 
a process to identify hazards and assess the 
associated risks including defining and implementing necessary control measures to bring down risk to an 
acceptable level. 
Pointing & Calling: This is a culture that AIS has created at each plant location, in terms of occupational 
safety, to avoiding mistakes by pointing at important indicators and verbally calling out their status quo. 
Safety Patrolling: At AIS, we follow the best practices to identify any kind of risk for this on a weekly basis. 
Safety officers perform safety patrolling and rectify the emerging issues. 
Near-miss Reporting: AIS pays attention to near-miss reporting, as timely reporting helps in mitigating 
risks, preventing accidents, raising awareness about the hazard’s employees face, and ensuring 
a safer 
working environment for everyone.

Replacing diesel forklifts with battery forklifts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and decrease noise pollution 
in the workplace. 
Adapting new processes for low suction pressure in blowers to reduce power consumption and installing Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) 
to optimize motor speed and efficiency. 
Converting low-efficiency motors to high-efficiency motors to enhance energy savings, reduce operational costs, and improve overall 
system performance. 
Adopting new technology to reduce CO, emissions in plants, thereby enhancing sustainability and minimizing the environmental impact. 
Reducing leakage throughout the premises along with other adoption of energy efficient technology. 
Planning to install ‘Waste to Heat’ recovery plant to capture and reuse the heat generated by industrial processes that would otherwise 
be 
lost to the environment, which 
has significant 
positive significant environmental 
benefits 
i.e, reduction 
in greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHGs), decreased air pollutants, resource conservation along with economic benefits, and contribution to UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs). 
AIS has signed a 20-year contract with Inox Air to supply 95 tonnes of green hydrogen annually for their new greenfield float glass facility 
in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan. In addition, AIS has invested in the solar plant that will provide renewable energy for generating green hydrogen

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
At AIS, we continuously monitor 
waste generation on a day-to-day basis across 
all the manufacturing plants. Measures are taken into consideration 
to effectively store, manage, and safely dispose of the waste as per pollution control board guidelines. 
Being a glass manufacturer, cullet is our primary type of waste generated, however, we are working very carefully to reduce the unwanted 
generation of broken glasses and train our workers on safety norms on a periodic basis. 
Additionally, for glass printing, we use sealant and ink materials, which are categorized hazardous waste. Therefore, the empty bottles of these 
inputs are collected and stored at a separate location and safely disposed of through authorized vendors, as per State Pollution Control Board 
(SPCB) guidelines.
