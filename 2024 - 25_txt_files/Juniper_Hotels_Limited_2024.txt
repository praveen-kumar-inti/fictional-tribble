Specific commitments, goals and

timelines, if any.
The specific commitments, goals, and targets set by Juniper Hotels Limited 
(JHL) with defined timelines are detailed in the Natural Capital chapter of this 
Annual Report, discussing their 2030 Environmental Goals. These commitments 
also align with the environmental strategies of Hyatt Corporation (Hyatt) for their 
managed properties, and include several key targets:
1. 	
Climate Change and Water Conservation: By 2030, Hyatt aims to reduce 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions for all its managed properties, including 
India, by 27.5% from a 2019 baseline. This goal reflects JHL’s commitment 
to enhancing efficiency measures, prioritizing water conservation, and 
increasing the use of renewable energy and groundwater.
2. 	 Waste and Circularity: In line with Hyatt goals, JHL plans to achieve a 50% 
global reduction in food waste sent to landfill or incineration per square 
meter by 2030, compared to 2019. JHL’s waste management practices 
emphasize the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, aligning with this initiative.
3. 	 Responsible Sourcing: In line with Hyatt’s goals, JHL is focused on increasing 
responsible sourcing of products and services, considering impacts on 
climate change, deforestation, human rights, waste, public health, resource 
scarcity, biodiversity, and animal welfare. JHL mirrors these efforts through 
its sustainable supply chain practices, working with suppliers who adhere to 
rigorous environmental standards.
4. 	 Thriving Destinations: JHL is dedicated to protecting biodiversity, managing 
water risks, reducing pollution, and promoting climate resilience. Through its 
initiatives, the Company fosters community engagement and biodiversity 
conservation, making meaningful contributions to local ecosystems and the 
well-being of surrounding communities.

maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance. As part of its 
Vision 2030 strategy, the Company is focused on further strengthening its 
governance framework. JHL has already achieved 25% representation of

making. Additionally, the Company plans to appoint Independent Directors 
as Chairs of all Board-level Committees, reinforcing the independence and 
integrity of its governance structure.
	
Demonstrating its commitment to responsible business practices, JHL also 
intends to integrate sustainability into its core governance by appointing 
three Sustainability/ESG experts to its Board. These initiatives form a key part 
of JHL’s Natural Capital strategy, which is aligned with Hyatt Corporation’s 
2030 Environmental Goals to ensure environmentally responsible and 
sustainable operations.

ESG Journey: JHL’s commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) practices is in its nascent stages, with numerous initiatives currently being

Reasons for Not Meeting Targets:  Several of JHL’s ESG targets are in the process 
of being achieved, with specific milestones strategically mapped out to align

company’s commitment to circular economy principles. For more detailed 
information, refer to the Natural Capital chapter within this Annual Report.
3.	
Responsible Sourcing:

Statement by the director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
Mr. Varun Saraf - Chief Executive Officer (CEO):
FY2025 was a landmark year for Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL), our first as a 
listed company. We proved that our strategy is both disciplined and effective, 
leading to significant growth and key strategic achievements. We saw a year of 
exceptional financial performance, with Total Income reaching a record ₹975.6 
crore, an 18.1% increase year on year. Our PAT was ₹713 million, a remarkable 
199.6% increase from FY2024. A key highlight was using ₹1,500 crore from our 
IPO to repay debt, resulting in annual interest savings of over ₹1,569 million. 
This strategic move significantly strengthened our financial position, with our 
Net Bank Debt to EBITDA ratio improving from 5.7x pre-IPO to just 0.5x.
Operationally, we achieved several key milestones that will drive future growth. 
The Grand Hyatt Mumbai completed its comprehensive room refurbishment 
and opened its new 49,655 sq. ft. MICE facility, The Grand Showroom. Under 
our strategic Juniper 2.0 initiative, we acquired a 6.5-acre asset near Bengaluru 
Airport and Jenipro Hotels Private Limited, which holds land in Kaziranga, 
Assam. We have also secured the Right of First Offer for two large Saraf family-
owned hotels—Hyatt Regency Mumbai and Hyatt Regency Chennai—which 
will add approximately 737 keys to our portfolio without a cash outflow.
Looking ahead, our pipeline is robust. We are on track to double our key count 
to over 3,467 by FY2029 and aim to triple our EBITDA over the next five years. 
We will continue to focus on expanding our presence in key metropolitan areas 
and leveraging our strong balance sheet for future growth. Thank you for your 
continued support and trust in Juniper Hotels Limited.
Warm regards,
Mr. Varun Saraf

the appropriate course of action.
	
Recusal from Decisions: Any Board member facing a conflict is required to recuse themselves from related discussions 
and decision-making processes.

accountability in its governance practices.

Our Company is committed to maintaining a transparent, safe, and accountable work 
environment. To ensure effective grievance redressal, the hotel has implemented a 
Whistleblower Policy and also constituted dedicated committees such as the POSH 
Committee and the Grievance Redressal Committee. All complaints are reviewed by 
the respective committee, comprising members from various departments along 
with one external member to ensure neutrality and fairness.
Colleagues can raise concerns via their official email ID or through a written 
application, providing relevant details and supporting evidence wherever possible. 
In cases where a complaint involves a committee member, it may be escalated 
directly to the General Manager or the Human Resources Department.
Regular classroom-based refresher training sessions are conducted to raise 
awareness on grievance redressal procedures. All investigations are carried out 
impartially, with no presumption of guilt, and all information shared during the 
process is treated with strict confidentiality, except where disclosure is necessary for 
conducting the investigation or taking corrective action.
Disciplinary actions taken, if any, remain confidential. Additionally, grievances 
related to the POSH Act, 2013 are addressed by the Internal Complaints Committee 
(ICC), which handles all concerns pertaining to sexual harassment in the workplace.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1. 	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
At Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL), we believe that active and meaningful engagement with stakeholders is essential for 
sustainable growth. To this end, we follow a structured approach to identify and connect with our key stakeholder groups:
	
•	
Stakeholder Mapping and Analysis: We continually map and analyse stakeholders based on their level of influence 
and interest in our operations. This enables us to prioritise engagement with those who have the greatest impact 
on our business or are most affected by our activities. Stakeholders are categorised into groups such as employees, 
customers, suppliers, local communities, and regulatory authorities.
	
•	
Engagement Surveys and Feedback: We conduct regular surveys, feedback sessions, and discussions to understand 
stakeholder expectations and address their concerns. These interactions take place through online surveys, focus 
groups, and one-on-one interviews. The insights gained are instrumental in refining our policies and aligning our 
practices with stakeholder needs.
	
•	
Ongoing Reviews and Updates: Recognising that stakeholder priorities evolve, we periodically review and update 
our identification and engagement processes. These reviews help assess the effectiveness of our strategies and 
incorporate adjustments based on feedback and emerging trends, ensuring our approach remains relevant and 
responsive.
	
Through these comprehensive measures, JHL fosters strong relationships built on trust, collaboration, and mutual value—
cornerstones of our long-term success.

into quarterly reports. These reports, prepared by relevant departments, outline key themes and concerns and are 
presented to the Board, enabling data-driven and stakeholder-informed decisions.
	
•	
Delegated Engagement Mechanisms: When consultation is delegated, JHL ensures a clear process for gathering 
and transmitting stakeholder input. Special committees or task forces are appointed to collect feedback on specific 
topics, compile findings, and present comprehensive summaries for Board review and follow-up action.
	
•	
Commitment to Enhancement: We continually evaluate the effectiveness of our consultation methods and welcome 
suggestions from stakeholders on how these processes can be improved. This ongoing refinement helps keep our 
approach adaptive, transparent, and responsive to evolving needs.
	
Through these mechanisms, JHL integrates stakeholder perspectives into both strategic planning and operational 
execution, fostering trust, accountability, and long-term value creation.
2. 	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
At Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL), stakeholder engagement plays a central role in identifying and addressing environmental 
and social priorities. Illustrative examples include:
	
Sustainability Projects: Insights from environmental organisations and local communities have been instrumental in 
shaping our green initiatives. As a result, we have implemented advanced waste management systems and invested 
in renewable energy solutions across our properties. At the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, for example, wind turbines have been 
installed to lower carbon emissions and reduce dependence on conventional energy sources—demonstrating our active 
contribution to climate action and our dedication to environmental responsibility.
	
Community-Focused Initiatives: Dialogue with community representatives has influenced the design of our CSR 
programmes, which focus on education, healthcare, and social welfare. A flagship example is the Bodhgaya Hotel School in 
Bihar, which offers quality education and improved facilities to underprivileged children. This initiative fosters sustainable 
economic growth in the area while enabling our guests to be part of a meaningful, positive change.
	
By embedding stakeholder perspectives into our decision-making, JHL ensures that our strategies and operations reflect 
both community expectations and our long-standing commitment to sustainable, responsible hospitality.
3. 	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Juniper Hotels Limited (JHL) is committed to engaging with vulnerable and marginalised groups and taking tangible 
steps to address their needs. Notable examples include:
	
•	
Advancing Education: Collaboration with underserved communities inspired the creation of the Bodhgaya Hotel 
School, an initiative that delivers high-quality education to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Beyond 
supporting the region’s long-term economic growth, the project invites guests to be part of a meaningful social 
impact journey. The school blends strong academic instruction with practical hospitality training, equipping students

with the skills required to succeed in the industry. For further insights, refer to the Social and Relationship Capital 
section.
	
•	
Strengthening Health & Safety: Feedback from at-risk groups has driven enhancements to our health and safety 
framework. This includes upgrading safety measures, conducting frequent fire safety and emergency preparedness 
drills, and offering regular training on topics such as cybersecurity. These steps ensure a secure and supportive 
environment for all. More details are available in the Human Capital section.
	
•	
Fostering Economic Inclusion: JHL actively supports India’s economic inclusion agenda by collaborating with local 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We integrate these businesses into our supply chain and provide mentoring 
and capacity-building opportunities to help them improve operations, expand reach, and strengthen competitiveness. 
Through these efforts, we help nurture a fairer, more resilient business ecosystem. Further information can be found 
in the Social & Relationship Capital section.
	
These initiatives reflect JHL’s dedication to protecting stakeholder interests and addressing their concerns through 
impactful, inclusive, and sustainable actions. By championing diversity, empowerment, and opportunity, we contribute to
