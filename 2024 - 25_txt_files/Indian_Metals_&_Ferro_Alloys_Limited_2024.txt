7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At IMFA we understand the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance stewardship and have long believed 
sustainability to be one of the key pillars to development and growth. We take cognisance of IMFA’s impact on neighboring 
communities, the environment and our internal culture, and as a leading corporate citizen, we are committed to adopting the 
highest standards in operations to mitigate challenges that arise.
	
We aim for organisational excellence by implementing strong corporate governance practices and embracing responsible 
leadership and integrating our processes and measures throughout the value chain.
	
While our operations have always prioritised sustainability through initiatives such as the first captive solar project in Odisha and 
gainful use of fly ash through production of low density aggregates (LDA), we took a major step this year by entering into long 
term power purchase agreements with two leading RE companies for 110 MW hybrid renewable energy. Slated to come on line 
by June 2026, this will result in a significant reduction of our carbon footprint.
	
In addition to a greater share of renewable energy in our operations, we are also focussing on a sustainability driven agenda while 
exploring growth and diversification opportunities. This includes adopting energy-efficient equipment and conducting regular 
energy audits to reinforce our vision of a greener tomorrow.

Regarding packaging materials, tarpaulins used during chrome ore transportation are reused multiple times to minimize waste. 
Once deemed unusable, they are disposed of responsibly through vendors authorized by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) 
in compliance with applicable environmental regulations.

6.	 	 Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and worker? 
If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)   
Permanent Workers  
The Company has a “Grievance Redressal Policy” applicable to all permanent employees. It seeks to 
promote practices and procedures that ensure creation and sustenance of healthy relationships and 
expeditious settlement of employee grievance, thereby improving productivity and overall efficiency 
of the organisation.
As per the policy framework, the grievance redressal process comprises three stages for addressing 
employee grievances:
1.	 First Stage: Submission of the grievance to the immediate supervisor or departmental head 
for resolution.
2.	 Second Stage: If unresolved, escalation to the Human Resources department for further 
examination and mediation.
3.	 Third Stage: In the event the grievance remains unresolved, final escalation to a designated senior 
management committee for conclusive resolution.
The decision of the Grievance Redressal Committee at Stage III shall be considered final, and no 
further appeal will be entertained against its decision. However, any unresolved grievances that are 
recorded in the monthly grievance reports are escalated to the Managing Director for a final review 
and decision, ensuring closure on all pending matters.

The company is committed to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) across all its manufacturing operations. Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs) have been established at all manufacturing locations for the treatment of industrial wastewater. These ETPs are maintained 
efficiently to ensure compliance with prescribed environmental norms. The treated water is reused for metal cooling, slag cooling, 
ash conditioning, and dust suppression, ensuring that no industrial effluent is discharged externally. 
	
In addition to this, Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) are installed at all locations to treat domestic sewage. The treated sewage 
water is reused for gardening and plantation activities within colony areas, contributing to water conservation and sustainability.
	
At the Choudwar plant, two Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) have been installed for the treatment of industrial wastewater. The 
first ETP has a treatment capacity of 240 cubic meters per hour (m³/hr), while the second has a capacity of 200 cubic meters per 
hour (m³/hr). These plants ensure effective treatment and reuse of industrial effluents in operational processes, such as metal 
cooling, slag cooling, ash conditioning, and dust suppression, thereby maintaining zero liquid discharge from the facility.
	
Additionally, at the Choudwar plant, two Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) have been established for the treatment of domestic 
wastewater. The first STP has a treatment capacity of 150 cubic meters per day (m³/day), while the second has a capacity of 3 
cubic meters per day (m³/day). The treated water is effectively reused for gardening and plantation activities within the colony 
area, contributing to sustainable water management and reduced freshwater dependency.

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	 Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Customer complaints: The mechanisms in place to receive and respond to customer complaints on export and domestic sales are 
described below:
	
Export Sales: Customers notify the Sales and Marketing Department (S&M) of any non-conformity, which is recorded in the 
Customer Complaint Register. The Department analyses the complaint and:
a)	
if it pertains to quality (chemical and size of the product), it is forwarded to the Head of Manufacturing, Production in-charge, 
Quality Control (QC) in-charge at the plant for investigation. 
b)	
Other complaints are investigated by the S&M department. 
	
If the issue (related to size deviation and Chromium difference) can be resolved as per the provisions of the contract at the 
destination, the Head of S&M shall try to do so with the customer after consultation with the Ferro Alloys Business Unit Head. 
If required, a Company representative(s) may visit the customer to assess and determine the cause of the non-conformity. The 
Company representative’s report is submitted to the Head of Sales & Marketing, who in turn in consultation with the Ferro Alloys 
Business Unit Head, takes suitable corrective and preventive actions (as per prescribed protocols), that are acceptable to the 
customer as well.
	
Records of non-conformities and their resolution are maintained in the prescribed form and suitable corrective action is taken to 
avoid future occurrences.
	
Domestic Sales: Customers can submit their complaints in writing or verbally at Corporate Head Quarters (CHQ), Branches or at 
IMFA Therubali/Choudwar. Complaints received at CHQ and Branches are acknowledged in the prescribed Customer Complaint 
Acknowledgement form. Complaints received at Works are forwarded to CHQ for acknowledgement. In case complaints are 
acknowledged at Branches, a copy of the acknowledgement is forwarded to S&M in Bhubaneswar.
	
Once the complaint is acknowledged a preliminary investigation carried out by an executive of the S&M department, which involves 
a) Understanding the complaint and customer expectations; b) Ascertaining if the entire consignment related to the complaint is 
segregated and untampered; and c) Any other aspect.
	
The preliminary investigation report is submitted to the S&M Head along with the Customer Complaint Acknowledgement. The 
S&M Head then determines whether a further detailed investigation is required. If so, an executive of the S&M Department carries 
out the said investigation. On completion, the Domestic Sales in-charge disposes the complaint based on the terms of the Purchase 
Order and/or mutual agreement between the customer and the Company. 
	
For issues arising from customer complaints, corrective action is taken by the designated personnel to avoid similar occurrences 
in the future. 
	
The “Review of Customer Complaint” and “Cost of Poor Quality” are recorded in the prescribed forms and copies are shared with 
the branches concerned. A brief of all the steps taken between the acknowledgement of the complaint and corrective action is 
recorded in the Customer Complaint Register maintained by the S&M Department.
	
Customer Feedback: Feedback is collected from customers with each consignment, where customers rate IMFA’s product quality, 
delivery and personal interaction on a scale of 0 to 10. These feedback forms are either sent to customers via email or hand-
delivered during sales visits. Feedback can also be collected over the telephone. All feedback forms are compiled and analysed on 
a half-yearly basis, for any corrective action.
