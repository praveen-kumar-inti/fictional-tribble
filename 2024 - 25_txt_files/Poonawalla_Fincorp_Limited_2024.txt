Yes, the engagement with communities and beneficiaries is mostly in the form of focused group 
discussions and their feedback on the CSR programs is considered and implemented as appropriate. We 
have instituted ESG policy that outlines our commitment for each of the focus areas identified by us.
	
The discussion of employees with HR and team leads has also helped the Company to incorporate 
activities such as employee wellbeing programs, taking cognizance of environmental initiatives (saving 
electricity, water etc.). We have instituted Equal Opportunity policy and other employee related policies 
and practices to promote a fair workplace.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
To avoid spreading false information about the organization, whenever journalists or media outlets ask 
questions or have queries, the Company immediately reviews them and responds. The Company also 
engages with the media to keep stakeholders updated about the Company. The Company thinks that the 
unban	
ked and underbanked people in urban India are less likely to integrate into India's mainstream 
economy, which makes them vulnerable to socioeconomic exploitation. Through its CSR initiative, the 
Company aims to improve the lives of underprivileged individuals, and all the CSR projects aims to address 
the concerns of marginalized stakeholder groups and promote society's holistic development. For further 
detail on our CSR programmes please refer annual CSR report.

provide details.
	
Yes
	
The Company has taken the following initiatives to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions:
•	 Awareness generation among the employees to conserve and responsibly use electricity.
•	 Reduction of usage of energy (through installation of LED bulbs, energy efficient electrical equipment 
and retrofitting LED lights in branch offices.)
•	 E-waste management and handling, distribution of sapling and paper conservation (e.g. both side 
printing, re-use of papers, PIN based controlled printing) and paper waste recycling.
•	 The Head office is in a Platinum certified green building.
•	 We have embraced “Go Green” initiative by procuring green energy from MSEB at Corporate office.
•	 The Company has managed all the electrical equipment in a manner so that they help to conserve energy. 
The Company has initiated installation of LED lights in new and upcoming branches wherever possible. 
The Company is also in the process of replacing existing lights with LED lights in a phased manner.
•	 Energy consumption would reduce as a result of these initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Energy 
conservation would significantly contribute to the mitigation of global warming in our nation due to 
the predominant use of fossil fuels for energy production, which results in greenhouse gas emissions 
and climate change.

system generated reports and facility for uploading system generated reports which helped in restricting
