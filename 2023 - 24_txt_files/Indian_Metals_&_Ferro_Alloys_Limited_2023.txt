Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
The Company has its own captive chrome ore mines. Our mines are compliant with all the statutory requirements.
	
	
For other raw materials, like Bauxite and Quartzite, we ensure that proper mining permissions have been 
acquired from the mining department of the state. Furthermore, interstate despatch of materials is done from 
external vendors only with the permission of appropriate state authority against valid transit pass, which is 
obtained prior to transporting materials from the vendor to the plant.

The Company has a “Grievance Redressal Policy” applicable to all permanent employees. It seeks to promote 
practices and procedures that ensure creation and sustenance of healthy relationships and expeditious settlement 
of employee grievance, thereby improving productivity and overall efficiency of the organisation.
	
As per the policy there are three stages to addressing an employee grievance:
	
Stage I: The grievance must be submitted with requisite documents to the aggrieved employee’s immediate 
supervisor (“relevant authority” at this stage). On receipt, the supervisor will discuss the matter with the aggrieved 
employee and redress the grievance if it is within their power to do so. A formal response has to be communicated 
to the employee within ten days of receipt of the grievance with a copy to the HR department.
	
Stage II: If at Stage I the aggrieved employee is not satisfied with the outcome, they can approach the Department/
Functional/Business Unit Head (“relevant authority” at this stage) within seven days of receipt of the decision. 
The reasons for taking the grievance to the next stage have to be indicated clearly in the prescribed form. The 
relevant authority will also meet the aggrieved employee to discuss the grievance in detail. Within ten days of 
receipt of the grievance the relevant authority has to communicate their response to the employee with a copy 
to the HR department.
	
Stage III: If dissatisfied with the outcome at Stage II, the employee can approach the Grievance Redressal 
Committee within seven working days of receipt of formal communication of the outcome, clearly stating the 
reasons. This Committee will further discuss the matter in detail with the employee. The Committee has to respond 
within thirty working days of receipt of the grievance with a copy to the HR department.
	
The decision of the Committee in Stage III is final, and no further appeal can be entertained against their decision.
	
However, unresolved grievances recorded in the monthly reports have to be referred to the Managing Director for 
a final decision.

Yes, the Company has implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge. Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) have 
been set up to treat the industrial waste water at all manufacturing locations as per norms. We have two (2) 
Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) (one has a capacity of 240 m3/hr and the other of 200 m3/hr) and the treated water 
is used for metal cooling, slag cooling, ash conditioning and dust suppression. No effluent water is discharged 
outside. Apart from these, the Company has two (2) sewage treatment plants (STP) (one has a capacity of 
150 m3/day and the other 3 m3/day) for treatment of waste domestic water. Treated water is used in gardening 
and plantation.
	
At the mines, two (2) ETPs, with capacities of 360 m3/hr and 900 m3/hr, have been set up within the Sukinda Mines 
lease area. The water generated from mines seepage and runoff is treated at these ETPs. Treated water is used 
for mining dust suppression and plantation activities as per prescribed norms. During the monsoon season, the 
water is discharged to the land outside the lease area as per prescribed norms. The quality of the treated water 
is monitored through a real-time telemetry system at the ETP and it is ensured that no effluent water is discharged 
from the mines.
	
Also the Company has implemented rainwater harvesting projects at Sukinda and Mahagiri Mines (Chromite) to 
augment ground water resources in the core and buffer zone in consultation with Regional Director, Central water 
Board. The rainwater harvested is accumulated in the harvesting pit from where it recharges the ground water, 
and the water is utilised for dust suppression after monsoon.

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner.
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Customer Complaints: The mechanisms in place to receive and respond to customer complaints on export and 
domestic sales are described below:
	
Export Sales: Customers notify the Sales and Marketing Department (S&M) of any non-conformity, which is 
recorded in the Customer Complaint Register. The Department analyses the complaint and:
	
(a)	 if it pertains to quality (chemical and size of the product), it is forwarded to the Head of Manufacturing, 
Production in-charge, Quality Control (QC) in-charge at the plant for investigation.
	
(b)	 Other complaints are investigated by the S&M department.
	
If the issue (related to size deviation and Chromium difference) can be resolved as per the provisions of the 
contract at the destination, the Head of S&M shall try to do so with the customer after consultation with the 
Ferro Alloys Business Unit Head. If required, a Company representative(s) may visit the customer to assess and 
determine the cause of the non-conformity. The Company representative’s report is submitted to the Head of 
Sales & Marketing, who in turn in consultation with the Ferro Alloys Business Unit Head, takes suitable corrective 
and preventive actions (as per prescribed protocols), that are acceptable to the customer as well.
	
Records of non-conformities and their resolution are maintained in the prescribed form and suitable corrective 
action is taken to avoid future occurrences.
	
Domestic Sales: Customers can submit their complaints in writing or verbally at Corporate Head Quarters (CHQ), 
Branches or at IMFA Therubali/Choudwar. Complaints received at CHQ and Branches are acknowledged in the 
prescribed Customer Complaint Acknowledgement form. Complaints received at Works are forwarded to CHQ 
for acknowledgement. In case complaints are acknowledged at Branches, a copy of the acknowledgement is 
forwarded to S&M in Bhubaneswar.
	
Once the complaint is acknowledged a preliminary investigation carried out by an executive of the S&M 
department, which involves: a) Understanding the complaint and customer expectations; b) Ascertaining if the 
entire consignment related to the complaint is segregated and untampered; and c) Any other aspect.
	
The preliminary investigation report is submitted to the S&M Head along with the Customer Complaint 
Acknowledgement. The S&M Head then determines whether a further detailed investigation is required. If so, an 
executive of the S&M Department carries out the said investigation. On completion, the Domestic Sales in-charge 
disposes the complaint based on the terms of the Purchase Order and/or mutual agreement between the customer 
and the Company.
	
For issues arising from customer complaints, corrective action is taken by the designated personnel to avoid similar 
occurrences in the future.
	
The “Review of Customer Complaint” and “Cost of Poor Quality” are recorded in the prescribed forms and copies are 
shared with the branches concerned. A brief of all the steps taken between the acknowledgement of the complaint 
and corrective action is recorded in the Customer Complaint Register maintained by the S&M Department.
	
Customer Feedback: Feedback is collected from customers with each consignment, where customers rate IMFA’s 
product quality, delivery and personal interaction on a scale of 0 to 10. These feedback forms are either sent to 
customers via email or hand-delivered during sales visits. Feedback can also be collected over the telephone. All 
feedback forms are compiled and analysed on a half-yearly basis, for any corrective action.
