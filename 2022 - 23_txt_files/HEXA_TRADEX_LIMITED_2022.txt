Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues: 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format. 
Sr. 
No 
Material 
issue 
Identified 
Indicate 
whether 
risk or 
opportunity 
Rationale for 
identifying the risk/ 
opportunity 
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt or 
mitigate 
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
Negative implications) 
1 
Product 
innovation, 
safety, and 
quality 
 
Opportunity 
Rapidly growing 
economy and emphasis 
on import substitution 
through “Atmanirbhar 
Bharat” presents 
significant opportunity for 
us to meet the 
requirements, leveraging 
on our product portfolio 
and innovation. 
NA 
Positive: 
Development of the right 
strategy on product 
innovation and quality 
may impact our business 
in a positive manner, and 
we are targeting that at 
least 10% of our revenue 
to come from our value-
added products.  
2 
Economic 
Value 
Distributed 
(EVD) 
 
Opportunity 
Economic Value 
Distributed (EVD) to the 
shareholders can lead to 
an increase in market 
capitalisation and 
potential opportunities for 
future fundraising from 
stakeholders. However, 
it’s important to find a 
balance between 
distributing economic 
benefits and allocating 
funds internally to 
support growth and 
expansion. 
NA 
Positive: 
EVD results in a positive 
impact to the market 
capitalisation in the near 
future and would create 
opportunities for fund 
mobilisation to support our 
growth. 
3 
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management 
 
Risk 
As our business 
continues to combat 
climate change and its 
consequential regulatory 
and compliance 
stringency, we need to 
keep pace with such 
regulatory landscape by 
making appropriate 
investments. 
We strive to make timely 
and suitable investments 
for continued 
compliances and even 
beyond.  
 
Positive: 
The Investments in energy 
and emission 
management systems and 
technologies have no 
financial impact on our 
business, which we 
consciously acknowledge 
and accept. 
4 
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety 
 
Risk 
Employees and workers 
are backbone of our 
business operations, and 
we believe in providing 
them a healthy and safe 
workplace. 
We strive to make 
suitable investments in 
safety related 
technology. 
Positive: 
Even though we need to 
invest in safety related 
technology, training, the 
benefits of uninterrupted 
operations outweigh the 
associated costs. 
5 
Customer 
Satisfaction 
 
Opportunity 
Customer satisfaction 
leads the path for market 
development, market 
penetration and getting 
value to the customers 
thereby resulting in gains 
for the company. It is an 
important factor for the 
reputation of our brand. 
NA 
Positive: 
Increased customer 
satisfaction presents 
immense positive 
implication in terms of 
repeat orders, and market 
expansion, by establishing 
us as a high-quality brand. 
 
 
 
7 
 
Sr. 
No 
Material issue 
Identified 
Indicate 
whether risk 
or 
opportunity 
Rationale for identifying 
the risk/ 
opportunity 
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or 
mitigate 
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
Negative implications) 
6 
Ethics and 
Compliance 
 
Opportunity 
An organisation like ours, 
focusing on ethics and 
compliance creates a 
cordial business 
environment that helps in 
employee loyalty, 
thereby reducing attrition 
and assists in attracting 
talent.  
NA 
Positive: 
Strong ethics and 
compliance facilitate a 
positive impact in terms of 
increased employee 
retention, cost savings on 
rehiring and ability to 
achieve and exceed 
targeted performance. 
 
7 
Risk, 
Opportunities 
and Crisis 
Management 
 
 
Risk 
We perceive this as a 
risk because it has the 
potential of 
unprecedented crisis 
which could lead to 
business disruptions. 
We have established 
robust SOPs and have 
developed plans to 
manage various crisis. 
Positive: 
While establishing robust  
Training of employees 
require investments, but 
result in a positive impact 
due to prevention of 
avoidable operational 
interruptions. 
 
8 
Supply Chain 
Management 
(SCM) 
 
 
Opportunity 
Due to current 
geopolitical conditions 
and impact of the 
pandemic, global supply 
chain systems have been 
severely disrupted. This 
presents an opportunity 
for us to create alternate 
models of SCM and gain 
a competitive advantage 
in the market. 
 
NA 
Positive: 
A robust supply chain 
management can lead to 
better customer 
satisfaction, creating a 
sustainable business 
opportunity for us. 
 
9 
Employee 
Wellbeing 
 
Risk 
As we have set high 
standards for employee 
wellbeing, it is pivotal for 
us to implement systems 
and processes for 
constant monitoring and 
upgradation to maintain 
high employee morale. 
We aim to mitigate this 
risk by having a constant 
focus on upgrading 
systems and processes 
to cater to the changing 
needs of employees and 
their families. We 
arrange programmes 
within the organisation 
which enhances 
employee belonging. 
 
Positive:  
Although the systems and 
processes require 
investments and costs in 
implementing and 
maintaining these 
programs, the direct result 
can be linked with 
increased employee 
loyalty and longer average 
service tenure. 
10 
Water and 
Waste 
Management 
 
 
Risk 
Water is a critical 
resource that’s also 
scarce. We ensure 
consistent and robust 
management and 
monitoring to conserve 
water as well as recycle 
as far as practicable.  
Still, we focus our efforts 
on recycling water as 
well as to meet the 
necessary standards for 
discharge.  
Negative: 
While our direct 
operations do not 
generate significant 
amounts of water or 
waste, nevertheless, there 
are some investment and 
cost to maintain the same. 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
Sr. 
No 
Material issue 
Identified 
Indicate 
whether risk 
or 
opportunity 
Rationale for identifying 
the risk/ 
opportunity 
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or 
mitigate 
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
Negative implications) 
11 
Diversity and 
Inclusion 
(D&I) 
 
Opportunity 
For a well-diversified and 
inclusive work culture, 
maintaining an open 
culture, free of any 
discrimination based on 
caste, creed, faith, or 
gender is important, 
which we do strive to 
maintain. 
 
NA 
Positive: 
D&I brings substantial 
value and impact on the 
culture of our 
organisation. 
12 
Respect for 
Human 
Rights 
 
Risk 
We are a large group 
and diversified 
organization spread over 
multiple geographies. We 
need to maintain the 
homogenous culture at 
all locations. 
We have a robust HR 
department, and we 
facilitate constant 
interactions with 
employees to maintain a 
conducive work 
environment across the 
entire organization. 
 
Positive: 
It requires marginal 
investment and cost but 
helps in maintaining an 
appropriate work 
environment.
