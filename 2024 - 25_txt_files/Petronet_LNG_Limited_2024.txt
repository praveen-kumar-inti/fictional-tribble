1
Raw Material 
Security
Opportunity
Petronet LNG Limited (PLL) considers raw 
material security a strategically important 
material as it directly influences its 
operational sustainability and contributes to 
national energy security and net zero goals. 
To ensure uninterrupted and cost-effective 
supply of LNG, PLL has secured long-term 
supply agreements with key global partners 
such as Qatar Energy (7.5 MMTPA), MARC 
Australia (1.425 MMTPA) and ExxonMobil 
(1.2 MMTPA).
A major milestone in this direction was 
the execution of a new long-term LNG Sale 
and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Qatar 
Energy in February 2024, for the supply of 
7.5 MMTPA of LNG over a 20-year period, 
starting from 2028. From a sustainability 
perspective, reliable access to raw material 
strengthens PLL’s role in supporting the 
Government of India’s objective to increase 
the share of natural gas in the country’s 
energy mix from 6% to 15% by 2030. This 
also aligns with India’s broader commitment 
to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. 
Thus, raw material security is not only a 
business enabler but also an opportunity to 
accelerate the transition to a cleaner and 
more sustainable energy system.
-
Positive: Crucial for the 
business sustainability 
and growth opportunity 
as a leading player in the 
industry
2
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Efficient water management offers a 
strategic opportunity for PLL to strengthen 
its sustainability efforts. In response to 
freshwater scarcity and environmental 
concerns, PLL has implemented innovative 
solutions such as utilizing condensate 
water generated from ambient air during 
the regasification process. This water is 
treated to potable standards to utilize in 
the terminal, which significantly reduces 
dependence on external water sources.
-
Positive: Initiatives taken 
for water management 
have a positive impact 
on business sustainability 
and the environment, 
as it reduces the 
dependence on external 
sources of water.

Besides, the condensate water is also 
being used for firefighting applications, as 
construction water in projects for hydro 
test and other activities, thus reducing the 
dependence on outside water resources. Apart 
from utilization of condensate water, rainwater 
harvesting also plays a vital role in minimizing 
the water procurement from external sources. 
These measures reinforce PLL’s commitment 
to conservation of resources, operational 
efficiency, and alignment with national 
sustainability objectives.
3
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
PLL’s business processes ensure the 
generation of a very small quantity of 
industrial wastes. The company views waste 
management not just as an environmental 
obligation but as a strategic opportunity. 
By implementing systems for waste 
minimization, segregation, and recycling, the 
company has reduced environmental impact 
and operational costs. Recovered materials 
are reused or disposed of through authorized 
recyclers, contributing to resource efficiency 
and circularity. These initiatives support PLL’s 
broader sustainability goals and reinforce 
its commitment to responsible business 
practices.
-
Positive: PLL continuously 
makes effort to minimize 
waste in its operations. 
PLL takes pride to be 
one of the cleanest 
industries.
4
GHG Emissions
Opportunity
LNG being the cleanest fossil fuel and 
globally acceptable as the transition fuel, 
PLL views reduction of GHG emissions 
as a strategic opportunity to improve 
environmental performance, support 
climate goals, ensure compliance, and 
create long-term value for its stake holders. 
Besides promoting the use of natural 
gas, PLL has implemented various energy 
efficiency measures, including shifting 
plant operations from in-house Gas Turbine 
Generator (GTG) power to lower emission 
grid power, thereby cutting emissions and 
reducing costs. The company continues to 
adapt with energy-efficient technologies 
and process improvements to minimize 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions and has set a target 
of achieving net zero goal by 2040. These 
efforts align with India’s climate targets, 
support access to green finance, and 
position PLL as a responsible player in the 
low-carbon transition.
-
Positive:
Shifting to grid power 
for 100% of the demand 
provides substantial 
savings in power costs. 
The average variable 
cost of grid power is 
`8.25/kWh, compared 
to approximately `16.4/
kWh for GTG power. This 
results in a reduction 
of nearly 50% in power 
costs, leading to 
significant optimization 
of OPEX.
Additionally, the 
reduction in gas 
consumption results in 
approximately a 16% 
decrease in the carbon 
footprint compared to 
GTG power.

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
PLL views energy management as a 
significant opportunity to drive both 
environmental sustainability and economic 
efficiency. In today’s context, optimizing 
energy usage is not only a responsible 
corporate practice but also a strategic 
enabler for long-term value creation.
       
At PLL, operational efficiency is a core 
focus area and forms an integral part of the 
company’s internal targets. To support this, 
PLL systematically records and monitors 
specific power consumption on a daily basis. 
Corrective actions are promptly initiated to 
ensure optimal energy utilization across its 
operations.
-
achieved substantial 
savings. Recent examples 
include replacing high 
energy consuming 
glycol water pumps 
with energy-efficient 
alternatives and installing 
Variable Frequency 
Drives (VFDs) to optimize 
the power usage of the 
chilled water system.
Also, both the terminals 
have increased solar 
power installed capacity 
and have plan in place 
to increase the capacity 
further.
6
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
A thriving human capital is critical to a 
company's consistent business growth 
and its ability to make positive impacts 
on society. Therefore, PLL endeavours to 
create a conducive work environment and 
offer ample opportunities for professional 
development to its employees.
-
Positive:
Providing a conducive 
workplace with growth 
opportunities allows 
individuals to feel valued 
and included, leading to 
increased engagement 
and motivation to 
perform at their best.
As a result of these 
initiatives, the attrition 
rate at PLL, for both 
employees and workers, 
is maintained at a 
reasonably low level 
(<3% in 2024-25).
7
Business ethics 
and accountability
Opportunity
Being a responsible corporate citizen, PLL 
believes that adhering to ethical business 
practices and being accountable for 
actions helps avoid legal, regulatory, and 
reputational risks. This can lead to cost 
savings, increased profitability, improved 
financial performance and generate an 
immense good will among its stakeholders.
-
Positive:
Ethical business practices 
and accountability 
can help in improving 
relations with 
stakeholders, including 
employees, investors, 
suppliers and customers, 
etc., which supports 
growth in business.
These healthy practices 
also enhance the broad 
image of the company.

Customer &

Opportunity
PLL acknowledges that feedback is 
crucial for any industry to thrive and 
grow. Therefore, the company values and 
appreciates feedback from its customers, 
and carries out this exercise on a regular 
basis at both its plants.
-
Positive:
Increased customer 
satisfaction results into 
healthier relations and 
greater customer loyalty, 
ultimately resulting in 
higher profitability and 
business growth.
9
Occupational 
Health & Safety 
(OHS)
Risk
Being in a hydrocarbon sector (though the 
cleanest) and considering the business 
processes, improper management of health 
and safety hazards can have adverse effects 
on both individuals and assets for PLL. 
The company accords great importance to 
health and safety in its operations.
PLL has a robust 
OHS system to 
address any 
occupational 
health & safety 
related risks.  
Negative:
Non adherence of OHS 
measures can result 
in loss of resources, 
penalties, legal 
action, damage to the 
company's reputation, 
and impediment to 
sustainable growth. 
However, the company 
has initiated various 
robust measures to take 
care of the OHS and well-
being of its employees 
and workers at the 
workplace.
Achieving 5-star ratings 
and Sword of Honor 
in its health, safety 
and wellbeing audits 
conducted by British 
Safety Council for two 
consecutive years, i.e. FY 
2022-23 and FY 2023-24, 
by both its terminals, 
is the testimony to the 
above.
10
Community 
engagement
Opportunity
PLL maintains strong ties with its community 
stakeholders, including disadvantaged and 
marginalized groups near its key operational 
sites. PLL views community engagement 
not as a risk, but as an opportunity to build 
trust, strengthen its social license to operate 
and support long-term business continuity.
-
Positive:
By fostering inclusive 
and cooperative 
relationships, PLL creates 
a peaceful environment 
that enables smooth 
operations and opens 
avenues for collaborative 
development and 
community goodwill.

Air quality
Risk
PLL believes that it is important for the 
company to implement measures to 
mitigate air quality risks such as investing 
in emission control technologies, reducing 
flaring and venting, improving vehicle and 
equipment efficiency and engaging local 
communities to address concerns related to 
air quality.
To mitigate 
associated risks, 
PLL has installed 
Continuous 
Ambient Air 
Quality Monitoring 
Systems 
(CAAQMS) within 
its premises. 
Additionally, 
Continuous 
Emission 
Monitoring 
Systems (CEMS) 
have been installed 
on gas turbine 
exhausts to ensure 
real-time tracking 
of emissions. This 
allows for prompt 
corrective action 
in case of any 
deviation from 
permissible limits. 
Additionally, 
even though the 
plants operate in 
a closed system, 
any released 
hydrocarbon 
molecules are 
routed through 
flare. 
Negative:
High GHG emissions or 
poor air quality

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
It is with great pleasure that I present Petronet LNG Ltd.’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for 
the fiscal year 2024-25, meticulously prepared in compliance with the latest guidelines from the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI). This report underscores our unwavering dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) principles, showcasing the milestones we have achieved while adeptly addressing the challenges of a dynamic 
industry. 
	
As a leader in the natural gas sector, the cleanest fossil fuel, Petronet LNG Ltd. has worked tirelessly to ensure affordable 
access to this vital resource across India’s diverse population. FY 2024-25 marked an exceptional year, characterized by 
unprecedented operational achievements. We recorded our highest-ever daily, monthly, and quarterly gas send-out 
volumes, achieved a record number of LNG truck fillings, and completed two LNG storage tanks in a record period of 
33 months. Additionally, we augmented the number of LNG truck filling bays at both our Dahej and Kochi terminals. 
A crowning achievement was receiving the prestigious “5-Star Rating” and “Sword of Honor” from the British Safety 
Council for the second consecutive year by both the terminals. Notably, Dahej and Kochi remain the only LNG terminals 
in India to earn these distinguished accolades, reflecting our steadfast commitment to the safety and well-being of our 
employees, contractual workers and surrounding communities. 
	
At Petronet LNG Ltd., we embrace our social and environmental responsibilities as integral to our operations, striving to 
conduct business in a sustainable and eco-conscious manner. To this end, we have developed a comprehensive roadmap 
to achieve net-zero for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2040. This strategy encompasses emissions reductions across 
our current operations, ongoing projects, and future initiatives as well. A prime example of our innovative approach is the 
pioneering integration of our Dahej LNG terminal with an upcoming petrochemical complex. By effectively harnessing 
the cold energy released during LNG vaporization (typically lost to the atmosphere), we plan to undertake the critical 
cryogenic cooling processes of the petrochemical plant. This initiative is expected to reduce power consumption by 
approximately 10-12 MW, significantly lowering Scope 2 emissions. 
	
Our commitment to societal well-being is further demonstrated through our robust Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) program, which touched the lives of over two lakh people in FY 2024-25. Our CSR efforts are focused on critical 
areas such as healthcare & education, women empowerment, inclusive growth, poverty alleviation, environmental 
preservation, wildlife conservation, etc., creating a meaningful and sustainable impact on communities and ecosystems 
alike. 
	
As we navigate the complexities of the energy sector, Petronet LNG Ltd. remains resolute in its mission to meet today’s 
energy demands while forging a sustainable and greener future. We are committed to building a legacy where energy 
solutions coexist harmoniously with environmental stewardship. I warmly invite your feedback and ideas to help us 
continue innovating and thriving together.

Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and is globally considered the transition 
fuel as the world aspires to achieve net zero goals. India has also set its target 
to achieve net zero by 2070 and also for enhancing the share of natural gas in 
the country’s energy basket present around 6% to 15% by 2030. Presently the 
demand for natural gas in the country is met to the extent of around 50% through 
domestic production and the rest is met through imports of LNG. As domestic 
production is likely to remain stagnant, the imports of LNG are expected to 
increase in the coming years. 
By investing in setting up greenfield infrastructure or augmenting the capacity of 
existing LNG import and re-gasification, PLL is playing a vital role in the process of 
clean energy transition. Some of the projects includes:
•	
Additional of LNG storage Tanks and regasification capacity in Dahej 
terminal.
•	
Construction of unique third jetty at Dahej terminal.
•	
Augmentation of LNG truck loading facility at Dahej and Kochi terminals.
•	
Setting up of new terminal in the east coast. 
Other clean energy projects that have been undertaken by the company include 
setting up solar power plants at Dahej and Kochi terminals.
Also, other initiatives are as follows: 
•	
CBG Plants: PLL is also in the process of setting up CBG plants at various 
locations across the country. 
•	
LNG Retailing: For introducing LNG as a cleaner alternative to conventional 
fossil fuels, 4 LNG dispensing stations are in final stage of commissioning, 
setting up of fifth station at Kochi is expected to commence soon. Further, 
10 more stations are being planned to be set up. 
2.	
a.  Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the procurement of input materials, equipment, tools, spares, and services is carried out in strict accordance with 
the Contract and Procurement Policy, which is consistently implemented across all locations with a focus on sustainable 
procurement practices. A well-defined Delegation of Authority framework guides the procurement process for both 
goods and services.
164
	
PLL’s core business involves the import of LNG at its regasification terminals located in Dahej (Gujarat) and Kochi (Kerala). 
As a result, approximately 95.22% of input material sourcing is inherently sustainable. Most LNG imports are managed 
under various long-term Sale and Purchase Agreements (SPAs), as details here under:
a) 	 7.5 MMTPA LNG SPA on a FOB basis with Qatar Energy (LNG imported from Qatar)
b) 	 1.425 MMTPA LNG SPA on a DES basis with MARC Australia (a subsidiary of ExxonMobil) with LNG imported 
primarily from Australia and Oman.
c) 	
1.2 MMTPA LNG SPA on a DES basis with Exxon Mobil Asia Pacific Pte. Limited (EMAPPL - a subsidiary of Exxon 
Mobil) which is likely to commence from FY 2026-27.
	
In addition to sourcing LNG through the Long-term SPAs, PLL also imports LNG spot cargoes on an as-needed basis to 
meet the requirements of its downstream customers. These spot purchases are made from international LNG suppliers 
and traders in accordance with the Policy and Process for Purchase of LNG on Spot/Short-term Basis, which has been 
duly approved by PLL’s Board of Directors.
	
The company also expects that its suppliers must adhere to relevant laws and ethical standards, as outlined in its 
Supplier Code of Conduct. Regular evaluations of supplier performance in terms of quality, cost, sustainability, reliability, 
and compliance with measurable goals are conducted regularly. For instances of non-compliance, corrective actions are 
taken, such as placing suppliers on a Holiday or Banning list, until they meet required standards, ensuring alignment 
with the organization's sustainable sourcing objectives.
	
b.	If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Approximately 95.22% of input material is sustainably sourced.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
PLL’s business process ensures generations of minimal hazardous waste. The company has a valid Consolidated Consent 
and Authorization (CC&A) for hazardous waste from State pollution control boards and mentioned conditions are strictly 
followed.
	
However, to ensure environmental responsibility and compliance, PLL has established robust procedures for the safe 
handling and disposal of all waste types generated at its sites. Hazardous wastes are systematically collected, stored and 
handed over to agencies authorized by the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) for recycling or safe disposal.
	
Detailed records of waste generation and disposal are maintained in compliance with regulatory requirements and are 
subject to periodic audits to ensure accountability and transparency. Recovered materials are reused or disposed of 
through authorized recyclers, contributing to resource efficiency and circularity. Also, there is regular monitoring by 
Board.
	
The detailed quantities of hazardous waste generated, and method of disposal are mentioned in Principle 6 of the 
report.

Actions Taken
Waste Management:
Hazardous waste generated on site is collected and stored in a 
designated area. Recovered materials are reused or disposed of 
through authorized recyclers, contributing to resource efficiency 
and circularity
Noise Pollution Management:
Noise is generated by various equipment during the process, 
such as pumps, cooling towers, compressors, etc. To mitigate high 
noise levels, the following measures were taken:
•	 Equipment design adheres to noise level regulations set forth 
by regulatory authorities.
•	 Acoustic barriers or shelters are necessary in noisy workplaces 
to mitigate noise levels.
•	 To minimize noise generated by equipment like pumps, hoods 
were installed.
•	 PPE such as earplugs and earmuffs is supplied to workers in 
high-noise-level areas.
•	 Regular monitoring of employee exposure in noisy areas is 
done to ensure compliance with OSHA requirements.
•	 Throughout the year in average day time, noise level never 
crossed 56 dBA which is far less than the permitted regulations.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
PLL’s business processes ensure the generation of a very small quantity of industrial waste. Following is the mechanism 
187
for different waste disposal methods at PLL:
1.	
Hazardous waste: Hazardous wastes generated in the terminal are stored in hazardous waste storage and disposed 
through GPCB/KSPCB approved agency by adhering applicable rules and regulations. Regular verification of 
the disposing agency is done by PLL. The utilization of hazardous chemicals within the terminal is kept to a 
minimum. The primary hazardous chemicals used are Liquid Nitrogen (Liq. N2), Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), soda 
ash, hypochlorite, High-Speed Diesel (HSD), and Mono Ethylene Glycol. It is important to note that no waste is 
produced during the handling of these chemicals. However, any hazardous waste generated from the handling of 
biocides, lubricating oil, and similar substances is disposed of in a manner that is both environmentally responsible 
and friendly.
•	
Non-Hazardous waste: Waste bins are provided across plant locations for collecting Biodegradable and Non-
Biodegradable wastes. Disposal of Non-hazardous wastes are part of the house keeping contract. A 130 KLD STP 
is installed and being operated for the treatment of sewages generated from plant admin building and canteen. 
Treated water from STP is being used for gardening.
•	
E-waste & Battery waste: Waste is being safely disposed to authorized recyclers. 
•	
Biomedical waste: Biomedical waste from the Occupational Health Centre (OHC) is incinerated by PCB accredited 
third party.
•	
Canteen waste: Canteen waste is internally recycled using food waste converters and transformed into manure 
through composting, which is then used in the kitchen garden.

LIMITED’S BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
To the Board of Directors of Petronet LNG Limited
We have undertaken to perform a reasonable assurance 
engagement, for Petronet LNG Limited (“PLL” or “the 
Company”) vide engagement letter dated May 25, 2025 in 
respect of the agreed Sustainability Information referred 
in “Identified Sustainability Information” paragraph below 
(the “Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance 
with the Criteria stated in “Criteria” paragraph below. The 
Identified Sustainability Information is as included in the 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (the “BRSR” or 
“the Report”) Section of the Annual Report of the Company 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 pursuant to 
the requirement of Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
(the “LODR Regulations”). This engagement was conducted 
by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners.
Identified Sustainability Information
The Identified Sustainability Information for the financial year 
ended March 31, 2025 is listed in the Appendix I to this report. 
The Reporting Boundary for BRSR is on a Standalone basis 
as disclosed under Question No. 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosures of the BRSR.
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to 
information pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 
2025 and we have not performed any procedures with respect 
to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR 
(other than those listed in Appendix I) and, therefore, do not 
express any conclusion thereon.
Criteria
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information is as under:
i)	
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;
ii)	
BRSR Reporting Requirements for listed entities per 
Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 
dated November 11, 2024 (the “SEBI Master Circular”);
iii)	 SEBI Press Release PR No.36/2024 dated December 18, 
2024;
iv)	 Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core as per 
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 
dated December 20, 2024; and
v)	
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD - PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42

Management’s Responsibilities
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or 
establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability 
Information, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in 
accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement 
of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations in preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) 
quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
complete scientific knowledge used to determine emission 
factors and the values needed to combine emissions of 
different gases.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we 
have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) 
and the SEBI Master Circular and its clarifications thereto and 
have the required competencies and experience to conduct 
this assurance engagement.
We apply Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “Quality 
Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and 
Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintains 
a comprehensive system of quality control including 
198
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on 
the procedures we have performed and evidence we have 
obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements 
(SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability 
Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(SAE) 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements (together “the Standards”), both issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (“the SRSB”) of the 
ICAI. These standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Identified Sustainability Information and included in the 
BRSR are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Criteria.
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or 
error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgement and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating 
the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting 
policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling 
with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures referred above, we:

the 
Identified 
Sustainability Information, related disclosures, the 
assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation 
and/or measurements of the Identified Sustainability 
Information;

of the design of the key systems, processes and controls

systems and controls.

•	
Assessed the level of adherence to the BRSR format 
issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI) followed by the Company in preparing the BRSR for 
detecting, on a test basis, any major anomalies between 
the information reported in the BRSR on performance 
with respect to agreed information and relevant source 
data/information.
•	
Tested the Company’s process for collating the 
sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling 
the sustainability information with the underlying 
records on a sample basis
