assist the complainant in filling out a Sexual Harassment Complaint Form, which will then be forwarded to the 
Grievance Redressal Committee for review.
	
Depending on the gravity of the situation, disciplinary action may include an apology, counselling, transfer, 
dismissal, demotion, or any other measures deemed appropriate by the management. The company takes 
prompt disciplinary action against any employee who engages in victimization or retaliation against someone 
who has reported a case of sexual harassment. This process reflects the company's commitment to maintaining 
a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.
