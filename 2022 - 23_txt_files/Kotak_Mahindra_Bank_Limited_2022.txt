Yes, we have implemented processes to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board. The details are mentioned below:

Every Director on the Board is required to make disclosure of his/her interest or concern in other entities (under Section 184 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 as also the parties to which such Director is related to (as under Section 2(76) of the Companies Act, 2013 and other laws applicable 
to us). Such disclosure is required to be made as and when a Director attends first Board Meeting after his/her appointment on the Board and 
thereafter at every first Board Meeting held in a financial year as well as within 30 days from any change in the disclosure previously given by 
such Director.
	
ii.	
Director, if interested or concerned in any transaction(s) or arrangement(s) to be entered into by the Bank, does not participate in the discussion 
and passing of the resolution thereon.
	
iii.	
We have also put in place necessary mechanisms and have formulated a Policy on Dealing with Related Party Transactions, keeping in view the 
requirements under Regulation 23 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and the provisions of the 
Companies Act, 2013. This Policy provides a framework to ensure proper identification, approval and reporting of Related Party Transactions. 
Such transactions would be appropriate only if they are in our and our members best interest.
	
iv.	
All transactions with Related Parties of the Bank are previously approved by the Audit Committee of the Bank. The Audit Committee also grants 
Omnibus Approval for Related Party Transactions of a recurring nature. Related Party Transactions, if not in the ordinary course or not at arm’s 
length, are placed before the Board (based on the Audit Committee’s recommendation) for its consideration and approval. If such transactions 
(which are placed before the Board of Directors) breach the threshold limits prescribed under Section 188 of the Companies Act, 2013 or if 
any transaction with a Related Party is material in nature as prescribed under Regulation 23 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, such transactions are also put up before the shareholders for their consideration and approval.
	
v.	
At the Audit Committee, only the Independent Directors who are members of the Audit Committee, consider and approve the transactions with 
related parties. At the Board, only those Directors who are not parties to the transaction(s) or arrangement(s) in subject or those who are not 
interested or concerned therein, participate to consider them. The interested Directors neither remain present nor do they vote on the resolution 
of Related Party Transaction. While seeking Shareholders’ approval, no Related Party of the Bank, whether party to a particular transaction or 
not, votes to approve such transaction.
	
vi.	
In terms of Regulation 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we do not extend any loans or advances on the security of our own shares, or 
commit to grant any loan or advance to or on behalf of our Directors, any firm in which a Director is interested as partner, manager, employee or 
guarantor, or any company or its subsidiary or holding company where Director of the Bank is a Director, Managing agent, manager, employee 
or guarantor or in which he holds substantial interest (as defined in Section 20 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949), or any individual in respect

improve environmental and social impacts. We are in the midst of a mindset shift and have moved in part from the physical world to the ‘phygital’ 
(physical enabled by digital) one. We are now leap frogging to ‘digical’( digital first supported by physical) and are evaluating AI enabled technologies. 
We have begun to proactively look for opportunities to direct our capital to finance assets that may have positive impact on the environment and 
communities.
2.	
a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
	
Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Code of Conduct covers aspects on Human Rights, Health and Safety, Operational Eco-efficiency, etc., and indicates 
applicability to the Bank’s vendors. Besides this, a focused Code of Conduct for service providers forms part of the service agreements with 
outsourced vendors.
	
b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
As a financial services organisation, our direct consumption of consumables and input materials is limited. We strive to improve energy 
efficiency, use cleaner sources of energy, and reduce paper consumption to a minimum. We expect our vendors to comply with our Code of 
Conduct for service providers which includes aspects on Human Rights, Health and Safety, Operational Eco-efficiency, etc. All Service contracts 
that were signed and renewed in FY 2022-23 include the Code of Conduct for service providers as an annexure.

Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such 
system?
	
	
Yes, we have instituted an occupational health and safety management system. We have implemented this system across six of our large 
corporate offices.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Our OHSMS manual serves as a comprehensive guide that outlines the governance framework and an action plan for conducting audits by 
the oversight team. It also provides guidelines on the reporting frequency and overall management of the system. The manual also clearly 
defines the scope and responsibilities of the teams tasked with overseeing the OHSMS. A monitoring plan has been established that takes into 
account factors including parameters measured, locations, scope and the methods used. The senior management is responsible for overseeing 
the evaluation of OHS performance and determining its effectiveness. In line with ISO 45000:2018 standard, a Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA)exercise is conducted where all the work-related hazards are identified and risks on a routine and non-routine basis are 
assessed, and along with these their mitigation measures are tabulated. The non-routine jobs are maintenance activities and extension of 
the premises etc. HIRA is reviewed annually and is revised, if required, in light of any incident. The updated documents are circulated to all our 
premises to ensure that the feedback gathered in the exercise serves as a preventive measure.
	
	
At the ISO 45001:2018 certified premises, we adopted an process that includes, but is not limited to, how the work is organised, social factors, 
leadership and organisational culture, activities and situations, past relevant incidents, potential emergency situations, actual and proposed 
changes irrespective of the level and nature and changes in knowledge of and information about hazards. The Occupational Health & Safety 
(OH&S) Management Representative (HMR) ensures that hazard identification is conducted by persons with competence in relevant hazard 
identification methodologies and techniques and appropriate knowledge of the work activity4. All jobs performed at our premises are supervised 
by the HMR. They ensure proper work permits are requested and granted prior to the job being undertaken, and also note and report work 
related hazards, if any. 'Toolbox talks' for routine and non-routine jobs are delivered to vendors undertaking work at our premises, as required 
which cover safety instructions and detailed processes to be followed to protect themselves from injuries or ill health and an OHSMS Hazard 
Identification Checklist is maintained. The methodology and criteria for the assessment of Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) risks are 
4     GRI 403-2
346
defined with respect to their scope, nature and timing to ensure they are proactive rather than reactive and are used in a systematic way. 
Employees are also encouraged to report any hazardous situations by either calling a designated helpline or writing to a location specific 
helpdesk to enable timely and appropriate action.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
	
	
Yes, we have processes in place for our employees to report on work-related hazards and enable them to remove themselves from such risks.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
	
	
Yes, we provide our employees with access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

We have adopted a holistic approach towards safeguarding the health and well-being of our employees. We launched the Annual Health Screening 
Policy for all our employees above 40 years of age or above certain employee grades. We have also tied up with some of the largest healthcare 
providers in the country to conduct various tests covered under this Policy. In FY 2022-23, many of our employees availed benefits under this 
Policy. We also facilitate various health and wellness programmes such as online yoga, meditation and Zumba sessions. We have also introduced 
doctor consultation, nutritionist consultation and emotional assistance programmes and discounts on pharmacy at select premises. Doctors and 
nutritionists were also available on call and in-house.
	
Our Emotional Assistance Programme (EAP) continued to support and guide our employees and their family members. In FY 2022-23, we saw
