Climate 
Change and 
Action
Risk
Risk: Climate change poses a 
significant material risk to IRCON, 
given the increasing frequency of 
extreme weather events, rising 
sea levels, and evolving regulatory 
landscapes. These 
factors 
can 
adversely 
impact 
infrastructure 
development, causing operational 
delays, project cost escalations, and 
potential asset damage. In addition, 
disruptions across the supply chain 
and construction timelines may 
affect project delivery and financial 
performance. Growing stakeholder 
expectations and the emphasis 
on long-term sustainability further 
necessitate proactive climate risk 
management.

Management
Risk/
Opportunity
Risk: IRCON acknowledges the 
material risks associated with water 
scarcity, the impacts of climate 
change on water availability, and 
the need to comply with evolving 
regulatory 
frameworks. 
These 
factors can lead to operational 
disruptions, cost escalations, and 
reputational risks, especially in 
water-stressed 
regions 
where 
infrastructure 
development 
is 
planned or underway.
Opportunity: 
Optimizing 
water 
use across operations presents a 
strategic opportunity for IRCON 
to 
reduce 
operational 
costs 
and reinforce its environmental 
responsibility. Proactive compliance 
with 
water-related

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
At IRCON International Limited, our unwavering focus remains on 
building infrastructure that is not only robust and future-ready, but 
also aligned with the highest standards of sustainable and ethical 
conduct. Guided by the National Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct (NGRBC) and aligned with global ESG frameworks, we 
strive to ensure that sustainability is embedded across all aspects of 
our business—from project planning and execution to stakeholder 
engagement and value creation.
Over the past year, we have made meaningful strides in improving 
our ESG performance. This includes strengthening our environment 
management systems, reinforcing workplace safety through ISO 
45001-aligned protocols, enhancing transparency in our operations, 
and advancing diversity and inclusion across the organization. We 
continue to prioritize energy efficiency, resource conservation, 
and responsible supply chain management while executing critical 
infrastructure projects nationally and globally.
We recognize the material risks posed by climate change, resource 
scarcity, and social inequities—and we are committed to addressing 
these proactively. At the same time, we view ESG integration not only 
as a compliance obligation but as a strategic opportunity to create 
lasting value for all stakeholders. Our growth journey is underpinned 
by strong governance, stakeholder trust, and a steadfast commitment 
to ethical leadership. By aligning our operational excellence with 
sustainability imperatives, IRCON aims to be a catalyst for inclusive 
and environmentally responsible development, contributing to a 
more resilient future for India and beyond.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes, IRCON has established and implemented an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management 
System in accordance with ISO 45001:2018, valid until 27.12.2027. The organization has identified and 
defined the necessary processes and their application across all functions, including determining the 
inputs and outputs for each process and developing an Inter-relation Matrix to illustrate their relationships. 
The sequence and interaction of these processes have been established, and appropriate criteria and 
methods-such as monitoring, measurement, and performance indicators-are utilized to ensure effective 
operation and control. Resources have been allocated, and roles and responsibilities have been clearly 
assigned. Risks and opportunities are systematically addressed, and processes are regularly evaluated 
and improved to achieve their intended outcomes. IRCON maintains documented information to support 
process operations and retains documentation to ensure adherence to planned processes in line with 
the ISO standards of ISO 45001:2018.
b.
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
IRCON employs a structured approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks for both routine 
and non-routine activities. This is achieved through the implementation of a well-defined Occupational 
Health & Safety (OH&S) Manual, which outlines systematic procedures for hazard identification and risk 
assessment. The core process involves Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), where hazards 
are regularly identified, evaluated, and prioritized based on their potential impact.
In addition, safety inspections are conducted at defined intervals to proactively detect and address 
hazards in the workplace. Comprehensive training programs are organized at project sites to ensure that 
all employees and contractors are aware of potential risks and safe work practices. Compliance with all 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements is strictly maintained and forms an integral part of the risk 
assessment process.
These processes are continuously monitored and improved to ensure their effectiveness, with all 
procedures and controls supported by the OH&S Management System, which is valid until 27.12.2027.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, such dedicated processes are present for workers. Following any incident or accident, the Person in 
Charge of Health and Safety (PH/SO) initiates an investigation in coordination with the subcontractor’s 
safety officer and other site staff to determine the causes and recommend corrective actions. The 
incident/accident report form is completed, and the PHSO identifies the necessary remedial steps. The 
Safety Officer then presents the findings to the Safety Committee and also shares the report during the 
Project Quality Council Meeting.
d.
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No) 
Yes, IRCON ensures that employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. 
The company offers a comprehensive range of benefits to both permanent and non-permanent staff, 
including reimbursement for outdoor and indoor medical treatments, approval for medical advances, 
ambulance charges, and complete health checkup benefits. Additionally, IRCON has established a 
medical trust to provide further assistance to employees in various situations

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
	
IRCON implements a comprehensive and structured approach to workplace health and safety by regularly 
identifying hazards, conducting risk assessments, and organizing safety drills for various scenarios. Stringent safety 
measures, including the enforcement of Safety related Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and comprehensive 
training programs, are in place at project sites to safeguard employees and workers. Scheduled medical checkups 
monitor employee health, while the company follows the Industrial Safety Hierarchy-prioritizing elimination, 
substitution, engineering controls, and administrative controls to systematically mitigate risks. Hazards are first 
eliminated or replaced with safer alternatives when possible; engineering and administrative controls are then 
applied, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided as needed. Through consistent application of these 
measures, IRCON fosters a strong culture of safety and responsibility, ensures regulatory compliance, and supports 
the long-term well-being of its workforce.

Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The process of identifying key stakeholder groups at IRCON begins with clearly defining the company’s purpose and role within 
the industry. Both internal and external stakeholders are then identified, considering their interests and concerns. Primarily 
engaged in the infrastructure sector, IRCON engages with a diverse range of stakeholders, including investors, shareholders, 
employees, workers, clients, employers, vendors, sub-contractors, consultants, the community, and end users of infrastructure. 
The selection of clients or employers is typically based on business interests, while vendors, sub-contractors, and consultants 
are chosen according to project requirements and contract terms. Responsibility for the end use of infrastructure usually lies 
with the client or employer, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
	
IRCON emphasizes building constructive relationships with all stakeholders through ongoing engagement, transparency, and 
accountability. By understanding and addressing stakeholder needs and concerns, IRCON is able to foster trust, enhance client 
satisfaction, collaborate effectively with government agencies, and generate value for both shareholders and other stakeholders, 
ultimately driving better project outcomes.
