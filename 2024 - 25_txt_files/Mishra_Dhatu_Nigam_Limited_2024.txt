1. 
GHG 
Emissions 
 R
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
primarily 
carbon 
dioxide 
and 
methane, are a major concern in 
alloy manufacturing due to fossil fuel 
combustion and industrial processes. 
Despite technological advancements 
that have lowered emissions per 
tonne of steel, the sector remains 
highly 
carbon-intensive. 
These 
emissions pose regulatory risks and 
increase operational costs, making 
environmental compliance a critical 
challenge for manufacturers. 
To address climate impact 
and 
regulatory 
risks, 
the 
company has adopted clean 
energy 
solutions 
including 
clean hydrogen, clean LPG, 
and solar power installations 
(4MW ground-mounted and 
60KWp rooftop), generating 
over 3.12 million kWh annually 
and cutting carbon emissions 
by 2,500 tons. These initiatives 
not only reduce greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
but 
also 
enhance 
operational 
efficiency and help mitigate 
financial exposure to rising 
fuel costs and emission-related 
regulations.
No 
negative 
impact reported 
in the FY 2024-
25 
2.
Energy 
Management
R
The business operations of the 
Company  is an energy-intensive 
process that relies heavily on fossil fuel 
combustion and electricity sourced 
from the grid, both of which contribute 
to significant direct and indirect 
emissions. 
The 
energy-intensive 
nature of the sector has notable 
implications for climate change, as the 
combustion of fossil fuels generates 
substantial Scope 1 emissions, while 
electricity consumption results in 
indirect Scope 2 emissions. Further 
energy costs form a significant part of 
operational expenses.
MIDHANI adopts a proactive 
approach to mitigate energy-
related risks and enhance 
sustainability by investing in 
renewable 
energy 
sources. 
The company has established 
ground-mounted and rooftop 
solar power plants, generating 
over 31 lakh kWh of energy and 
reducing its carbon footprint by 
2,500 tons. Further to reduce 
its power factor,  provided

Waste and 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management 
R
The 
handling 
and 
disposal 
of 
operational 
waste, 
particularly 
hazardous waste, pose significant 
environmental and health risks if 
not managed responsibly. Improper 
storage or disposal practices can 
result in land and water contamination, 
threatening 
ecosystems 
and 
communities.
The Company has implemented 
robust 
waste 
management 
systems in line with regulatory 
frameworks and environmental 
best practices, earning ISO 
14001:2015 
certification 
across its operations, including 
offices 
and 
manufacturing 
units. 
To 
mitigate 
risks 
associated 
with 
long-term 
waste disposal impacts, the 
Company proactively reduces 
waste, particularly hazardous 
streams, 
and 
focuses 
on

non-
hazardous by-products.

Supply Chain 
Management
R
Ensuring the timely procurement 
of raw materials like iron ore on 
favourable commercial terms from 
third-party suppliers is critical. Any 
delays or failure in this process 
could hinder the Company’s ability 
to meet the demand and impact 
overall operational efficiency. Further 
mineral extraction has significant 
environmental and social impacts.
To mitigate supply chain risks, 
the Company should diversify 
suppliers, maintain buffer stock, 
use real-time tracking, and 
establish strong partnerships. 
Regular supplier assessments, 
strategic sourcing agreements, 
and 
contingency 
planning 
further enhance supply chain 
resilience ensuring they avoid 
illegal 
or 
environmentally 
damaging activities and uphold 
social responsibility standards.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements:
	
The global shift towards sustainability has accelerated in the post-pandemic era, with businesses increasingly turning intent into 
action. MIDHANI, with over five decades of expertise in manufacturing alloys and special metals, has remained committed to 
responsible growth by ensuring efficient resource management and maintaining a minimal environmental footprint. Its focus on 
meeting strategic national requirements, rather than mass commercial production, underscores this approach.
	
Social responsibility has been integral to MIDHANI’s ethos, well before it became a statutory requirement under the Companies 
Act, 2013. The company’s CSR initiatives are centered on education, health, and wellness, with the aim of empowering and 
upskilling communities. Employees are actively encouraged to volunteer in CSR projects, strengthening engagement with local 
communities and fostering a deeper sense of purpose.
	
As a Government-owned enterprise, MIDHANI operates under strict oversight from institutions such as the Comptroller and

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited (MIDHANI) currently does not operate under a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism. However, 
the Company has established a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) to effectively manage and treat domestic wastewater generated 
from its premises. The maximum quantity of domestic wastewater generated is estimated at 90 m³/day.
	
The treated water from the STP is proposed to be reused for gardening and landscaping purposes, thereby promoting sustainable 
water management practices within the facility.
	
The wastewater treatment process is carried out in three stages -Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary treatment:
 
 
Primary Treatment: Involves screening and equalization to remove large particles and balance the wastewater 
characteristics.
 
 
Secondary Treatment: Comprises an aeration process followed by secondary clarification to biologically degrade 
organic matter.
 
 
Tertiary Treatment: Involves chemical oxidation to ensure further purification and compliance with prescribed 
discharge standards.
	
Through this structured treatment process, MIDHANI ensures that domestic wastewater is effectively managed and 
environmentally responsible practices are adopted, even in the absence of a ZLD system.

In line with statutory requirements, MIDHANI ensures that all categories of hazardous waste, such as pickling sludge, coolant 
oil, oil-soaked cotton waste, and similar by-products, are safely stored in designated areas within the central store until further 
treatment or disposal.
	
For safe disposal, hazardous wastes are handed over to M/s Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd., a certified third-party agency, with 
all movements duly documented through Manifest Form-10 in compliance with regulations. Bio-medical waste is responsibly 
32
Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited
disposed of through M/s Sattva Enviro Global Services, while E-waste and used batteries are auctioned only to authorized 
agents. Additionally, turnover data of hazardous waste is regularly submitted to the concerned regulatory authority in the 
prescribed Form-04 format under HWMR.
	
Our waste management practices are guided by the 3R strategy --Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle:
 
 
Reduce: Adoption of advanced waste-reduction technologies and improved inventory management techniques to minimize 
waste at source.
 
 
Reuse: Recirculation of coolant and quench oils within operations to extend their lifecycle.
 
 
Recycle: Remelting of metallic scrap in arc melting furnaces to produce primary ingots, thereby reducing dependency on 
virgin raw material.
	
In alignment with our Consent to Operate (CTO) targets, MIDHANI has also adopted structured methodologies to further 
reduce hazardous waste generation. For instance, metallic scrap is now increasingly utilized in arc melting operations, thereby 
lowering overall waste volumes. Furthermore, a new pickling waste treatment technology has been introduced, wherein the 
liquid discharge from pickling operations is treated with specific chemicals, enabling segregation into reusable water and solid 
pickling sludge.

certain categories of waste. Since waste-related disclosures form the 
basis for Scope 3 emission calculations, the absence of this methodology
