Ethical 
Behaviour 
Risk 
Adhering to ethical behaviour 
underscores the Bank's dedication 
to promoting ethical behaviour and 
maintaining integrity in all its 
dealings. By prioritizing ethical 
conduct, the Bank aims to not only 
retain its existing customer base 
but also attract new customers to 
the Bank. Upholding these values 
fosters 
trust, 
strengthens 
relationships and reinforces the 
Bank's reputation as a responsible 
and 
trustworthy 
financial 
institution. 
The Bank recognizes the critical 
importance of effective Corporate 
Governance for the safe and sound 
functioning of the Bank and lays 
emphasis 
on

Negative: Unethical behaviour could directly impact 
the reputation of the Bank. It could also lead to loss 
of morale and employee productivity thereby 
affecting the top-line growth. By upholding ethical 
standards and treating both customers and 
employees with integrity and respect, the bank 
cultivates 
a 
positive 
work 
environment 
and 
strengthens relationships with customer.

Systematic 
Risk 
Management 
Risk  
This ensures financial stability, 
regulatory 
compliance 
and 
protection 
of 
stakeholders. 
It 
facilitates 
business 
continuity, 
reputation management and long-
term sustainability by identifying, 
assessing, and mitigating potential 
risks effectively. These risks may 
stem 
from 
various 
sources, 
including Financial, Technological 
or Lending Risk. Such events or 
sequences of events possess the 
capacity 
to 
undermine 
or 
jeopardize the stability of the 
overall system.  
The Bank has set up appropriate 
risk 
management 
organization 
structure 
in 
the 
Bank. 
Risk 
Management Committee of the 
Board (RMCB), a sub-committee of 
Board, 
is 
Constituted 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
management 
of 
Credit 
Risk, 
Market Risk, Operational Risk and 
other risks in the Bank. The Bank 
has also constituted Internal Risk 
Management Committees namely 
Credit 
Risk 
Management 
Committee (CRMC) for managing 
Credit 
Risk, 
Asset 
Liability 
Management Committee (ALCO), 
Funds Committee for managing 
Market Risk, Operational Risk 
Management Committee (ORMC) 
and 
Product/Process 
Risk 
Mitigation Committee (PRMC) for 
managing Operational Risk, and 
Information Security Committee 
for 
managing 
Information 
Security. Risk Managers have been 
nominated at Regional Offices to 
oversee the Credit Risk of the 
respective Regional Offices. 
Negative: Failure to address any unmitigated risk 
with the potential to escalate into a systemic risk 
could have detrimental effects on the Bank's 
performance. Such risks pose a threat to the stability 
and integrity of the financial system, potentially 
leading 
to 
disruptions, 
financial 
losses 
and 
reputational damage.

Customer 
fairness 
and 
right-selling 
Risk 
Lack of customer-centric product 
offerings, value-added services or 
misconduct can erode trust and 
damage the Bank's reputation. 
This underscores the importance 
of aligning products and services 
with 
customer 
needs 
while 
upholding ethical standards to 
maintain trust and safeguard the 
Bank's image in the eyes of 
stakeholders. 
The Bank’s philosophy of ‘Fair 
Practices Code’ emphasises the 
need to deliver fair value to 
customers, 
including selling products and offer 
services which meet societal needs 
and 
are in the interest of customers.  
 
https://www.iob.in/uploads/CEDo

Negative: Mis-selling of products can harm Banks 
through reputational damage, legal consequences, 
financial losses, customer attrition, operational 
disruption, and employee morale issues.

their

and 
ensuring 
that they propel towards higher

Positive: 
A 
strong 
workforce 
with 
higher 
engagement, retention rate and diversity in the 
workforce brings new perspectives, experiences and

performance and enables a positive culture in the 
organization and highlights the Bank’s efforts toward 
creating a conducive work environment.

failure to comply with the industry 
laws and regulations. Failure to 
adhere to the laws would directly 
affect 
the 
bank's 
revenue, 
valuations and could lead to loss of

GHG Emissions 
Management 
Opportu
nity 
Assessing 
the 
environmental 
impact 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
own 
operations is a focus area. If these 
risks are not properly managed, 
they could negatively impact the 
operations and profitability. This 
also 
attracts 
scrutiny 
from 
stakeholders/investors 
and 
generates a public perception of 
the bank. 
The Bank intends to identify 
initiatives and develop a roadmap 
to 
reduce 
emissions 
in 
its 
operations. 
 
The 
Bank 
has also taken several initiatives 
for paperless banking like online 
account opening with video KYC, 
Electronic Bank Guarantee and 
national & cross border payment 
system with Bhim UPI. 
Positive: GHG emissions management allows Banks 
to mitigate risks, invest in low- carbon systems, 
fostering sustainability and market differentiation. 
10 
ESG Oversight 
Opportu
nity 
Having 
an 
efficacious 
ESG 
oversight on the board level will 
augment 
the 
overall 
ESG 
performance and reflect the Bank’s 
commitment 
to 
integrating 
responsible 
business 
practices 
within 
its 
growth 
model. 
Integrating ESG into the business 
practices 
would 
propel 
an 
enhanced 
risk 
management, 
governance, 
accountability 
reporting and decision-making. It 
would build the ability to identify 
and 
manage 
risks 
and 
opportunities 
related 
to 
environmental and social impact as 
well 
as 
build 
trust 
and 
transparency amongst investors 
and stakeholders. 
As we move into the future, ESG 
will be the cornerstone of our 
financial success. Board of 
Directors is the highest authority 
responsible 
for making decision on 
sustainability related issues. 
Positive: Leadership oversight on the ESG strategy, 
action plan, and performance fosters a positive 
impact on the environment and community. It also 
enables the bank to further embed robust monitoring 
mechanisms across ESG initiatives and business 
practices. As we move into the future, ESG will be 
the cornerstone of our financial success, competitive 
advantage and future accomplishments.

Our R&D efforts focus on process enhancement, including product digitization. Throughout the year, the Bank has undertaken significant initiatives to digitize 
customer offerings, enhancing transparency and accessibility to our products and services. Additionally, digitization has led to a decrease in paper-based processes, 
thereby reducing the Bank's carbon footprint. We have initiated the tracking of this data and plan to report it in the upcoming financial year.

a.  
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
The Bank being part of the service industry, consumption of resources is limited. The Bank puts efforts 
to ensure it purchases sustainable products from local suppliers and at a fair price. Some of the key 
initiatives the bank has taken in this direction are as follows: 
• The Bank considers energy efficiency standards while purchasing equipment. The star rated equipment 
such as air-conditioners, laptops, computers, lighting devices are considered as part of assessment 
criteria in all branches and offices. 
• Bank is also complying with DFS mandate of procurement through GeM portal for all items available 
on the portal.  
b. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably? 
As an institution providing financial services, the Bank’s operations are not material resource intensive. 
However, as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank has been focusing on maximising its resource 
consumption efficiency, reducing waste generation while focusing on improving its process efficiency 
and productivity. Even as digitization of products and services has been reducing the requirement of 
paper, it remains a significant resource consumed during the Bank’s normal course of business, and it 
has focused on reducing its paper consumption further by scaling up recycling, procuring paper from 
more sustainable sources, and rationalizing printing requirements internally within the business. For 
procurement of equipment that are required to run our banking operations, such as computer hardware, 
BRSR 2023-24 
Page 22 of 56 
 
lighting devices, air conditioners and DG sets, the Bank considers green procurement and ensures that 
energy efficiency standards are duly considered during the purchase of such equipment.
