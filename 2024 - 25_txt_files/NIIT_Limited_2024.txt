1
Climate Change 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity The emergence of virtual and hybrid 
working models due to climate change has 
emphasized the necessity for NIIT’s online 
training modules. As we navigate the shift 
towards virtual and hybrid work setups, 
climate change presents a signiﬁcant 
opportunity for our business.
Positive
2
Talent Attraction 
and Development
Opportunity As a talent development corporation, 
it is crucial for NIIT to prioritize the 
development of our own human capital. 
We have established a robust learning 
culture within the Company.
Additionally, we prioritize and consistently 
invest in cultivating a diverse group of 
leaders. Our company oﬀers executive 
development programs tailored to every 
level, including individual contributors, 
managers, and leaders.
We utilize technological solutions to 
enhance the employee experience. For 
instance, we have implemented Success 
Factors and employed N.AI.R.A an AI BOT 
for engagement surveys, and utilizing an 
online portal for wellness initiatives.

3
Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
Risk
There are several potential risks associated 
with cyber threats, including malware 
attacks, social engineering attacks, and 
software supply chain attacks. These risks 
pose a signiﬁcant threat to the Company 
as they can result in the theft of sensitive 
customer data. This not only jeopardizes 
data privacy but also poses a reputational 
risk to the Company.
NIIT implements various security 
measures such as Segregation 
of Duties (SOD), Multi-Factor 
Authentication 
(MFA), 
disk 
encryption, and USB disablement 
to safeguard against IT risks and 
maintain data privacy. Our robust 
cyber security and data privacy 
policy is designed to promptly 
address threats and eﬀectively 
manage data, mitigating any 
potential risks stemming from 
cyber security and data privacy 
concerns. 
The Company further obtained 
ISO27001:2022 
certiﬁcate 
for 
processes handling its corporate 
customer database.
Negative
4
Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk exists in the learning content practice 
as customers may opt to use Gen AI for 
content creation. However, customers may 
alternatively opt to invest in more eﬀective 
training at levels 2 and 3.
We have incorporated automation, bots, 
and RPAs into our Learning administration 
processes. AI won’t revolutionize our 
oﬀerings, it does enable us to introduce 
some new products.
The risk is low for Learning Delivery as 
instructors continue to oﬀer unique value 
towards building proﬁciency.
Our strategy for future is centered 
around a strong focus on highly 
AI-enabled solutions. We also 
plan to invest signiﬁcantly in FY26 
to strengthen our AI capabilities, 
for driving internal eﬃciencies 
and customer deliverables.
Positive
5
Employee Health 
and Safety
Opportunity Poor work environments and unsafe 
practices can deter employee retention 
and discourage workplace eﬃciency or 
productivity. Lost time injuries create loss 
of productivity and mental dissatisfaction 
of employees. The new normal of hybrid 
working, employee demands have shifted 
to mental and emotional wellness rather 
than only that of physical. 
Employee 
well-being 
has 
been 
an 
important focus area for NIIT. When COVID 
ﬁrst impacted us, we already had in place a 
wellness portal called Round Glass which 
was used for various health and wellness 
programs. We also had a panel of experts 
to take care of mental wellness. 
Our online wellness portal has more 
than 50% of employees participating 
in webinars on areas related to health 
and wellbeing. We also drive health 
and wellness initiatives through a tie up 
with external consultants, and provide 
free sponsorship of membership to our 
employees. We take continuous feedback 
from employees through engagement 
surveys and feedback to design and 
incorporate newer initiatives in the area of 
wellbeing.

6
Business Ethics 
and Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity Business ethics are cornerstones of 
ensuring 
transparent 
and 
sustainable 
corporate 
governance 
frameworks. 
Upholding policies such as code of 
conduct and anti-bribery & corruption and 
good-governance measures to eﬀectively 
implement 
stringent 
actions, 
among 
others tantamount to strong business 
ethics. When such business ethics are not 
complied with it often leads to signiﬁcant 
reputational damage.
NIIT to ensure implementation of these 
policies and compliance legal requirements, 
has implemented company-wide tool at 
GCMS (Global Compliance Management 
System) where each applicable provision 
of the laws is assigned to an individual 
which is second level conﬁrmation taken 
on its compliance. Policies such as 
whistleblower, related party transactions, 
etc. are strictly followed and reviewed 
independently by internal audit. 
Positive
7
Customer 
Concentration
Risk & 
Opportunity
The 
company 
functions 
in 
multiple 
sectors and is mostly focused on fortune 
1000 organizations.  The company sets 
into its customer training and upskilling 
in an integral manner, which results in 
fewer customers having a large share or 
contribution towards revenue. Usually, the 
customer maturity process is long-term for 
the business.
NIIT 
has 
grown 
to 
earn 
the 
trust 
of 
many 
Fortune 
1000companies. Trusted by the 
world’s leading companies, NIIT 
provides high-impact managed 
learning solutions that weave 
together the best of learning 
theory, technology, operations, 
and services to enable a thriving 
workforce.
The risk of failure of these 
customers is low and there is a 
steep entry barrier. More and 
more organizations are engaging 
professional training partners like 
NIIT for outsourcing. The India 
geography is seeing as extensive 
expansion of GCCs. Hence there 
are signiﬁcant opportunities in 
the market.
Positive
8
Supply chain 
Management
Opportunity Supply chain management aﬀects product 
and service quality, delivery, costs, customer 
experience and ultimately, proﬁtability. 
Increased supply chain disruptions at 
the wake of geopolitical transitions, and 
crises such as the pandemic result in loss 
of business continuity. Lack of inclusive 
supply chains creates vacuum at the time 
of crises. - A robust supply chain includes 
local sourcing, boosting local economies 
and disadvantaged communities.
 NIIT’S operation depends signiﬁcantly 
on value chain partner and it maintains a 
very wide base of such partners globally 
with ability to sources at very short interval 
to meet customer demands. The value 
proposition to its enterprise customers that 
the provides is the ability to meet certain 
surges of demand, thus not requiring 
customers to have any ﬁxed commitment.
The company maintains a wide 
base 
of 
freelancing 
trainers 
in 
various 
disciplines. 
The 
transparency and ease of doing 
business help the company to 
attract and retain its trainer pool. 
The company also invests equally 
in trainer upskilling and has 
implemented a robust feedback 
system from ultimate learners to 
maintain global standard quality 
of training.

topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
There are multiple sub committees of the board (CSR committee, risk management, audit committee, shareholder governance, 
nomination and remuneration committee), where the management provides updates on matters like environmental changes, 
environmental risk, and other topics having a signiﬁcant impact like people policy, etc. The respective business leadership team 
provides quarterly inputs on performance and yearly perspective planning for three years with budgets for the next year to the 
board members as per schedule. External professionals like statutory auditors, cost auditors, secretarial auditors, and other 
professional experts on matters like tax and M&A are regularly invited to submit their reports either to subcommittees or to the 
board directly. The NIIT Board conducts townhall meetings for its employees post the board’s quarterly meeting on declaration 
of ﬁnal results. Fire-side chats are also conducted for employees to voice their feedback directly to the NIIT Managing Director 
as well as CEO. There is robust customer feedback mechanisms for individual beneﬁciaries to customer leadership team. 
The voice of the customers are discussed at the board meetings and future product and marketing strategies are planned 
accordingly.

topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics
