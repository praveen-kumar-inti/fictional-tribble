To be a leading diversified corporate entity  
having market leadership with global presence 
in chosen business segments, consistently 
delivering value to all stakeholders,  
with environmental and social responsibility.
“The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav means elixir of energy of independence; elixir 
of inspirations of the warriors of freedom struggle; elixir of new ideas and pledges; 
and elixir of Aatmanirbharta. Therefore, this Mahotsav is a festival of awakening 
of the nation; festival of fulfilling the dream of good governance; and the festival 
of global peace and development. 
Like the history of the freedom movement, the journey of 75 years after 
independence is a reﬂection of the hard work, innovation, enterprise of ordinary 
Indians. Whether in the country or abroad, we Indians have proved ourselves 
with our hard work. We are proud of our Constitution. We are proud of our 
democratic traditions. The mother of democracy, India is still moving forward 
by strengthening democracy. India, rich in knowledge and science, is leaving its 
mark from Mars to the moon.”

CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Dear Esteemed Members,
I welcome you all at the 106th Annual General 
Meeting of your Company being held through 
VC / OAVM. On behalf of the Board of Directors 
of Balmer Lawrie, I thank you all for your trust 
and support as we continue to work through the 
challenges before us.
The Business Environment
The Indian economy appears to have moved 
forward after its encounter with the pandemic, 
staging a full recovery in Financial Year 2023 
ahead of many nations and positioning itself 
to ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path in 
Financial Year 2023. The Indian economy in 
Financial Year 2023 has nearly “recouped” what 
was lost, “renewed” what had paused, and “re-
energised” what had slowed during the pandemic.
With the containment of COVID-19 infections 
and the lifting of travel restrictions worldwide, 
the current Financial Year has shown a rebound, 
with both passenger and cargo movements 
being close to the pre-COVID-19 levels. The 
civil aviation sector in India has great potential 
owing to growing demand from the middle 
class, growth in population and tourism, higher 
disposable incomes, favourable demographics 
and greater penetration of aviation infrastructure. 
This is further supported by the Government 
through schemes such as UDAN, which has 
considerably enhanced regional connectivity 
through the opening of airports in India’s 
hinterland. The UDAN scheme focuses on the 
connectivity between the Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities 
in the country. Further, the Government has also 
accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for the setting up 
of 21 greenfield airports across the country. 
In logistics industry the thrust is to facilitate the 
last mile connectivity and also reduce travel time 
for people, further reducing the logistics cost 
and promoting export competitiveness. PM Gati 
Shakti and National Logistics Policy (NLP) has 
sectoral complementarity of logistics facilitation. 
The NLP was launched in September 2022. This 
has also helped the country move from unimodal 
to multimodal transportation. The multimodal 
connectivity will provide integrated and seamless 
connectivity for movement of people and goods 
from one mode of transport to another. 
At Balmer Lawrie, we believe strongly that there 
is no short cut to success. Business success can 
be achieved only through hard work and giving 
preference to customer satisfaction. As a result, 
the Company has continued to grow. With this 
background, let me move on to the performance 
of your Company during the Financial Year 2022-
23.

GREASES & LUBRICANTS [G&L]
Balmer Lawrie was the first grease manufacturer 
in India when it opened plants in Sewree (Mumbai) 
in 1934 and in Kolkata in 1937. Balmer Lawrie’s 
“Balmerol” greases are the leaders in the field 
with over 80 years of manufacturing experience. 
With the current R&D facilities clubbed with 
our infrastructure, the SBU has a very good 
opportunity to increase its market share and

has taken a lot of initiatives to tap the potential 
and increase volumes. Efforts are being made to 
revive the segment as it helps to improve capacity 
utilization.
CHEMICALS 
Leather processing consists of three stages. 
Beam house, Wet end and Finishing. SBU-

diversified service range, pan-India presence, 
technology-led customer service, knowledgeable 
resources will ensure that the SBU is able to grow 
in the face of significant crisis that was inflicted to 
the economy by the pandemic.
LOGISTICS SERVICES (LS)
The Indian logistics industry is growing due to the 
flourishing E-commerce market and technological 
advancement. The industry has progressed from 
a transportation and storage-focused activity to a 
specialised function that now encompasses end-
to-end product planning and management, value-
added services for last-mile delivery, predictive 
planning, and analytics, among other things.
One thing the global pandemic showed us was 
just how much could be ordered online. What 
once was used for impulse purchases or last 
minute purchases was suddenly relied upon for 
everything – the weekly shop, clothing, essential 
work items, all ordered online and all expected in 
a very short delivery window. This caused a huge 
spike in demand.
SBU-LS, for the second consecutive year 
achieved all-time record turnover. The growth 
was driven by incremental business in mainly Air 
Import, Ocean Import, Ocean Export and Express 
service.
SBU-LS was able to retain its major GOI and 
CPSU customers and was also able to sign 
some of the new activities from those contracted 
customers. SBU-LS has a well-defined plan and 
ambition to continue increasing its private sector 
business with a view to improve topline as the 
new sales team gains traction on a pan India 
basis. 
Major focus has been emphasized to enhance 
‘Customer Delight’ by providing one stop logistics 
solution aligning Logistics Services along with 
Infrastructure and 3PL services. SBU-LS has 
plans to enter the 3PL business and is exploring 
options to diversify in other areas of logistics 
to become an Integrated Logistics solutions 
provider. 
Technology being the backbone of customer 
satisfaction, SBU-LS is in the process of 
implementing new initiatives like online customer 
survey feedback and customized IT solutions 
for faster, dedicated, and focused time bound 
service and delivery.
COLD CHAIN SERVICES (CC)
India being an agro-based nation, one of the 
major challenges faced is huge losses of 
agricultural produce due to improper storage 
and not adhering to right temperature and 
proper infrastructure along with transportation 
at optimum temperature. This is where the Cold 
Chain Industry plays a vital role. The Government 
of India has come up with various initiatives in 
providing aids, schemes, concession on various 
duties and income tax benefits to the Cold Chain 
industry. Due to all these recent developments, 
there has been a huge demand of organized 
cold chain industry offering state-of-the-art 
Temperature Controlled Warehouses (TCWs) 
along with value added services like pre-cooling, 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
9
pre-conditioning, 
ripening, 
packaging, 
blast 
freezing etc. and primary and secondary logistics 
by Temperature Controlled Vehicles (TCV). 
The cold chain market is expected to grow at 
nearly 17% per annum on a sustained basis over 
the next 4 years. The major products include 
fruits and vegetables, meat and fish, dairy 
products, and healthcare products. SBU-CC has 
four cold chain units operating at Hyderabad, 
Rai (Haryana), Patalaganga (Maharashtra) and 
Bhubaneshwar (Odisha). To manage the end-to-
end supply chain of the Cold Chain operations, 
the SBU is also operating with 18 numbers of 4 
MT capacity of reefer vehicles on pan India basis. 
Storage business (TCW) had increased 32% in 
the sales YOY and transportation segment (TCV) 
has shown a nominal decrease in revenue, which 
is mainly due to lower volume in the COVID-19 
vaccine distribution business. However, the SBU 
has been able to rope in new customers from 
other segments to increase utilization of vehicles 
vis-à-vis an improvement in revenues which 
is expected to improve the revenue generation 
moving forward.
With the improvement in the asset utilization and 
the revenue, SBU-CC is expecting to increase its 
footprints across India by setting up of Mini Cold 
Storage facilities which will be executed at lower 
capex infusion and implementation lead time. 
TRAVEL
Over the past ten years, the aviation industry in 
India has experienced substantial expansion and 
change. With more people preferring to travel by 
air than ever before, India has grown to become 
the third-largest domestic market in the world, only 
behind the United States and China. In Financial 
Year 2021–2022, the COVID-19 pandemic 
significantly affected the civil aviation sector and 
imposed a financial burden on airlines, airports, 
and related services. However, domestic aviation 
traffic increased again as of Financial Year 2022-
23 and is predicted to reach 97% of pre-COVID 
levels.
The SBU has a lot of scope to grow because 
a company like Balmer Lawrie is typically seen 
of as one that serves in-person needs through 
travel desks and implants. The SBU has worked 
hard to improve our online presence by creating a 
new B2C website that places strong emphasis on 
vacations and other services on a single platform. 
To meet a variety of customer needs, domestic 
and international ticketing, hotel booking and 
ancillary services have been combined with an 
excellent search function.
The SBU has already developed a special 
website for employees of the Government of India 
to use for their official travel, and it wants to give 
major corporations a booking website tailored 
specifically to their needs. Together with our 
counter personnel, our digital offering establishes 
a local presence through partnerships, enabling 
us to provide consumers with a hybrid brick-
and-click solution. The Travel Industry is highly 
dependent on technology and with the increasing 
use of AI and Machine learning platforms, it is 
necessary for us to adapt to these technologies 
as soon as possible to keep our services at par 
with the market standards. 
VACATIONS
The start of the year has again shown tourism’s 
unique ability to bounce back. In many places, 
we are close to or even above pre-pandemic 
levels of arrivals. Tourism has continued to show 
its resilience. India’s tourism sector is showing 
signs of revival following the easing of COVID-19 
restrictions and the waning of the pandemic. It 
also noted that foreign tourist arrivals in India in 
Financial Year 2023 have been growing month-
on-month with the resumption of scheduled 
international flights.
India has seen an upsurge in medical tourism due 
to the various Government initiatives like Ayush 
visa for medical tourists, the launch of the National 
Strategy for Sustainable Tourism and Responsible 
Traveller Campaign, the introduction of the 
Swadeshi Darshan 2.0 scheme and Heal in India.
The Government initiatives like E-Visa, Swadesh 
Dekho etc. along with the G20 presidency have 
resulted in the rise of MICE activities and inbound 
travellers. The G20 presidency has provided a 
strong platform for India to promote its agenda of 
developing sustainable / green tourism practices.
With the change in tourism landscape, “Bleisure 
travel” is one of the concepts that is gaining 
popularity which has evolved as a radical 
concept among the business travellers combining 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
10
business and leisure travel. India now ranks 2nd in 
the world in terms of Bleisure travel. 
The Financial Year 2022-23 is a source of great 
pride for the Vacations vertical, which achieved 
its highest-ever gross topline of INR 129.91 crore 
along with bottom line of INR 77.13 Lakh. The 
efforts made to recoup the losses incurred over 
the past two years and return to profitability are 
notable. The aggregate business increased by 
more than 2.03 times compared to the previous 
fiscal year. 
REFINERY & OIL FIELD SERVICES [ROFS]
The SBU: Refinery & Oil Field Services is 
rendering service to all the refineries in India by 
recovering hydrocarbon from crude oil storage 
tanks and lagoons. It handles mechanized oily 
sludge processing where the sludge is being 
processed to recover oil and hydrocarbons. 
However, the market share has decreased 
significantly in recent years. The main threats 
visualized by SBU-ROFS relate to subdued 
market demand and the entry of new players in 
the niche market. Preference of MSME vendors 
also poses a significant challenge to the SBU 
with respect to booking of new orders. 
The demand for sludge processing services is 
expected to be stagnant in the near term. SBU-
ROFS aims to differentiate its offerings in the 
sludge processing space through technological 
upgradation 
and 
incorporation 
of 
new 
technologies for reducing processing times and 
manual intervention in sludge processing.
With a highly technical team with sound 
experience and maintaining stringent safety 
norms, this SBU is catering to all oil companies. 
SBU-ROFS continues to have the highest market 
share in the oily sludge processing segment 
in India. SBU-ROFS intends to leverage its 
experience in project execution and wide base 
of satisfied clientele to foray into allied service 
areas by diversifying its service offerings. SBU-
ROFS is working towards mitigation of the risks 
through upgradation of technology, as well as 
expansion and diversification of service offerings 
and client base.

Hub (MMLH) facility in Visakhapatnam. The 
MMLH comprises of an open yard storage facility, 
mechanised warehouse and a temperature-
controlled storage solution facility for mechanised 
materials handling and intermodal transfer 
between container terminals and break-bulk 
cargo terminals. The MMLH provides option for 
handling both bonded as well as non-bonded 
cargo coupled with offering of value-added 
services such as customs clearance, sorting, 
grading, aggregation, disaggregation and freight 
handling. It has a rail connectivity of 1.30 K.M. 
where 4 rakes can be handled in a day. The MMLH 
upon receipt of CFS license, has commenced its 
CFS operations from 2nd March, 2023. 
The mechanised warehouse facility of the JVC 
covering around 1,06,650 sq. ft. had witnessed 
an average capacity utilization of 92% during 
the FY 2022-23, as against utilization of 97% 
during the previous FY 2021-22. In anticipation 
of receiving CFS license, the EXIM portion of the 
warehouse had to be vacated in November 2022, 
which resulted in reduction of capacity utilization, 
which otherwise had witnessed 100% utilisation 
till November 2022. 
The JVC’s temperature-controlled warehouse 
facility is equipped with frozen & chilled chambers 
with a capacity of handling 3,780 pallets. During 
the FY 2022-23, this business had reached its 
maximum capacity utilization of 100%, as against 
utilization of 95% during the previous FY 2021-
22. 
The JVC during the year under review experienced 
challenges in achieving growth in the area of 
Open Yard and Rail Siding business, due to 
imposition of export duty on steel products which 
was effective from second quarter of the FY 2022-
23, ban on export of agricultural commodities and 
non-availability of rakes for the customers dealing 
in Aluminum products. These significant factors 
had adversely affected the capacity utilization of 
its Open Yard business, which had dropped from 
40% (FY 2021-22) to 24% in the FY 2022-23. The 
number of rakes handled also had reduced from 
123 Rakes (FY 2021-22) to 60 rakes in the  FY 
2022-23.    
During the FY 2022-23, the JVC was able to 
generate a total revenue of Rs.12.56 Crores 
as against Rs.14.05 Crores earned during 
the previous FY 2021-22. However, due to 
depreciation and interest on borrowings, the JVC 
ended up with a loss of Rs.10.54 Crores during 
the FY 2022-23.
The significant achievement of the JVC during the 
FY 2022-23, was the receipt of Container Freight 
Station (CFS) license on 27th January, 2023 and 
commencement of CFS operations on 2nd March, 
B~LawrieW>Co.Ltd. 
15
2023. With this license in place, the facility is 
now aligned with the Prime Minister’s Gati Shakti 
initiative, since the JVC is well equipped to offer 
an end-to-end Logistics Services with best-in-
class infrastructure. 
The JVC had already handled 74 TEUs of Export 
containers in the month of March 2023 and 
generated a revenue of Rs.12 Lakh. The JVC 
is expected to perform better in the current FY 
2023-24, since commercial agreements have 
been signed off with some of the major shipping 
lines.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the 
ongoing commitment of businesses to integrate 
social and environmental concerns into their 
operations. India holds the distinction of being 
the first country to enforce CSR activities and 
mandate the reporting of CSR initiatives under 
Balmer Lawrie 1> ra. Ltd. 
22
the Companies Act, 2013. This landmark 
legislation marks the beginning of a new era for 
CSR in India, bringing about significant changes 
that affect Company formation, administration, 
and governance. One notable addition is 
Section 135, which outlines the Corporate Social 
Responsibility obligations for companies listed 
in India. This section covers the requirements 
for executing, allocating funds, and reporting 
on successful project implementation. The main 
objective of this mandate is to invest in the socio-
economic, cultural, and environmental betterment 
of 
communities. 
Achieving 
comprehensive 
empowerment for disadvantaged communities 
necessitates sustainable approaches that align 
with shared community goals. CSR acts as a 
positive step towards promoting quality health, 
education, livelihood, care, and protection 
while 
ensuring 
environmental 
sustainability 
and ecological balance. Balmer Lawrie, as an 
organization, is deeply committed to conducting 
its business in a socially responsible manner 
and being responsive to the needs of society 
as a whole. Over the past few decades, the 
Company has consistently undertaken various 
CSR initiatives, driving sustainable development 
and growth for its stakeholders. Balmer Lawrie 
has 
independently 
spearheaded 
numerous 
projects across its units and establishments 
throughout the country, in addition to supporting 
government-initiated programs such as the Clean 
India Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission and Skill 
Development Institutes. CSR has now become 
an integral part of a Company’s functioning, and 
firms must demonstrate such responsibility.
Balmer Lawrie’s CSR initiatives are primarily 
driven by two flagship programs: the Balmer 
Lawrie Initiative for Self-Sustenance [BLISS] and 
Samaj Mein Balmer Lawrie [SAMBAL]. While 
the former program focuses on providing and 
improving long-term economic sustenance for the 
underprivileged, the latter aims to enhance living 
standards and quality of life for the population in 
and around the Company’s operational areas. 
To further its commitment to a sustainable 
society, Balmer Lawrie has implemented various 
innovative CSR programs. The Company has 
successfully delivered on its CSR commitments 
and continues to make progress for the 
betterment of communities. Recognizing the 
importance 
of 
national 
flagship 
programs 
launched by the government, Balmer Lawrie 
seeks partnerships with organizations that can 
identify community needs and effectively execute 
the Company’s CSR objectives. By engaging with 
impactful specialized organizations and adhering 
to guidelines such as the DPE guidelines, the 
Companies Act, 2013, and Schedule VII thereto. 
Balmer Lawrie takes pride in advancing initiatives 
falling under the purview of CSR.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
(Forming Part of the Board’s Report for 2022-23) 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 and 
Guidelines on Corporate Governance for Central 
Public Sector Enterprises, 2010 – issued by the 
Department of Public Enterprises, this report is 
made with an endeavour of the Board of Directors 
to:
(i) make an analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations of the Company;
(ii) provide an overview of each of environs 
in which different Strategic Business Units 
[SBUs] of the Company are performing;
(iii) analyze the underlying factors, which had 
acted upon or had impacted the performance 
of the Company during the Financial Year 
2022-23;
(iv) share the future outlook of the Company.
The Financial Year 2022-23 was filled with 
uncertainties. The global economies were barely 
recovering from the pandemic when the war in 
Ukraine broke out in February, 2022. The conflict 
has now continued for almost a year, disrupting 
the restoration of the supply chains that were 
badly affected earlier by lockdowns and limited 
trade traffic. The conflict caused the prices of 
critical commodities such as crude oil, natural 
gas, fertilisers, and wheat to soar.
The Indian economy, however, appears to have 
moved forward after its encounter with the 
pandemic, staging a full recovery in Financial 
Year 2022 ahead of many nations and positioning 
itself to ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path 
in Financial Year 2023. In the year Financial Year 
2023, so far India has reinforced the country’s 
belief in its economic resilience. The economy 
has withstood the challenge of mitigating external 
imbalances caused by the Russian-Ukraine 
conflict without losing growth momentum in the 
process. 
The Indian economy in Financial Year 2023 has 
nearly “recouped” what was lost, “renewed” what 
had paused, and “re-energised” what had slowed 
during the pandemic and since the conflict in 
Europe as well.
The Indian industry is on the cusp of a growth 
revival facilitated by public investment and 
policies that have eased business conditions 
and improved viability. Bank credit to industry 
has picked up momentum, particularly for 
micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). 
Among other things, the pandemic had caused 
a shift in the attitude towards supply chains from 
efficiency to security and from ‘just in time’ to ‘just 
in case’. Supply chains are being reconfigured. 
Lockdowns and mobility restrictions disrupted 
consumer behaviour and gave an impetus to 
online shopping. The E-commerce industry is 
focusing on local solutions to penetrate rural areas 
by strengthening the network of rural distributors 
and retailers and using local distribution centres 
as Pick Up and Drop Off points, enabling 
logistics companies to serve rural consumers. 
The Government senses a big opportunity 
here, and its investment into and commitment 
towards Production-Linked-Incentive Scheme 
demonstrates its determination to plug India into 
the global supply chains. It is an industrial policy 
with a global vision. 
PM Gati Shakti and National Logistics Policy 
(NLP) has sectoral complementarity of logistics 
facilitation. The NLP was launched in September, 
2022. The targets for achieving the vision of the 
NLP are to: 
(i) reduce the cost of logistics in India to be 
comparable with global benchmarks 2030; 
(ii) improve the Logistics Performance Index 
ranking and endeavour  to be among the top 
25 countries by 2030, and 
(iii) create a data driven decision support 
mechanism 
for 
an 
efficient 
logistics 
ecosystem.
All of these are expected to tighten the nuts 
and bolts for the arduous infrastructure journey. 
This has also helped the country move from 
unimodal to multimodal transportation. The 
Balmer Lawrie 1> ra. Ltd. 
40
multimodal connectivity will provide integrated 
and seamless connectivity for movement of 
people and goods from one mode of transport to 
another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity 
and also reduce travel time for people, further 
reducing the logistics cost and promoting export 
competitiveness.
Building upon it, the Government has also kept 
its focus towards developing the traditional 
infrastructure like roads, railways, airports, ports, 
mass transport and waterways. These play a 
vital role in national integration and regional 
development.
With the containment of COVID-19 infections and 
the lifting of travel restrictions worldwide, air travel 
has rebounded. While in Financial Year 2020-21, 
there was a considerable decline in the air-traffic 
(a decline of 54 per cent) as well as passenger 
traffic handled (a decline of 66 percent), Financial 
Year 2021-22 saw a recovery, mainly led by the 
domestic sector. The current Financial Year has 
further shown a rebound, with both passenger 
and cargo movements being close to the pre-
COVID-19 levels. The civil aviation sector in India 
has great potential owing to growing demand 
from the middle class, growth in population and 
tourism, higher disposable incomes, favourable 
demographics and greater penetration of aviation 
infrastructure. This is further supported by the 
Government through schemes such as UDAN, 
which has considerably enhanced regional 
connectivity through the opening of airports in 
India’s hinterland. The UDAN scheme focuses 
on the connectivity between the Tier-2 and 
Tier-3 cities in the country. Under this scheme, 
the Government has approved a budget of 
ൠ FURUH IRU UHYLYDO RI H[LVWLQJ XQVHUYHG
/ underserved airports / airstrips of the State 
Governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), 
Public Sector Undertakings and civil enclaves. 
Further, the Government has also accorded 
‘in-principle’ approval for the setting up of 21 
greenfield airports across the country. 
The eight core industries of coal, fertilisers, 
cement, steel, electricity, refinery products, crude 
oil and natural gas are critical in meeting the 
demand for inputs across industries. The growth 
in these industries has held steady, reflecting a 
broad momentum in industrial activity. However, 
the manufacturing landscape shows uneven 
growth across various categories. Production of 
coke and refined petroleum has also increased, 
fetching high returns in a global market where 
crude oil prices were higher than in Financial Year 
2022. Chemicals and chemical products such as 
caustic soda, soda ash, fertilisers and petroleum 
products have also performed well, contributing 
to sustaining the growth momentum in the 
agriculture sector while increasing exports. At the 
same time, a few product categories, including 
textiles, apparel and leather, have been showing 
tepid growth as export demand for these products 
has been mellowing with the slowing of global 
output and demand. Growth in pharmaceutical 
output has slowed due to an unfavourable base 
effect and the waning of the pandemic.
While 
India 
celebrated 
its 
75th 
year 
of 
Independence in 2022, it is befitting that during 
India’s Amrit Kaal, it assumed the Presidency of 
G-20 nations in December 2022. Global problems 
need global solutions, and global solutions require 
collaboration and cooperation. Based on the 
theme of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam: One Earth, 
One Family, One Future”, India’s G20 Presidency 
aims to achieve co-ordinated solutions to key 
issues of global concern. In short, the G20 
Presidency is an opportunity for India to bind an 
otherwise fragmented global order.
1. INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING [IP]
Industry Structure and Developments:
The Indian packaging industry is one of the largest 
sectors in India’s economy and its market potential 
is valued at INR 3,00,000 crores with the projected 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5 
to 6%. As far as packaging is concerned, there 
are many types of packing options depending 
upon the nature of the product and it is broadly 
classified into two main categories i.e., Industrial 
packaging and Consumer packaging and it is 
further sub segmented into Rigid and Flexible 
packaging. There are different types of material 
that are being used for packaging such as paper, 
glass, plastic, stainless steel and mild steel. 
Majorly plastic and steel are used as material of 
construction for industrial segments.
In Industrial packaging, the 210L Mild steel 
drum plays a vital role as it gives stability and 
ease of handling though the cost of packaging 
is comparatively a little higher than the other 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
41
packing materials. As the supply is more than the 
demand there are some challenges on pricing. 
There is fierce competition as there are more 
than 70 players pan India. 
Being a market leader in the 210 L mild steel 
drum industry, Balmer Lawrie enjoys a significant 
position with a handsome market share in most 
of the customer segments be it fruits, chemicals, 
lubricants, transformer oils or additives. With 
state-of-the-art 
manufacturing 
facilities 
and 
highly skilled technocrats, this Strategic Business 
Unit (SBU) manufactures all types of steel drums 
like conical, composite, open top, tight head, 
galvanized, tall, plain, lacquered and necked in.
There are six manufacturing facilities - pan India 
to cater to the needs of all the customers and for 
Eastern Region customers, their requirements 
are being taken care of with the toll blending 
business model. The new plant in Vadodara 
is picking up and it is under the process of 
stabilization. The Chittoor plant modernization 
project is in full swing, and it is getting ready to 
cater to the entire Southern Region. 
The kind of steel being used with specialized 
lacquers and customer specific paints enables 
Balmer Lawrie to manufacture superior quality 
products with high reliability in supplies in the 
modern manufacturing plants. It enjoys high 
brand value and a large and delighted customer 
base in India as well as in overseas export 
markets.
SBU-IP has been continuously focusing on 
quality upgradation, technological innovations, 
health, safety and environmental parameters, 
and most importantly on sustainability which 
helps in having an edge over competition. 
Balmer Lawrie retained silver rating from 
ECOVADIS, a global solution provider which 
partners 
with 
300+ 
leading 
multinational 
organizations to reduce risk across the supply 
chain and drive innovation in their sustainable 
procurements. 
Opportunities & Threats:
Opportunities:
 Introduction of new products thereby enhancing 
the product portfolio.
 Accessing new markets through Exports.
 Growing Chemicals market segment in India.
 Tapping new customer base in Gujarat through 
the new plant at Vadodara.
 Modernisation of the Chitoor plant in SR with

HDPE & Reconditioned drums).
 Competition from smaller players having 
locational advantage.
Segment-wise or product-wise performance:
The Industrial Packaging SBU has been 
showing consistent growth in volumes, turnover, 
profitability and profits. Due to poor fruit season 
and high volatility of steel prices, SBU-IP was 
able to close Financial Year  2022-23 with lesser 
volume / profits YOY. The reduction in volume 
is mainly due to a sharp drop in offtake from 
chemicals as well as from fruits segments.
Outlook:
With the on-going Ukraine war, the prices of steel 
had been volatile. However, with the Government 
taking major steps to tame inflation and levying 
15% duty on steel exports, the steel prices have 
started to stabilize in the country. Overall industry 
growth and market demand is expected at CAGR 
of about 6% in 2023-24. The GDP is expected to 
grow around 7%.
SBU-IP expects to continue its growth trajectory 
in 2023-24.SBU-IP anticipates significant growth 
in the coming years with the biggest drivers 
being Chemicals, Food, Transformer Oils and 
Lubes segment. SBU-IP also plans to expand 
aggressively in the Exports segment.
Risks and concerns:
Geo-political developments around the world 
for example the Ukraine war etc. may pose 
challenges as an external environment. 
Large number of unorganized players with low 
overheads, increasing presence of substitute 
products, low entry barriers etc. continue to pose 
area of concern  for the SBU-IP. 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd.

3. CHEMICALS 
Industry Structure and Developments:
In the current year the leather industry in India 
had partially recovered from the effect of slow 
down due to COVID-19. Thus, annual export of 
the leather industry from India increased by 8% 
over the last year to USD 5.30 Billion. 
India is the second largest producer of footwear 
and leather garments in the world. India is 
affluent with hide and skin as 20% of the world’s 
cattle population and 11% of goat and sheep are 
in our country. Almost the entire resource of hides 
and skins are getting converted into leather and 
leather products for export and domestic use. 
There is huge scope in the leather chemicals 
market and thus, SBU-Chemicals has its plan 
to tap the market with both existing and new 
products.
The annual leather production in India is around 
3 billion sq. ft which is 10% of the world leather 
production.
The leather industry is an employment intensive 
sector, providing jobs to about 4.5 million people, 
mostly from the weaker sections of the society. 
Women employment is predominant in leather 
products sector with about 30% share.
Leather processing consists of three stages. 
Beam house, Wet end and Finishing. SBU-
Chemicals with its strong presence in Wet end 
particularly in synthetic Fatliquors, has started 
catering in the other two stages to its customers. 
In terms of market potential in India, the Southern 
Region holds 44%, East is 23% and North is 33%. 
Each region is manufacturing different products 
for example safety gloves in East, footwear and 
leather articles in South, and upholstery and 
garments in North.
With a complete product basket in hand, SBU-
Chemicals is focusing on the Southern Region 
where market potential is higher and registered a 
sales growth of 24% over last year in this region.
Leather is a fashion driven industry. Based on 
the current trends and fashion, new products 
are being introduced without affecting the cost 
of production of leather. Technical services and 
commercial viability are the important factors of 
this business. 
SBU-Chemicals participated in Manufacturing 
Excellence Audit conducted by IRIM (International 
Research Institute of Manufacturing) and was 
awarded Gold for two years consecutively.
SBU-Chemicals is also focusing on synergy 
businesses like Textile Chemicals and Agro 
Chemicals. Some of the products are launched 
and this will enhance the business performance 
of SBU-Chemicals.
Opportunities and Threats: 
Opportunities:
SBU-Chemicals has enough opportunities to 
grow in other segments like Finishing, Chrome 
tanning and Beam house. SBU-Chemicals 
has introduced new chemicals in Beam house 
segments like Wetting agents. SBU-Chemicals 
also launched a new range of Finishing chemicals 
with modern manufacturing facility.
SBU-Chemicals has well equipped ‘Technical 
Service Centers’ in all the major leather 
manufacturing clusters in India and renders high 
quality technical service to the Tanneries. SBU-
Chemicals developed eco-friendly, metal free 
tanning process with Glutaraldehyde which has 
become popular now in the market. 
With a well-known brand image, strong technical 
service team and with an enhanced product 
basket, SBU-Chemicals  has many opportunities 
to improve the business in coming years. 
Apart from the leather chemical business, SBU-
Chemicals  has forayed into other synergy 
chemicals such as textile chemicals and 
intermediate for agro chemicals business.
Threats:

Major part of Leather Industry is unorganized 
and comes under MSME.
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd.


Limited scope for mobilizing funds through 
private placement and public issue as most of 
them are family businesses.

Stricter 
and 
changing 
international 
environmental 
norms 
require 
regular 
upgradation, 
investment 
and 
newer 
infrastructure. 

High competition from MNCs and Italian 
companies. 

Lack of presence of any Indian brand in world 
leather fashion market.
Segment-wise or product-wise performance:
In spite of low demand of leather / leather products 
/ footwear due to COVID-19 and the global 
economic meltdown, SBU-Chemicals has been 
able to reach 97% of previous year’s volume and 
has clocked 11% higher turnover by capturing the 
market of Imported Fatliquors. SBU-Chemicals is 
able to realize better price compared to previous 
years.
Outlook:
Path forward as envisaged in SBU-Chemicals is 
as follows:

Improving the sales volume through existing 
dealers and increase the distribution channel 
by appointing new dealers in all three regions.

Focusing more on new product lines like 
Finishing chemicals, High end Fatliquor, 
Beam house chemicals.

Entering into other synergy businesses.

Focusing on export markets like China, East 
Africa, Korea and Bangladesh.
Risks and concern:
Increasing usage of non-leather products, and 
very strict environmental norms, which may lead 
to small manufacturers closing down operations 
for adherence issues.
Internal control systems and their adequacy:
SBU-Chemicals uses SAP to have control on 
raw materials and overheads. The manufacturing 
unit at Manali, Chennai is certified for Integrated 
Management 
System 
comprising 
of 
ISO 
9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 
of M/s. International Certification Services Private 
Limited, Mumbai.
SBU-Chemicals is a registered Member of 
Leather Working Group, UK (LWG). 
We are also one of the ZDSC Level 3 leather 
chemical companies in India.
Discussion on financial performance with 
respect to operational Performance:
Leather articles are fashion items, niche and 
very high value compared to Synthetic materials. 
Worldwide there was less demand of leather 
articles on account of the post COVID-19 global 
financial turmoil and this affected the Indian 
leather 
industry. 
SBU-Chemicals 
managed 
to turnaround and make profit through OPEX 
initiatives, process improvements, and proactive 
sales and marketing activities.  
Material developments in Human Resources/
Industrial Relations front, including number 
of people employed:
Training & development programs by internal and 
external faculties are continuously organised to 
improve the skill of employees . SBU-Chemicals 
maintained 
cordial 
relations 
with 
all 
the 
stakeholders of the industry. The Technical Service 
Centres of Balmer Lawrie are run by experienced 
and knowledgeable Leather Technologists who 
are also facilitators of environmental awareness 
among various stakeholders.  They train 
young college students and industry personnel 
about modern environmentally friendly leather 
processes.
4. LOGISTICS
LOGISTICS INFRASTRUCTURE (LI) 
Industry Structure & Development: 
The Indian logistics industry is continuously 
evolving at an exceptional pace providing 
necessary impetus to boost international trade 
through great advancements in infrastructural 
development and technology to foster its 
growth. There is continued focus on the part of 
the Government to convert India into a global 
manufacturing hub by boosting infrastructure and 
introduction of the National Logistics Policy (NLP) 
and Prime Minister’s Gati Shakti Programme are 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
46
some of the few major initiatives in that direction. 
The growth in E-commerce industry is also driving 
the need for setting up premium infrastructure 
facilities backed with effective technological 
support in India. 
India’s Logistics market is valued at US$ 250 
billion in 2021, with the market predicted to 
increase to an astounding US$ 380 billion by 
2025, at a healthy 10-12% year-on-year growth 
rate. Moreover, the Government is planning to 
reduce the logistics and supply chain cost in 
India from 13-14% to 10% of the GDP as per 
industry 
standards. 
Awarding 
infrastructure 
status has made it easier for investment inflows 
and this has become a major growth driver of the 
logistics industry.  The Indian Government plays 
an important role in supporting the ports sector. 
It has allowed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of 
up to 100% under the automatic route for port, 
harbour construction and maintenance projects. 
The Logistics Infrastructure business comprises 
of three main segments viz., Container Freight 
Stations (CFS) typically set up in the vicinity of 
ports, and Warehousing & Distribution (W&D). 
Besides this, SBU-LI  has also developed and is 
operating a Multi Modal Logistics Hub (a JV with 
Visakhapatnam Port Authority) in Visakhapatnam. 
CFSs are an extended arm of the port set up 
primarily with a view to decongest ports. All 
the activities related to clearance of goods for 
home use, warehousing, temporary admissions, 
re-export, temporary storage for onward transit 
and outright export, transhipment etc. are car-
ried out in a CFS. Presently, the Company has 
three state-of-the art CFSs located at Nhava 
Sheva-Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. During 
Financial Year  2022-23, container handling at 
top 12 ports in India went up by 1% which is on 
a lower side compared to last year’s growth of 
16% that was majorly attributed to the recovery 
of the EXIM business after the COVID-19 impact 
in Financial Year  2020-21. The total container 
throughput in India during Financial Year  2022-
23 was around 12.93 million TEUs while it was 
12.76 million TEUs in Financial Year  2021-22. In-
cidentally, the three ports where Balmer Lawrie is 
interested in, accounts for nearly 59% of the total 
container traffic handled in Indian ports. During 
the Financial Year  2022-23, the import volumes 
in the three ports of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust 
(JNPT), Kolkata and Chennai increased by 5% 
but the volumes moved to CFS from port in these 
three cities went down by 18% during Financial 
Year  2022-23 as compared to the earlier year. 
The increase in CFS volumes is due to drop in 
volumes of Inland Container Depot (ICD) and 
increase in nominations of Direct Port Delivery 
(DPD) - CFS category volumes. The industry wit-
nessed the implementation of technology driven 
policies to clear the containers or cargo at fast 
pace so as to facilitate “ease of doing business” 
for the importers and exporters. DPD especial-
ly at Nhava Sheva was started during the fourth 
quarter of Financial Year  2016-17 and the mea-
sures taken to streamline its effective implemen-
tation resulted in significant reduction of volume 
available for CFS and approximately 70% of im-
port volumes at JNPT has been cleared through 
DPD route. 
The India warehouse market reached a value 
of INR 1,113 billion in 2021. Looking forward, 
IMARC group expects the market to reach INR 
2,069.6 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR 
of 11.9% during 2022-2027. The usage of 
the warehousing system in India has gained 
significant prominence over the past few years. It 
also involves managing warehouse infrastructure 
and processes that involves the handling and 
storage of cargo in an efficient manner. The 
warehousing, industrial, and logistics (WIL) 
sectors are projected to be crucial for attaining 
India’s vision of being a US$ 5 trillion economy 
by Financial Year 2025. The warehouse and 
logistics industry has benefited the most from 
the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing its share 
from 2% in 2020 to 20% in 2021. Because of the 
growing shift from discretionary to essential 
internet buying during the pandemic, the 
E-commerce industry became more appealing 
and attractive.
The Indian warehousing industry gathered 
more impetus and prominence especially during 
the last 4-5 years with notable triggers being 
the implementation of Goods and Service Tax 
(GST) in the year 2017 and grant of recent 
infrastructure status to Logistics industry. This 
paved way for reorganization of supply chain 
wherein the focus was more on improving the 
efficiency of supply chain and not merely on 
achieving tax savings. Resultantly, fragmented 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
47
small warehouses are being replaced with large 
fulfillment centers in major key markets. The 
growth in Indian warehouse industry is led by 
various factors, prominent amongst them are 
initiatives of Government like Make-In-India in 
facilitating the manufacturing at the local level, the 
implementation of GST, growth of e-commerce, 
digitisation, Government thrust on economy 
moving to cashless state, growing domestic 
consumption, favourable increase in international 
trade and growth in private and foreign investments 
in infrastructure.  At present, warehousing 
in India is mostly concentrated in tier-I cities, 
such as Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, 
Delhi-NCR, Ahmedabad, Pune and Hyderabad. 
However, with the rising demand for e-commerce 
activities and doorstep delivery services in the 
tier-II and tier-III cities, the warehousing sector 
in India is expected to grow potentially in the 
coming year. The Company’s Warehousing 
and Distribution facilities are presently fully 
operational at Kolkata and Coimbatore locations. 
CFS - Kolkata added 43000 sq. ft area of 
warehouse in addition to the existing 37000 sq. 
ft, CFS - Chennai added 5000 sq. ft of bonded 
warehouse for handling Hazardous Cargo and 
added 20000 sq. ft warehouse space during 
Financial Year 2022-23 to increase focus on 
Warehousing activities. 
Opportunities & Threats: 
In India, there is huge opportunity to tap the market 
in containerized segment. India’s containerization 
level still stands at 60% whereas in most of the 
developed countries it is in the range of 70-
75%. Strong growth supported by Government 
reforms, transportation sector development plans, 
growing retail sales and the E-commerce sector 
are likely to be the key drivers of the logistics 
industry in India in the coming years.. Online 
freight platforms and aggregators have been 
on the rise in the Indian logistics market, given 
the need for low entry barriers and less capital 
investment compared to setting up of an asset-
based business model. Manufacturing in India 
holds the potential to contribute up to 25-30% of 
the GDP by 2025 which will drive the growth of 
the warehousing segment in India. E-commerce 
is another major segment which is expected to 
support growth of the logistics industry during 
the forecast period. The Sagarmala programme, 
the INR 9.2 trillion investment proposals of 
the Government of India entailing setting up 
of new mega ports, modernization of India’s 
existing ports, development of 14 Coastal 
Economic Zones (CEZs) and Coastal Economic 
Units, enhancement of port connectivity via 
road, rail, multi-modal logistics parks, pipelines 
& waterways and promote coastal community 
development, all point to a very positive direction 
for the Logistics Infrastructure business. Besides 
these, there are ports where number of CFS 
operators are quite less. It can also be noted 
that the growth of traffic at non-major ports has 
been increasing significantly year on year. With 
the implementation of GST and the increase in 
volume of containers getting cleared through 
DPD, the handling of Less than Container Load 
(LCL) consolidators’ cargo and venturing into 
Warehouse and its affiliated activities like offering 
value added services in addition to the CFS 
services like last mile transportation, packaging, 
labelling, and distribution would be opportunities 
in the long term. In October 2021, Prime Minister 
launched PM Gati Shakti - National Master Plan 
for Multi-modal connectivity, essentially a digital 
platform to bring 16 Ministries including Railways 
and Roadways together for integrated planning 
and coordinated implementation of infrastructure 
connectivity projects. In October 2022, the 
Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved 
the development of a container terminal at Tuna-
Tekra, Deendayal Port, Gujarat the terminal will 
be built on a Build, Operate & Transfer (BOT) 
basis under Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) 
mode.  In August 2022, Minister of Road Transport 
and Highways, Minister of Ports, Shipping & 
Waterways and Ayush, and Minister of State for 
Road Transport & Highways, signed a tripartite 
agreement for swift development of modern Multi 
Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP) under Bharatmala 
Pariyojna across the country.  
As part of the Sagarmala project, more than 574 
projects worth Rs. 6 lakh crore (US$ 82 billion) 
have been planned for implementation between 
2015 and 2035. In Maritime India Summit 2021, 
the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways 
identified a total of 400 projects worth Rs.2.25 lakh 
crore (US$ 31 billion) investment potential. The 
multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated 
and seamless connectivity for movement of 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
48
people, goods and services from one mode of 
transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile 
connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce 
travel time for people. 
SBU-LI won “Best Warehouse of the Year” and 
“Logistics Visionary Team of the Year” under the 
Warehouse & Logistics Leadership Category as 
part of Warehouse & Supply Chain Leadership 
Awards 2022. CFS - Mumbai and CFS - Chennai 
under LI received awards in the category of 
“Managing Risk and Risk Assessment at Work” 
and “Best Health and well being Programme” 
in the 6th Annual Health, Safety, Environment, 
Strategy Summit Awards 2023 conducted by 
Inventicon Business Intelligence Pvt. Ltd. 
The shipping lines and ports are going for 
a backward integration in order to offer the 
customised logistics solutions to their customers. 
The decrease in the dwell times of the containers 
at the CFS is affecting the bottom line of the 
organisation. The competition in the industry is 
forcing the players to follow suit so as to retain the 
volume. In recent years, though the DPD concept 
has been partially diluted by moving the containers 
to CFS as part of DPD / CFS facility by the 
importers / forwarders and Custom House Agent 
(CHA)s. This has led to the increase of bargaining 
power for forwarders / importers / CHAs to move 
the containers to CFS of their choice by getting 
the best rates with maximum free days possible in 
the market. With the increased DPD and various 
Customs-initiated reforms like Risk Management 
Systems, (RMS), almost all the CFSs remain 
largely 
underutilized. They 
are 
currently 
functioning at around 40%  of their functional 
capacity. Another reason for the losing business 
is the introduction of RMS by the Customs, which 
has taken away 60%  of the non-DPD business. 
Under the RMS regime, as much as 60% of the 
shipments do not need Customs clearance.
Outlook: 
With DPD taking off in India in a big way towards 
reduction in logistics costs, CFS operators in the 
country face a grim future. However, Logistics 
Infrastructure SBU of Balmer Lawrie is able to 
bring together a unique set of value proposition 
for its customers. SBU-LI is expecting the CFSs 
to be the major contributor to the bottom line. 
SBU-LI is in the process of establishing  long 
term contracts with major Shipping Lines which 
will garner steady business. All the CFSs are 
in the course of having long-term association 
with major Import houses (DPD clients) which 
will ensure steady business.  SBU- LI is also 
conducting feasibility studies for opening ICDSs, 
Warehouses in various potential locations and 
expecting finalization of projects in  due course. 
Within the asset-centric business, the SBU is able 
to offer a basket of solutions: Container Freight 
Stations, Ambient Warehouses, and a Multimodal 
Logistics Hub (through Vishakhapatnam Port 
Logistics Park Limited). The comprehensive 
services – offered across pan-India locations 
make SBU-LI a partner of choice to Importers, 
Exporters, 
Shipping 
Lines, 
CHAs, 
Freight 
Forwarders and the trade. So, while there is a 
wide variety of hurdles for the industry and SBU-
LI, it is expected that a combination of diversified 
service range, pan-India presence, technology-
led customer intimacy, knowledgeable resources 
– will ensure that the SBU is able to grow in the 
face of significant crisis that was inflicted to the 
economy by the pandemic.
The warehousing and logistics industry in India 
is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector that is 
expected to play an increasingly important role in 
the country’s economy. Despite some challenges, 
the sector is well-positioned for long-term growth 
and presents exciting opportunities for investors 
and businesses. With the Government’s focus 
on improving infrastructure and the rise of 
E-commerce, the sector is expected to be a key 
driver of economic growth in the country. Moreover, 
with the increasing adoption of technology and 
the Government’s push for a digital economy, 
there is also significant potential for logistics 
players to leverage data analytics, artificial 
intelligence, and machine learning to improve 
operational efficiency and enhance customer 
experience. There are also opportunities for 
foreign investment as international companies 
look to tap into India’s growing logistics market. 
The Government has made it easier for foreign 
companies to invest in the sector by allowing 
100% foreign direct investment in logistics parks 
and warehouses.
Risks & Concerns:  
The CFS industry is undergoing dynamic process 
changes with various policies of the Government 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
49
such as DPD, Online DO and face assessment 
making the industry more competitive. The shift 
to DPD at ports like JNPT has resulted in the Rs 
4,500 crore CFS industry in an existential crisis. 
In the last five years, the industry has grown at 
6-8% annually. JNPT, which alone accounts for 
over 40% of the container handling in the country, 
witnessed a substantial growth in the DPD 
volume. More efficient and technology driven 
port operations are enabling reduced dwell time. 
In view of the stiff competition, CFSs are not able 
to pass on the increase in costs to the customers. 
Overall there is a substantial reduction in earning 
per TEU for most of the CFS operators. Challenges 
faced by the SBU are being addressed through 
appropriate management intervention, employee 
involvement and improved processes.
Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy: 
SBU-LI through its Operation package i-Comet 
has built in high degree of control with checks 
and balances to conduct its operations effectively 
and efficiently.  Financial records are however 
maintained in SAP. The process for advancement 
in technology has also been initiated in the form 
of developing a new software which would 
further improve the efficiency and productivity 
as a whole. There are also periodic internal and 
external audits conducted for the SBU. SBU-
LI, like all other SBUs of the Company has a 
very robust Performance Budgetary control 
system whereby actual performance is weighed 
against the Business Plan developed before the 
commencement of the year. All the three units 
of SBU-LI are certified under ISO 9001:2015, 
ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018 and AEO-
LO certification. Additionally, CFS - Mumbai is 
certified with ISO 28000:2007, CT-PAT and CFS-
Chennai is certified with ISO 28000:2007.
Discussion on Financial Performance with 
respect to physical/operational performance 
of SBU: 
During Financial Year 2022-23, SBU-LI was able 
to achieve 32% growth in terms of imports, and 
7% growth in terms of exports and the turnover 
increased by 18% compared to the previous year.
However, due to cut throat pricing and competition 
from the industry and reduction in dwell times of 
containers at CFS, the profit reduced by 15% in 
comparison to last year. 
Material development in Human Resources 
/ Industrial Relations: including number of 
people employed:
Industrial relations in all the units of CFS, WD, 
AMTZ and MMLH remained cordial all throughout 
the year.  As on 31st March 2023, SBU-LI had a 
total of 95 employees. 
LOGISTICS SERVICES (LS)
Industry structure and developments:
The Indian logistics industry is growing, due 
to the flourishing E-commerce market and 
technological advancement. The logistics sector 
in India is predicted to account for 13-14% of 
the GDP. The industry has progressed from a 
transportation and storage-focused activity to a 
specialised function that now encompasses end-
to-end product planning and management, value-
added services for last-mile delivery, predictive 
planning, and analytics, among other things. One 
of the key drivers of this expansion is projected 
to be the rise of India’s logistics industry, which 
employs 22 million people and serves as the 
backbone for various businesses. The logistics 
sector in India was valued at US$ 250 billion in 
2021, with the market predicted to increase to an 
astounding US$ 380 billion by 2025, at a healthy 
10-12% year-on-year growth rate.
India witnessed one of the major milestones in 
logistics in 2022 with the release of National 
Logistics Policy which aimed at reducing the 
logistics cost from 13-14% to 9-10% and 
increasing the efficiency. The logistics industry 
is observing a paradigm shift from a fragmented 
and unorganised market to a seamless and under 
one roof solution due to various initiatives taken 
by the Industry and Government like PM Gati 
Shakti, Atmanirbhar Bharat / Make in India, PLIB 
schemes, dedicated freight corridors, National 
rail plan, Sagarmala, growth of airports, and 
unified logistics platform. The changing dynamics 
of logistics have shown that technology plays a 
pivotal role and Government initiatives like EXIM 
digitization, fast tags, E-Way bill, ULIP etc. have 
contributed towards the growth of technology in 
the logistics segment as a whole. 
The industry is crucial for the efficient movement 
of products and services across the nation and in 
the global markets. The logistics business is highly 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
50
fragmented and has over 1,000 active participants, 
including major local players, worldwide industry 
leaders, the express division of the Government 
postal service, and rising start-ups that focus 
on E-commerce delivery. The industry includes 
transportation, warehousing, and value-added 
services like packaging, labelling, and inventory 
management. With the advent of technology-
driven 
solutions 
such 
as 
Transportation 
Management Systems (TMS) and Warehouse 
Management Systems (WMS), India’s logistics 
industry has witnessed tremendous development 
in recent years. These solutions have assisted 
logistics firms in increasing operational efficiency, 
lowering costs, and improving customer service.
Opportunities and Threats:
The Indian logistics market presents several op-
portunities, including:
Growing E-commerce Industry: The rapid 
growth of the E-commerce industry in India is 
driving demand for logistics services, providing a 
significant opportunity for companies to expand 
their operations.
Government Initiatives: The Indian Government 
has launched several initiatives aimed at 
improving the country’s logistics infrastructure 
and reducing the cost of logistics, providing a 
significant opportunity for companies in the sector.
Rising Demand for Cold Chain Logistics: With 
the increasing demand for perishable goods 
and pharmaceutical products, the demand for 
cold chain logistics services is also on the rise, 
presenting a significant opportunity for companies 
in this segment.
Expansion of the Manufacturing Sector: The 
expansion of the manufacturing sector in India is 
driving demand for logistics services, providing a 
significant opportunity for companies to expand 
their operations.
Increase in Foreign Investment: The increasing 
foreign investment in the Indian economy is 
expected to drive demand for logistics services, 
providing a significant opportunity for companies 
in the sector.
Adoption of Technology: The adoption of 
technology and automation in the logistics sector 
is expected to improve efficiency and reduce 
costs, presenting a significant opportunity for 
companies to invest in these areas.
Threats:
Availability of quality human resource pool has 
been a challenge in the logistics industry. The 
manufacturing and logistics industries employ 
almost 4 million people. According to research 
3PL (Third Party Logistics) providers listed their 
top challenges as finding, retaining and training 
staff.
Increase 
in 
customer 
expectations 
and 
serviceability - one thing the global pandemic 
showed us was just how much could be ordered 
online. What once was used for impulse 
purchases or last minute birthday presents was 
suddenly relied upon for everything – the weekly 
shop, clothing, essential work items, all ordered 
online, and all expected in a very short delivery 
window.
This caused a perfect storm – a huge spike in 
demand just as labour shortages started to bite.
The Russia-Ukraine war led to an increase 
in prices of several commodities including 
fertilizers, food products,  oil and gas. The supply 
chain disruptions have increased freight charges, 
created container shortages, and lowered the 
availability of warehousing space. Several 
ports have been closed and orders are being 
pulled back because of delays in shipments and 
congestion.
The rise in natural gas prices by around 120-
130% in the 6 months since the start of the war, 
have had its cascading effect on rise in cost of 
living index in EU and consumption pattern. 
Segment–wise or product-wise performance:
SBU-LS, for the second consecutive year 
achieved all-time record turnover. SBU-LS during 
the year achieved a turnover of Rs.550 crores and 
registered topline growth of around 20% whereas 
growth in bottom line is 22% as compared 
to previous year. The growth was driven by 
incremental business in mainly Air Import, Ocean 
Import, Ocean Export and Express service.
Discussion on financial performance with 
respect to operational performance:
During the year SBU-LS witnessed significant 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
51
growth in top line as well as in bottom line despite 
pressure on margins on account of competitive 
forces. Reduced volatility in freight rates has 
helped bottom line movement in line with growth 
in topline. The increase is primarily on account of 
the following:

139% growth in Express service mainly on 
account of project logistics movements. 

55% growth in Ocean Import. Ocean 
movement for NPCIL was major contributor.

Growth in Air Import was 7% and CHA activity 
grew by 25% over 2021-22.
Outlook:
The Russia–Ukraine situation continues to weigh 
on the global economy, disrupting supply chains 
and adding to inflationary pressures. Sanctions 
have led to the suspension of virtually all trade 
links between Russia and the West including 
rail freight services between China and Central 
and Western Europe. Owing to the global trade 
war and China’s authoritarian policies, there is a 
gradual shift of business from China, and India 
is emerging as a land of opportunities backed by 
abundant supply of resources, cheap manpower, 
geographical 
advantage 
and 
Government 
reforms on FDI etc.
SBU-LS was able to retain its major GOI and 
CPSU customers and was also able to sign 
some of the new activities from those contracted 
customers. The SBU is now focusing on private 
business especially in the Air Export segment 
of perishables by tying up with APEDA and also 
eyeing the project cargo business of private 
customers.
SBU-LS has a well-defined plan and ambition to 
continue increasing its private sector business 
with a view to improve topline as the new sales 
team gains traction on a pan India basis. The 
combination of experienced and knowledgeable 
manpower as well as fresh talent in the sales 
team will enable the SBU to adapt to the changes 
faster. SBU-LS has focused on strengthening 
its Marketing wing through proactive brand 
positioning and enhancement in different forums 
and digital platforms to drive exponential growth. 
Major focus has been emphasized to enhance 
‘Customer Delight’ by providing one stop logistics 
solution aligning Logistics Services along with 
Infrastructure and 3PL services. SBU-LS has 
plans to enter the 3PL business and is exploring 
options to diversify in other areas of logistics 
to become an Integrated Logistics solutions 
provider. 
Technology being the backbone of customer 
satisfaction, SBU-LS is in the process of 
implementing new initiatives like online customer 
survey feedback and customized IT solutions 
for faster, dedicated, and focused time bound 
service and delivery.
SBU-LS has been continuously working closely 
with its worldwide Agents & Associates. In 
some cases, SBU-LS enjoys exclusivity with 
some Associates and is working closely with 
other players to nurture a similar relationship to 
gain reciprocating business. SBU-LS has also 
increased the number of Associates in different 
countries like China, Vietnam and Turkey to be 
more competitive in handling Ocean volumes.
SBU-LS continues to be an active member of 
different Industry associations like ACAAI, FFFAI, 
WCA, WSA, JCTRANS, AMTOI, CII Logistics 
Forum, Bengal Chambers Shipping Committee 
to name a few.
Risks and concerns:
SBU-LS works in a highly competitive market, 
facing aggressive price competition majorly from 
multinationals and big local forwarders. Revenue 
generation avenues in the hands of logistics 
operators is getting squeezed due to the highly 
competitive and customized services offered, 
while input cost in terms of freight as charged by 
carriers too is showing a declining trend which 
remains a matter of concern in the current fiscal. 
This trend is likely to continue till the first half 
of the year due to demand / supply imbalance. 
Big competitors are increasing their strength by 
mergers and acquisitions with a view to grab 
incremental market share. The global trade war 
between China-US has influenced the Maritime 
and Logistics platform, which also has affected 
our buying rates.
Major shipments are getting converted to CIF 
from FOB which is ultimately affecting our top 
line as well as some of our contracted customers 
are moving towards buying on CIF / DAP 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
52
INCOTERMS instead of FOB. The industry as 
a whole is providing a one stop solution to their 
customers and is also making investments in 
technology, infrastructure and training to bring in 
synergy with increasing demand from customers 
on service levels. Capacity reduction for carriers, 
blank sailing and unavailability of PAX / Cargo 
Airlines will increase input cost of services till the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic stays.
SBU-LS is taking adequate steps to mitigate the 
challenges through its established and growing 
global associate network and offering our clients 
single window logistics solutions under one roof. 
Added focus is given on growing the Air Console 
business as India’s Air Freight Market is estimated 
to be USD 13.08 billion in 2023 and is expected 
to reach USD 17.22 billion by 2028, growing at a 
CAGR of 5.65%.
India has achieved a remarkable milestone in 
defence exports in Financial Year  2022-23. The 
exports have reached an all-time high of approx. 
Rs 16,000 crore, almost Rs.3,000 crore more 
than the previous financial year. It is a rise of over 
10 times since 2016-17. We are actively engaged 
as logistics partners with different private sectors 
/ PSU’s active in defence exports. SBU-LS has 
revamped its existing technology and has plans 
to further upgrade it to meet future business 
challenges.
Internal control systems and their adequacy:
SBU-LS has in place an effective Internal Control 
Mechanism and during the year under review, a 
fairly large number of Internal Audits were carried 
out in all branches and the findings were found to 
be satisfactory. All the branches of the SBU-LS 
are ISO accredited and such accreditations were 
valid in Financial Year  2022-23.
Material developments in Human Resources 
/ Industrial Relations front, including number 
of people employed:
Industrial relations continued to be cordial at all 
units while the SBU-LS operated with optimum 
level of manpower across the units. SBU-LS had 
a total of 116 employees as on 31st March 2023.
5. COLD CHAIN SERVICES(CC)
Industry structure and developments:
India being an agro-based nation, one of the 
major challenges faced is huge losses of 
agricultural produce due to improper storage 
and not adhering to right temperature and 
proper infrastructure along with transportation 
at optimum temperature. All India Cold-chain 
Infrastructure Capacity carried out by NABARD 
Consultancy Service (NABCONS) assessed 
requirement of 350 lakh MT capacity of cold 
storage for perishable fruits and vegetables. 
Currently, there is 374.25 lakh MT capacity of 
cold storages in the country. Estimated annual 
value of losses of agri produce currently stands 
at Rs. 92,651 crores. Adequate and efficient cold 
chain infrastructure from farm gate to consumers 
is required to arrest the high losses in supply 
chain of perishables.
The Government of India has come up with various 
initiatives in providing aids, schemes, concession 
on various duties and income tax benefits to 
the Cold Chain industry. Due to all these recent 
developments, there has been a huge demand 
of organized cold chain industry offering state-
of-the-art Temperature Controlled Warehouses 
(TCWs) along with value added services like pre-
cooling, pre-conditioning, ripening, packaging, 
blast freezing etc. and primary and secondary 
logistics by Temperature Controlled Vehicles 
(TCV). The market has benefitted significantly 
from the stringent regulations governing the 
production and supply of temperature-sensitive 
products. The industry is poised for unprecedented 
growth over the forecast period on account of 
growing organized retail sectors in the emerging 
economies. Moreover, rising automation in 
refrigerated warehouses is projected to boost the 
demand further. India over the years witnessed 
a marked increase in production of perishable 
high nutrition products like fruits, vegetables, 
meat and poultry products etc. but development 
of cold-chain infrastructure was not strategically 
directed, for safe handling and to convey these 
perishable products to markets. The inadequacy 
of 
scientific 
farm-to-market 
logistics 
also 
contributed to high food losses in the case of 
perishable foods, further adding to inflationary 
pressures. To reduce post-harvest loss of fruits 
and vegetables several schemes were launched 
by different Ministries of GOI. 
The cold chain market is expected to grow at 
nearly 17% per annum on a sustained basis over 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
53
the next 4 years. The major products include 
fruits and vegetables, meat and fish, dairy 
products, and healthcare products. SBU-CC has 
four cold chain units operating at Hyderabad, 
Rai (Haryana), Patalaganga (Maharashtra) and 
Bhubaneshwar (Odisha). To manage the end-to-
end supply chain of the Cold Chain operations, 
the SBU is also operating with 18 numbers of 4 
MT capacity of reefer vehicles on pan India basis. 
Opportunities and Threats:
For the past several decades, the Indian 
cold storage infrastructure has struggled with 
challenges related to the fragmented nature of the 
segment, the disruption in demand and supply, 
the lack of skilled manpower, among many other 
factors. The gap presents a significant opportunity 
for stakeholders associated with the industry. The 
increase in the number of segment of products 
opens multiple opportunities to Company in 
segments like Quick Serve Restaurants (QSR), 
Pharmaceutical etc. Increased demand in the 
real time temperature monitoring of products in 
the entire supply chain is opening multiple doors 
to temperature-controlled vehicle as well. 
Since the organized Cold Chain segment is 
highly capex intensive, the capacity utilization 
along with the right pricing model plays an 
important role in ensuring the profitability of 
the business. With organized players gradually 
entering this market segment, a high price war for 
ensuring capacity utilization resulting in reduction 
of average selling price may pose as a threat 
to this industry. However, service excellence, 
maintaining high quality standards, value added 
service offerings and seamless distribution of 
products shall overrule the price war and help in 
customer retention.  
Segment–wise or product-wise performance:
Storage business (TCW) had increased 32% in 
the sales YOY and transportation segment (TCV) 
has shown a nominal decrease in revenue, which 
is mainly due to lower volume in the COVID-19 
vaccine distribution business. However, the SBU 
has been able to rope in new customers from 
other segments to increase utilization of vehicles 
vis-à-vis an improvement in revenues which 
is expected to improve the revenue generation 
moving forward.
Outlook:
With the improvement in the asset utilization and 
the revenue, SBU-CC is expecting to increase 
it footprints across India by setting up of Mini 
Cold Storage facilities which will be executed at 
lower capex infusion and implementation lead 
time. SBU-CC also proposes to venture into the 
Asset Light Model of operations wherein facilities 
including vehicles will be hired from the market 
and deployed for its customers. This will enable 
SBU-CC to increase its turnover and profitability.
Risks and concerns :
Storage rental is the main source of revenue 
for SBU-CC and seasonality has an important 
influence on storage volumes. This leads to 
reduced capacity utilization when it is looked at 
an annual basis. The industry is attracting new 
players and existing players are also augmenting 
capacity leading to more competition and that is 
putting pressure on pricing power of SBU-CC. 
Attrition of junior officers and scarcity of trained 
manpower may lead to service quality impact and 
that is also a concern for SBU-CC.   
Internal control systems and their adequacy: 
SBU-CC is using the software Warehouse 
Management System (WMS) as control in the 
inventory. Regular checks are also being done 
with the customer to ensure stock accuracy. 
Financial records are maintained in SAP. There 
are periodic internal and external audits conducted 
for SBU-CC. The cold storage operation has 
been automated by SCADA software which is 
used to monitor and control as per the customer’s 
requirement. 
Discussion on financial performance with 
respect to operational performance:
Increase in the asset utilization YOY had 
supported SBU-CC to uplift the revenue by 20% 
over last year. Storage business (TCW) has seen 
an increase in occupancy level by 24% over last 
year. 
Material developments in Human Resources 
/ Industrial Relations front, including number 
of people employed:
SBU-CC was formed in July, 2021 which 
was initially a part of Logistics Infrastructure. 
Functions of SBU-CC have been centralized 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
54
at the SBU’s headquarter in Mumbai. Industry 
experts have been recruited to enhance the skill 
and efficiency of SBU-CC. The marketing team 
has been reinforced after capability assessment 
process and ensuring the right person in the right 
role. As on 31st March 2023, SBU-CC has total 
manpower strength of 29 people.  
6. TRAVEL & VACATIONS 
TRAVEL
Industry Structure & Development:
Over the past ten years, the aviation industry in 
India has experienced substantial expansion and 
change. Early in the new millennium, only a select 
few wealthy people in India had access to the 
luxury of air travel. With more people preferring to 
travel by air than ever before, India has grown to 
become the third-largest domestic market in the 
world, only behind the United States and China. 
In Financial Year 2021–2022, the COVID-19 
pandemic significantly affected the civil aviation 
sector and imposed a financial burden on airlines, 
airports, and related services. However, domestic 
aviation traffic increased again as of Financial 
Year 2022-23 and is predicted to reach 97% of 
pre-COVID levels.
According to the Directorate General of Civil 
Aviation (DGCA), the nation’s aviation overseers 
reported that domestic air passenger traffic 
increased annually by 42.88% between January 
and April 2023 compared to the same period last 
year, when there were 3.52 crore passengers.
Nearly 5.03 crore passengers were transported 
by India’s domestic airlines during that time, 
demonstrating 
a 
high 
demand 
for 
travel 
throughout the nation. The domestic aviation 
business has continued to thrive, as seen by the 
22.20% monthly passenger growth in April, 2023 
over March, 2023. (Source ET-Travelworld.com).
The rise in air traffic is a positive development for 
the aviation industry, as seen by the air traffic flow, 
which was 236.71 million in the Financial Year 
2022-23 (April-December 2022) as compared 
to 131.61 million during the same period last 
Financial Year  2021-22 (April-December 2021). 
The Indian aviation industry has largely recovered 
from the COVID-19 pandemic shock.
Opportunities & Threat:
India has become the third-largest domestic 
aviation market in the world and the Indian 
aviation industry is expected to  contribute 5% of 
the GDP, creating a total of 4 million jobs.
The air transport market in India is forecast 
under the “current trends” scenario to grow by 
262% in the next 20 years. This would result in 
an additional 370.3 million passenger journeys 
by 2037. If met, this increased demand would 
support approximately US $126.7 billion of GDP 
and almost 9.1 million jobs.
The air transport sector generates a job opportunity 
of 9,43,000 direct and indirect jobs. The sector 
is estimated to support a further 553,000 jobs 
through the wages it pays to its employees, 
some, or all of which are subsequently spent on 
consumer goods and services. Foreign tourists 
arriving by air to India, who spend their money 
on the local economy, are estimated to support 
an additional 4.3 million jobs. In total 6.2 million 
jobs are supported by air transport and tourists 
arriving by air. The spending by the air transport 
industry, including airlines and its supply chain, 
is estimated to support US $13 billion of GDP in 
India. 
Even while there is a sizable chance for growth 
across the board and plenty of room for businesses 
to manoeuvre, the truth remains that the sector is 
undergoing unprecedented changes due to the 
quick uptake of cutting-edge technologies. We 
have a lot of scope to grow because a Company 
like Balmer Lawrie is typically seen of as one 
that serves in-person needs through travel 
desks and implants. We have worked hard to 
improve our online presence by creating a new 
B2C website that places strong emphasis on 
vacations and other services on a single platform. 
To meet a variety of customer needs, domestic 
and international ticketing, hotel booking, and 
ancillary services have been combined with an 
excellent search function.
We have already developed a special website for 
employees of the Government of India (GOI) to 
use for their official travel, and we want to give 
major corporations a booking website tailored 
specifically to their needs. Together with our 
counter personnel, our digital offering establishes 
a local presence through partnerships, enabling 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
55
us to provide consumers with a hybrid brick-and-
click solution.
The Travel vertical has tremendously improved 
its ability to operate, sell, and develop software, 
which has significantly increased the number of 
clients we serve. Customers are choosing tech-
rich solutions like SSBT / SBT from Balmer Lawrie 
because we can provide our business clients 
with comprehensive, cost-effective, customised 
services. By showcasing technologically enabled 
solutions and dedication to first-rate customer 
care, we have been successful in attracting elite 
private sector clientele. The SBU has made 
the most of the available time to prepare for 
the anticipated demand, and we want to have 
centralised ticketing to boost productivity and 
guarantee a consistent level of customer service.
Risk and Concerns:
The industry has defeated the sharp impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now there is 
shortage of trained and experienced manpower 
due to increase in business volume going past 
pre-pandemic level. The Travel Industry is highly 
dependent on technology and with the increasing 
use AI and Machine learning platforms, it is 
necessary for us to adapt to these technologies 
as soon as possible to keep our services at par 
with the market standards.  
The Travel vertical remains dependent on GOI & 
PSU customers which consists of more than 90% 
of business and this remains as one of the major 
concerns of the vertical.
Outlook: 
India’s travel and tourism sector contributed 
approximately 122 billion dollars to the country’s 
GDP, and it is projected to increase at a CAGR 
of over 10% to reach nearly $500 billion by 2028. 
It is a crucial sector for creating jobs and earning 
foreign currency, and the Government has 
implemented a number of initiatives to take full 
advantage of the opportunity.
By creating a stable policy environment and 
encouraging growth that is driven by competition, 
the Indian Government is actively assisting the 
aviation industry.  The revival and development 
of 100 unserved and under-served airports, 
helipads, and water aerodromes by 2024 are 
planned 
under 
the 
Government-approved 
“Revival of Undeserved and Under-Served 
Airports” initiative. A plan called Krishi Udan 2.0 
focuses on moving perishable food items out 
of mountainous regions, North Eastern states, 
tribal territories, and other places. 58 airports 
have been chosen as part of this programme to 
encourage the circulation of air freight. In the next 
five years, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) 
and other airport developers plan to invest over 
INR 98,000 crore in the construction of new and 
existing airports.
The largest order in aviation history was placed 
by Air India on February 14, 2023, when it agreed 
to a contract with Boeing and Airbus to purchase 
470 aircrafts for $70 billion. This is Air India’s 
first purchase since 2005, and it coincides with a 
rise in passenger traffic for the country’s aviation 
sector.
Segment-wise or Product-wise Performance:
The Travel vertical has introduced a new platform 
for employees of Government of India, which has 
given a major boost to our business and working 
capital requirement support as the business is on 
prepayment basis. The vertical’s  main source 
of business remains autonomous bodies, GOI & 
PSUs which consists of over 90% of the business. 
The products we offer are air ticketing and related 
services such as hotel booking, forex, insurance, 
transportation etc.
Internal Control System and their adequacy:
Travel has achieved some major breakthrough 
in terms of internal control processes, like 
centralization of all ticketing in HUB including 
cancellation and provision of credit notes.  Travel 
has achieved an optimal process of refund for all 
types of cancelled and failed ticketing activities.  
Material 
developments 
in 
the 
Human 
Resources/Industrial 
Relations 
front, 
including the number of people employed:
Human Resource Development at Travel : 
The market opened with great positivity post 
pandemic and we capitalized on this opportunity 
by launching a centralized ticketing HUB in 
Delhi.  To ensure the smooth operationalization 
of the HUB, we accomplished new recruitments 
in record time.  This allowed us to assemble a 
highly competent team capable of delivering 
exceptional service to our customers.
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
56
We undertook a comprehensive organization 
restructuring, and this enabled us to realign our 
resources effectively, optimizing our workflows 
and enhancing overall efficiency.  We also 
welcomed numerous new employees into Travel 
as part of this restructuring, bringing fresh 
perspectives and skills in our team. We engaged 
15 apprentices / COPA for a year long training 
from the relevant trade.  We ensured exposure 
of various functions of our SBU to make them 
employable and skillful. 
In line with our commitment to employee growth 
and development, we introduced a training 
program in Travel specifically designed for our 
Out-Sourced (OS) Deputees.  The training 
sessions proved to be highly motivating for the 
participants, empowering them to perform at their 
best and contribute to the success of Travel.
Furthermore, the Management is proactively 
engaged with employees through open house 
sessions conducted across T&V branches. 
These sessions created a platform for open 
dialogue, fostering a culture of transparency 
and collaboration within Travel. The feedback 
received during these sessions has been 
invaluable in shaping our HR strategies and 
improving employee satisfaction in the Travel 
vertical.
As on 31st March 2023, Travel had total manpower 
strength of 277 people.
VACATIONS
Industry structure and developments:
International tourism is well on its way to returning 
to pre-pandemic levels, with twice as many 
people travelling during the first quarter of 2023 
than in the same period of 2022.
The start of the year has again shown tourism’s 
unique ability to bounce back. In many places, 
we are close to or even above pre-pandemic 
levels of arrivals. However, we must remain alert 
to challenges ranging from geopolitical insecurity, 
staffing shortages, and the potential impact of the 
cost-of-living crisis on tourism. We must ensure 
tourism’s return delivers on its responsibilities 
as a solution to the climate emergency and as a 
driver of inclusive development.
International tourism receipts grew back to hit the 
USD 1 trillion mark in 2022, growing 50% in real 
terms compared to 2021, driven by the important 
rebound in international travel. International 
visitor spending reached 64% of pre-pandemic 
levels (-36% compared to 2019, measured in 
real terms). By regions, Europe enjoyed the 
best results in 2022 with nearly USD 550 billion 
in tourism receipts (EUR 520 billion), or 87% of 
pre-pandemic levels. Africa recovered 75% of 
its pre-pandemic receipts, the Middle East 70% 
and the Americas 68%. Due to prolonged border 
shutdowns, Asian destinations earned about 
28%.
The second UNWTO World Tourism Barometer 
of the year shows that the sector’s swift recovery 
has continued into 2023. It shows that:
Overall, 
international 
arrivals 
reached 80% 
of 
pre-pandemic 
levels in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2023. 
An 
estimated 
235 
million 
tourists 
travelled 
internationally 
in the first three months, more than double the 
same period of 2022.
Tourism has continued to show its resilience. 
Revised data for 2022 shows over 960 million 
tourists 
travelling 
internationally 
last 
year, 
meaning two-thirds (66%) of pre-pandemic 
numbers were recovered.
India Tourism:
India’s tourism revenue grew around 291% YoY 
in February, 2023 compared with an increase of 
369% YoY in the previous month.
India’s tourism sector is showing signs of revival 
following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and 
the waning of the pandemic. It also noted that 
foreign tourist arrivals in India in Financial Year 
2023 have been growing month-on-month with 
the resumption of scheduled international flights.
The profitability ratios of the tourism industry 
have shown a strong rebound in the June, 
2022 quarter. Travel returned to normal levels 
in March, 2022 given the higher vaccination 
rate and overall effective management of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The hotel occupancy rate 
has increased considerably reaching the average 
pre-pandemic level of 2019-20.
India has seen an upsurge in medical tourism 
due to the various Government initiatives like 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
57
Ayush visa for medical tourists, the launch of the 
National Strategy for Sustainable Tourism and 
Responsible Traveller Campaign, the introduction 
of the Swadeshi Darshan 2.0 scheme and Heal 
in India.
Domestic tourism together with inbound tourism 
has emerged as a key driver of economic growth. 
In the year 2022, India recorded Foreign Tourist 
Arrivals (FTAs) of 6.19 million (provisional) with 
a growth of around 305% over the same period 
of the previous year which account for Foreign 
Exchange Earnings (FEEs) of Rs.1,35,543 crore 
(provisional estimates) with a growth of 106.77%. 
Besides, as per the data furnished by State / UT 
Government and other information available 
with the Ministry of Tourism, there were 677.63 
million Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) all over the 
country during the year 2021.
Opportunities and Threats:
According to research by World Travel & Tourism 
Council (WTTC), the travel & tourism sector’s 
contribution to the Indian economy would surpass 
the pre-pandemic levels in 2024 with a year-on-
year growth of 20.7%.
India’s tourism sector is showing steady signs 
of revival with the waning of the COVID-19 
pandemic. One of the sectors of tourism which 
has witnessed substantial growth is medical 
tourism and India is ranked 10th out of the top 
64 countries in the world in the Medical Tourism 
Index Financial Year 2021, according to the 
Economic Survey. The Government initiatives 
like E-Visa, Swadesh Dekho etc. along with 
the G20 presidency have resulted in the rise 
of MICE activities and inbound travellers. The 
G20 presidency has provided a strong platform 
for India to promote its agenda of developing 
sustainable / green tourism practices.
With the change in tourism landscape, “Bleisure 
travel” is one of the concepts that is gaining 
popularity which has evolved as a radical 
concept among the business travellers combining 
business and leisure travel. India now ranks 2nd in 
the world in terms of Bleisure travel.  
It is envisaged that Indian tourists shall be among 
the top spenders in 2023 for travel as the flights 
and hotels at popular tourist destinations are 
operating at their maximum capacity. Weekend 
destinations have gained immense popularity. 
With the change in spending dynamics and 
highly competitive marketplace, the international 
tourism industry is now wide open to the middle 
class segment. The tourism industry has come 
up with facilities like EMI (travel now pay later) 
which is giving an impetus to the outbound travel 
segment in India. 
The group tours will stay and rise in demand 
as people would want to pay for their travel in 
local currency before they can travel, while 
TNPL will gain popularity as customers would 
like to conserve cash and carry extra cash to the 
destination or park in their saving.
Offline travel agents will gain popularity:  With 
the booming demand, though all segments within 
travel will continue to gain, the offline segment 
(bookings done via offline travel agents) will 
get bigger share of total market. The reason 
being, just before and during the COVID-19 
pandemic, travellers suffered in the hands of 
OTA & aggregators on issues of refunds and 
cancellation. As a result, they fell back on agents 
who serviced them better on these fronts. Also, 
with the changing environment, travellers always 
look for a fall back option if all hell breaks loose 
while travelling, which an offline agent handles 
better instead of an IVR. However, with the given 
increase in demand, technology and collaboration 
will be the new drivers of the travel industry in the 
coming years. To stay relevant, travel merchants 
will have to invest more in online technologies to 
make bookings seamless for the travellers. POS 
solutions and technology will contribute majorly 
to this, while airlines would be focusing on more 
of capabilities such as self-service, touchless 
travel, biometrics, and Artificial Inteligence (AI).   
India is coming up with 66 new airports in the 
next decade. From 85 million domestic flyers in 
Financial Year 2022, the number is estimated to 
shoot up to 330 million in Financial Year 2032. 
However, tourism’s recovery also faces some 
challenges.  According to the United Nation 
World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Panel 
of Experts, the economic situation remains the 
main factor weighing on the effective recovery of 
international tourism in 2023, with high inflation 
and rising oil prices translating into higher 
transport and accommodation costs.  As a result, 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
58
tourists are expected to increasingly seek value 
for money and travel closer to home. Uncertainty 
derived from the Russian aggression against 
Ukraine and other mounting geopolitical tensions, 
also continue to represent downside risks. 
Segment–wise or product-wise performance: 
In the fiscal year 2022-23, the Travel and 
Tourism industry witnessed increased demand 
over the pre-COVID levels. As we reflect on 
the challenging times SBUs endured during the 
pandemic, we recognize the efforts made by 
the Vacations team to seize opportunities once 
demand began to rise.
The year 2022-23 is a source of great pride 
for the Vacations vertical, which achieved its 
highest-ever gross topline of INR 129.91 crore, 
representing a growth of more than 2.03 times 
compared to the previous fiscal year’s along with 
bottom line of INR 77.13 lacs.  The efforts made 
to recoup the losses incurred over the past two 
years and return to profitability are notable. The 
aggregate business increased by more than 2.03 
times compared to the previous fiscal year. 
Corporate Tours – Delhi & Mumbai put together 
(achieved 2.53 times more) and Retail (achieved 
4 times more) experienced significant growth 
compared to the previous fiscal year.  MICE 
has accomplished 1.24 times more than in the 
previous fiscal year.
Vacations has taken a few commendable 
initiatives, 
including 
strengthening 
internal 
operations, IT and customer service, manpower, 
a dedicated call centre for the Business, the 
launch of new products, and the introduction of 
financial incentive schemes for employees.
Outlook :    
In 2023, Indian travellers will be among those 
who spend the most on travel options. There are 
travellers between the ages of 23 and 40. This 
year, weekend trips are anticipated to grow in 
prominence among vacationers willing to spend 
more money and enhance their experiences. In 
2023, travellers will go one step further, as we 
prepare to embark on a tour to forecast the travel 
and tourism industry’s trends. Travel and tourism 
returned to form in 2022, and despite rising 
global prices, tourists continue to take vacations 
and explore the globe. With millions of travellers 
already planning journeys and a 20% increase 
in earnings for the global tourism industry, 2023 
appears to be a prosperous year. Travel has 
become a way of life, and individuals are not 
hesitant to spend their money on experiencing 
new excursions and discovering new places.
There has been a noticeable change in travellers’ 
behaviour in recent years, which has forced 
companies and destinations to adapt to meet 
travellers’ high expectations. There were several 
factors driving this change, including the popularity 
of remote working, the growing concern about 
sustainability, the desire for flexible cancellation 
policies, and the sentiment of revenge travel. 
As we can see from the numbers, international 
tourism showed strong signs of recovering in 
2023. By 2025, this segment should be fully 
recovered.
Growth Drivers - Incredible India campaign, 
extending international tourism business in India, 
E-Tourist Visa facility, E-visa facility extended to 
156 Countries under 5 sub-categories i.e ‘e-Tourist 
visa’, ’eBusiness visa’, ‘e-medical visa’, ‘e-Medical 
Attendant Visa’ and ‘e-Conference Visa’. Since 
tourist’s desire to carry less cash or save it, TNPL 
(Travel Now Pay Later) platforms are growing in 
popularity which makes travel affordable. 
The tourism business has always been about the 
customer experience. With new technologies and 
a growing number of tourist choices, it has never 
been more important to improve the customer 
experience. In the end, how customers feel about 
your business will make or break it. Finetuning 
the experience can define the difference between 
getting a customer to come back again and again 
and spread the word about your business and 
losing a customer before they even book. 
Trends in digital transformation have had a 
significant impact on the Tourism segment. 
Personalization and custom-tailored packages 
based on customer preferences, global mobile 
presence, artificial intelligence, chatbots, the 
Internet of Things (IoT), focus on big data, 
adventure tourism, and a host of other trends 
have characterised modern tourism.  Contactless 
payments, Voice Search & Voice Control, 
Virtual Reality and metaverse travel, Virtual 
Reality Tourism Trends, Robots, Chatbots, and 
Automation are on the rise.

Risks and concerns :
Inflation and high cost of living are concerns 
for tourism in 2023. Skilled Human Resources, 
Regulatory (Visa appointments for Europe & 
USA) & Border Issues, Taxation,  Supply chain 
issues,  Inflation, high energy costs resulting in 
higher living costs, geopolitical instability etc., 
according to a report released by World Travel 
Market (WTM) London, are the major concerns 
facing the global tourism industry in the year 
ahead.
Internal control systems and their adequacy:
The vertical has an effective internal control 
mechanism, and during the period under review, 
a significant number of internal Audits involving 
customer feedback management, billing to cus-
tomers etc. were conducted in all branches, with 
satisfactory results. 
Discussion on financial performance with 
respect to operational performance:
The Travel and Tourism industry saw increased 
demand in fiscal year 2022-23 compared to 
pre-COVID levels. As we reflect on the difficult 
period SBUs faced during the pandemic, we 
acknowledge the efforts made by the SBU team to 
capitalize on opportunities as demand increased.
The Financial Year 2022-23 is a source of great 
satisfaction for the Vacations SBU, which reached 
its highest-ever gross topline of INR 129.91 
Crore, alongwith a bottom line of INR 77.13 
lacs. The efforts made to recoup losses from the 
previous two years and return to profitability are 
noteworthy.   
When compared to the previous fiscal year, the 
total business expanded by more than 2.03 times. 
Both Corporate Tours - Delhi & Mumbai (2.53 
times more) and Retail (4 times more) showed 
considerable growths compared to the previous 
fiscal year. MICE achieved 1.24 times more than 
the previous fiscal year.
Material developments in Human Resources 
/ Industrial Relations front, including number 
of people employed:
Employee relations remained cordial at all 
Vacations 
vertical 
branches. 
The 
vertical 
continues to improve the skills of its employees 
through training and development initiatives. As 
of March 31, 2023, the vertical employed a total 
of 75 individuals.
7. REFINERY & OIL FIELD SERVICES [ROFS]
Industry Structure and Developments:
The SBU: Refinery & Oil Field Services is 
rendering service to all the refineries in India by 
recovering hydrocarbon from crude oil storage 
tanks and lagoons. It handles mechanized oily 
sludge processing where the sludge is being 
processed to recover oil and hydrocarbons. 
Though we are the only public sector in this 
business there are many companies that 
have entered this business thereby, creating 
stiff competition in getting the orders. As the 
competitors are MSME it’s very difficult for us to 
maintain the margins.
With a highly technical team with sound 
experience and maintaining stringent safety 
norms, this SBU is catering to all oil companies. 
Opportunities and Threats:
The SBU continues to have the highest market 
share in the oily sludge processing segment in 
India. However, the market share has decreased 
significantly in recent years. 
The SBU intends to leverage its experience 
in project execution and wide base of satisfied 
clientele to foray into allied service areas by 
diversifying its service offerings.
The main threats visualized by the SBU relate to 
subdued market demand and the entry of new 
players in the niche market. Preference of MSME 
vendors also poses a significant challenge to the 
SBU with respect to booking of new orders. 
Segment and Product wise Performance:
The operational performance was more or less at 
par with our budgeted estimates, mainly due to 
advance order booked for the SBU.
The new order booking was sluggish due to 
high competition in the market and the expected 
profitability of newly booked orders is expected to 
be lower than historical trends.
Outlook:
The demand for sludge processing services is 
expected to be stagnant in the near term. The 
SBU aims to differentiate its offerings in the 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
60
sludge processing space through technological 
upgradation 
and 
incorporation 
of 
new 
technologies for reducing processing times and 
manual intervention in sludge processing.
Diversification of Business into other allied areas 
is also being explored.
Risk & Concerns:
Increased competition in the market can put 
downward pressure on market share as well as 
profit margins of the SBU.
Other 
risks 
include 
adoption 
of 
modern 
technologies in refineries, which would reduce 
generation of oil sludge in the storage tanks, 
thereby limiting the need for sludge processing in 
the long run.
The SBU is working towards mitigation of the risks 
through upgradation of technology, as well as 
expansion and diversification of service offerings 
and client base.
Internal Control System and their Adequacy:
Tank Bottom Sludge processing and Lagoon 
Sludge Processing are onsite operations and 
the SBU adheres to the best norms and HSE 
practices followed by oil refineries and oil 
exploration companies. 
No near-miss incidents have been recorded by 
the SBU during the year. Periodic audits, risk 
mitigation measures and compliance with HSE 
guidelines ensure robustness of the internal 
control systems.
Discussion on Financial Performance with 
respect to Operational Performance:
The SBU has been able to be near par with its 
business plan for Financial Year 2022-23 w.r.t 
turnover and profit.
The equipment utilization levels have been able 
to meet the targeted levels.
Material Developments in Human Resources / 
Industrial Relations:
Industrial relations continued to be satisfactory 
during the financial year under report. The SBU 
has a total of  18 employees.

4.  Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief 
and if available, provide a web-link to the policy.
Yes, anti-corruption and anti-bribery clauses are incorporated in Balmer Lawrie’s Fraud Prevention 
Policy.
The Company has a Fraud Prevention Policy which covers all aspects of anti-bribery. The policy 
is in place for detection, reporting and prevention of fraud. This policy covers all types of frauds 
irrespective of their nature. The Fraud Prevention Policy applies to all frauds committed or 
suspected, linked to the business of the Company, involving any employee, including the whole-
time Directors (employed in any capacity including those deputed by other agencies to carry out 
any work for and on behalf of the Company) and other stakeholders such as vendors, suppliers, 
contractors, service providers, consultants or any other external agency / person having business 
relationship and / or associated with the Company in any manner, as well as their representatives. 
The clause “Actions constituting fraud” under the sub-clause (x) of Fraud Prevention Policy talks 
about what constitutes bribery and corruption:
“Bribery or corruption, including inappropriate relationship with third parties causing conflict of 
interest and accepting or seeking anything of material value from contractors, vendors or any other 
person supplying material or providing services to the Company”
The objective of the “Fraud Prevention Policy” is to provide a system for detection, reporting and 
prevention of fraud, whether committed or suspected. The policy strives to:

or suspected fraud
Balmer Lawrie also has the Whistle Blower Policy in place. The Whistle Blower Policy provides 
employees a framework to report to the Management, instances of unethical behaviour, and actual 
or suspected fraud. 
In the course of contracting, one has to deal with various vendors / suppliers / contractors / 
consultants who are expected to adopt and maintain highest standards and a high degree of ethics 
and integrity, commitments and sincerity towards the work undertaken by them. Any aberration, 
deviation and violation from the expected standards of supplies / services / behaviour of the 
contracting agencies is dealt in line with the policy framed on Blacklisting so that it becomes a 
deterrent for all. This policy is aimed at blacklisting the errant vendors and service providers by 
following the laid down procedure.

Otherwise, the material will be collected back for reprocessing and re-use. Also, corrective action will 
be taken to avoid recurrence.
SBU - G&L: On receipt of complaints at Sales Office, the same is recorded in SAP. Visit to customer 
site is made if found necessary otherwise the personnel speaks over phone with customer to 
understand the problem. Sample is collected for evaluation in our QA laboratory or R&D centre and is

instruments, if found necessary, to find contamination if occurred at customer end. In case we find 
that customer is not following correct procedure to maintain the lubricants or failure of mechanical 
components, we guide them to rectify the same. In some cases, we send additives to correct the 
products during usage as rectification, if possible, at site. If any other kind of defect in products is 
observed, we replace the material at the earliest. We communicate the laboratory report to sales team 
to forward the same to customers.
SBU - IP : Customer complaints received by Marketing / Field Officer / Sales Admin, are recorded in 
specified format. Joint inspection by Filed Officer and Quality Representative at Customer site is done 
within 48 hours. If any quality deviation found, efforts are made to correct at customer premises itself,

Payment of Dividend through Electronic Mode 
The electronic mode of payment brings in further efficiency and uniformity in credit of the dividend 
amount. The advantages of electronic mode over physical mode includes faster credit of remittance 
to beneficiary’s account, wider coverage with no limitations of location in India.
Your Company accordingly encourages the use of electronic mode for payment of dividend, wherever 
available. To avail such facility the shareholders, are requested to fill-in the mandate form thereby 
providing the MICR and IFSC code number of their bank and branch along with the bank account 
number, relevant forms and other details to the Registrar & Share Transfer Agent of the Company, 
(where the shares are being held in physical form) or to their Depository Participant (where the shares 
Balmer Lawrie 1> ra. Ltd. 
126
are being held in dematerialized mode) on or before Wednesday, 20th September, 2023 (end of day). 
This would facilitate prompt encashment of dividend proceeds and also enable the Company to 
reduce cost of dividend distribution.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
OF 
BALMER LAWRIE & COMPANY LIMITED
To 
The Members of
Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited
Report on the Audit of Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements 
of Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the balance sheet as 
at 31st March 2023, and the statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the 
statement of changes in equity and the statement 
of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to 
the standalone financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information in which are included the 
returns for the year ended on that date audited by the 
branch auditors of the Company’s branches located 
at Northern, Southern and Western Regions of the 
country (hereinafter referred as “Standalone Financial 
Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, the profit 
and total comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (“SA”s) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the standalone 
financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. 
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. We have determined the matters described 
below to be the key audit matters to be communicated 
in our report:
Sl. No
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
1.
Evaluation of uncertain tax positions 
The Company has tax matters under dispute 
which involves judgment to determine the 
possible outcome of these disputes. [Refer 
Note No.42.3(a) to the standalone financial 
statements read with its Annexure “A”]
We obtained the details of assessment orders to the 
extent available, regarding those assessments for 
which disputes are continuing and being disclosed as 
contingent liability by the management. We involved 
our expertise to estimate the possible outcome of the 
disputes. Our experts considered the assessment 
orders and other rulings in evaluating management’s 
position on these uncertain tax positions to evaluate 
whether any changes were required to management’s 
position on these uncertain tax matters.
2.
Debtors Due for More than Three years 
and Credit Balances in Sundry Debtors 
Accounts (Unallocated Receipts)
We have checked the debtor’s ageing schedule of 
the SBU’s.  The Company is regularly following up 
on the realisation of the same. As is evident from the 
ageing schedule dues do exist for more than three 
years against which provisions have been made in the 
accounts.
B~LawrieW>Co.Ltd. 
147
Sl. No
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
The Company has credit balance in some 
customer 
accounts 
across 
all 
Strategic 
Business Unit (SBU’s). The credit balance in 
these customer accounts are due to either of 
the following reasons:
x
Amount lying in the nature of advance in 
the customer account;
x
Amount credited to customers account 
but the same could not be tracked/linked 
with any sales invoice;
x
Non-reconciliation of these balances and 
the absence of customer’s confirmation 
resulting in the credit balances lying for 
long periods;
We, during the course of our examination have also 
checked the unadjusted advances from customers 
lying for more than three years and also the credit 
balances lying in customers’ accounts on account of 
unmatched invoices (unallocated receipts). Some of 
the advances which were lying unadjusted for more 
than three years have been written back during the 
course of audit. In some cases, the management is 
in the process of reconciliation with the respective 
parties and hence the write back if any, has been kept 
in abeyance.
It is observed that though the letters seeking 
customers’ confirmation are sent by the Company, 
the response has been poor. Steps should be taken 
to get the confirmation from customers. In addition 
to the practice of seeking confirmation annually, the 
Company should also get confirmation through the 
sales team on a periodical basis other than annually.
The management has to strengthen the internal control 
process of reconciling the balances of the debtors and 
to adjust the unallocated receipts on a periodical basis.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to the following matters in the Notes 
to the standalone financial statements, which describe 
the uncertainty related to the outcome. 
a) Note No. 42.8 which states that trade receivables, 
loans and advances and deposits for which 
confirmations are not received from the parties 
are subject to reconciliation and consequential 
adjustments on determination/ receipt of such 
confirmation.
b) Note No. 42.30 which states that the Company has 
not made any provision towards its investments 
made in subsidiary, M/s Visakhapatnam Port 
Logistics Park Limited (VPLPL).
c) Note No. 42.37 which states that the Company 
had made payments/provision of certain portion 
of demand raised by Syama Prasad Mookerjee 
Port (SMP) which is under reconciliation. Balance 
demand is shown under contingent liabilities 
(Claims against the Company not acknowledged 
as debts).
d) Note No. 23: “Other Trade Payable” includes 
the sundry creditor for expenses amounting to 
Rs.322.62 Lakhs (P.Y. Rs. 322.57 Lakhs) of E&P 
Division, Kolkata, which are lying unpaid since 
long, as the matters are under litigation.
e) Note No. 42.19(i)(*) which states that as per the 
order of Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal 
(NCLT), the demat account service provider has 
unilaterally reduced the investment of the Company 
in the shares (both equity and preference) of 
M/s Transafe Services Limited (TSL). However, 
the Company continues to display these quantities 
of shares under its Investment (Refer Note No. 6- 
“Financial Assets- Investments- Non-Current”).
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above 
matters.
Information Other than the Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Management Discussion 
and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures 
to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, 
Corporate Governance Report and Shareholder 
Information, but does not include the standalone 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.

concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
Audit 
of 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these standalone financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
xIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.  
xObtain an understanding of internal financial 
control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. 
Under section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls. 
xEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by 
management.  
xConclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.  
xEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.  
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
standalone financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
standalone financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the standalone financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal 
financial control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financial statements/ information 
of branches situated in Northern, Southern and 
Western 
Regions 
included 
in 
the 
standalone 
financial statements of the Company whose financial 
statements/financial information reflect total assets of 
Rs.1,24,236.80 Lakhs as at     31st March 2023 and 
the total revenue of Rs.1,79,058.67 Lakhs for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the standalone 
financial statements / information of these branches 
have been audited by the branch auditors whose 
reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion 
in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of these branches, is based solely 
on the report of such branch auditors.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above 
matter.

d)  During the year, the Company has not revalued 
its Property, Plant and Equipment (including 
Right of Use Assets) or intangible assets or 
both and hence provisions of clause (i) (d) of 
the Order are not applicable to the Company.
e) According to the information and explanation 
given to us and the records maintained by 
the Company, no proceedings have been 
initiated or are pending against the Company 
for holding any benami property under the 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 
and rules made there under.
ii a)   According to the information and explanation 
given to us the inventory of the Company 
except goods in transit has been physically 
verified during the year at reasonable intervals 
by the management. In our opinion, having 
regard to the nature and location of inventory, 
the frequency of verification is reasonable. 
The discrepancies noticed on such verification 
were not 10% or more in the aggregate for 
each class of inventory.  
 b)  In our opinion and according to the information 
and explanation given to us and records 
maintained by the Company, the Company 
has not been sanctioned working capital limit 
in excess of Rs. 5.00 crores in aggregate, from 
banks or financial institutions on the basis 
of security of current assets. The quarterly 
returns or statements filed by the Company

Annexure - C to the Auditors’ Report
REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3 
OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 (“THE ACT”)
We have audited the internal financial controls 
over financial reporting of Balmer Lawrie & 
Company Limited (“the Company”) as of 
March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit 
of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Company is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal 
financial 
controls 
based 
on 
the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to 
respective Company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under 
the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of the Company based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance 
Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the Standards on 
Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls over financial reporting was 
established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to 
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the 
internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal financial controls over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and 
operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting 
of the Company.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
A Company’s internal financial control over 
financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
Company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the Company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors 
of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
prevention 
or 
timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
159
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial 
statement
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due 
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company 
has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting. 
Though certain areas require further strengthening, it does not have any material effect on the internal 
financial controls. The internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively 
as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by The Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India.

March are authorised and approved for issue by the Board 
of Directors. 
1. SUMMARY 
OF 
SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
 
The Standalone financial statements have been prepared 
using the accounting policies and measurement basis 
summarized below.
1.1 Historical cost convention
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for the following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value 
or revalued amount:
 Certain financial assets and liabilities, measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments),
 Defined benefit plans, plan assets measured at fair 
value
1.2 Property, plant and equipment
Items of Property, plant and equipment are valued 
at cost of acquisition inclusive of any other cost 
attributable to bringing the same to their working 
condition. Property, plant and equipment manufactured 
/constructed in house are valued at actual cost of raw 
materials, conversion cost and other related costs.
Expenditure incurred during construction of capital 
projects including related pre-production expenses is 
treated as Capital Work-in- Progress and in case of 
transfer of the project to another body, the accounting is 
done on the basis of terms of transfer.
Machine Spares whose use is irregular is classified as 
Capital Spares. Such capital spares are capitalised as 
per Property, plant & equipment.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, 
plant and equipment are determined as the difference 
between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the assets and are recognized in profit or loss within 
‘other income’ or ‘other expenses’ respectively.
Depreciation on Plant & Machinery other than continuous 
process plant is provided on pro-rata basis following 
straight line method considering estimated useful life 
at 25 years, based on technical review by a Chartered 
Engineer. Depreciation on continuous process plant is 
as per Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
Depreciation on certain Property, plant & equipment, 
which have been refurbished/ upgraded and put to 
further use are being depreciated on a pro rata basis 
considering their reassessed residual useful life which 
is not more than the life specified in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Depreciation on tangible assets other than Plant & 
Machinery is provided on pro-rata basis following 
straight line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the asset or over the lives of the assets prescribed under 
Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, whichever is 
lower. Based on internal review, the lower estimated 
useful lives of the following assets are found justifiable 
compared to the lives mentioned in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act 2013:
Asset category
Estimated useful 
life (in years)
Mobile Phones and Portable 
Personal Computers
Assets given to employees under 
furniture equipment scheme
Electrical items like air conditioners, 
fans, refrigerators etc.
Sofa, Photocopier, Fax machines, 
Motor Cars & Machine Spares
2 years
5 years
7 years
5 years
The residual values of all assets are taken as NIL.
Balmer Lawrie 1> ra. Ltd. 
166
1.3 Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for 
capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied 
by the Company, is classified as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at its 
cost, including related transaction costs and where 
applicable, borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. 
When part of an investment property is replaced, the 
carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. 
Additionally, when a property given on rent is vacated 
and the managements intention is to use the vacated 
portion for the purpose of its own business needs, 
Investment Properties are reclassified as Buildings.
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives which is 
consistent with the useful lives followed for depreciating 
Property, Plant and Equipment.
1.4 Financial Instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial instrument and are measured 
initially at fair value adjusted by transaction costs, 
except for those carried at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL) which are measured initially at fair 
value. However, trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component are measured at 
transaction price. Subsequent measurement of financial 
assets and financial liabilities is described below.
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, 
or when the financial asset and all substantial risks 
and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is 
derecognized when it is extinguished, discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial 
assets
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified into the following categories upon 
initial recognition:

Amortised cost

financial assets at FVTPL
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are 
subject to review for impairment.
Amortised cost 
A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost 
using effective interest rates if both of the following 
conditions are met:
a) The financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows; and
b) The contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and 
most other receivables fall into this category of financial 
instruments.
A loss allowance for expected credit losses is 
recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost. 
Expected loss on individually significant receivables 
are considered for impairment when they are past 
due and based on Company’s historical counterparty 
default rates and forecast of macro-economic factors. 
Receivables that are not considered to be individually 
significant are segmented by reference to the industry 
and region of the counterparty and other shared credit 
risk characteristics to evaluate the expected credit 
loss. The expected credit loss estimate is then based 
on recent historical counterparty default rates for each 
identified segment. The Company has a diversified 
portfolio of trade receivables from its different segments. 
Every business segment of the Company has calculated 
provision using a single loss rate for its receivables 
using its own historical trends and the nature of its 
receivables. There are no universal expected loss 
percentages for the Company as a whole. The Company 
generally considers its receivables as impaired when 
they are 3 years past due. Considering the historical 
trends and market information, the Company estimates 
that the provision computed on its trade receivables is 
not materially different from the amount computed using 
expected credit loss method prescribed under Ind AS 
109. Since the amount of provision is not material for the 
Company as a whole, no disclosures have been given in 
respect of expected credit losses.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at FVTPL.
1.5 Inventories
Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable 
value. For this purpose, the basis of ascertainment of 
cost of the different types of inventories is as under –
a) Raw materials & trading goods, stores & spare 
parts and materials for turnkey projects on the basis 
of weighted average cost. 
b) Work-in-progress on the basis of weighted average 
cost of raw materials and conversion cost upto the 
relative stage of completion where it can be reliably 
estimated.
c) Finished goods on the basis of weighted average 
cost of raw materials, conversion cost and other 
related costs.
d) Loose Tools are written-off over the economic 
OLIH H[FHSW LWHPV FRVWLQJ XSWR ൠ ZKLFK DUH
charged off in the year of issue. 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
167
1.6 Government grants
a) Grants from the government are recognised at their 
fair value where there is a reasonable assurance 
that the grant will be received and the Company will 
comply with all attached conditions.
b) Government grants relating to income are deferred 
and recognised in the profit or loss over the period 
necessary to match them with the costs that they 
are intended to compensate and presented within 
other income.
c) Government grants relating to the purchase of 
property, plant and equipment are included in 
non-current liabilities as deferred income and are 
credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the expected lives of the related assets and 
presented within other income.
1.7 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
 
Items included in the financial statements are 
measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates 
(‘the functional currency’). The applicable functional 
and presentation currency is INR.
b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into 
the functional currency using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are 
generally recognised in profit or loss. 
1.8 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker.
The board of directors assesses the financial 
performance and position of the Company, and makes 
strategic decisions and have identified business 
segment as its primary segment.
1.9 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Capital 
commitments
a) Provision is recognised when there is a present 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation in respect of which 
a reliable estimate can be made. Provision amount 
are discounted to their present value where the 
impact of time value of money is expected to be 
material.
b) Contingent liabilities are disclosed in respect of 
possible obligations that arise from past events 
but their existence is confirmed by the occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company. 
c) Contingent 
liabilities 
pertaining 
to 
various 
government authorities are considered only on 
conversion of show cause notices issued by them 
into demand.
1.10 Intangible assets
a) Expenditure incurred for acquiring intangible assets 
OLNH VRIWZDUH FRVWLQJ ൠ DQG DERYH DQG
OLFHQVH WR XVH VRIWZDUH SHU LWHP RI ൠ DQG
above, from which economic benefits will flow over 
a period of time, is amortised over the estimated 
useful life of the asset or five years, whichever is 
earlier, from the time the intangible asset starts 
providing the economic benefit. 
b) Brand value arising on acquisition are recognised 
as an asset and are amortised on a straight line 
basis over 10 years. 
c) Goodwill on acquisition is not amortised but tested 
for impairment annually.
d) In other cases, the expenditure is charged to 
revenue in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. 
1.11 Accounting for Research & Development
a) Revenue Expenditure is shown 
under 
Primary 
Head of Accounts with the total of such expenditure 
being disclosed in the Notes.
b) Capital 
expenditure 
relating 
to 
research 
& 
development is treated in the same way as 
other fixed assets.
1.12 Treatment of Grant / Subsidy
a) Revenue grant/subsidy in respect of research 
& 
development 
expenditure 
is 
set 
off 
against respective expenditure.
b) Capital grant/subsidy against specific fixed assets 
is set off against the cost of those fixed assets.
c) When grant/subsidy is received as compensation 
for extra cost associated with the establishment of 
manufacturing units or cannot be related otherwise 
to any particular fixed assets the grant/subsidy so 
received is credited to capital reserve. On expiry 
of the stipulated period set out in the scheme of 
grant/subsidy the same is transferred from capital 
reserve to general reserve.
d) Revenue grant in respect of organisation of certain 
events is shown under Sundry Income and the 
related expenses there against under normal heads 
of expenditure.
1.13  Impairment of assets
An assessment is made at each Balance Sheet 
date to determine whether there is an indication 
of impairment of the carrying amount of the fixed 
assets. If any indication exists, an asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds 
the recoverable amount. 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
168
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-
generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-
generating unit using an appropriate discount factor. 
1.14 Income taxes
Tax expense recognized in profit or loss comprises the 
sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which 
differs from profit or loss in the financial statements. 
Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the 
liability method on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their 
tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless 
the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at 
tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective 
period of realization, provided those rates are enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period.
Deferred tax asset (‘DTA’) is recognized for all 
deductible temporary differences, carry forward of 
unused tax credit and unused tax losses, to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which deductible temporary difference, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilized or to the extent of taxable 
temporary differences except: 
- 
Where the DTA relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination; and at the time 
of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit 
nor taxable profit or loss.
- 
in respect of deductible temporary differences 
arising 
from 
investments 
in 
subsidiaries, 
branches and associates, and interests in joint 
arrangements, to the extent that, and only to 
the extent that, it is probable that the temporary 
difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; 
and taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilized.
This is assessed based on the Company’s forecast of 
future operating results, adjusted for significant non-
taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the 
use of any unused tax loss or credit.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
recognised as a component of tax income or expense 
in profit or loss, except where they relate to items that 
are recognized in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case the related deferred tax 
is also recognized in other comprehensive income or 
equity, respectively.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary 
differences between the carrying amount and tax 
bases of investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
associates and interest in joint arrangements where the 
Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
1.15 Leases
 The Company as a lessee
The Company considers whether a contract is, or 
contains a lease. A lease is defined as ‘a contract, 
or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use 
an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration’. To apply this 
definition, the Company assesses whether the 
contract meets three key evaluations of whether:
a) The contract contains an identified asset, which 
is either explicitly identified in the contract or 
implicitly specified by being identified at the time 
the asset is made available to the Company. 
b) The Company has the right to obtain substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use of the 
identified asset throughout the period of use, 
considering its rights within the defined scope of 
the contract. 
c) The Company has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset throughout the period of use.
Measurement and recognition of leases
At 
lease 
commencement 
date, 
the 
Company 
recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The 
right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which includes 
the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial 
direct costs incurred by the Company, an estimate of 
any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end 
of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance 
of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives 
received). 
The Company depreciates the right-of-use asset on a 
straight-line basis from the lease commencement date 
to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-
use asset or the end of the lease term. The Company 
also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment 
when any indicators exist.
At 
lease 
commencement 
date, 
the 
Company 
measures the lease liability at the present value of 
the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate 
is readily available or the Company’s incremental 
borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the 
measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed 
payments, variable payments based on an index or 
rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual 
value guarantee and payments arising from options 
reasonably certain to be exercised.
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
169
Subsequent to the initial measurement, the liability 
will be reduced for payments made and increased for 
interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment 
or modification, or if there are changes in fixed 
payments. When the lease liability is remeasured, the 
corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-
use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use asset is 
already reduced to zero. 
The Company has elected to account for short-term 
leases i.e. for leases for period less than 12 months 
and leases of low-value i.e. value of leased asset which 
LVOHVVWKDQൠXVLQJWKHSUDFWLFDOH[SHGLHQWV
Instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease 
liability, the payments in relation to these are recognised 
as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. In the Balance Sheet, right-of-
use assets have been disclosed under non-current 
assets and lease liabilities have been disclosed under 
financial liabilities.
The Company as a lessor
The Company classifies leases as either operating or 
finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease 
if the Company transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset 
to the lessee, and classifies it as an operating lease if 
otherwise.
1.16  Revenue recognition
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation.
Sale of goods
When the control over goods is transferred to the buyer 
and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the 
amount of consideration that is derived from the sale 
of goods.
Services rendered
a) 
When control over the service rendered in full or 
part is recognized by the buyer and no significant 
uncertainty exists regarding the amount of 
consideration that is derived from rendering the 
services.
b) 
In case of project activities: As per the percentage 
of completion method after progress of work 
to a reasonable extent for which control can be 
transferred to the buyer. 
c) 
In cases where the Company collects consideration 
on account of another party, it recognises revenue 
as the net amount retained on its own account.
Other income
a) 
Interest on a time proportion basis using the 
effective Interest rate method.
b) 
Dividend 
from 
investments 
in 
shares 
on 
establishment of the Company’s right to receive. 
c) 
Royalties are recognised on accrual basis in 
accordance with the substance of the relevant 
agreement
d) 
Export incentives are recognised as income only 
at the time when there is no significant uncertainty 
as to its measurability and ultimate realisation.
For determining the transaction price, the Company 
measures the revenue in respect of each performance 
obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling 
price.
The Company accounts for volume discounts and 
pricing incentives to a buyer as a reduction of revenue 
based on the ratable allocation of the discounts/
incentives to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress by the 
buyer towards earning the discount/ incentive. 
Term of returns, refunds etc. are agreed with the 
buyers on a case to case basis upon mutually 
accepted terms and conditions. The impact of returns 
and refunds is negligible on the turnover of the 
Company.
As a practical expedient, as given in Ind AS 115, 
the Company has not disclosed the remaining 
performance 
obligation 
related 
disclosures 
for 
contracts where the revenue recognized from the 
satisfaction of the performance obligation corresponds 
directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s 
performance completed to date especially in relation 
to those contracts where invoicing is on time and 
material basis.
Significant payment terms:
Payment is generally received either in cash or based 
on credit terms. Credit terms are agreed to with the 
buyers and is generally in line with the respective 
industry standards.
1.17 Borrowing Costs 
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period 
of time that is required to complete and prepare the 
asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets 
are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Other 
Borrowing Costs are recognised as expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
1.18 Cash Flow Statement
Cash Flow Statement, as per Ind AS – 7, is prepared 
using the indirect method, whereby profit for the 
period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a 
non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or 
future operating cash receipts or payments and items 
of income or expenses associated with investing or 
financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities of the Company are 
segregated.

1.19 Employee Benefits
(i) 
Short term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service 
are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid 
when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligation 
in balance sheet
(ii) Post-employment obligations
Defined Contribution Plans
Provident Fund: the Company transfers provident 
fund contributions to the trust registered for 
maintenance of the fund and has no further 
obligations on this account. These are recognised 
as and when they are due.
Superannuation Fund (SAF): the Company 
contributes for eligible employees, a sum 
equivalent to 9% and 8% for Executives and 
Officers, respectively of salary, to the fund 
administered by the trustees and managed by Life 
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) (for eligible 
optees for LIC managed scheme) or to the fund 
administered and managed by the NPS Trust 
(for balance eligible optees for NPS managed 
scheme). The Company has no further obligations 
on this account. These are recognised as and 
when they are due.
Defined Benefit Plans
Gratuity and Post Retirement Benefit plans – The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually 
by actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
Re-measurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in 
which they occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained earnings 
in the statement of changes in equity. Changes 
in present value of the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised immediately in profit or loss as 
past service cost.
(iii) Other long term employee benefit obligations
The liabilities for leave encashment and long 
service awards are not expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service. 
They are measured annually by actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. Re-measurement as 
a result of experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the 
period in which they occur in profit or loss.
1.20 Prior period Items
Material prior period items which arise in the current 
period as a result of error or omission in the preparation 
of prior period’s financial statement are corrected 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements 
approved for issue after their discovery by:
a) restating the comparative amounts for the prior 
period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or
b) If the error occurred before the earliest prior 
period presented, restating the opening balances 
of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior 
period presented.
c) $Q\LWHPVH[FHHGLQJUXSHHVWZHQW\ILYHODFVൠ
Lacs) shall be considered as material prior period 
item.
d) Retrospective restatement shall be done except 
to the extent that it is impracticable to determine 
either the period specific effects or the cumulative 
effect of the error. When it is impracticable to 
determine the period specific effects of an error 
on comparative information for one or more prior 
periods presented, the Company shall restate the 
opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity 
for the earliest prior period for which retrospective 
restatement is practicable (which may be the 
current period).
1.21  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss (excluding other comprehensive 
income) for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. The weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year is 
adjusted for events such as bonus issue, share splits or 
consolidation that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding without a change in corresponding 
change in resources. For the purpose of calculating 
diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss 
(excluding other comprehensive income) for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the year are adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential 
equity shares.

(vi) Extension and termination options
The Company has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options which are used for regular operations 
of its business. These options are negotiated by management to provide flexibility in managing the Company’s business 
needs. Management exercises significant judgement in determining whether these extension and termination options are 
reasonably certain to be exercised.
In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to 
exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) 
are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is 
reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within 
the control of the lessee.

42.30 Visakhapatnam Port Logistics Park Limited (VPLPL) is a subsidiary of the Company. The Company holds 60% of the equity 
capital. VPLPL has been facing initial teething problems since the start of operations in the second half of 2019 and is 
going through initial stabilization phase which has been further heightened by impact of Covid-19 since 2020. This is an 
infrastructure project and the gestation period is generally higher than for normal projects. Approval had been received earlier 
from the bankers of VPLPL for restructuring of the Bank term loan under special resolution framework for Covid-19 stressed 
units. Through sustained efforts, VPLPL has been successful in obtaining the Container Freight Service (CFS) licence during 
the year and CFS operations has started from March 2023. Based on these above facts and future growth expectations of the 
Company, the management is hopeful of a turnaround in its performance in the near future. Therefore, the Company has not 
made any provisions towards its investment in VPLPL.

42.35 The additional notes to accounts as at balance sheet date as on 31.03.2023/ 31.03.2022:
 (a)  The Company does not have any relationship with struck off Companies under section 248 of the Companies Act, 2013 
or section 560 of Companies Act, 1956.
 (b)  The Company does not have any such case where the borrowings from banks and financial institutions have been used

42.36 Impact of New Labour Codes
The Indian Parliament has approved 4 Labour Codes viz: The Code on Wages, 2019, The Code on Social Security, 2020, The 
Industrial Relations Code, 2020 and The Occupational Safety Health and Working Conditions, 2020 subsuming many existing 
labour legislations. These would impact the contributions by the Company towards Provident Fund, Bonus and Gratuity. The 
effective date from which the codes and rules will be applicable is yet to be notified. The Company will assess the impact and 
its valuation and will give appropriate impact in its financial statements in the period(s) in which, the Codes become effective 
and the related rules to determine the financial impact are notified. 
42.37 Some of the leases with Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port (SMP) erstwhile Kolkata Port Trust have expired and are under 
renewal. During the current FY, an overall continuous reconciliation exercise has been undertaken with SMP for all the plots 
of BL in and around Kolkata being utilised by various businesses of the Company. Based on such reconciliation, payments 
have been released for the confirmed amounts. The balance is still shown as receivable by SMP from the Company which 
seems to have arisen mainly out of improper adjustment by SMP for payments made by the Company, consequential accrual 
of interest on outstanding as per SMP policy, non-accounting by SMP of TDS deducted and deposited by the Company and 
charging of rent at higher rates by SMP for specific periods after the expiry of lease. The Company has sought for waiver of 
these items which are wrongly charged by SMP and along with those the accounting for which are pending in SMP books. 
These have been agreed in-principle to be adjusted/ waived during various discussions with SMP. However, the Company 
has been given to understand that the same will require the approval of Board of SMP and would be done in due course. 
Based on the above, the Company has made provision in its books for a certain portion and the balance of SMP receivables 
as per the SMP statement dated 17.05.2023 (net of payments and provisions made by BL) is shown as claims against the 
Company not acknowledged as debts. 
 42.38 A portion of freehold land at Asaoti, Haryana had been given on rent to Avi - Oil India Private Limited, as associate Company. 
This has been reclassified from PPE to Investment Property in the current FY with the proportionate value of such land 
amounting to Rs.54.72 Lakhs and the comparatives have also been re-classified to this extent. This was missed out in the 
previous financial years due to oversight and was treated as freehold land in PPE. There is no financial impact of the said 
reclassification on the statement of profit and loss of the Company as at 31.03.2022 and 01.04.2021. The Balance Sheet as 
at 01.04.2021 and as at 31.03.2022 have also been restated to correct the impact of the aforesaid reclassification as on such 
date and is not material. The impact of the reclassification is tabulated below:

The Company’s risk management other than in respect of trade receivables is carried out by a central treasury department 
under policies approved in-principle by the Board of Directors. The policies include principles for overall risk management, as 
well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of surplus 
funds. Company's risk in respect of trade receivables is managed by the Chief Operating Officer of the respective Strategic 
Business Units.
A) Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure

customers which is predominantly outstanding from sales to Government departments and public sector entities whose risk of 
default has been very low in the past. In case of other trade receivables, the credit risk has been managed based on continuous 
monitoring of credit worthiness of customers, ability to repay and their past track record.                                                                                                
Provisions 
For Receivables
There are no universal expected loss percentages which can be derived for the Company as a whole. The Company generally 
considers its receivables as impaired when they are outstanding for over three years period. Considering the historical trends 
based on amounts actually incurred as a loss in this regard over the past few years and market information, the Company
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2023
B~LawrieW>Co.Ltd. 
205
estimates that the provision computed on its trade receivables will not be materially different from the amount computed using 
expected credit loss method prescribed under Ind AS - 109. Since the amount of provision is not material for the Company as 
a whole, no disclosures have been given in respect of expected credit losses.
For Other Financial assets
Loans - are given to regular employees who are on the payroll of the Company as per the employment terms and primarily 
secured in case of house building and vehicle loans. For other loans, the amounts are well within the net dues to the  employees 
and hence credit risk is taken as nil.
Accrued income - includes Dividend income from both Indian and foreign JV's/associates. Hence no credit risk is envisaged.
Deposits - represent amounts lying with customers mainly government and public sector undertakings on account of security 
deposits, earnest money deposits and retention money given as per contractual terms. Based on past records the risk of 
default is minimal.
Cash & Cash equivalents - represent cash in hand and balances lying in current accounts with various consortium banks who 
have high credit ratings.
Other Bank Balances - mainly represent fixed deposits having maturities up to one year and includes accrued interest on such 
deposits. These deposits have been taken with various public and private sector banks having the high credit ratings.
B) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from borrowings and other liablities.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due. Due to the nature of the business, 
the Company maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed facilities. Management monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. The Company 
takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Company’s liquidity management 
policy involves considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against 
internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining short term debt financing plans.
The Company does not foresee any problems in discharging their liabilities towards trade payables and other current liabilities 
as and when they are falling due. 
C) Market Risk
Market risk arises due to change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
1) Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent of its investments in fixed deposits with banks.The Company has 
also invested in preference share capital of its joint venture Company, M/s Transafe Services Limited which has been entirely 
provided for in the books of the Company (Refer Note no. 42.19). The Company has not invested in any other instruments 
except equity investments.
2) Foreign currency risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net foreign currency payables, primarily with respect to the 
US Dollar, GBP and Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that 
is not the Company’s functional currency. The Company as per its overall strategy uses forward contracts to mitigate its risks 
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates on borrowings and such contracts are not designated as 
hedges under Ind AS-109. The Company does not use forward contracts for speculative purposes.
The Company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net foreign currency receivables on account of dividend 
and other fees from its foreign subsidiaries and associates, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and AED . 
The Company, as a matter of policy decided by the Board of Directors, do not enter into derivative contracts.
The Companys exposure to major foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period expressed in individual currencies are 
as follows:

characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Company, being a CPSE is governed by the guidelines on Capital issued from time to time by the Government of India.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
OF 
BALMER LAWRIE & COMPANY LIMITED
To 
The Members of
Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
financial 
statements 
of 
BALMER 
LAWRIE 
& 
COMPANY 
LIMITED 
(the 
“Holding 
Company”) 
and its subsidiary (the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary together referred to as the “Group”), 
its associates and joint ventures, which comprise 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 
2023, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 
the year then ended, and a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated Financial 
Statements”).
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements, give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind 
AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group, its associates and joint 
ventures, as at March 31, 2023, the consolidated 
profit, consolidated total comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated 
cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under 
those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the Group and its associates 
and joint ventures in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements in India in terms of 
the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of 
the Companies Act, 2013, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. We have determined the matters 
described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report:

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
1.
Evaluation of uncertain tax positions 
The Holding Company has tax matters under 
dispute which involves judgment to determine 
the possible outcome of these disputes. [Refer 
Note No.42.4(a) to the consolidated financial 
statements]
We obtained the details of assessment orders to the 
extent available, regarding those assessments for 
which disputes are continuing and being disclosed as 
contingent liability by the management. We involved 
our expertise to estimate the possible outcome of the 
disputes. Our experts considered the assessment or-
ders and other rulings in evaluating management’s 
position on these uncertain tax positions to evaluate 
whether any change was required to management’s 
position on these uncertain tax matters.

Auditor’s Response
2
Debtors Due for More than Three years and 
Credit Balance in Sundry Debtors Accounts 
(Unallocated Receipts)
The Holding Company has credit balance in 
some customer accounts across all Strategic 
Business Unit (SBU’s). The credit balance in 
these customers accounts are due to either of 
the following reasons:
x Amount lying in the nature of advance in the 
customer’s account;
x Amount credited to customers account but 
the same could not be tracked / linked with 
any sales invoice.
x Non-reconciliation of these balances in the 
absence of customer’s confirmation resulting 
in the credit balances lying for long periods
We have checked the debtor’s ageing schedule of the 
SBU’s. The Company is regularly following up on the 
realisation of the same. As is evident from the age-
ing schedule dues do exist for more than three years 
against which provision has been made in the ac-
counts.
We, during the course of our examination have also 
checked the unadjusted advances from customers ly-
ing for more than three years and also the credit bal-
ances lying in customers’ accounts on account of un-
matched invoices (unallocated receipts). Some of the 
advances lying unadjusted for more than three years 
have been written back during the course of audit. In 
some cases, the management is in the process of rec-
onciliation with the respective parties and hence the 
write back if any, has been kept in abeyance.
It is observed that though the letters seeking confirma-
tions are sent by the Company, the response has been 
poor. Steps should be taken to get the confirmations 
from customers. In addition to practice of seeking con-
firmation annually, the Holding Company should also 
get confirmation through the sales team on a periodi-
cal basis other than annually
The management has to strengthen the internal con-
trol process of reconciling the balances of the debtors 
and to adjust the unallocated receipts on a periodical 
basis.
Emphasis of Matter
We draw attention to the following matters in the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements which 
describe the uncertainty related to the outcome.
a) Note No. 42.6 which states that trade receivables, 
loans and advances and deposits for which 
confirmations are not received from the parties 
are subject to reconciliation and consequential 
adjustments on determination / receipt of such 
confirmation.
b) Note No. 23: “Other Trade Payable” includes 
the sundry creditor for expenses amounting to 
Rs.322.62 Lakhs (P.Y. Rs.322.57 Lakhs) of E&P 
Division (Kolkata) of Holding Company, which are 
lying unpaid since long, as the matters are under 
litigation.
c) Note No. 42.1(b) which states that as per the 
order of Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal 
(NCLT), the demat account service provider has 
unilaterally reduced the investment of the Company 
in the shares (both equity and preference) of M/s 
Transafe Services Limited (TSL). However, the 
Company continues to display these quantities of 
shares under its Investment (Refer Note No. 6- 
“Financial Assets- Investments- Non-Current)
d) Notes No.42.1(c) regarding non-accrual of interest 
on loan and non-impairment of its investments in 
M/s Transafe Services Limited by a Joint Venture 
Company, M/s Balmer Lawrie - Van Leer Limited in 
the financial year 2020-21, which have no further 
impact on the group. 
e) Note No. 42.1(d) regarding qualified opinion in one 
of the Joint venture Company, M/s. Balmer Lawrie 
(UAE) LLC for i) provision for expected losses on 
raw material inventory which are done in departure 
to applicable Standards and ii) absence of 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence pertaining to 
provision of discounts to trade receivables payable 
to customers.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above 
matters.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not

In connection with our audit of the consolidated

other information and in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information; we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of Management and those Charged 
with Governance for the consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is 
responsible for the preparation and presentation of 
these consolidated financial statements in term of 
the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 
Act) that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial
performance and consolidated cash flows of the 
Group including its associates and joint ventures in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group and of its associates and joint ventures are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose 
of preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associates and joint 
ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of 
the Group and of its associates and joint ventures to

matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associates and joint 
ventures is responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group and of its associates 
and joint ventures.
Auditor’s 
responsibilities 
for 
the 
Audit 
of 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
212
override of internal control. 
 Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company and its subsidiary 
companies, associates and joint ventures which 
are companies incorporated in India, has adequate 
internal financial controls system in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls. 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management. 
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group and its associates 
and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation. 
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by other 
auditors, such other auditors remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
consolidated financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
consolidated financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure - B to the Auditors’ Report
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“The Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company as of and for 
the year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
of Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its 
subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India, as of that 
date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Boards of Directors of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the respective 
Companies considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the respective 
Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting of 
the Holding Company and its subsidiary, joint venture 
and associate companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards 
on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls over financial reporting 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
A Company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial 
control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
218
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statement
Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
Holding Company and its subsidiary, joint venture 
and associate companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting. Though certain areas require 
further strengthening, it does not have any material 
effect on the internal financial controls. The internal 
financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the respective companies considering 
the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
insofar as it relates to 1 (one) subsidiary Company,1 
(One) Joint Venture Company and 1 (One) associate 
Company, which are companies incorporated in India, 
is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors 
of such companies incorporated in India.

READ WITH SECTION 129(4) OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS OF BALMER LAWRIE & COMPANY LIMITED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements of Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited for the year ended 
31 March 2023 in accordance with the financial reporting framework prescribed under the Companies Act, 
2013 (Act) is the responsibility of the management of the company. The statutory auditor appointed by the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of India under section 139 (5) read with section 129 (4) of the Act is responsible 
for expressing opinion on the financial statements under section 143 read with section 129 (4) of the Act based 
on independent audit in accordance with the standards on auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act. 
This is stated to have been done by them vide their Audit Report dated 25 May 2023.
 
I, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, have conducted a supplementary audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 under 
section 143(6) (a) read with section 129 (4) of the Act. We conducted a supplementary audit of the financial 
statements of Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited but did not conduct supplementary audit of the financial 
statements of the subsidiaries, associate companies and jointly controlled entities as detailed in Annexure for 
the year ended on that date. Further, section 139 (5) and 143 (6) (a) of the Act are not applicable to the entities 
as detailed in Annexure being private entities/ entities incorporated in Foreign countries under the respective 
laws, for appointment of their Statutory Auditor and for conduct of supplementary audit. Accordingly, Comptroller 
and Auditor General of India has neither appointed the Statutory Auditors nor conducted the supplementary 
audit of these companies. This supplementary audit has been carried out independently without access to 
the working papers of the statutory auditors and is limited primarily to inquiries of the statutory auditors and 
company personnel and a selective examination of some of the accounting records.
 
On the basis of my supplementary audit nothing significant has come to my knowledge which would give rise to 
any comment upon or supplement to statutory auditors’ report under section 143 (6) (b) of the Act.

Significant Accounting Policies and other explanatory information to the 
Consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023
GENERAL INFORMATION AND STATEMENT OF 
COMPLIANCE WITH IND AS
Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd. (the “Company”) is a Government 
of India Enterprise engaged in diversified business with 
presence in both manufacturing and service businesses. The 
group is engaged in the business of Industrial Packaging, 
Greases & Lubricants, Chemicals, Logistic Services and 
Infrastructure, Refinery & Oil Field and Travel & Vacation 
Services in India. The Company is a Government Company 
domiciled in India and is incorporated under the provisions 
of Companies Act applicable in India, its shares are listed on 
recognized stock exchange of India. 
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements relates to the Company 
along with its subsidiaries and its interest in joint ventures and 
associates (collectively referred to as the ‘Group’) and have 
been prepared in accordance with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 as amended issued by 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs and other relevant provisions of 
the Companies Act, 2013. The Group has uniformly applied 
the accounting policies during the period presented. These 
are the Group’s financial statements prepared in accordance 
with and comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS). Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are 
stated in lacs of Rupees.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or 
non-current as per the groups normal operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies 
Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and the time 
between the acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the group has 
ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose 
of current / non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of 
accounting estimates which, by definition, may or may not 
equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise 
judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31st March are authorised and approved for issue by the 
Board of Directors. 
1. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The 
Consolidated 
financial 
statements 
have 
been prepared using the accounting policies and 
measurement basis summarized below.
1.1 Historical cost convention
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis, except for the following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value 
or revalued amount:
 Certain financial assets and liabilities, measured at 
fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial 
instruments),
 Defined benefit plans, plan assets measured at fair 
value
1.2 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has 
control. The group controls an entity when the group 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power to direct the relevant 
activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the 
group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
The group combines the financial statements of the 
parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together 
like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and 
expenses. 
InterCompany 
transactions, 
balances 
and unrealised gains on transactions between group 
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the transferred asset. 
Joint ventures
Under Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements, investments 
in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures. The classification depends 
on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, 
rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. 
The Group has only joint ventures.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in 
the Group’s balance sheet.
Associates
Associates are all entities over which the group has 
significant influence but not control or joint control. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting, after initially being 
recognised at cost.
Equity method
In consolidated financial statements, the carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize 
changes in the group’s share of net assets of the joint 
venture/associate. Goodwill relating to the joint venture/ 
associate is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment individually. 
When the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted 
investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, 
including any other unsecured long-term receivables, 
the group does not recognise further losses, unless it 
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the other entity.
1.3 Property, plant and equipment
Items of Property, plant and equipment are valued at 
cost of acquisition inclusive of any other cost attributable 
to bringing the same to their working condition. Property, 
plant and equipment manufactured /constructed in 
Balmer Lawrie 1> ra. Ltd. 
226
house are valued at actual cost of raw materials, 
conversion cost and other related costs.
Expenditure incurred during construction of capital 
projects including related pre-production expenses is 
treated as Capital Work-in- Progress and in case of 
transfer of the project to another body, the accounting is 
done on the basis of terms of transfer.
Machine Spares whose use is irregular is classified as 
Capital Spares. Such capital spares are capitalised as 
per Property, Plant & equipment.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, 
plant and equipment are determined as the difference 
between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the assets and are recognized in profit or loss within 
‘other income’ or ‘other expenses’ respectively.
Depreciation on Plant and Machinery other than 
continuous process plant is provided on pro-rata basis 
following straight line method considering estimated 
useful life at 25 years, based on technical review by 
a Chartered Engineer. Depreciation on continuous 
process plant is as per Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013.
Depreciation on certain Property, Plant & Equipment, 
which have been refurbished/ upgraded and put to 
further use are being depreciated on a pro rata basis 
considering their reassessed residual useful life which 
is not more than the life specified in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Depreciation on tangible assets other than Plant and 
Machinery, is provided on pro-rata basis following 
straight line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the asset or over the lives of the assets prescribed under 
Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, whichever is 
lower. Based on internal review, the lower estimated 
useful lives of the following assets are found justifiable 
compared to the lives mentioned in Schedule II of the 
Companies Act 2013:
Asset category
Estimated useful 
life (in years)
Mobile Phones and Portable Personal 
Computers
Assets given to employees under 
furniture equipment scheme
Electrical items like air conditioners, 
fans, refrigerators etc.
Sofa, Photocopier, Fax machines, 
Motor Cars & Machine Spares
2 years
5 years
7 years
5 years
The residual values of all assets are taken as NIL.
1.4  Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for 
capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied 
by the group, is classified as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at its 
cost, including related transaction costs and where 
applicable, borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. 
When part of an investment property is replaced, the 
carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. 
Additionally, when a property given on rent is vacated 
and the managements intention is to use the vacated 
portion for the purpose of its own business needs, 
Investment Properties are reclassified as Buildings.
Investment properties are depreciated using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives 
which is consistent with the useful lives followed for 
depreciating Property, Plant and Equipment.
1.5  Financial Instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the financial instrument and are measured 
initially at fair value adjusted by transaction costs, 
except for those carried at fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL) which are measured initially at fair 
value. However, trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component are measured at 
transaction price. Subsequent measurement of financial 
assets and financial liabilities is described below.
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, 
or when the financial asset and all substantial risks 
and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is 
derecognized when it is extinguished, discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial 
assets
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified into the following categories upon 
initial recognition:
 Amortised cost
 financial assets at FVTPL
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are 
subject to review for impairment.
Amortised cost 
A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost 
using effective interest rates if both of the following 
conditions are met:
a) the financial asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows; and
b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents, trade and 
most other receivables fall into this category of financial 
instruments.
B~LawrieW>Co.Ltd. 
227
A loss allowance for expected credit losses is 
recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost. 
Expected loss on individually significant receivables are 
considered for impairment when they are past due and 
based on Group’s historical counterparty default rates 
and forecast of macro-economic factors. Receivables 
that are not considered to be individually significant are 
segmented 
by reference to the industry and region of the 
counterparty and other shared credit risk characteristics 
to evaluate the expected credit loss. The expected 
credit loss estimate is then based on recent historical 
counterparty default rates for each identified segment. 
The Group has a diversified portfolio of trade receivables 
from its different segments. Every business segment of 
the Group has calculated provision using a single loss 
rate for its receivables using its own historical trends 
and the nature of its receivables. There are no universal 
expected loss percentages for the Group as a whole, 
The Group generally considers its receivables as 
impaired when they are 3 years past due. Considering 
the historical trends and market information, the group 
estimates that the provision computed on its trade 
receivables is not materially different from the amount 
computed using expected credit loss method prescribed 
under Ind AS 109. Since the amount of provision is not 
material for the Group as a whole, no disclosures have 
been given in respect of expected credit losses.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at FVTPL.
1.6  Inventories
Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable 
value. For this purpose, the basis of ascertainment of 
cost of the different types of inventories is as under –
a) Raw materials & trading goods, stores & spare 
parts and materials for turnkey projects on the basis 
of weighted average cost. 
b) Work-in-progress on the basis of weighted average 
cost of raw materials and conversion cost upto the 
relative stage of completion where it can be reliably 
estimated.
c) Finished goods on the basis of weighted average 
cost of raw materials, conversion cost and other 
related costs.
d) Loose Tools are written-off over the economic 
OLIH H[FHSW LWHPV FRVWLQJ XSWR ൠ ZKLFK DUH
charged off in the year of issue. 
1.7 Employee benefits
(i) Short term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries including non-
monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service 
are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid 
when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligation in 
balance sheet.
(ii) Post-employment obligations
Defined Contribution Plans
Provident Fund: the group transfers provident fund 
contributions to the trust registered for maintenance 
of the fund and has no further obligations on this 
account. These are recognised as and when they 
are due.
Superannuation Fund: the group contributes for 
eligible employees, a sum equivalent to 9% and 
8% for Executives and Officers, respectively of 
salary, to the fund administered by the trustees 
and managed by Life Insurance Corporation of 
India (LIC) (for eligible optees for LIC managed 
scheme) or to the fund administered and managed 
by the NPS Trust (for balance eligible optees for 
NPS managed scheme). The group has no further 
obligations on this account. These are recognised 
as and when they are due.
Defined Benefit Plans
Gratuity and Post Retirement Benefit plans – The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually 
by actuary using the projected unit credit method. 
Re-measurement gains and losses arising from 
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which 
they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. 
They are included in retained earnings in the 
statement of changes in equity. Changes in present 
value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from 
plan amendments or curtailments are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss as past service cost.
(iii) Other long term employee benefit obligations
The liabilities for leave encashment and long 
service awards are not expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period 
in which the employees render the related service. 
They are measured annually by actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. Re-measurement as 
a result of experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period 
in which they occur in profit or loss.
1.8  Government grants
a) 
Grants from the government are recognised 
at their fair value where there is a reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and the 
group will comply with all attached conditions.
b) 
Government grants relating to income are 
deferred and recognised in the profit or loss 
over the period necessary to match them with 
the costs that they are intended to compensate 
and presented within other income.
c) 
Government grants relating to the purchase of 
property, plant and equipment are included in 
non-current liabilities as deferred income and 
are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line 
basis over the expected lives of the related 
assets and presented within other income.
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd.

1.9 Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
 
Items included in the financial statements of each of 
the group’s entities are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The 
consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Indian rupee (INR), which is Group’s functional and 
presentation currency.
b) Transactions and balances  
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into 
the functional currency using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are 
generally recognised in profit or loss. 
c) Group companies
 
The results and financial position of foreign 
operations that have a functional currency different 
from the presentation currency are translated into 
the presentation currency as follows:
 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing 
rate at the date of that balance sheet
 Income and expenses are translated at average 
exchange rates, and
 All resulting exchange differences are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
1.10 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker.
The board of directors assesses the financial 
performance and position of the group, and makes 
strategic decisions and have identified business 
segment as its primary segment.
1.11 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Capital 
commitments
a) Provision is recognised when there is a present 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation in respect of which a reliable estimate 
can be made. Provision amount are discounted to 
their present value where the impact of time value of 
money is expected to be material.
b) Contingent liabilities are disclosed in respect of 
possible obligations that arise from past events 
but their existence is confirmed by the occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Group. 
c) Contingent 
liabilities 
pertaining 
to 
various 
government authorities are considered only on 
conversion of show cause notices issued by them 
into demand.
1.12 Intangible assets
a) Expenditure incurred for acquiring intangible assets

OLFHQVH WR XVH VRIWZDUH SHU LWHP RI ൠ DQG
above, from which economic benefits will flow over 
a period of time, is amortised over the estimated 
useful life of the asset or five years, whichever is 
earlier, from the time the intangible asset starts 
providing the economic benefit. 
b) Brand value arising on acquisition are recognised 
as an asset and are amortised on a straight line 
basis over 10 years. 
c) Goodwill on acquisition is not amortised but tested 
for impairment annually.
d) In other cases, the expenditure is charged to 
revenue in the year in which the expenditure is 
incurred. 
1.13  Accounting for Research & Development
a) Revenue Expenditure is shown 
under 
Primary 
Head of Accounts with the total of such expenditure 
being disclosed in the Notes.
b) Capital 
expenditure 
relating 
to 
research 
& 
development is treated in the same way as 
other fixed assets.
1.14 Treatment of Grant / Subsidy
a) Revenue grant/subsidy in respect of research 
& 
development 
expenditure 
is 
set 
off 
against respective expenditure.
b) Capital grant/subsidy against specific fixed assets 
is set off against the cost of those fixed assets.
c) When grant/subsidy is received as compensation 
for extra cost associated with the establishment 
of manufacturing units or cannot be related 
otherwise to any particular fixed assets the grant/
subsidy so received is credited to capital reserve. On 
expiry of the stipulated period set out in the scheme 
of grant/subsidy the same is transferred from 
capital reserve to general reserve.
d) Revenue grant in respect of organisation of certain 
events is shown under Sundry Income and the 
related expenses there against under normal heads 
of expenditure.
1.15  Impairment of assets
 
An assessment is made at each Balance Sheet date to 
determine whether there is an indication of impairment of 
the carrying amount of the fixed assets. If any indication 
exists, an asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying 
amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-
generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-
generating unit using an appropriate discount factor. 
Balmer LawrieW>Co. Ltd. 
229
1.16 Income taxes
Tax expense recognized in profit or loss comprises the 
sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs 
from profit or loss in the financial statements. Calculation 
of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability 
method on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. 
However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability unless the related 
transaction is a business combination or affects tax or 
accounting profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to their respective period of realization, 
provided those rates are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax asset (‘DTA’) is recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax 
credit and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which deductible temporary difference, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilized or to the extent of taxable temporary 
differences except: 
- 
Where the DTA relating to the deductible temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination; and at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss.
- 
in respect of deductible temporary differences 
arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches 
and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, 
to the extent that, and only to the extent that, it is 
probable that the temporary difference will reverse 
in the foreseeable future; and taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilized.
This is assessed based on the Group’s forecast of 
future operating results, adjusted for significant non-
taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the 
use of any unused tax loss or credit.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
recognised as a component of tax income or expense in 
profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are 
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity, 
respectively.
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary 
differences between the carrying amount and tax bases 
of investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates 
and interest in joint arrangements where the group is 
able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that the differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
1.17 Leases
The Group as a lessee
The Group considers whether a contract is, or contains 
a lease. A lease is defined as ‘a contract, or part of a 
contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the 
underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration’. To apply this definition, the Group 
assesses whether the contract meets three key 
evaluations of whether:
a) The contract contains an identified asset, which is 
either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly 
specified by being identified at the time the asset is 
made available to the Group. 
b) The Group has the right to obtain substantially all 
of the economic benefits from use of the identified 
asset throughout the period of use, considering its 
rights within the defined scope of the contract. 
c) The Group has the right to direct the use of the 
identified asset throughout the period of use.
Measurement and recognition of leases
At lease commencement date, the Group recognises 
a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-
use asset is measured at cost, which includes the initial 
measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct 
costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to 
dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, 
and any lease payments made in advance of the lease 
commencement date (net of any incentives received). 
The Group depreciates the right-of-use asset on a 
straight-line basis from the lease commencement date 
to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-
use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also 
assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when 
any indicators exist.
At lease commencement date, the Group measures the 
lease liability at the present value of the lease payments 
unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the 
Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments 
included in the measurement of the lease liability are 
made up of fixed payments, variable payments based 
on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable 
under a residual value guarantee and payments arising 
from options reasonably certain to be exercised.
 Subsequent to the initial measurement, the liability 
will be reduced for payments made and increased for 
interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment 
or modification, or if there are changes in fixed 
payments. When the lease liability is remeasured, the 
corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-
use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use asset is 
already reduced to zero. 
The Group has elected to account for short-term leases 
i.e. for leases for period less than 12 months and leases 
Balmer Lawrie 1> Co.Ltd. 
230
of low-value i.e. value of leased asset which is less 
WKDQൠXVLQJWKHSUDFWLFDOH[SHGLHQWV,QVWHDG
of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability, 
the payments in relation to these are recognised as an 
expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. In the Balance Sheet, right-of-use assets 
have been disclosed under non-current assets and 
lease liabilities have been disclosed under financial 
liabilities.
 The Group as a lessor
The Group classifies leases as either operating or 
finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease 
if the group transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset 
to the lessee, and classifies it as an operating lease if 
otherwise.
1.18  Revenue recognition
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance 
obligation is measured at the amount of transaction 
price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation.
Sale of goods
When the control over goods is transferred to the buyer 
and no significant uncertainty exists regarding the 
amount of consideration that is derived from the sale 
of goods.
Services rendered:
a) When control over the service rendered in full or 
part is recognized by the buyer and no significant 
uncertainty exists regarding the amount of 
consideration that is derived from rendering the 
services.
b) In case of project activities: As per the percentage 
of completion method after progress of work to 
a reasonable extent for which control can be 
transferred to the buyer. 
c) In cases where the Group collects consideration on 
account of another party, it recognises revenue as 
the net amount retained on its own account.
Other income: 
a) Interest on a time proportion basis using the 
effective Interest rate method
b) Dividend 
from 
investments 
in 
shares 
on 
establishment of the Group’s right to receive. 
c) Royalties are recognised on accrual basis in 
accordance with the substance of the relevant 
agreement.
d) Export incentives are recognised as income only at 
the time when there is no significant uncertainty as 
to its measurability and ultimate realisation.
For determining the transaction price, the Group 
measures the revenue in respect of each performance 
obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling 
price.
The group accounts for volume discounts and pricing 
incentives to a buyer as a reduction of revenue based 
on the ratable allocation of the discounts/incentives 
to each of the underlying performance obligation that 
corresponds to the progress by the buyer towards 
earning the discount/ incentive. 
Term of returns, refunds etc. are agreed with the buyers 
on a case to case basis upon mutually accepted terms 
and conditions. The impact of returns and refunds is 
negligible on the turnover of the group.
As a practical expedient, as given in Ind AS 115, the 
Group has not disclosed the remaining performance 
obligation related disclosures for contracts where 
the revenue recognized from the satisfaction of the 
performance obligation corresponds directly with 
the value to the customer of the entity’s performance 
completed to date especially in relation to those 
contracts where invoicing is on time and material basis. 
 Significant payment terms:
Payment is generally received either in cash or based 
on credit terms. Credit terms are agreed to with the 
buyers and is generally in line with the respective 
industry standards.
1.19  Borrowing Costs 
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of 
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset 
for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets 
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use or sale. Other Borrowing 
Costs are recognised as expense in the period in which 
they are incurred.
1.20  Cash Flow Statement
Cash Flow Statement, as per Ind AS – 7, is prepared 
using the indirect method, whereby profit for the 
period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a 
non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or 
future operating cash receipts or payments and items 
of income or expenses associated with investing or 
financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, 
investing and financing activities of the group are 
segregated.
1.21  Prior period Items
 Material prior period items which arise in the current 
period as a result of error or omission in the preparation 
of prior period’s financial statement are corrected 
retrospectively in the first set of financial statements 
approved for issue after their discovery by:
a) restating the comparative amounts for the prior 
period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or
b) if the error occurred before the earliest prior period 
presented, restating the opening balances of 
assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior 
period presented.

Lacs) shall be considered as material prior period 
item.
d) Retrospective restatement shall be done except 
to the extent that it is impracticable to determine 
either the period specific effects or the cumulative 
effect of the error. When it is impracticable to 
determine the period specific effects of an error 
on comparative information for one or more prior 
periods presented, the group shall restate the 
opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity 
for the earliest prior period for which retrospective 
restatement is practicable (which may be the 
current period).
1.22  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
net profit or loss (excluding other comprehensive income) 
for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the year. The weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for events 
such as bonus issue, share splits or consolidation that 
have changed the number of equity shares outstanding 
without a change in corresponding change in resources. 
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, 
the net profit or loss (excluding other comprehensive 
income) for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
and the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects 
of dilutive potential equity shares.

(vi) Extension and termination options
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options which are used for regular operations 
of its business. These options are negotiated by management to provide flexibility in managing the Group's business needs. 
Management exercises significant judgement in determining whether these extension and termination options are reasonably 
certain to be exercised.
In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to 
exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) 
are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is 
reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within 
the control of the lessee.

Note : a.  
The accounting year of all the aforesaid companies is the financial year ending March 31, 2023 except for Balmer 
Lawrie (UAE) LLC which follows accounting year as the calendar year ending December 31, 2022. Effective 
08.08.2022, Balmer Lawrie (UAE) LLC acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Elegant Industries LLC which 
is a limited liability Company registered at UAE and its financials are merged with Balmer Lawrie (UAE) LLC.
 b. Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) vide its order dated April 09, 2021 have approved the Resolution 
Plan of M/s Om Logistics Limited (Resolution Applicant in the said matter of Corporate Insolvency Resolution 
Process (CIRP) initiated upon M/s Transafe Services Limited (TSL)), wherein, the following had been approved 
upon implementation of the Resolution Plan:
i. 
The entire existing Equity Share Capital of TSL shall stand cancelled, extinguished and annulled & be regarded 
as reduction of Share Capital to the extent of 99.99997% and the remaining 0.00003% shall be required to be 
transferred to the Resolution Applicant.
ii. 
The entire existing Preference Share Capital of TSL shall stand cancelled, extinguished and annulled to the 
extent of 100% & be regarded as reduction of Capital.
Consequent to the above, the group ceased to have joint control or have any significant influence over TSL and 
TSL ceased to be a Related Party under the extant provisions of Section 2(76) the Companies Act, 2013 or under 
IND AS-110 or clause 2(1) (zb) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015. 
However, an appeal has been filed to Hon’ble National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the 
orders of Hon’ble NCLT and the matter is pending for adjudication before Hon’ble NCLAT. The investments of the 
Company (in both equity and preference shares in the said joint venture), have been unilaterally reduced by way 
of capital reduction, by the demat account service provider. The Company has been following up with the demat 
account service provider for re-instatement of the same considering that the matter is sub-judice (supra).
 c.  In one of the joint venture Company, M/s Balmer Lawrie - Van Leer Limited (BLVL), their Statutory Auditors have 
expressed qualified opinion for “non-accrual of interest on a loan from Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited (BL), 
together with the non-impairment of its investment in one of the joint venture Company M/s Transafe Services 
Limited (TSL) consequent to the orders of Hon’ble NCLAT (Refer b above) in the financial year 2020-21”. However, 
since the investments have been impaired and loan balance written back by BLVL in its books during the previous 
financial year 2021-22, the impact is Nil for the group and no further actions are required by the group.
d.  In one of the joint venture Company, M/s Balmer Lawrie (UAE) LLC, their Statutory Auditors have expressed 
qualified opinion towards (i) “provision for expected credit losses on raw material inventory done in departure to the 
B~LawrieW>Co.Ltd. 
253
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2023
applicable standards” and (ii) absence of sufficient appropriate audit evidence pertaining to provision of discounts 
to trade receivables payable to customers which were provided without any legal or constructive obligation”. 
The share of the impact in consolidated financial statements is Rs.33.65 cores. The effect of the same in the 
consolidated financial statements would have resulted in higher valuation of investment of the said joint venture. 
Following conservative approach, the same is not given effect to in the consolidated financial statements.
  e.  Since the net worth of M/s PT. Balmer Lawrie Indonesia (PTBLI) continues to be negative, hence consolidation of 
its figures is not required as per IND-AS and consequently has not been done. 
 42.2 10,56,79,350 (10,56,79,350) number of Equity Shares are held by Balmer Lawrie Investments Limited (The Holding  Company).

Company. This has been reclassified from PPE to Investment Property in the current FY with the proportionate value of 
such land amounting to Rs.54.72 Lakhs and the comparatives have also been re-classified to this extent. This was missed

The Group’s risk management other than in respect of trade receivables is carried out by a corporate department under policies 
approved in-principle by the board of directors. The policies include principles for overall risk management, as well as policies 
covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of surplus funds. Group's 
risk in respect of Trade Receivables is managed by the Chief Operating Officer of the respective Strategic Business Units.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2023
A) Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk is primarily from trade receivables and other receivables . The Holding Compnies receivables are typically 
unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers which is predominantly outstanding from sales to Government 
departments and public sector entities whose risk of default has been very low in the past. In case of other trade receivables, 
the credit risk has been managed based on continuous montitoring of credit worthiness of customers, ability to repay and their 
past track record.                                                                                                
Similarly all Group companies closely monitor their trade receivables which includes tracking the cedit worthiness of the 
customers, ability to pay, default rates, past history etc. Accordingly expected credit loss has also been computed and 
accounted for by them.
Provisions 
For Receivables
There are no universal expected loss percentages for the group as a whole. The Holding Company generally considers its 
receivables as impaired when they are 3 years past due. Considering the historical trends and market information, the Group 
estimates that the provision computed on its trade receivables is not materially different from the amount computed using 
expected credit loss method prescribed under Ind AS 109. Since the amount of provision is not material for the Group as a 
whole, no disclosures have been given in respect of expected credit losses.
For Other Financial Assets
Loans - are given to regular employees who are on the payroll of the Holding Company as per the employment terms and 
primarily secured in case of house building and vehicle loans. For other loans the amounts are well within the net dues to the 
employees and hence credit risk is taken as nil.
Deposits - represent amounts lying with customers mainly governemnt and public sector undertakings on account of security 
deposits, earnest money deposits and retention money given as per contractual terms. Based on past records the risk of 
default is minimal.
Cash & Cash equivalents - represent cash in hand and balances lying in current accounts with various consortium banks who 
have high credit ratings.
Other Bank Balances - mainly represent fixed deposits having maturities up to one year and includes accrued interest on such 
deposits. These deposits have been taken with various public and private sector banks having the high credit ratings.
B) Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from borrowings and other liablities.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due. Due to the nature of the business, 
the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed facilities. Management monitors rolling 
forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group 
takes into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity operates. In addition, the Group’s liquidity management policy 
involves considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against 
internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining short term debt financing plans.
The Group does not foresee any problems in dischargiung their liabilities towards trade payables and other current liabilities 
as and when they fall due. 
C) Market Risk
Market risk arises due to change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
1) Interest Rate Risk
The group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent of its investments in fixed deposits with banks. The Holding Company 
has also invested in preference share capital of M/s Transafe Services Limited which has been entirely provided for in the 
books of the Company (Refer Note no. 42.1(b). The Holding Company has not invested in any other instruments except equity 
investments. The Group as a whole has a very insignificant borrowing on which interest is payable and it does not foresee any 
risk in its repayment.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2023
2) Foreign Currency Risk
The Holding Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net foreign currency payables, primarily with respect to 
the US Dollar, GBP and Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency 
that is not the Holding Company’s functional currency. The Group as per its overall strategy uses forward contracts to mitigate 
its risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates on borrowings and such contracts are not designated 
as hedges under Ind AS 109.  The Group does not use forward contracts for speculative purposes.                                                                                                               
The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net foreign currency receivables on account of Dividend and 
other fees from its foreign subsidiaries and associates, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and AED . 
Some  Group Companies like Avi-Oil significantly import raw materials and is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily with 
USD & Euro which is not hedged. Similarly BLVL has business transactions involving several currencies exposing it to foreign 
currency risk arising from foreign currency receivables and payables which it manages by entering into forward contracts.
Note No. 45
Capital Management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
- to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
- to provide an adequate return to shareholders
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the 
face of balance sheet.
Management assesses the Group’s capital requirements in order to maintain an efficient overall financing structure while 
avoiding excessive leverage. This takes into account the subordination levels of the Group’s various classes of debt. The 
Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk 
characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount 
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

restructured the existing loan outstanding under Reserve Bank of India Resolution Framework for Covid 19 related stress with 
moratorium of 24 months and  repayment has commenced from September 2022 on quarterly basis.
