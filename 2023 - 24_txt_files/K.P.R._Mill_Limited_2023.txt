The concept of Sustainable business refers to the utilisation of the available 
resources in such a manner that the requirements of the future generations are 
also fully taken into account. To put it in other words the finite natural resources are 
utilised by the enterprise in a judicious manner and conserved for the future 
necessities of the enterprise, society and environment. Sustainable business 
involves the pursuit of activities and initiative to ensure that their economic 
activities not only address the current environmental concerns apart from making 
profits, but also focus on environment protection, preservation of natural 
resources, work towards social justice and equality. 
These sustainable practices are not new to K.P.R. and have been practiced ever 
since it started setting up its main business. Be it environment friendly measures, 
promotion of employee welfare, empowering downtrodden, following good 
governance etc.

Yes. The Company's manufacturing Units are compliant with Zero Liquid Discharge.
5. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
KPR has installed an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) with capabilities to treat 3 million liters/day of waste water generated from our 
dyeing process, which enables the company to reuse 100% of the treated waste water for the process again. On-site Zero Liquid 
Discharge treatment system treats and recovers almost all waste water such that the only water lost is through evaporation or as 
moisture in the sludge from treatment plant operations.
Through these measures, KPR is committed to protecting the fragile eco system of the planet, which is our gift to our children and 
our future. Our ETP stands tall as a model recycling facility in this part of the Country.
