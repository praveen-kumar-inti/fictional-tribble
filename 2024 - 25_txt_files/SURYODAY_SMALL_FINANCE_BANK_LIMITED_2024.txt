As we continue to explore the principles of ESG, it becomes increasingly evident that this journey is not optional-it is essential 
to our very existence. Even if the immediate outcomes appear modest, our role as a responsible organization and a proactive 
member of the financial ecosystem compels us to move forward. We are dedicated to taking meaningful actions that 
contribute to addressing global challenges, such as climate change, and to driving progress toward a more sustainable 
future. We have already initiated several steps, including digitizing processes to reduce paper usage, promoting the use of 
sustainable glass bottles over plastic ones, and installing light sensors in restrooms to conserve energy.
