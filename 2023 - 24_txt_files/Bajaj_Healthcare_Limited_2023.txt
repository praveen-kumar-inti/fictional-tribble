Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report of the Company, I am pleased to share our unwavering commitment 
to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, which are integral to our business strategy and operations.
ESG Challenges:
In our journey towards sustainability, we face several challenges, including managing the environmental impacts of our operations, 
ensuring the health and safety of our employees and workers, and maintaining robust governance practices across our value chain. 
Adapting to the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and meeting the evolving expectations of our stakeholders also present 
ongoing challenges. Additionally, the transition to more sustainable business practices requires continuous investment in new 
technologies and processes, which can be resource-intensive.
ESG Targets:
To address these challenges, we have set ambitious targets that align with our long-term sustainability goals. We aim to achieve Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) across all our manufacturing units, further reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and continue to eliminate 
hazardous waste landfilling in the foreseeable future. We are also focused on enhancing our energy efficiency through initiatives such 
as the installation of solar panels, replacing old insulation to prevent heat loss, and transitioning to LED lighting across our facilities. On 
the social front, we are committed to ensuring the well-being of our employees and workers by providing access to comprehensive 
healthcare services, maintaining a safe and healthy work environment, and offering transition assistance programs.
ESG Achievements:
We are proud of the significant progress we have made in our ESG journey. Our Panoli unit has already achieved ZLD status, and we are 
actively working to extend this achievement to other units. We have successfully implemented several projects to reduce our carbon 
footprint, including the installation of solar panels, the replacement of mercury vapor lamps with LED lights, and the promotion 
of indoor and outdoor plantation to improve air quality. Our commitment to waste management has resulted in the elimination 
of hazardous waste landfilling and the responsible disposal of plastic, e-waste, and other hazardous materials in compliance with 
regulatory standards.
In conclusion, while the path to sustainability is challenging, it is one we are committed to navigating with determination and 
responsibility. We remain focused on achieving our ESG targets and continuously improving our practices to create long-term value 
for our stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available, provide a 
web-link to the policy.
Yes, the Company has established a comprehensive anti-bribery policy as part of its Code of Conduct, reflecting the Company’s 
unwavering commitment to ethical business practices and adherence to all relevant anti-bribery laws.
The policy applies to all employees of the Company, including those who are permanent, temporary, or on contract, as well as those 
working through contractors, retainers, or as full-time consultants. Additionally, it covers members of the Board of Directors. This broad 
application ensures that every individual associated with the Company is held to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior.
The anti-bribery policy specifically prohibits the acceptance of gifts, presents, or gratuities of more than nominal value from suppliers 
or customers. Such practices are viewed as serious breaches of discipline, as they can create conflicts of interest and potentially 
compromise the Company’s interests. Employees and directors are expected to avoid any actions that could undermine the Company’s 
reputation or integrity.
The policy also extends to the Company’s business partners, including suppliers, service providers, agents, and channel partners such 
as dealers and distributors. These partners are required to adhere to the same principles of integrity and ethical conduct outlined in 
the policy.
To ensure effective implementation and compliance, the Company conducts regular internal reviews and provides ongoing training to 
all personnel. This proactive approach helps to reinforce the policy’s principles and address any potential issues promptly.

by higher management or an ethics committee, which assesses the nature and implications of the conflict. The review process involves 
determining appropriate actions to address and mitigate the conflict, which may include measures such as recusal from specific 
decisions or activities where the conflict arises. The Company continuously monitors and reassesses potential conflicts, providing 
regular updates and training to ensure that all personnel are aware of their responsibilities and the procedures for managing conflicts.

The Company implements a comprehensive approach to identifying work-related hazards and assessing risks, both on a routine 
and non-routine basis, as part of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS).
For routine hazard identification and risk assessment, it conducts regular inspections and audits of the occupational health 
and safety management systems. These inspections are carried out systematically by the qualified safety officers, who use 
detailed checklists and established protocols to evaluate the safety of the work environments and practices. Each unit within

safety procedures. These internal reviews involve thorough evaluations of work processes, safety practices, and equipment to

insights into day-to-day operational risks that may not be immediately apparent through formal inspections.
For non-routine hazard identification and risk assessment, the Company employs Job Safety Analysis (JSA) for specific tasks that are 
outside of routine operations or involve new activities. This analysis involves a detailed examination of the task to identify potential 
hazards and implement control measures before the task is performed. Additionally, when introducing new processes, equipment, 
or changes to existing operations, it conducts thorough risk assessments to evaluate potential hazards. This ensures that any new 
or modified activity does not introduce new risks or compromise existing safety measures. The Company also continuously assess 
risks related to emergency situations by conducting drills and simulations, which helps to identify potential gaps in the emergency 
preparedness and response plans. These assessments allows to make necessary adjustments to effectively handle unforeseen events.
Overall, Company’s approach to hazard identification and risk assessment is dynamic and integrative, combining routine

measures are implemented swiftly.
Additionally, the procedures include provisions for workers to remove themselves from hazardous situations without fear

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
The Company utilizes a structured approach to consult stakeholders on economic, environmental, and social matters through the 
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee. This Committee is established in line with Regulation 20 of the Listing Regulations and Section 
178 of the Companies Act. Its primary role involves addressing and resolving shareholder and investor concerns, such as issues related 
to dividends, annual reports, share transfers, and other shareholder services. The Committee also oversees share transfer processes and 
ensures that effective voting rights are facilitated for shareholders.
Feedback from stakeholders is managed through a comprehensive communication process. Departmental heads engage regularly 
with both internal and external stakeholders, and these insights are shared with senior management. Senior management then reports 
to the Board, ensuring that stakeholder concerns are integrated into strategic decision-making. The CSR Committee also plays a crucial 
role by maintaining regular contact with local communities to address their concerns and issues effectively.
For shareholders and investors, the Company provides a dedicated communication channel at investors@bajajhealth.com. This allows 
for direct submission of queries and feedback. All received feedback is documented, reviewed, and addressed by the relevant teams, 
with summaries and actions reported to the Board. This systematic approach ensures that stakeholder feedback is considered in 
decision-making processes and that necessary actions are taken to address concerns effectively.

The Company has implemented advanced water management practices across its operations. One of its units operates as a Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facility, ensuring that all wastewater is effectively treated and reused within the unit. For the remaining units, 
Effluent Treatment Plants are in place, where wastewater is either recycled and reused or sent to a third party for treatment. The 
Company is dedicated to maintaining detailed quantitative data on water discharge and will ensure comprehensive and transparent 
reporting in the coming years.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) If yes, name 
of the external agency.
During the FY, the Company has not undertaken any independent assessment/evaluation/assurance of the data disclosed.
5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
Yes, the Company has implemented a comprehensive mechanism at several manufacturing sites to address wastewater management. 
At these locations, it has established advanced effluent treatment plants (ETPs) that are specifically designed to treat the wastewater 
generated during production processes. The treated water undergoes a stringent purification process, ensuring that it meets the 
required standards for safe reuse within the facility. This treated water is then repurposed for various ancillary operations, including 
site gardening, cooling towers, and other non-potable uses, significantly reducing our reliance on fresh water and minimizing our 
environmental footprint.
A notable example is the Panoli unit, which operates as a full ZLD facility. At this site, no liquid waste is discharged into the environment, 
aligning with the commitment to sustainable and responsible manufacturing practices. In addition, the Company is actively exploring 
and implementing enhancements to the ETP capabilities at other units with the goal of achieving ZLD status across more of the 
locations. This initiative is part of the broader environmental sustainability strategy, which seeks to minimize waste, conserve resources, 
and reduce the overall environmental impact.
