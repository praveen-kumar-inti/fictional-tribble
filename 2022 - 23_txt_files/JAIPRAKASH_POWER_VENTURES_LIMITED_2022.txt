ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
The Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between a business's 
financial performance and its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. By encouraging the disclosure of 
non-financial information, the BRSR enables regulators, investors, and stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding 
of a company's overall business stability, growth, and sustainability. This comprehensive reporting framework goes beyond 
financial metrics, providing valuable insights into a company's ESG commitments, risk management practices, social impact, 
and environmental stewardship. By emphasizing the importance of non-financial disclosure, the BRSR promotes transparency, 
accountability, and the integration of sustainable practices into a company's core operations.

Risk
Economic downturns or periods 
of slow growth can lead to 
reduced energy demand from 
industrial, 
commercial, 
and 
residential sectors. Decreased 
energy demand can affect the 
revenue and profitability of power 
companies,

Statement by Director, responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the 
placement of this disclosure)
JP Power Ventures Ltd. firmly acknowledges the risks is not only a moral imperative but also a critical business strategy for our long-term success and sustainability.The power sector 
plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of our planet. While it is essential for meeting the energy demands of a growing population, it also carries significant responsibilities towards 
minimizing environmental impact, promoting social well-being, and upholding high standards of governance. Failing to address these issues adequately can lead to reputational 
damage, legal repercussions, and financial instability, all of which can hinder our progress as a responsible and forward-thinking industry leader.
ESG considerations encompass a broad range of factors, including but not limited to climate change mitigation, energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, pollution control, 
community engagement, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and ethical business practices. Each of these aspects poses unique challenges and risks that we must proactively 
address.
The company is committed to ensuring that operations align with the principles of sustainability and responsible stewardship. To this end, the Company is implementing robust ESG risk 
management frameworks, conduct regular assessments of our environmental and social impact, and promote transparency and accountability throughout our organization. Moreover, 
the Company will also seek to collaborate with industry partners, policymakers, and communities to drive positive change and find innovative solutions to complex challenges.
Recognizing the significance of ESG considerations in the power sector, the company will allocate the necessary resources and expertise to enhance our capabilities in this domain. 
The company will invest in research and development, foster a culture of continuous learning, and empower our employees to actively contribute to our ESG goals.
By addressing the ESG related risks and challenges in the power sector,the company is not only safeguarding their own future but also fulfilling our duty to the planet and the 
communities we serve. Together, let us embark on this transformative journey, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to sustainable practices, responsible growth, and a brighter 
future for generations to come.

The company maintains ISO 14001 certification at all its sites, which ensures the implementation of safe waste management 
practices. External auditors conduct audits to verify ongoing compliance and adherence to environmental standards.
	
At thermal power plants, hazardous waste is collected and stored in empty drums and barrels, which are then kept in a 
covered shed within an isolated and fenced area. This storage method follows the guidelines outlined in the Hazardous 
Waste (Management, Handling, and Transboundary Movement) Rules. The stored hazardous waste is subsequently sent to 
Authorized Recyclers for proper disposal. Additionally, both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated at these plants 
are disposed of in accordance with the consent conditions set by the MPPCB (Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board).
	
At the Vishnuprayag plant, hazardous and toxic waste is handed over to Authorized Agencies specialized in disposal. Bio-
medical waste is appropriately disposed of in a pit, which is approved by the Nagar Palika (Municipal Council) of Joshimath.
	
For the Amelia Coal Mines, the reception, collection, and storage of hazardous waste strictly adhere to the Hazardous Waste 
(Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules of 2016. The hazardous waste generated is collected in 210-litre drums/
barrels and stored in a designated covered storage shed that has an impervious lining, ensuring containment. The personnel 
working on-site are provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) for their safety, and fire-fighting arrangements are in 
place to mitigate any potential risks.
	
Overall, these measures and procedures demonstrate the sites' commitment to responsible waste management and 
compliance with environmental regulations. Through the implementation of these practices, the sites aim to minimize the 
environmental impact associated with waste generation and disposal, promoting sustainable and environmentally conscious 
operations.

The company ensures that all sites of JPVL are ISO 45001 certified and possess well-established Disaster Management 
Plans. Specifically, JNSTPP has an approved On-Site Emergency Plan in place. The company has formulated the emergency 
planning of the plant to ensure that, despite all precautionary measures, personnel are capable of effectively handling any 
potential disaster and obtaining necessary help and assistance to minimize losses. Ongoing training on On-Site Emergency 
Plans is provided to all employees through TNI. To enhance preparedness, emergency contact numbers for Fire, Hospital, 
and CCR are prominently displayed at various locations within the facilities. The initiation of the On-Site Disaster Management 
Plan is signaled by raising the alarm or alert. Any employee who notices an unusual event, such as a fire, or release of 
flammable liquids, or chlorine, is responsible for raising the alarm or informing someone who can do so promptly. Given 
that the plant operates round the clock with constant occupation, visual detection and alarm-raising measures are easily 
accessible. The company has implemented a Crisis/Disaster Management Plan that complies with ISO 14001 standards. 
This plan is overseen by a 12-member Crisis/Disaster Management Committee, with the Director serving as the Chairman. 
Regular mock drills are conducted to simulate various contingencies, including floods, earthquakes, fires, and terrorist 
attacks, ensuring preparedness and effective response capabilities.
