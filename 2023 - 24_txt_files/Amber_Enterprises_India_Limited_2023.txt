Product 
quality & 
safety
Product quality and safety is not merely a 
legal and ethical obligation for a business. 
Ensuring product quality and safety 
provides a valuable opportunity to enhance 
brand reputation, increase customer trust 
and win competitive advantage over peers.
Positive:
Prioritising product 
quality and safety 
can lead to increased 
revenue and profitability 
as a result of improved 
operational efficiency, 
reduced risk of recalls, 
and enhanced market 
share.
Ethics & 
compliance
Ethics and compliance are critical 
consideration for our business. Prioritising 
legal compliance, ethical leadership, and 
fair business practices, helps build trust 
among stakeholders and mitigate business 
risk which are essential for long-term 
business success.
Positive:
Promoting ethics & 
compliance within 
business strategy 
can help to mitigate 
financial losses or 
liabilities, improve risk 
management, respond 
effectively to market 
transitions and gain 
stakeholder trust.
Research & 
development 
Research & development is crucial 
for business innovation and growth, 
development of new products and 
improvement of existing products and 
processes. R&D creates significant 
opportunities in terms of competitive 
advantage, generation of new revenue 
streams through diversified product 
portfolio, and improved operational and 
resource efficiency.
Positive:
Undertaking R&D 
activities can be slightly 
expensive in the short 
term, however, a sound 
long-term R&D strategy 
can significantly 
contribute towards 
business growth 
through increased 
revenues (development 
of new products 
and technologies), 
improved efficiency 
of manufacturing 
processes, competitive 
advantage etc.

Climate action
Climate change has a significant impact on 
businesses. There are several risks that a 
business can face due to climate change 
including physical risk, regulatory risk, 
financial risk, and reputational risk.
GHG Emission and energy management 
are key essential climate actions that 
businesses can take up to reduce their 
carbon footprints. Additionally, resource 
depletion and environmental degradation 
poses the risk of resource availability for 
businesses and may affect their operations.
To mitigate risks 
associated with climate 
change and take the 
opportunities presented 
by climate change, 
Amber has adopted 
a strategic approach 
to sustainability, to 
continuously monitor and 
track our environmental 
performance. Amber 
has taken the following 
mitigation measures as 
part of its climate action 
strategy:
1.  Adopting climate-
resilient and clean 
technologies in 
business operations 
and processes
2.  Implement energy 
efficiency measures 
across all the facilities
3.  Invest in renewable 
energy sources such 
as solar to reduce 
reliance on non-
renewable sources
4.  Investments in research 
and development to 
manufacture climate-
resilient products and 
services
5.  Responsible utilisation 
of resources and 
minimization of 
environmental impact 
of business
Negative:
In case of failure to 
manage risks associated 
with climate change, a 
business may experience 
financial losses, damage 
to reputation and loss of 
competitive advantage.

Occupational 
health and 
safety
Occupational health and safety (OHS) is 
an important focus area of our business to 
create a safer and healthier workplace for 
our people.
Amber aims to ensure zero time loss 
due to workplace accidents or injuries. 
Company has adopted comprehensive 
OHS strategy, which includes workplace 
hazard identification and assessment, 
implementation of hazard controls, OHS 
awareness and training, along with regular 
audits.
We conduct regular 
safety trainings for all 
our employees and 
workers. A Gemba Walk 
is performed by Plant 
Heads and entire team 
across our manufacturing 
facilities, and we also 
conduct monthly 
hygiene audits. We have 
immediate access to and 
tie-ups with hospitals in 
case of any unfortunate 
incident and ensure 
all our workforce is 
covered under medical 
insurance. A fire brigade 
and an internal team of 
trained first aiders are 
available at each of the 
manufacturing facilities. 
Safety committees are 
formulated at each 
facility and quarterly 
safety mock drills are 
conducted for hands-on 
experience in case of any 
mishaps.
Positive:
Investing in OHS helps to 
create a safe and healthy 
workplace. It promotes 
well-being of employee 
and reduces the risk of 
workplace accidents and 
inquires while gaining 
business benefits such 
as improved productivity, 
reduced liability costs 
(medical expenses, 
compensation claims or 
potential legal liabilities) 
and production loss, 
enhanced employee 
satisfaction, improved 
stakeholder relationship 
(employee, investor, 
regulators etc.) and 
overall enhanced brand 
reputation.
In case of any incident, 
we share the complete 
learnings and preventive 
& corrective measures 
taken across the entire 
amber group so that each 
plant takes proactive 
measure to avoid any 
future recurrence.
Labor and 
human rights
Labour and human rights are essential 
components of any business, as they 
impact the well-being and dignity of 
workers and employees.
As a responsible business entity, Amber 
respects and promotes labor and human 
rights across its operations and value 
chain. We prohibit child labor, forced labor 
and discrimination of any kind over caste, 
creed, religion, colour, or gender.
We make sure that all our workers and 
employees have fair pay, safe working 
conditions, and the ability to engage in 
collective bargaining.
Every manufacturing 
location at Amber has 
a dedicated HR Team 
which ensures Labour 
& Human rights are well 
adhered and provide 
cohesive atmosphere to 
mitigate risks ensuring 
motivated culture is in 
place.
Positive:
In addition, being ethical 
and legal obligations 
but also have significant 
benefits for business 
such as increased 
employee satisfaction, 
improved industrial 
relations and reputation, 
reduced legal and 
financial risks.

Environmental 
management
Environment management is necessary 
due to a growing concern for the protection 
of natural resources and environmental 
surroundings. Environmental management 
provides valuable opportunities for any 
business to reduce operational costs, 
minimise environmental footprint and 
comply with regulations.
Positive:
Environmental 
management practices 
involve upfront costs; 
however, the long-
term benefits far 
outweigh these costs. 
By improving efficiency, 
reducing operational 
costs, complying 
with regulations, 
and attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers, 
a business can improve 
its financial performance 
and competitiveness in 
the marketplace.
Material 
handling 
and waste 
management
Material handling and waste management 
are two interlinked areas that businesses 
can prioritise to reduce their environmental 
impact and improve their sustainability 
performance.
Material handling helps minimise waste 
generation by optimising the use of raw 
materials, while waste management 
ensures compliance with environmental 
regulations and minimises the impact of 
waste on the environment.
Implementation of an effective 
management process for waste and 
materials can lead to cost savings and 
increased productivity.
Positive:
Effective material 
handling and waste 
management can help 
businesses save costs 
savings on raw materials 
sourcing. Also, it provides 
significant opportunities 
for businesses to drive 
innovation and improve 
brand reputation.

Supply Chain 
Management
Supply chain management can be a 
significant risk factor for businesses, 
particularly for those that rely heavily on 
their supply chains to operate. Some of the 
key risks posed by supply chain are:
•  Strategy risk: The risk Risk of losing 
confidential information such as trade 
secrets, ideas, and intellectual property
•  Financial risk: The financial health of 
value chain partners determines the 
continuity of their operations.
•  Compliance risk: Adherence to 
compliances by value chain partners
•  Operational risk: Whether value chain 
partners have adequate resources.
To mitigate supply chain 
risks, businesses should 
have robust supply chain 
management strategy, 
diversified supplier base 
and regular monitoring of 
the supply chain.
On the similar line, a 
Amber, we have adopted 
number of measures to 
mitigate risks associated 
with supply chain, some 
of which include:
•  Group-wide standard 
procurement 
procedures are 
implemented
•  Sourcing teams are 
trained to ensure and 
maintain data accuracy 
and sanity
•  Use of technology and 
digital transformation 
tools for forward 
and reverse auction, 
vendor portals, quality 
management to 
evaluate and mitigate 
the strategic and 
compliance risks.
Negative:
Risk associated with 
supply chain can have 
significant financial 
implications. Disruptions 
in supply chain can result 
increased operational 
costs and loss of 
revenue. Additionally, 
supply chain disruptions 
that arise from ethical or 
legal violations can lead 
to legal and regulatory 
costs, fines, and legal 
liabilities.
Community 
relations
Community relations refers to the 
interaction and relationships that a 
business has with communities in areas 
which it operates. This involves engaging 
with local stakeholders and community

Statement by Director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure): 
With our diverse business portfolio spanning across various geographies 
in India, we very well recognise the potential ESG challenges and risks 
associated with the same. Therefore, we are diligently working towards 
enhancing, standardising, and amplifying our ESG performance across 
Amber Group. In alignment with our sustainability strategy, our initiatives 
are structured around the three pillars of sustainability: Environmental 
Sustainability, Empowering People and Society, and Responsible 
Governance. As part of our environmental responsibility, we are focusing 
on increasing the share of renewable energy consumption, monitoring 
and reducing air emissions by transitioning to cleaner fuels. Furthermore, 
we are implementing strategies to minimise waste and materials through 
reduction, reuse, and recycling efforts and by innovating and developing 
new products with more energy efficiency. We are also conscientious 
about freshwater consumption, particularly in regions facing water 
scarcity. On the social aspect, we are committed to empowering both 
internal and external stakeholders. We prioritise providing a safe, 
nurturing, and healthy working environment for our employees and 
workers. Furthermore, through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives, we are dedicated to uplifting vulnerable communities around 
our business operations. For the financial year 2023-24, our focus on the 
governance aspect has centred on the integration of an ESG strategy for 
which we adopted a top-down leadership approach. This includes the 
establishment of a Sustainability Governance Committee and working 
group, tasked with driving the ESG agenda across the organisation at 
all levels. These measures ensure that sustainability remains a priority 
in our business practices, enabling us to create positive impacts for the 
environment, society, and governance structures.
At Amber Group, we truly believe that sustainability is not just a 
responsibility but also a driver of innovation and long-term success. 
Our stakeholders’ continued support and partnership are crucial as 
we navigate through these transformative times. We are committed to 
growing the business more sustainably and responsibly in the years to 
come. Our ESG report is an attempt from Amber Group to hold more 
accountability, ensure more transparency, and entail more responsibility 
to serve our stakeholders better.

Psychrometric Labs.
2.	
Air-to-Water Heat Pump Performance and Reliability Labs set up 
to optimise design and development, especially for the European 
market
3.	
Fan performance curve optimisation (with and without porous 
media application) is done based on CFD analysis under Ansys 3D 
simulation software.
4.	
Refrigerant side pressure drop estimation inside Evaporator and 
Condenser considering 2-phase refrigerant flow co-relations and 
optimization using the experimental data.
5.	
Heating Capacity and COP enhancement for Air-to-Air Heat Pumps 
by the analysis of frosting in case of Low Ambient Temperature 
condition, specifically for markets in Canada and USA.
6.

The Company Company is making significant investments to improve 
efficiency of its various operations by adopting new technologies and 
improving manufacturing processes to improve the environmental and 
social outcomes of its business. Some of the key highlights from these 
investments are shared as follows:
	
Transparent PU sheets have been installed at the Rajpura Plant for 
the purpose of saving electricity during the day time. 
	
500 KW Capacity Solar Panel has been installed in Rajpura Plant/
R&D.
	
At our Ever plant, we replaced standard 100-Watt street lights 
with solar street lights to cut down excess electricity usage. We 
also conducted energy audits and controlled electricity use with 
multi-event timers in office and canteen areas for improved energy 
efficiency.
	
At our Amber Sricity plant, we are operating electrical motors over 
0.75 KW with air conditioners to minimize operational losses. 
We are also implementing closed-circuit process control where 
applicable, e.g., cooling tower fan motors are being interlocked with 
temperature to prevent unnecessary operation. 
	
At Supa, we achieved a 10% reduction in electricity consumption for 
ETP by mixing chemicals with compressed air.
	
At Dehradun plant, we enabled efficient ventilation control through 
automation for improved energy management.
	
Transparent PU sheets are installed at the Rajpura Plant for the 
purpose of saving electricity in day time. 
	
The duct design for reliability laboratories was upgraded to reuse 
wasted outdoor room energy, resulting in monthly energy savings of 
2700 KWH.
	
25 motion sensors were installed within the R&D premises to save 
energy and reduce lighting costs.
	
Fresh air evaporative coolers were used to replace air-conditioners 
in the R&D office area, resulting in approximately 50% energy 
savings due to reduced heat load.
	
Energy was saved by installing UPS for psychrometric laboratories 
to prevent power interruptions during sudden grid power failures.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
	
The Company is firmly committed to decarbonising its business operations and processes by enhancing its efforts 
to reduce energy consumption and emissions. The Company strives to achieve carbon neutrality by transitioning to 
renewable energy, cleaner transportation, and the adoption of targeted energy reduction programs throughout the 
organisation in the coming years. Some of the initiatives undertaken by the Company in alignment with its carbon 
neutrality strategy include the installation of solar panels, which has effectively reduced electricity consumption from 
non-renewable sources, the targeted use of electric forklifts and stackers inside plant premises in place of diesel 
forklifts, and continual operational innovation and improvements to obtain energy efficiency. Furthermore, regular 
monitoring of air quality for processes and DG stacks is also carried out through NABL-certified laboratories every 
quarter, and we have also moved towards environmentally friendly retrofitting of our existing DG sets with PNG dual 
kits. The transition to repurposed PNG-based generators contributes to a significant decrease in diesel usage and a 
reduction in the release of pollutants like NOx and CO2. Moving forward, the Company plans to introduce CNG-powered 
trucks and phase out old diesel-powered vehicles. Additionally, we aim to use electric vehicles within plant premises 
and improve operations and processes for better energy efficiency.
