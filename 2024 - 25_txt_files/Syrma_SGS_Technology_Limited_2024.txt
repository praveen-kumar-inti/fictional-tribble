5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
We have a Grievance Redressal Policy aimed at providing employees with a structured mechanism to raise concerns 
related to their employment and workplace. The policy ensures that all grievances are addressed promptly and fairly, in 
alignment with the organisation’s related policies.
	
All grievances can be submitted via phone, mail, or letter. 
	
For intradepartmental grievances, the immediate supervisor or reporting manager will address the issue. In the case of 
interdepartmental grievances, the immediate supervisor or reporting manager will escalate the matter to the Functional 
Head. The Functional Head will discuss the grievance with the Functional Head of the employee involved and address 
the concerns accordingly. If the grievance pertains to personal matters regarding an individual, the Functional Head may 
decide to involve the Head of Human Resources for further intervention.
	
For any major grievances, discussions will be recorded and managed by the Head of Human Resources (HED). The HED 
will also consult with the concerned Functional Head and Head of Department (HOD) for all significant grievances or 
complaints. Major grievances will be handled with a thorough inquiry, and judgments will be based on the findings of 
the proceedings.
	
Minor grievances will not be formally recorded unless the aggrieved employee requests to have them documented 
or submits a letter regarding the issue. These minor grievances will be resolved within 7 working days, while major 
grievances will be addressed within 15 working days. Management will always refer to Syrma SGS’s Standing Orders 
for guidance on all grievance-related matters.
