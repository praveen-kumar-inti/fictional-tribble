Product 
innovation and 
quality
Opportunity
Customer preferences 
and needs are constantly 
evolving, and a Company 
that fails to keep up 
with these changes 
may find itself losing 
customers. In a highly 
competitive market, a 
company that does not 
innovate risks losing its 
competitive edge to its 
rivals. By introducing new 
and improved products, 
a company can stay 
ahead of its competitors 
and capture a larger 
share of the market.
Companies that are 
known for their innovative 
products
are often seen as more 
dynamic, progressive,
and forward-thinking.

Operational Landscape
GLOBAL ECONOMY REVIEW
The global economic outlook for FY 2025–26 reflects 
a landscape of cautious optimism amidst persistent 
challenges. According to the International Monetary 
Fund’s April 2025 World Economic Outlook, global real 
GDP growth is projected to moderate from 3.2% in 2024 
to 2.8% in 2025, before stabilising around 3.1% over the 
medium term. This trajectory underscores a slower 
but steady post-pandemic recovery, influenced by 
shifting trade patterns, tightening financial conditions, 
and evolving geopolitical alignments.
Advanced economies are expected to continue 
their subdued recovery, with growth inching up from 
1.6% in 2024 to 1.7% in 2025, and marginally higher 
at 1.8% by 2026. This muted expansion is shaped 
by high interest rates, sluggish productivity growth, 
and demographic constraints in several developed 
markets.
On the other hand, emerging markets and developing 
economies (EMDEs) are forecast to grow at 4.2% 
in 2025, a slight moderation from 4.3% in 2024, but 
still significantly ahead of advanced economies. 
Strong domestic demand, improved labour markets, 
and investment in digital infrastructure continue to 
be growth drivers for EMDEs. However, inflationary 
pressures and currency volatility pose ongoing risks.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Annexure - VII
Global inflation, while easing, remains elevated 
in some regions. The IMF projects headline global 
inflation to decline to 5.9% in 2025, down from 6.8% 
in 2023, with advanced economies seeing a faster 
disinflation compared to developing counterparts. 
Core inflation, especially in services, remains sticky 
due to wage growth and supply-side disruptions.
The report also highlights the continued impact 
of geoeconomic fragmentation, energy security 
concerns, and rising trade restrictions. These structural 
shifts are leading economies to re-evaluate supply 
chains, invest in domestic capabilities, and transition 
toward digital and green economies—factors likely 
to reshape global growth contours over the next 
decade.
Despite these concerns, the global economy remains 
resilient, supported by robust household consumption 
in some markets, sustained government spending, 
and a gradual recovery in global trade volumes. 
The baseline scenario remains one of a soft landing, 
though downside risks such as conflict escalation, 
financial instability, and climate-related shocks 
could challenge this trajectory.
