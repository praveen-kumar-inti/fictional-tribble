Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
As part of its commitment to responsible end-of-life vehicle (ELV) management and circular economy, Maruti Suzuki India 
Limited (MSIL), in collaboration with Toyota Tsusho Group, has established a joint venture—Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India 
Private Limited (MSTI). This facility, located in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, is a state-of-the-art ELV dismantling and recycling unit 
focused on safe, sustainable, and environmentally sound processing of vehicles at the end of their life. The initiative ensures 
structured dismantling, material recovery, and safe disposal in line with regulatory standards and global best practices.
	
MSTI follows specific processes for the handling of different waste streams generated during ELV management, as 
outlined below:
	
(a)	
Plastics (including packaging):
	
	
Plastic components recovered during ELV dismantling are segregated and sent to Pollution Control Board-authorised 
recyclers for further processing. These plastics are typically converted into granules for reuse in non-critical applications. 
Additionally, MSIL complies with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) for packaging plastics. Plastic packaging waste generated from spare parts and service operations is handled 
by authorised waste partners.
	
(b)	 E-waste:
	
	
Electronic components such as sensors and control modules extracted from ELVs are treated as per the E-Waste 
(Management) Rules, 2022. These are collected and transferred to certified e-waste recyclers for safe processing and, 
where applicable, material recovery. All handling is carried out in a compliant and environmentally secure manner.
Maruti Suzuki India Limited  |  Annual Integrated Report 2024-25
268
	
(c)	
Hazardous waste:
	
	
Hazardous materials, including used oil, coolants, automotive fluids, and refrigerants, are carefully drained and stored 
following prescribed safety protocols before dismantling. These are then handed over to authorised recyclers/ handlers 
in compliance with the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. MSIL 
prioritizes minimising environmental risks by adhering strictly to national guidelines and industry best practices.
	
(d)	 Other waste:
	
	
Ferrous and non-ferrous metals recovered from ELVs are directed to registered recyclers for material recovery. All 
dismantling and material recovery operations are conducted at MSTI’s dedicated facility to ensure safety, compliance, 
and maximum resource efficiency.
4.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has adopted a comprehensive and environmentally responsible waste management strategy, based on 
Suzuki’s core philosophy of sho-sho-kei-tan-bi — “smaller, fewer, lighter, shorter, and beauty.” For over a decade, the 
Company has successfully practiced ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’, consistently maximising recycling, minimising environmental 
impact, and promoting industrial symbiosis. Aligned with its sustainability vision, the Company integrates key circular 
economy principles—eliminating waste, applying the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) across it’s operations. The key 
waste management practices includes:
•	 Hazardous and Toxic Waste Includes used oil, sludge, solvents, contaminated containers, and tyres. These are securely 
stored and sent to authorised co-processing or treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). Saleable hazardous 
materials are routed to certified recyclers in full regulatory compliance.
•	 Non-Hazardous, Recyclable & Miscellaneous Waste: Covers dry industrial scrap, packaging materials, thermocol, 
wooden pallets, glass, paper, plastics, and metals. All materials are segregated at source and sent to authorised recyclers 
for resource recovery. Office paper is minimised through digitalization.
•	 Organic Waste: Food and horticulture waste is processed in in-house composting units and biogas plants. Compost 
supports landscaping, while biogas is used as a clean energy source, reinforcing nutrient and energy circularity.
•	 Electronic Waste (E-waste): Obsolete IT equipment and electronics are disposed of via certified e-waste recyclers, 
ensuring safe handling and material recovery.
•	 Construction & Demolition (C&D) Waste: Debris from infrastructure activities is transferred to authorised C&D processors 
for responsible recycling or disposal.
	
Through this structured, multi-stream approach, the Company is not only able to practice Zero Waste to Landfill 
commitment but also sets a benchmark in circular industrial practices, reaffirming its leadership in sustainable 
waste management.

Case related to after-market sale of spare parts: An investigation 
was initiated by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 
2011 against a few car manufacturing companies wherein it was 
contended that these companies were not making genuine spare 
parts of automobiles freely available in the open market. CCI later 
expanded the scope of investigation to the MSIL as well as other 
car manufacturing companies. In the final order passed by the CCI 
on 25th August 2014, certain directions were laid down against the 
automobile companies and penalties were imposed. A penalty 
of I 4,711.4 million was imposed on the company. The Company 
contested this matter before the Delhi High Court primarily on the 
ground that it was not a named party in the investigation and that the 
investigation ought not to have been conducted against it. On the 
contrary, the Company was named in the information given by the 
informant stating that MSIL made spare parts easily accessible in 
the open market. The Delhi High Court, on 16th May 2019, disposed 
the petition stating that the MSIL had alternative remedies available. 
Thereafter, it filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court 
of India, wherein a stay on the CCI’s order was granted. The stay is 
continuing and the matter is pending adjudication
No. The Company does not 
agree with the observation by 
CCI. The order is stayed by

Competition 
Commission of 
India (CCI)
Matter relating to alleged discount control practices: An 
investigation was initiated suo-moto by the CCI in February 2019 
based on the information provided by a purported dealer of the MSIL. 
The dealer alleged that the Company resorts to anti-competitive 
discount control practices. The CCI passed its final order on 23rd 
August 2021 and held that the Company indulged in anti-competitive 
discount control practices (re-sale price maintenance) and imposed 
a penalty of I 2,000 million on MSIL. The Company filed an appeal 
against the CCI’s order before the National Company Law Appellate 
Tribunal (NCLAT), wherein on 22nd November 2021, a stay on the 
CCI’s order was granted subject to the deposit of I 200 million. The 
stay is continuing and the matter is pending adjudication.
No. The Company does not 
agree with the observation 
by CCI. The order is stayed 
by NCLAT.

Limitation(s) and Exclusions
The assurance process for Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) conducted by Bureau Veritas for the financial year (FY) 2024-25, 
includes a reasonable level of assurance for BRSR Core Indicators and a limited level of assurance for other BRSR disclosures. 
The following limitations and exclusions apply to the assurance engagement:
•	 Materiality Threshold: The assurance considers an uncertainty of ±5% for estimation or measurement errors and omissions, 
based on the materiality threshold.
•	 Exclusion of Financial Data: Bureau Veritas did not evaluate or assess MSIL’s financial data or performance. For BRSR Core 
Indicators involving financial metrics (e.g., attributes 8 and 9, or where INR is applied), reliance was placed on third-party audited 
financial reports. Bureau Veritas assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of these financial reports.
•	 Defined Reporting Period: The assessment is restricted to data and information within the FY 2024-25 reporting period. Data 
outside this period is excluded from the assurance scope, unless otherwise stated in the report.
•	 Geographical and Operational Boundary: The assurance covers only operations within the defined boundary (manufacturing 
plants in Gurugram, Manesar, and Kharkhoda and R&D facilities in Gurugram and Rohtak, unless otherwise specified). Data or 
activities outside these boundaries are not included, unless explicitly stated.
•	 Exclusion of Subjective Statements: The assurance does not cover MSIL’s statements expressing opinions, beliefs, 
aspirations, expectations, aims, or future intentions, nor does it include assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights or 
competitive issues.
•	 Limited Scope of Framework Mapping: The assurance is restricted to the BRSR framework as specified in the SEBI Circular 
(Annexures I and II). Comparisons or assessments against other reporting frameworks are not included.
•	 Exclusion of Strategy and Legal Compliance: The assessment does not review MSIL’s strategy, related linkages in the report, 
or compliance with legal requirements, which remain the responsibility of MSIL.
•	 Data Authenticity Assumption: The assurance relies on the assumption that data and information provided by MSIL are 
complete, sufficient, and authentic.
Conclusion
Bureau Veritas conducted a comprehensive assurance engagement for Maruti Suzuki India Limited’s (MSIL) BRSR disclosures for 
the period April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, as presented in its Report. Subject to the inherent limitations outlined in the Report, 
our conclusions are as follows:
•	 Reasonable Level of Assurance - BRSR Core Indicators
	
Based on the procedures performed, evidence obtained, and information provided by management, we conclude that MSIL’s 
BRSR Core disclosures across nine core attributes (as listed in Annex I) are, in all material respects, prepared in accordance 
with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) BRSR guidelines (Annexure I of SEBI Circular dated 12th July 2023, 
Industry Standard on Reporting of BRSR Core, Circular No.: SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated Dec 20, 2024).
•	 Limited Level of Assurance - Other BRSR Disclosures
	
Based on the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that MSIL’s other BRSR disclosures do 
not adhere to the reporting requirements outlined in the BRSR guidelines (Annexure II of SEBI Circular dated 12th July 2023, 
Industry Standard on Reporting of BRSR Core, Circular No.: SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated Dec 20, 2024). 
Our review, supported by sample-based testing and evaluation of management processes, confirms that the disclosures are
