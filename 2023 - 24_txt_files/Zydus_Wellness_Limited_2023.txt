1.
Leadership and 
Corporate 
Governance
R/O
Risk: Inadequate corporate 
governance standards may 
hinder progress towards long-
term strategic goals and expose 
organizations to reputational, 
operational, and legal risks. 
Upholding ethical behavior 
among stakeholders is crucial to 
maintaining trust, particularly in 
the health and wellness sector, 
and is integral to safeguarding the 
Company’s reputation and long-
term viability.
Opportunity: Implementing 
strong corporate governance 
practices that prioritize 
transparency, accountability, 
and technological innovation 
can enhance business growth, 
reputation, and stakeholder trust, 
ultimately benefiting consumers.
The governance framework 
comprises the Board of Directors 
and its Committees at the highest 
tier, with an internal operational 
structure below. The CEO & Whole 
Time Director operates under the 
oversight of the Board, overseeing 
the organization’s overall 
functioning. The Company adheres 
to Corporate Governance standards 
outlined in The Companies Act, 
2013, and The SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
Adopting proactive measures 
becomes paramount. Firstly, 
establishing clear lines of 
communication and accountability 
within the governance structure can 
enhance oversight and minimize 
potential pitfalls. 
Secondly, implementing robust 
policies and procedures aligned 
with regulatory requirements 
and industry best practices can 
mitigate risks associated with 
poor governance. Additionally, 
fostering a culture of transparency, 
integrity, and ethical conduct 
throughout the organization can 
mitigate reputational risks and 
enhance stakeholder trust. Regular 
monitoring and evaluation of 
governance practices, coupled 
with timely adjustments as 
needed, can further strengthen the 
organization’s resilience to such 
risks.
Positive: Implementing effective 
Corporate Governance practices 
not only mitigates risks associated 
with safety, legal, performance, and 
warranty issues but also translates 
into tangible financial benefits. 
By streamlining processes 
and fostering transparency, 
unnecessary expenses can be 
minimized, allowing for more 
strategic allocation of resources 
towards innovation and growth 
initiatives. 
Furthermore, robust governance 
ensures financial security for 
stakeholders, shareholders, 
customers, staff, and the Board 
of Directors, fostering long-term 
stability and trust.
Negative: Failure to adhere 
to ethical business conduct 
regulations across operational 
geographies exposes the Company 
to significant financial risks and 
reputational damage. Non-
compliance may result in hefty 
fines and sanctions imposed by 
the regulatory bodies, draining 
financial resources and tarnishing 
the Company’s reputation. 
The erosion of trust among 
customers and shareholders 
due to potential reputational 
damage can further exacerbate 
financial implications, impacting 
profitability and shareholder 
value. Therefore, prioritizing 
adherence to ethical standards and 
regulatory compliance is crucial to 
safeguarding financial health and 
preserving stakeholder trust.

2.
Energy & 
Emissions
R/O
Risk: Effective energy and 
emissions management is crucial 
for the Company due to its direct 
impact on business performance 
and sustainability. Failure to 
actively address these areas can 
pose significant risks. Inadequate 
energy management may result 
in higher operational costs and 
decreased competitiveness in 
an increasingly environmentally 
conscious market. Failure to 
reduce emissions could lead 
to regulatory non-compliance, 
resulting in potential fines and 
penalties that harm the Company’s 
reputation and brand image.
Opportunity: Conversely, 
effective energy and emissions 
management present 
opportunities for the Company to 
enhance its business performance 
and sustainability. By actively 
managing energy consumption and 
reducing emissions, the Company 
can minimize operational costs 
and strengthen its competitive 
position in the market. Adopting 
energy efficient technologies and 
renewable energy sources can 
lead to substantial cost savings 
and streamlined operational 
processes. Furthermore, by 
showcasing a commitment 
to sustainability initiatives 
and reducing environmental 
impact, the Company can attract 
environmentally conscious 
consumers, potentially leading 
to enhanced market penetration 
and revenue generation. This 
prioritization of sustainable 
practices demonstrates the 
Company’s commitment to 
long-term resilience and financial 
success.
In addressing the risks associated 
with energy emissions, it’s 
imperative to adopt a proactive 
approach to adapt and mitigate 
potential challenges. One 
strategy is to set clear targets for 
emission reduction, renewable 
energy adoption, and energy 
intensity reduction. For instance, 
the Company has established 
ambitious goals for the FY 2028-
2029 compared to the base
FY 2021-2022: 
- Including 15.0% reduction in 
emissions (Scope 1+2), 
- 15.0% increase in renewable 
energy usage, and 
- 20.0% decrease in energy 
intensity.
To achieve these targets, the 
Company has implemented several 
initiatives.
The Company has focused on 
enhancing energy efficiency 
through adoption of advanced 
technologies, optimizing 
energy usage across operations. 
Additionally, the Company has 
prioritized transitioning to greener 
fuels wherever feasible, further 
reducing its carbon footprint. We 
will see significant increase in the 
utilization of solar power from 
FY 2024-2025, leveraging 
renewable energy sources to 
reduce emissions.
By implementing these measures, 
the Company aims to not only 
mitigate the risks associated 
with energy emissions but also 
contribute to environmental 
sustainability and long-term 
business resilience.
Positive: Effective management 
of energy and emissions presents 
numerous positive financial 
implications for the Company. By 
reducing energy consumption 
and emissions, the Company can 
achieve significant cost savings 
through lower operational 
expenses, such as reduced energy 
bills and maintenance costs. 
Additionally, investing in renewable 
energy sources can provide 
long-term financial benefits 
by stabilizing energy costs and 
potentially generating revenue 
through renewable energy credits 
or selling excess energy back to 
the grid. Moreover, implementing 
energy-efficient technologies and 
practices can enhance operational 
efficiency, leading to improved 
productivity and profitability.
Negative: Conversely, neglecting 
to address energy and emissions 
management can result in 
negative financial implications 
for the Company. Increased 
energy consumption and 
emissions may lead to higher 
operational costs, diminishing 
profitability. Non-compliance with 
environmental regulations and 
emissions standards can result 
in fines, penalties, and legal 
expenses, negatively impacting the 
Company’s financial performance 
and reputation. Additionally, failure 
to adapt to evolving consumer 
preferences for sustainable 
products and practices may lead 
to decreased market share and 
revenue loss. Overall, inadequate 
management of energy and 
emissions can pose significant 
financial risks to the Company’s 
bottom line.

3.
Business Ethics
R/O
Risk: The pursuit of profitability 
and business objectives may entice 
Companies to compromise on 
ethical standards. Ethical risks, 
such as human rights violations, 
corruption, environmental harm, 
or breaches of data privacy, can 
tarnish the Company’s reputation 
and erode trust among consumers 
and investors.
Opportunity: Prioritizing ethical 
and sustainable practices presents 
an opportunity for the Company to 
cultivate trust among customers, 
investors, and stakeholders, 
establishing a competitive edge 
in the market. By embracing 
ethical practices, the Company can 
enhance financial performance, as 
customers and investors are more 
inclined to support and invest in 
ethically responsible companies.
Business ethics pose a significant 
risk, as any deviation from ethical 
standards can lead to reputational 
damage, loss of consumer trust, 
and legal consequences. To 
mitigate this risk, the Company 
prioritizes transparency, 
accountability, and integrity 
across all business operations. 
Implementing comprehensive 
compliance programs, providing 
ongoing ethics training, and 
fostering a culture of ethical 
behavior can help mitigate the 
risk of ethical breaches. Regular 
monitoring and enforcement of 
the “Code of Business Conduct” 
among partners, coupled with 
swift corrective action in case of 
violations, are essential steps 
to safeguarding the Company’s 
reputation and maintaining 
stakeholder trust. 
Additionally, establishing clear 
communication channels for 
reporting ethical concerns 
and whistleblower protection 
mechanisms can encourage 
early detection and resolution 
of ethical issues. Ultimately, 
embedding ethical principles 
into the Company’s core values 
and decision-making processes is 
crucial for effectively managing the 
risk of business ethics.
Positive: Adhering to high ethical 
standards can yield numerous 
positive financial outcomes for 
the Company. By maintaining 
a reputation for integrity and 
trustworthiness, the Company 
can attract and retain loyal 
customers, leading to increased 
sales and revenue. Additionally, 
ethical business practices can 
enhance investor confidence, 
resulting in higher stock prices 
and greater access to capital. 
Moreover, companies with strong 
ethical cultures often experience 
lower employee turnover and 
recruitment costs, as employees 
are more likely to be engaged and 
motivated to contribute to the 
company’s success.
Negative: Conversely, failing 
to prioritize business ethics 
can have detrimental financial 
consequences for the Company. 
Ethical lapses may lead to 
reputational damage, customer 
defection, and loss of market 
share, resulting in decreased sales 
and revenue. Legal fees, fines, 
and settlements stemming from 
ethical violations can also impose 
significant financial burdens on the 
company. 
Moreover, unethical behavior 
can erode employee morale 
and productivity, leading to 
higher turnover and decreased 
operational efficiency. Ultimately, 
the financial implications of 
neglecting business ethics can 
include decreased profitability, 
diminished shareholder value, 
and long-term damage to the 
company’s bottom line.

Plastic and Waste 
Management
R/O
Risk: The indiscriminate use 
of plastic packaging presents 
a notable risk, not only to the 
environment but also to our 
Company’s reputation. As 
consumers become increasingly 
mindful of environmental 
impact, failure to address plastic 
waste concerns may result in 
reputational damage and loss of 
consumer trust. Furthermore, 
regulatory authorities are 
tightening restrictions on plastic 
usage, increasing the risk of 
non-compliance, penalties and 
legal ramifications. Therefore, it 
is imperative for us to proactively 
mitigate these risks by adopting 
sustainable packaging alternatives 
and implementing effective waste 
management strategies.
Opportunity: Amidst the 
challenges posed by plastic waste, 
there are significant opportunities 
for innovation and advancement. 
By investing in alternative 
packaging materials and 
implementing efficient recycling 
initiatives, our Company can not 
only mitigate environmental risks 
but also achieve long-term cost 
savings and operational efficiency. 
Moreover, addressing plastic waste 
aligns with consumer preferences 
for environmentally friendly 
products, potentially enhancing 
brand reputation and market 
competitiveness. 
Embracing sustainability in 
packaging and waste management 
not only fulfills our social 
responsibility but also fosters 
innovation and drives positive 
change within our industry.
For the risks associated with 
plastic and waste management, 
it is essential to adopt proactive 
measures. This includes 
collaborating with government-
approved waste collection 
agencies and recyclers, adhering to 
Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) commitments, and setting 
ambitious targets for waste 
reduction and recycling. 
Additionally, investing in innovative 
packaging materials, promoting 
recyclable and reusable packaging, 
and exploring the use of recycled 
materials can help mitigate 
environmental risks and enhance 
sustainability efforts.
We collaborate with government-
approved waste collection agencies 
and recyclers to exceed our EPR 
commitments. 
In FY 2023-2024, we surpassed 
our EPR target by recycling and 
safely disposing 7392.2 tons of 
post-consumer plastic packaging 
waste, with an additional collection 
of 86.2 tons. 
We have initiated projects aimed 
at saving 280 tons of packaging 
material annually, contributing to 
our goal of reducing 1,000 tons 
over the next three years, starting 
from FY 2023-2024. Projects are 
underway to achieve this goal 
in various product lines such as 
Nycil bottles, Sugarfree powder 
concentrate bottles and caps, 
Complan Cartons, and Corrugated 
boxes.
We are committed to transitioning 
from multi-material packaging 
(category 3) to multi-layer 
plastic material (category 2) and 
ultimately to fully recyclable 
materials by FY 2027-2028. Our 
efforts also include replacing 
aluminum-based plastic laminates 
with all-plastic laminates for 
Glucon D sachets. Moreover, 
we are exploring the use of 
Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) 
material in product categories 
permitted by the Plastic Waste 
Management Act. Everyuth body 
lotion is currently being tested in 
PCR-based containers for potential 
integration of PCR material.
Positive: Investing in effective 
plastic and waste management 
strategies can yield positive 
financial outcomes for the 
Company. By reducing packaging 
material usage and increasing 
recycling efforts, the Company 
can achieve cost savings through 
lower raw material expenses and 
waste disposal costs. Moreover, 
embracing sustainable practices 
can enhance brand reputation 
and consumer loyalty, potentially 
leading to increased sales and 
market share. 
Additionally, compliance with 
regulatory requirements and 
meeting EPR commitments can 
help avoid fines and penalties.
Negative: Neglecting plastic and 
waste management can result in 
negative financial consequences 
for the Company. Increased 
usage of packaging materials and 
inefficient waste management 
practices may lead to higher 
operational costs and waste 
disposal expenses. 
Furthermore, failure to address 
environmental concerns related 
to plastic waste can tarnish 
the Company’s reputation and 
result in lost sales opportunities. 
Non-compliance with regulatory 
requirements may incur hefty 
fines and legal expenses, further 
impacting financial performance. 
Overall, the financial implications 
of inadequate plastic and waste 
management can include 
decreased profitability, reduced 
market competitiveness, and 
potential legal liabilities.

Human rights
R/O
Risk: According to the World Press 
Freedom Index India ranks 150th 
position in 180 nations globally 
in the Human Freedom Index, 
implying that the Companies 
currently operate in a region with 
high cases of human rights issues. 
Companies have a responsibility 
to ensure they respect of core 
human rights in the communities 
in which they operate. In particular, 
companies should ensure that 
no child labour, forced or bonded 
labour, or human trafficking occurs 
within their value chain.
Opportunity: By disclosing 
policies, practices and impacts on 
human rights allows businesses 
to proactively identify and address 
any human rights issues within 
operations. By engaging with 
stakeholders on Human rights 
fosters trust, build stronger 
relationships with all the 
stakeholders.
The Company is committed to 
providing fair opportunities at all 
levels, safe and healthy workplaces 
and protecting human health and 
the environment. 
The Company strives to provide 
a non-discriminatory and 
harassment-free workplace for all 
its employees and contractual staff. 
The Factories Act, 1948 provides 
the overarching framework for the 
Company’s policy on human rights 
for the employees working in the 
Company’s factory.
Positive: By demonstrating a 
commitment to human rights 
in its operation, the Company 
can enhance reputation and get 
competitive advantage in the 
market. Consumers and Investors 
are increasingly considering 
human rights performance 
while purchasing and making 
investment decisions. By aligning 
with the human rights reporting, 
the Company can attract socially 
responsible consumers, Investors 
and partners who value human 
rights.
Negative: The Company has an 
extensive supply chain footprint 
regionally and globally. Ensuring 
respect for human rights 
throughout the value chain is 
essential to avoid reputational and 
financial damage.

Health & Nutrition
R/O
Risk: Ensuring safe production 
of consumer goods is crucial for 
maximizing public health benefits 
and maintaining consumer 
trust. Poor product quality can 
erode consumer confidence and 
negatively impact sales.
Opportunity: Growing consumer 
demand for healthier products 
presents a significant opportunity 
for the Company. By meeting 
market expectations and offering 
products that prioritize health 
and well-being, the Company can 
expand brand categories, increase 
market share, and adapt to evolving 
consumer preferences.
To address health & nutrition 
risks, the Company adopts 
a comprehensive approach. 
Thorough research and testing, 
including clinical and preclinical 
studies, are prioritized to ensure 
that all products meet necessary 
nutrition requirements and 
safety standards. Additionally, 
stringent quality control measures 
are implemented, with regular 
monitoring and assessment 
throughout the production process 
to mitigate health risks effectively. 
Collaboration with experts such 
as nutritionists, dieticians, and 
healthcare professionals is also 
integral to ensuring that products 
align with health guidelines and 
consumer needs. Transparent 
labeling practices are employed, 
providing clear nutritional 
information and ingredient lists to 
consumers, enabling them to make 
informed choices. Furthermore, 
the Company invests in innovation, 
utilizing research findings to 
enhance product quality and meet 
evolving health and nutrition 
demands.
The Company has established an 
Ethical and Responsible Marketing 
policy, which can be accessed 
at https://www.zyduswellness.

Responsible%20Marketing%20
Policy.pdf
Positive: Investing in health 
and nutrition initiatives can yield 
positive financial outcomes for 
companies. Providing products 
that align with consumer demand 
for healthier options can lead 
to increased sales and market 
share. Moreover, promoting health 
and nutrition can enhance brand 
reputation and consumer loyalty, 
driving long-term profitability. 
Additionally, by addressing health 
concerns proactively, companies 
can mitigate potential legal and 
regulatory risks, avoiding fines and 
penalties.
Negative: Neglecting health and 
nutrition concerns can result in 
negative financial consequences 
for companies. Failure to meet 
consumer demand for healthier 
products may lead to decreased 
sales and market share loss. 
Moreover, if products are found to 
pose health risks, companies may 
face lawsuits, recalls, and damaged 
brand reputation, resulting in 
significant financial losses. 
Additionally, non-compliance with 
health and nutrition regulations 
can lead to fines, legal expenses, 
and tarnished corporate image, 
impacting profitability and 
shareholder value. 
Overall, the financial implications 
of ignoring health and nutrition 
can include decreased revenue, 
increased costs, and diminished 
market competitiveness.

There are adequate mechanisms in place to manage waste generated in different forms during our operation and 
manufacturing processes. All plants have a well-designed Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). Wastewater from the production 
process is treated via a Common ETP and discharged in accordance with the standards set by the Pollution Control Boards. 
Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) is being installed in Aligarh & Sikkim plants and OCEMS system is 
online connected to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) server and details are being monitored by CPCB. We have also 
involved Government approved Environment Monitoring laboratories for validation of our treated water parameters against 
the prescribed limits by respective State Pollution Control Board. After treatment, about 80.0% to 85.0% of recycled water 
is used for green belt development, cleaning, housekeeping, gardening and flushing in toilets. As a result of our efforts, we 
have saved 2.0% ground water consumption / ton at Aligarh plant and 4.3% surface water consumption at Ahmedabad and 
Sikkim plants.
	
Other waste including e-waste, plastic waste etc. are managed according to the expectation of State Pollution Control Board.
