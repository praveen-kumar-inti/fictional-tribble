Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.

material and reintroduce excess material back into the production process. The Company employs the '3R' approach, which is 
to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. They follow legally prescribed methods and environmentally safe disposal techniques for 
disposing of hazardous waste and sell non-hazardous waste to approved recyclers.

site. By regularly refining the process and technology, the company employs a "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recovery and 
Disposal" strategy to minimise the creation of hazardous waste.

Disposal Facilities (TSDF), or offers it to other industries as raw material.
