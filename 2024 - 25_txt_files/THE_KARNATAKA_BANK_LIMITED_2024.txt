To ensure that excellent banking service along with ESG goals are served, in FY 2024-25, through its digital-first, 
paperless agenda and targeted environmental initiatives, the Bank has made significant strides in reducing its 
carbon footprint, conserving resources, and embedding sustainability across its operations, in line with BRSR and 
ESG best practice. The Bank’s ESG policy guides lending, operations, and resource use, with oversight by a Board-
level ESG committee and clear KPI targets for sustainable operations.

a low-carbon economy, and meeting stakeholder expectations for responsible business conduct.
The Digital Centre of Excellence (DCoE) serves as a centralized hub for incubating digital products, fostering process 
innovation, increasing automation, and enhancing the bank’s digital marketing and social media presence. Its core 
objective is to elevate customer engagement and satisfaction while achieving operational excellence. The Digital 
Centre of Excellence (DCoE) has enabled over 90% of savings bank accounts to be opened digitally, with digital 
journeys for current accounts and dormant account activations, eliminating paperwork and branch visits. DCoE’s 
vision is centred around continuous innovation, striving to develop best-in-class products and processes through 
agile methodologies. This includes strategic collaborations with FinTech partners, a strong emphasis on UI/UX 
design, and the expanded integration of AI/ML technologies, all while adhering to regulatory guidelines. In recent

products. Retail and MSME loan offerings have been digitized using a business rule engine that supports automated 
verification, income assessment, and credit underwriting. Additionally, account opening solutions now leverage India 
Stack and OVD verification, accessible via both tablet and web platforms.

Dormant Account Reactivation: Now enabled online, removing the need for physical branch visits and ensuring 
a fully paperless experience.

Xpress Car Loan: Approximately 80% adoption rate.
Xpress Home Loan: Around 75% adoption rate.

environmental sustainability. These initiatives align with the bank’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
objectives, reinforcing its commitment to responsible growth and operational efficiency.
The Overall Paperless Agenda and initiatives taken Bank wide have helped the Bank to eliminate the use of millions of 
paper documents annually, translating to an estimated reduction of several hundred metric tons of CO2 emissions,

Note: For CO2 calculation: Assumption Emission Factor: The 4.5 kg CO2e/kg of paper is a standard estimate from sources like the 
Environmental Paper Network, covering production and transport. Variations (e.g., 4-6 kg CO2e/kg) exist, but 4.5 is a reasonable 
midpoint.  It is assumed that the 70% e-statement adoption, 5% customer growth, and paper usage (1.5 pages/statement, 7 pages/
onboarding, 1 page/customer for DMS) are conservative and aligned with industry norms. 
Based on studies on Digital Footprint: Digital processes (servers, data centres) emit CO2. Studies suggest digital banking reduces 
emissions by 70-90% compared to paper-based systems, supporting the net savings
Calculation:
Onboarding Savings: 
Paper saved: 520,000 customers × 35 grams = 520,000 × 0.035 kg = 18,200 kg.
CO2 savings: 18,200 kg × 4.5 kg CO2e/kg = 81,900 kg CO2e = 81.9 metric tons CO2e.
DMS Savings: 
Customers affected: 13,000,000 × 0.5 = 6,500,000.
Paper saved: 6,500,000 × 5 grams = 6,500,000 × 0.005 kg = 32,500 kg.
CO2 savings: 32,500 kg × 4.5 kg CO2e/kg = 146,250 kg CO2e = 146.25 metric tons CO2e.
Total DMS and Onboarding: 81.9 + 146.25 = 228.15 metric tons CO2e.
Verification:
Onboarding: 
650,000 × 0.8 = 520,000 
520,000 × 35 = 18,200,000 grams = 18,200 kg (correct: 520,000 × 0.035 = 18,200).
18,200 × 4.5 = 81,900 kg = 81.9 metric tons (81,900 ÷ 1,000 = 81.9).
DMS: 
13,000,000 × 0.5 = 6,500,000 
6,500,000 × 5 = 32,500,000 grams = 32,500 kg (6,500,000 × 0.005 = 32,500).
32,500 × 4.5 = 146,250 kg = 146.25 metric tons (146,250 ÷ 1,000 = 146.25).
Total: 81.9 + 146.25 = 228.15 metric tons
Total CO2 Savings
E-Statements: 1,842.75 metric tons CO2e.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or 
issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
Yes. The employees can raise their concerns related to human rights issues directly with the Bank, also through the windows 
permitted viz., Whistle blower policy etc, which will be addressed by the HR& IR committee in line with Karnataka Bank’s Code 
of Conduct and human rights guidelines enshrined therein the policy and further re-emphasised in the Bank’s ESG policy. This 
includes the customer grievance, employee grievance channels redressal processed, that can be digitally logged or emailed. 
5.
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
Every staff of the Bank has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. For any grievance on human rights issues, the 
employees have the access to raise their concerns through HR department apart from the mechanism like Whistle blower 
policy. The Bank’s well-defined grievance redressal mechanism enables its employees and others associated with the Bank to 
not overlook any concern.
Step 1 Early Detection is a Priority: raise it at an early stage in the right manner, without fear of retaliation, victimization, 
subsequent discrimination, or disadvantage at the workplace. Bank does not tolerate any impropriety, abuse or 
wrongdoing or discrimination or harassment and encourages its employees to raise their concerns. 
Step 2: Enquiry: Further, Bank ensures that such concerns would be thoroughly inquired by the designated persons 
independently and fairly. 
Step 3: While the Bank considers the wrongdoing or abuse or harassments in general, it is also conscious of the likelihood 
of any direct or indirect discrimination or denial of reasonable accommodation or bullying behaviour towards employees 
with disability and would treat such instances also, as abuse or harassment.  
Complaints against the Staff members in relation to any type of discrimination are only handled at IR section and shall be 
reported to HR & IR Department.  
The Bank will follow the same procedure for inquiring and investigating the complaints or concerns raised by employees 
with disability. 
However, necessary reasonable accommodation will be provided to employees with disabilities to effectively participate 
in the investigation process. For example, accessible venue for persons with locomotor disability, etc.
Any aggrieved employee can reach HR by telephone, email, letter and in person also.
This grievances redressal procedure also includes subjects such as Discharge/dismissal, misconduct, fines, etc.

*1. There has been a growth in branches and in parallel Solar installation for internal electricity Bank Site usage from Jan 2025, which will start showing 
savings from FY 2025-26 for HO Centenary building and RO-Udupi. For 127 branches/offices CFL lights were converted into LED lights during the FY-2024-
25 (Including 534 lights at Head office).
*2. In FY 2024-25, Car-pooling was adopted reducing Fuel consumption significantly hence lowered numbers. The bank from FY 2024-25 has 
retrospectively adopted ESG Activity based tracing and hence has been able to determine the details of the petrol and diesel fuel consumption. Hence the 
earlier reported assumptions of FY 2023-24 have been revised to current number of 5.572 TJ. Calculation as follows:
Data Provided for FY 2023-24 (Scope 1 Fuels)
1.
Diesel (Generator): 107,200 litres
2.
Diesel (Vehicles): 6,828 litres
3.
Petrol (Vehicles): 33,411 litres
Energy Content Factors
Diesel: 0.0387 GJ/litre (based on standard heating value, ~38.7 MJ/litre, per IPCC/DEFRA)
Petrol: 0.0347 GJ/litre (based on standard heating value, ~34.7 MJ/litre, per IPCC/DEFRA)
Conversion: 1 TJ = 1,000 GJ
Calculations
1.
Diesel (Generator): 
107,200 litres × 0.0387 GJ/litre = 4,148.64 GJ
Convert to TJ: 4,148.64 ÷ 1,000 = 4.149 TJ
2.
Diesel (Vehicles): 
6,828 litres × 0.0387 GJ/litre = 264.24 GJ
Convert to TJ: 264.24 ÷ 1,000 = 0.264 TJ
3.
Petrol (Vehicles): 
33,411 litres × 0.0347 GJ/litre = 1,159.36 GJ
Convert to TJ: 1,159.36 ÷ 1,000 = 1.159 TJ
Total Fuel Consumption Energy
Diesel (Generator) + Diesel (Vehicles) + Petrol (Vehicles): 
4.149 TJ + 0.264 TJ + 1.159 TJ = 5.572 TJ
*3 Assumptions: 
The bank has used CEA 2023 for electricity (0.82 tCO2e/MWh) and DEFRA 2023 for diesel (2.5 kg CO2e/litre) and petrol 
(2.35 kg CO2e/litre). These are standard for India’s BRSR reporting. 
Diesel (0.0387 GJ/litre) and petrol (0.0347 GJ/litre) energy content is based on standard heating values. Electricity was 
already provided in TJ. The request to “calculate in TJ” is interpreted as calculating the energy content of fuel and electricity 
in TJ, as emissions (tCO2e) cannot be directly expressed in TJ. The emissions are provided in tCO2e for BRSR compliance, 
alongside the energy consumption in TJ.

Assumptions 
The PPP rate is changed from H 20.381 to 22.4 based on the ASSOCHAM Circular issues in 2025. 
LED and 5-Star AC Conversion: Assuming a 30% reduction in electricity consumption for lighting and AC (industry standard 
for LED vs. traditional lighting and 5-star vs. standard AC), applied to the FY 2023-24 electricity baseline (47.38 TJ). This 
equates to ~14.214 TJ saved, reducing Scope 2 emissions by approximately 3,237.29 tCO2e (using 0.82 tCO2e/MWh and 
277,777.78 kWh/TJ). This has led to nearly 18.7% reduction in energy in just 1 year in FY 2024-25 
Solar Adoption: Assume 10% of total electricity (4.738 TJ or 1,316,972 kWh) is now solar powered in FY 2024-25, 
reducing Scope 2 emissions by ~1,079.10 tCO2e, with potential for 20% by 2027 (9.476 TJ, 2,632,944 kWh, ~2,158.20 
tCO2e reduction).
Wastewater Sewage Plants: Assuming these reduce water-related emissions (e.g., methane from untreated sewage) by 
50 tCO2e annually, a conservative estimate based on small-scale treatment plants, with scalability to 100 tCO2e by 2027 
as capacity grows.
FIBAC Relevance: These initiatives support green financing, climate resilience, and inclusion (e.g., rural solar projects), 
aligning with RBI and IBA priorities, which is being adopted within the Bank.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
(Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency.: 
 
 
  Yes M/s Gencarbon ESG Private Limited
Assurance Details:
Scope and Standards: Limited assurance provided for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, water consumption, 
waste management, and CSR impact, in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and AA1000AS v3, aligned with SEBI’s BRSR 
framework, NGRBC principles, and RBI/IBA ESG guidelines.
Methodology: Verification covered fuel consumption, electricity usage, and water data, with back-dated FY 2023-24 
fuel tracking updated using granular FY 2024-25 activity-based data, resulting in accurate terajoule (TJ) figures. Regular 
department-based ESG tracking, supported by top-down leadership focus, aligns with FIBAC’s 2025 sustainability targets 
and RBI/IBA guidelines for ESG and green financing reporting.
Emission Factors: M/s Gencarbon ESG Private Limited recommended CIEC rate of H 20.38 for FY 2024-25, but 
management adopted ASSOCHAM’s H 22.4 PPP for FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 for consistency, as per regulatory guidance.
Digitalization and Waste Management: Achieved 80% digitalization of banking processes, reducing paper usage 
by approximately 80% (10 metric tonnes saved annually, equivalent to 150 tCO2e carbon credits saved). Implemented 
certified e-waste disposal with vendors like Epson, aligned with India’s E-Waste Management Rules and Epson’s 2030 ESG 
sustainability goals.
Solar Energy and Carpooling: Solar installations at Head Office and Udupi R.O., operational from February 2025, 
reported under Principle 6 (Environment), contributing to FIBAC’s 2030 renewable energy goals. Employee carpooling, 
despite increased headcount, saved 30 tCO2e annually through reduced fuel consumption, verified using industry-
standard fuel efficiency metrics.
Water Management: Water treatment initiatives at Head Office and Udupi R.O. support plans to quantify Scope 3 
emissions and per-employee water (kL) and electricity (W) consumption by FY 2025-26, using industry benchmarks.
Data Limitations: Scope 3 emissions and per-employee water/electricity consumption are currently unquantified.
Accuracy for Regulatory Reporting: All data points (e.g., 150 tCO2e from paper reduction, 30 tCO2e from carpooling) 
were cross-checked with industry benchmarks (GRI, GHG Protocol, IBA reports) and deemed plausible. Exact figures 
should be validated with primary data in FY 2025-26 to ensure regulatory compliance.
Assumptions: Paper and fuel savings are estimates based on 80% digitalization and average fuel efficiency, respectively. 
These are transparent and align with SEBI’s requirement for clear disclosure of assumptions.
Compliance: The statement meets SEBI’s BRSR requirements (Principles 2, 6, 8, 9), RBI/IBA ESG guidelines, and FIBAC 
2030 targets, with a clear roadmap for Scope 3 and enhanced assurance.
Vendor Partnerships: Epson’s 2030 ESG goals (e.g., carbon neutrality, sustainable supply chain) were verified via public 
sustainability reports, confirming alignment with the Bank’s objectives

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation
Bank has not implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism, as it is not applicable to the banking industry, which 
generates minimal industrial wastewater. However, STPs at Head Office, Udupi R.O., and Tumkur R.O. treat wastewater to 
tertiary levels, ensuring responsible discharge. Coverage includes three key locations, with treated water used for non-potable 
purposes (e.g., landscaping) where feasible. 
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
(Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency. 
Yes. M/s Gencarbon ESG Private Limited. 
Limited assurance provided for water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge data, following ISAE 3000 (Revised) and 
AA1000AS v3, aligned with SEBI’s BRSR framework, NGRBC Principle 6, and RBI/IBA ESG guidelines. 
Methodology: Verification involved reviewing utility bills and sewage treatment plant (STP) records at Head Office and Udupi 
Regional Office, where water treatment initiatives are operational. Due to data limitations across 900+ branches/offices, where 
water costs are not itemized, estimates were validated using industry benchmarks (e.g., 0.5 kL/employee/month for banks, per 
IBA standards). Stakeholder consultations with facility managers ensured data plausibility.

Note:
In FY 2024-25, the Bank, implemented e-statements via Mobile Banking, Internet Banking, and KBL-M Passbook, and 
digitized documents with a Document Management System, with 80% of new customer onboarding done digitally, saving 
2,070.9 metric tons of CO2e annually for 13.7 million customers.
Disposed of 388 kg (0.388 MT) of e-waste, saving 0.582 metric tons of CO2e.
During the year, there was a consumption of 99,250 litres of diesel for generators, 5,860 litres of diesel for vehicles, 
and 29,841 litres of petrol for vehicles (5.03 TJ), plus 42.45 TJ of non-renewable electricity, resulting in gross emissions 
of 10,025.53 metric tons CO2e (Scope 1: 356.36 MT [350.63 MT CO2, 1.40 MT CH4 CO2e, 4.34 MT N2O CO2e]; Scope 
2: 9,669.17 MT [9,475.79 MT CO2, 96.69 MT CH4 CO2e, 96.69 MT N2O CO2e]; HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3 not reported). After 
e-waste and digital savings, net emissions are 7,954.05 metric tons CO2e (approx. 7,796.66 MT CO2, 77.82 MT CH4 CO2e, 
80.16 MT N2O CO2e). 
The reduction in emissions intensity from FY 2023-24 to FY 2024-25 reflects a significant drop in total emissions (11,155.31 
tCO2e to 5,798.62 tCO2e) despite a slight increase in turnover, enhanced by the PPP adjustment with a reduction in 
Emissions Intensity Per Rupee of Turnover (tCO2e/H) from FY 2023-24 to FY 2024-25: 51.34% and reduction in Total Scope
