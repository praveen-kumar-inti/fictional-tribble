Government 
subsidy 
schemes
Opportunity
The Pradhan Mantri Awas 
Yojana (PMAY) is a flagship 
housing 
project 
launched 
by the Government of India 
with the primary objective of 
providing affordable housing 
to all citizens of the nation. 
The Credit-Linked Subsidy 
Scheme (CLSS) under PMAY 
has made homeownership 
more affordable for many low-
income groups. Beneficiaries 
receive interest subsidies on 
home loans, making housing 
finance more accessible and 
attractive.
-
Positive
This initiative has not only 
transformed 
the

landscape in India but has also 
improved the lives of millions

Aptus takes a customer-
centric approach by actively 
engaging with its customers 
and 
understanding 
their 
business ventures, income 
generation, 
aspirations, 
dreams, and lifestyle. The 
Company does not mandate 
stringent income documents 
from customers, which may 
not be available with our 
target 
informal 
segment 
customers, but emphasizes 
on personal discussions to 
assess suitability and eligibility 
for housing loans. 
-
Positive
Positive reputation, loyalty, and 
efficient 
customer 
servicing 
results in increased customer 
retention 
yielding 
portfolio 
sustenance and high turnover 
to the Company to serve a 
larger number of low and 
middle 
income 
families 
in 
affording home.

Due to the nature of our pre-dominantly digital processes resulting 
from the investments in digitalisation and automation initiatives, our 
Capex largely consists of expenses relating to purchase of softwares/
other IT related expenses. 
Our investment into digitalisation is also aimed at making our 
environment paper less contributing to the wellness of our eco 
system and society at large.
2.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably?
	
Housing finance, the core of our business, primarily involves the management and allocation of financial resources 
rather than the use of tangible raw materials typically associated with sustainability concerns. Consequently, our 
operations do not necessitate the implementation of procedures for sustainable sourcing, as we do not engage with 
physical resources that would require such measures.
3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Since the Company is a housing finance company, the key waste products are primarily e-waste and paper waste. The 
Company has put in place an environment-friendly system for management of its e-waste and paper waste. Further, the 
Company is in the process of implementing a 100% paperless office
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes,
