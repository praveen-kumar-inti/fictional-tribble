approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications. 
	 Product Quality and Safety
Whether Risk or Opportunity
Both, Risk & Opportunity
Rationale for identifying the risk/
opportunity
Risk rationale
•	 Pharma industry is highly regulated.
•	 Product quality/safety is very critical for success of the Company. 
•	 Any deviation or gap in product quality/safety will adversely impact the image and revenue 
of the Company. 
•	 It will also attract actions from regulators. 
Opportunity rationale
Maintaining product quality, efficacy, safety and meeting all regulatory requirements will 
demonstrate the Company’s commitment towards patient safety and elevate the brand image.
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate

have an adverse impact on the Company’s brand image and consumer confidence.
	 Occupational Health and Safety
Whether risk or opportunity
Both, Risk & Opportunity
Rationale for identifying the risk/
opportunity
Risk rationale
Unhealthy, unsafe and hazardous work conditions can cause physical and mental health issues 
for workers which will lead to reduced productivity. Any gaps in meeting Health & Safety (HS) 
regulatory standards can lead to penal actions. 
Opportunity rationale
Robust Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System with a comprehensive 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Risk Management and Mitigation Plan will showcase 
the Company’s commitment towards the health and safety of its workforce. Fewer HS issues 
boost employee morale and results in higher efficiency and better-quality products.

adapt or mitigate
Committed to providing robust HS management system by:
•	 Providing safe and healthy working conditions for the prevention of work-related injury and 
ill health.
•	 Meeting regulatory standards/requirements and taking steps for continued improvement.
•	 Conducting periodic audits to identify HS risks and taking proactive steps to minimise and 
mitigate the same.

image. It also enables the Company to penetrate new markets/ geographics. 
In case of risk, approach to adapt 
or mitigate
•	 Standard Operating Practices (SOPs) and protocols laid down for every compliance requirement.
•	 Review by quality assurance team along with cross functional team at regular intervals.
•	 Expert external consultants are engaged for internal audits to ensure 100% compliance.
•	 Actively engaging with regulatory agencies to mitigate the risk.
Financial implications of the risk or 
opportunity

opportunity 
Positive
Extensive product range and innovative products at affordable prices augment growth, 
revenue and profits.
	 Sustainable Supply Chain Management
Indicate whether risk or opportunity Both, Risk & Opportunity
Rationale for identifying the risk/
opportunity
Risk rationale
Sustainable supply chain management involves integrating environmentally and financially 
viable practices into the complete supply chain lifecycle; from product design and 
development to material selection, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, warehousing, 
distribution, consumption, return and disposal.
Unprecedented situations may lead to disruptions in the supply chain and consequently 
impact business continuity.  
Supply chain not adhering to the Company principles may adversely affect the Company’s 
dealing with them and thereby impact the business.
Opportunity rationale
Sustainable supply chain management assists in not only reducing total carbon footprint, 
but also in optimising the Company’s end-to-end operations to achieve greater cost 
savings and profitability.
In case of risk, approach to adapt or 
mitigate
The Company has established robust systems to assess the implication of unprecedented 
situations that can disrupt the supply chain and develop contingency plans to avoid 
material impact on the business.
We undertake periodic assessment of suppliers to ensure that they adhere to the Company’s 
principles on responsible business conduct and the regulatory framework governing human rights. 
Financial implications of the risk or 
opportunity 
Positive
Strong supply chain practices enables the Company to swiftly deal with unprecedented

	 Risk Management
Whether risk or opportunity
Both, Risk & Opportunity
Rationale for identifying the risk/
opportunity
Risk rationale
Deficiency of robust controls and lack of proper risk management & mitigation system may 
lead to adverse impact on business operations and growth plans.

and efficient manner and thereby thwart any interruption or disruption of business. It also 
bolsters the Company’s business continuity plan.

mitigate
Managing risk is an interactive process and assists us in setting strategy, achieving 
objectives and making informed decisions. 
The Company has a well-established risk management system which includes identification

and mitigation strategies and implementation of the same to ensure business continuity, if 
risk materialises.
Major risks identified are regulatory, competition, ESG, supply chain disruption, cyber & data 
security, economic and political etc. 
Financial implications of the risk or 
opportunity 
Positive
A robust Risk Management and Mitigation Plan enables the Company to take timely 
actions/measures to minimise the chance of risk materialisation and its adverse impact, if 
the risk indeed materialises.
	 ESG Governance Risk 
Whether risk or opportunity
Both, Risk & Opportunity
Rationale for identifying the risk/
opportunity
Risk rationale
ESG governance risks have become more imperative in the business. The Company’s 
environmental, social and governance factors could create a bad reputation or harm the 
Company financially. 
Opportunity rationale
Embedding the ESG parameters in the Company’s governance structure will augment 
performance around ESG aspects and reflect commitment to build a sustainable business. 
It helps the Company to create financial value in the long run through sustainable methods 
of production and also balance its financial performance against sustainability risks.

parameters in the business plan which will reduce risk considerably.
Also, there is an effective audit and assurance regime around ESG disclosures.

enhance the brand reputation and increase trust in the investor community.
	 Talent Management Risk
Whether risk or opportunity
Both, Risk & Opportunity

Getting and retaining the right talent is crucial to the success of any organisation. Inability 
to meet the workforce expectations and well-being may impact the Company’s retention 
rate and adversely affect business operations.
Opportunity rationale
The Company considers its employees as invaluable assets and is committed to provide a 
conducive environment that values their contribution and provides them opportunities to 
grow. This enables the Company to attract and retain the right talent.

Yes, the Company places utmost emphasis on OHS management. Following are the objectives and commitments: 
•	 Provide safe and healthy working conditions for the prevention of work-related injury and ill health. 
•	 Eliminate hazards and reduce OHS risks.
•	 Continual improvement of the OHS management system. 
•	 Fulfil legal and other obligations. 
	
All work-related, health & safety risks and their causes in the work environment are identified. To mitigate the same, 
personal protective equipment is provided and awareness training related to SOPs and best practices is given to 
the employees and workers. Each site is supervised by the OHS management team and the site management, who 
conduct workplace inspections and hazard identifications, which are then notified to the OHS head. 
	
Safety & Environmental audits are also conducted through external agencies to identify gaps and establish 
compliances. Central Safety Committee and emergency response teams are also formed to periodically conduct 
workplace and work zone monitoring at the sites. As a safety measure, signages including general safety instructions 
(also in vernacular languages), Life Safety Rules etc. are placed at all the factories. Process Safety Risk Assessment 
& Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) are also kept at all the sites. Health insurance & compensation, Occupational 
health centre, first aid points, firefighting systems (smoke detectors, fire alarm systems, fire extinguishers etc.), SOPs 
to operate plant activities in emergencies, ambulance service and Government approved on-site Emergency plan 
are also provided at all the sites. To ensure that the suppliers comply with OHS regulations, the Company gathers

cause. Furthermore, follow up on implementation of CAPA is done to reassess the process if necessary.
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Yes/No)
	
Yes, systems are in place to report work-related hazards. Safety suggestion boxes are provided at each site where 
employees and workers can drop their concerns with details of the hazard identified. Based on the concerns raised, 
hazard risk level is evaluated and CAPA is implemented to either eliminate or to minimise hazard levels.
d)	
Do the employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, there is a Group Mediclaim policy for all the employees and workers.
