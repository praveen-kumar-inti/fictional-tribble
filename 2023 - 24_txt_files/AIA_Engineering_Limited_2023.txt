1
Greenhouse 
gas emissions 
& energy 
management
For AIA, a company 
operating in the 
manufacturing 
industry, the 
operations are 
highly energy-
intensive, 
predominantly 
relying on non-
renewable fuels 
due to the large 
scale of production.
We continuously look to replace high-emission fuels 
with more clean alternatives. 
2
Waste 
management
As part of 
manufacturing 
operations, a 
significant amount 
of waste is 
generated.
Our goal is to reduce the amount of waste we 
produce and make sure that it is reused or 
recycled for the same or a different purpose. A 
‘waste hierarchical approach’ is applied to reduce, 
reuse, recycle, and recover waste products in 
preference to disposal of waste in alignment with 
the circular economy. Where possible, we explore 
opportunities for the use of recycled material 
and reuse of waste by us or other companies 
through the co-processing of foundry waste 
and other waste as alternative raw materials or 
fuel. It presents opportunities for environmental 
stewardship and helps us manage price-related 
risks for raw materials. The Company takes waste 
management seriously and works towards reducing, 
reusing, and recycling its waste wherever possible. 
We optimise the use of key resources, including 
minerals, ensure waste minimisation at sources 
and facilitate recovery, and recycling. We follow 
waste management standards that meet or exceed 
applicable legal requirements and we incorporate 
industry best practices into our operations and 
services. We recognise the negative impact of 
improper waste disposal on the environment and, 
as a result, put in place strong mechanisms to treat 
and dispose of the generated waste. We ensure 
that all waste we generate from our activities is 
re-melted into the furnace or recycled through 
authorised recyclers and vendors, applying the 
Principles of Circular Economy

EI-8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases - 
Certainly. Yes, the Company has implemented several measures to prevent adverse consequences to complainants in cases of 
discrimination and harassment. At its Registered Unit in Odhav, there is a Grievance Redressal Forum, along with a dedicated 
e-mail and a suggestion box for reporting concerns. Employees are encouraged to approach the HR manager at their convenience, 
and they can submit complaints (written or verbal) to their functional heads, which are then escalated to the HR department. 
Complaints are addressed and resolved on priority basis within one month.
Furthermore, AIA has established an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) specifically to handle complaints of sexual harassment. 
The Company is committed to fostering a healthy and supportive work environment where women can operate without fear of 
gender bias, prejudice, or harassment. Measures are in place to ensure no adverse consequences for complainants, with issues 
addressed in a fair and transparent manner. Details and the inquiry process are treated with strict confidentiality.
Moreover, if the aggrieved person is unable to file a complaint due to physical incapacity, a relative, friend, co-worker, an officer 
from the National Commission for Women or State Women’s Commission, or any informed person may file a complaint on their 
behalf with their written consent.

EI-10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes - 
Waste Management Practices: At our establishment, we prioritise waste reduction, reuse, and recycling in accordance with a 
waste hierarchy approach, aligning closely with the principles of the circular economy. Our strategies include: 
1.	
Reducing Waste Generation: We optimise the use of resources, including minerals, to minimise waste at its origin. 
2.	
Reuse and Recycling: We actively seek opportunities to reuse waste both internally and externally, such as by utilising 
foundry waste and other materials as alternative raw materials or fuel through co-processing. 
3.	
Compliance and Best Practices: We surpass legal requirements in waste management and incorporate industry-leading 
best practices into our operations. 
4.	
Environmental Stewardship: Recognising the environmental consequences of improper waste disposal, we employ robust 
mechanisms for waste treatment and disposal. 
Specific Practices: 
	
Eco-friendly Brick Production: Utilising foundry waste materials such as sand and plastic, we manufacture eco-friendly bricks 
and paver blocks. In the previous year, we utilized approximately 150 MT of waste materials to produce over 50,000 bricks 
and paver blocks. Similarly, for F.Y. 2023-24, we continued this practice, using 172 MT of waste material to manufacture 
57,000 bricks and paver blocks, contributing to sustainable construction practices.
	
Co-processing with Ambuja Cement: We engage in co-processing with Ambuja Cement to reuse waste silica sand generated 
by foundry operations in cement kilns. In F.Y. 2022-23, 14,457 tonnes of waste silica sand were utilized for co-processing. 
Similarly, for F.Y. 2023-24, we continued this practice, utilizing 16,307 tonnes of silica sand for co-processing at Ambuja 
Cement Limited (an Adani Group company), ensuring regulatory compliance and sustainable waste disposal.
	
Organic Waste Utilisation: Kitchen and canteen waste are converted into organic manure through in-house composting 
machines and external waste management agencies. Approximately 70 MT of canteen and kitchen waste were effectively 
utilized for organic manure production and composting in F.Y. 2022-23. Similarly, in F.Y. 2023-24, we converted 67 MT of 
kitchen waste into organic manure.
	
Waste Sand: The Company has integrated mechanical and thermal reclaimers to recycle its molding sand, reducing the 
requirement for silica sand by 80%. The waste sand generated is used in co-processing in cement kilns and for making 
bricks and paver blocks.
	
Slag: Slag is reprocessed in our captive slag processing plant for metal recovery, with the recovered metal reused as raw 
material in foundry operations. In F.Y. 2022-23, a total of 7,863 tonnes of slag were processed in the Slag Processing Plant, 
recovering 900 tonnes of metal. Similarly, for F.Y. 2023-24, 12,922 tonnes of slag were processed, recovering 1,099 tonnes 
of metal.
	
Hazardous Waste Management: We prioritise the reuse and recycling of hazardous waste to promote a circular economy 
and minimize environmental impact. Our practices include:
	
1	
Partnerships with approved facilities for decontamination, recycling, and disposal of hazardous waste components like 
containers, oils, e-waste, batteries, and biomedical waste.
	
2	
Transportation and disposal of all hazardous waste using registered vehicles and in compliance with regulatory 
standards.
	
Non-Hazardous Waste Management: Our practices for managing non-hazardous waste include:
	
1	
Recycling and internal or external reuse of waste materials like silica sand, slag, and refractory materials for various 
purposes such as co-processing, brick making, and metal recovery.
	
2	
Sale of commercial waste materials like paper, wood, and rubber to designated vendors for further processing or reuse.
	
Our waste management policies and practices are detailed in our Waste Management Circular Economy Policy, underscoring 
our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.

AIA’s products demonstrate exceptional operational efficiency, 
meticulously tailored to meet the specific demands of 
each casting application. Our High Chrome and Sintercast 
technologies are renowned for their advanced quality and 
superior throughput, maintained through precise metal 
composition ratios. This efficiency directly translates into 
significant power savings during operation, reducing coal 
consumption and leading to substantial carbon savings. 
Ultimately, this contributes significantly to lowering CO2 
emissions, making a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas 
reductions for our customers.
For example, in the context of cement grinding, we observed 
substantial savings in alloys and a reduced carbon footprint by 
transitioning grinding elements from conventional alloy grades 
to VEGA Specific Grade. An analysis highlighted the anticipated 
reduction in greenhouse gases achieved through improved 
performance in grinding mills and tube mills.
In the period from April 2023 to March 2024, the castings 
supplied by AIA Engineering Limited (via Vega Industries) for 
Vertical Mills and Tube Mills demonstrated promising results. 
By utilizing Ceramic-based Grinding elements (Sintercast) 
for Vertical Roller Mills (VRM) and optimizing the alloy 
combinations in grinding media and latest liners/grate plates, 
an estimated 46.12 tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas 
emissions were avoided per tonne of specific product used 
in sectors such as cement, power plants, and tube mills at 
customer facilities. This resulted in a total absolute reduction 
of 13,35,322 tonnes of CO2e controlled/avoided based on the 
volume of products sold.
Total tonnage of liner castings sold amounted to 28,949 MT, 
contributing significantly to the reduction of 13,35,322 tonnes 
of GHG emissions.
Remarks: Conversion of energy kWh to carbon considered 
factors such as specific coal consumption (0.5 Kg/kWh) and 
carbon content in coal (40% fixed carbon + volatile matter). 
Calculations were based on operational hours of various 
cement plants, power plants, and tube mills where AIA 
conducted business.

We utilise direct energy for the heat treatment process 
across all our foundry units. To mitigate Scope 1 emissions, 
we have transitioned to Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and Liquid 
Petroleum Gas (LPG). Additionally, we have implemented flue 
gas recuperators on all our PNG-fired heat treatment furnaces. 
These recuperators enhance furnace efficiency by recovering 
heat from flue gases. The recovered waste heat is then utilized 
to preheat the combustion air supplied to the burners.

Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) practices are upheld across all our 
plants, supported by various initiatives aimed at minimizing 
water consumption. At Kerala GIDC Plant, we've implemented 
a dry-type cooling tower that significantly reduces blow 
down. This discharged water is now reused for sand mold 
preparation and cooling sand/slag. Greywater and sewage 
undergo treatment in our STP (Sewage Treatment Plant), with 
the treated water repurposed for gardening, toilet flushing, and 
cooling towers. Furthermore, we've adopted automatic and 
spring-operated water taps to mitigate potable water wastage, 
along with the installation of waterless urinals.
42,749 
kiloliters 
of 
treated water from the 
STP was reused.

EI-1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback - 
Customer Feedback Management 
We continuously gather and utilize feedback from customers to align with their requirements. Our process efficiently manages 
customer complaints regarding products and services. Typically, complaints are first received by the respective field engineer and 
then escalated to the Quality Assurance Controller for thorough investigation. When feasible, samples are collected and analyzed 
to determine the causes of issues. Root cause analyses are conducted for all complaints, and corrective actions are promptly 
implemented. Resolutions are communicated back to customers through our field engineers, ensuring customer satisfaction.
Measuring Customer Satisfaction 
We have implemented a robust system to monitor customer perceptions of our products. Feedback is systematically collected 
to cover various aspects of our operations. Key attributes evaluated include delivery timelines, product performance, and after-
sales service. Customer satisfaction levels are graded on a scale from 1 to 4. Using a weighted average method, we compute the 
Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) annually. For the latest reporting period, our CSI score stood at 97%.

(Yes/No) 
Our product packaging includes essential customer information like dimension and weight, among others. As our products, like 
grinding media in ball form and other alloy mill castings, are mechanical components made of metallic materials, they inherently 
pose no hazards in their original form. Therefore, they do not necessitate special handling or storage requirements. However, 
we provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) with consignments upon customer request. Furthermore, we actively conduct customer 
satisfaction surveys to ensure continuous improvement.
