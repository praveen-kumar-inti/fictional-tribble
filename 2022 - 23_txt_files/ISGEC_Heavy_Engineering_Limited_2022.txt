Corporate 
Governance and 
Code of Conduct

•
Isgec is a global company
with 
its 
products 
and
services catering to the
demand both nationally
and internationally.
•
As a philosophy, Isgec
believes in being a good
corporate

Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
•
Isgec has large manpower,
both in its Manufacturing
Units and in its Project
business at project sites
as well as its engineering &
procurement offices.
•
Adopting best practices to
ensure health and safety
of 
its 
employees 
and
workers is very important.
Company has proper 
systems in place to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
of the workforce at 
its 
workplace. 
For 
instance, 
it 
is 
ISO 
45001 certified and 
conducts 
periodic 
internal and external 
audits to assess the 
efficacy 
of 
health 
management in place. 
The 
Company 
has 
dedicated 
officers 
at 
plant 
& 
project 
sites. Further, it does 
health and safety risk 
analysis at sites and 
projects 
and 
takes 
necessary actions to 
avoid 
any 
negative 
events.
Ensuring the safety of 
the workforce of the 
Company would instill 
greater trust among 
the 
people 
in 
the 
Company which would 
be reflected in better 
financial performance.
3
Emission 
Reduction 
& Emission 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
•
Company 
is 
reliant 
on
non-renewable 
energy
sources to meet its energy
requirements, 
both 
in
regular 
operations 
at 
offices, 
manufacturing 
plants and at the Project 
sites.
•
Energy 
transition 
from 
non-renewable 
energy 
to renewable and energy 
efficiency measures would 
help 
in 
reducing 
the 
Company’s 
greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Over 
the 
years, 
Company 
has 
incorporated 
several 
energy 
efficient 
initiatives 
into 
its 
operations.
Further, it has been 
transitioning 
to 
cleaner 
energy 
by 
installing solar power 
plants and shifting to 
RLNG by cutting down 
diesel 
requirements 
to meet its energy 
requirements.
Adopting 
new 
technologies 
might 
lead increased cost/
investments 
in 
the 
short term. However, 
in 
the 
long-term 
adopting 
energy 
efficient 
measures 
and 
adopting 
new 
technologies 
would 
result in cost-saving.
4.
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
•
Company has a robust
supply chain management
system with a mix of
suppliers including both
big and small companies.
Company 
conducts
comprehensive 
supplier/
vendor assessment before
onboarding any suppliers
to ascertain that there
is no risk involved with
the 
potential 
supplier
specifically, 
financial
and 
legal 
compliances,
good health and safety
measures.
Availability 
of 
systematized supplier 
onboarding 
and 
assessment 
process 
would prevent non-
compliances and thus 
will 
have 
positive 
financial implications.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
•
The 
Company 
has
been 
working 
towards
decreasing the amount of
waste getting generated

the 
operations.
Furthermore, the Company
has been taking initiatives
to reuse some of the scrap
in 
its 
own 
operations.
Through the ETP cum STP
plant, the Company tries
to manage the liquid waste
effectively.
Company 
has 
identified

as 
one of the material 
issues and therefore, 
it 
has 
devised 
an 
effective 
waste 
management roadmap 
which helps Company 
adopt 
appropriate 
disposal 
practice 
for 
the 
respective 
category of waste so 
that recycling or reuse 
rate may be increased.
Initially, certain cost 
may be incurred while 
implementing 
the 
waste 
management 
practices.
8
Water 
Management
Opportunity
•
The Company understands
that water is a critical
natural 
resource 
and
should be used judiciously.
Isgec has been taking all
the necessary measures
to 
reduce 
the 
overall
water 
consumption 
in
its 
operations. 
Several
initiatives 
have 
been
taken 
to 
reduce 
the
water 
withdrawal 
and
implementing 
water
recyclability measures.
Since 
Company 
is 
already 
undertaking 
several 
initiatives 
to 
promote 
water 
conservation activities, 
it will have the positive 
financial implications.
