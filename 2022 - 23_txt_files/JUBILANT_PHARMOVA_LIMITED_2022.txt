Statement by director 
responsible for the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting 
ESG related 
challenges, targets and 
achievements 
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to present Jubilant Pharmova Limited's BRSR Report for the fiscal year 2023 (FY2023). 
As a pharmaceutical company, our core purpose is to improve lives through scientific and medical 
advancements. Our commitment to harnessing the power of science and technology has been 
instrumental in our holistic growth.
Within this report, we emphasise the sustainability challenges and opportunities encountered during 
FY 2023. Despite the obstacles faced, our Company achieved stable revenues due to the diversification 
of our businesses. We have expedited capacity expansions to bolster our capabilities and meet evolving 
demands. Moreover, we have successfully reduced our absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions year 
after year. This year, we are also fulfilling the reporting requirements of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) as mandated by SEBI. 
Corporate Overview | Statutory Reports | Financial Statements
111
Our commitment to sustainability is evidenced by our remarkable achievements in ESG ratings. We attained 
an outstanding percentile of 94% in the S&P Global ESG Indices CSA 2022 (DJSI), signifying a substantial 
increase of 42.50% compared to last year’s score. We take pride in attaining a GOLD Sustainability rating 
in EcoVadis, placing us among the top 5% of global pharmaceutical companies. This achievement 
underscores our dedication to environmental, social, and governance factors. Additionally, we have 
received an impressive ‘B’ score band from CDP for ‘Climate Change’ and ‘Water Security.’  The Company 
has moved from the ‘B-’ band (last year’s score) to the esteemed ‘B’ band, known as the ‘Management’ 
band. Furthermore, our leading position in the pharmaceutical sector and fourth position across all 
sectors in the Asia-Pacific Climate Leaders survey by Nikkei Asia validate our commitment to combatting 
climate change.
Our progress towards sustainability goals has been truly remarkable. We have surpassed expectations by 
achieving a 22% reduction in specific energy consumption, a 20.9% decrease in specific water consumption, 
and an impressive 55.1% reduction in specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to our FY 2019 
baselines. Additionally, our unwavering dedication and adaptability have resulted in a significant 38% 
reduction in absolute GHG emissions since FY 2019. We also take equal pride in maintaining a gender 
diversity ratio of 25.2% and remain focused on further enhancing diversity within our workforce. 
This report provides detailed insights into our initiatives, progress, and future plans. We acknowledge 
the evolving business landscape and the growing demands from stakeholders regarding ESG issues. Our 
strong ESG position instills confidence among stakeholders and allows us to explore new markets.
ESG excellence is ingrained in our corporate culture and reflected in our policies. We strive to minimise 
our environmental footprint, uphold good governance, and create shared value. We are integrating our 
in-house portal, ‘Sanchetna,’ to record all identified hazards and implement Corrective Action Preventive 
Action (CAPA) across all our manufacturing sites and offices. We also have ‘HumanTech,’ a cloud-based 
software utilising artificial intelligence technology, to assess ergonomic risks in our manufacturing 
operations and provide systematic solutions. Additionally, last year our Radiopharmacy business in the 
United States has implemented a Driver Safety training program called Driver Insights to address specific 
skill gaps.
Transparency is a core value for us, and we consistently share our ESG performance and goals with 
stakeholders. Our sustainability culture is fueled by our strong value system, and we continue to innovate 
and learn from the markets we serve. We aim to inspire the right talent and foster a supportive team that 
embraces change and supports our organisation’s cause.
As we move forward, we are committed to giving back more than we take. We look forward to continued 
sustainable growth in collaboration with our stakeholders.
