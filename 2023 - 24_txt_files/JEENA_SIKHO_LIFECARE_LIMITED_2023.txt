resolution, the employee can appeal to senior
management or an external arbitrator (if
specified). 5. Roles and Responsibilities •

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its
stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1. Describe
the processes
for identifying
key
stakeholder
groups of the
entity.
We engage with our stakeholders including Investors, Customers, Healthcare professionals, Employees,
Communities, Regulators, Suppliers, and Industry Associations to understand their expectations and concerns at
regular intervals. Effective stakeholder engagement is the cornerstone of building strong, mutually beneficial
relationships. By identifying and understanding the needs, interests, and potential concerns of our stakeholders,
we can mitigate risks and identify opportunities, drive innovation, foster collaboration, and increase trust. Our
stakeholder engagement process consists of the following steps: * Identifying key stakeholders involves
recognising the groups or individuals who hold significant influence over our operations or are directly affected
by the Company’s activities * Developing a clearly defined communication strategy requires finalising different
approaches to engage with stakeholders, considering factors such as communication frequency and the
preferred mode of communication * Engagement objectives help specify the desired goals and outcomes of the
engagement process. For example, objectives might include enhancing customer satisfaction or improving
employee retention rates * To measure the effectiveness of the engagement plan, we define specific metrics.
These metrics allow us to quantitatively assess the success of our engagement efforts. Additionally, we diligently
track our progress against these metrics to maintain transparency and accountability * We frequently evaluate
and refine the stakeholder engagement plan to ensure its continued effectiveness and relevance as our
operations evolve

5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place
to redress grievances related to human rights
issues.
1. Reporting Work-Related Hazards Create a straightforward, accessible
process for workers to report hazards. Steps to Implement: Reporting
Mechanisms: Provide multiple ways for workers to report hazards, such as a
digital platform, physical forms, or direct reporting to a supervisor. Anonymous
Reporting: Allow for anonymous reporting to encourage employees who may
feel hesitant about speaking up. Training: Educate employees on how to identify
and report hazards effectively. Clear Workflow: Establish a documented process
showing what happens after a report is made (e.g., acknowledgment,
investigation, resolution). Example Process: Worker identifies a hazard. Worker
submits a report via an app, email, or paper form. Supervisor or safety officer
reviews the report within 24 hours. Corrective action is implemented and
communicated back to the worker. 2. Removing Themselves from Risks Enable
workers to step away from unsafe situations without fear of retaliation. Steps to
Implement: Empowerment: Clearly communicate that employees have the right
to refuse unsafe work without consequences. Policy Development: Include a
formal policy in your safety manual that outlines this right. Safe Escalation:
Provide clear instructions on how to alert a supervisor or safety officer if a risk
is identified. Incident Documentation: Create a protocol for documenting the
incident, including the worker’s account and any actions taken to resolve the
issue. Example Guidelines for Workers: Stop work immediately if a hazard poses
an imminent threat. Notify your supervisor or safety officer of the risk. Relocate
to a safe area if needed. Resume work only after the hazard has been mitigated
and deemed safe. 3. Encourage a Safety-First Culture Regularly communicate
the importance of safety during meetings. Celebrate hazard reporting and
corrective actions to encourage proactive behavior. Conduct periodic safety
audits and act on findings promptly.

8. Mechanisms to
prevent adverse
consequences to the
complainant in
discrimination and
harassment cases.
Policy to Prevent Adverse Consequences to Complainants The organization is committed to ensuring a
safe and equitable workplace where individuals feel confident reporting concerns of discrimination or
harassment without fear of retaliation. All complaints will be addressed promptly, confidentially, and
impartially. Any form of retaliation against complainants or witnesses is strictly prohibited and will
result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Mechanisms to Prevent Adverse
Consequences 1. Confidentiality • Limit information about the complaint to those directly involved in its
resolution. • Use anonymous reporting systems where feasible. 2. Anti-Retaliation Measures • Clearly
define and enforce anti-retaliation policies. • Monitor interactions involving the complainant, ensuring
no changes to their role, responsibilities, or work environment are punitive. 3. Independent
Investigation • Assign neutral investigators who have no stake in the outcome. • Avoid involving
individuals in the process who have prior conflicts of interest. 4. Support Systems • Provide access to
counseling or Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). • Designate a liaison to support complainants
through the process. 5. Continuous Monitoring • Conduct periodic check-ins with the complainant post-
resolution to ensure there are no adverse impacts. • Monitor workplace dynamics to prevent subtle
forms of retaliation, like exclusion or unjust criticism. 6. Training and Awareness • Conduct regular anti-
discrimination and anti-harassment training emphasizing non-retaliation. • Educate employees on the
importance of supporting a culture of openness and accountability. 7. Escalation and Appeal • Provide
clear pathways for complainants to escalate their concerns if they experience adverse consequences. •
Allow appeals if the complainant is dissatisfied with the handling of their case. 8. Documented Processes
• Maintain detailed records of all complaints, investigations, and resolutions to ensure transparency and
accountability. • Use this documentation to identify and address patterns of retaliation or
discrimination. These measures aim to build trust and reinforce the organization's commitment to
fairness and safety.
