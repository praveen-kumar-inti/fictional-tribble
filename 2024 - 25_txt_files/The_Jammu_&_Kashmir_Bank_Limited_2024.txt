Climate Change Risk
The Bank recognizes that a portion 
of its credit portfolio is exposed 
to sectors and assets vulnerable 
to climate-related risks, both as 
primary financed assets and as 
collateral. Climate change presents 
a growing challenge to the long-term 
sustainability of these businesses, 
potentially affecting asset quality 
and creditworthiness.
The Bank has identified climate 
risk as a material risk requiring 
dedicated 
attention 
within 
its 
risk management framework. To 
effectively assess the materiality of 
this evolving risk, a comprehensive 
climate risk assessment framework 
is currently under development. A 
core component of this framework 
will be the application of scenario 
and sensitivity analysis, enabling 
the Bank to thoroughly evaluate 
the potential impact of key climate 
risk drivers across its business 
operations and financial exposures.

Observed Act/omission
Steps taken to address the non-compliances 
The bank allowed certain BSBDA holders to also open Savings 
Bank Deposit Accounts;
Bank has placed system level checks in CBS to prevent opening 
of more than one BSBD account for a single customer, except in 
cases where a minor’s account is opened under the parent’s Cust-
ID. Additionally, the system also restricts BSBD account holder from 
maintaining any other saving account simultaneously. 
The bank did not identify beneficial owner for opening accounts 
of certain Legal Persons, who were not natural persons;
There is proper mechanism in place wherein beneficial owner details 
are identified in terms of RBI guidelines. KYC/AML Department 
follows up with the branches on regular basis and ensures beneficial 
owner details are added in all the eligible legal entity accounts. 
The bank allowed operations in certain small accounts that did 
not meet the regulatory requirements;
Following system checks were implemented in CBS in the month 
of May 2023 to freeze such accounts at EOD if they exceed the 
following prescribed limits:
i.	
The aggregate of all credits in a Financial Year exceeds 
`1,00,000.
ii.	  The aggregate of all withdrawals and transfers in a month 
exceeds `10,000.
iii. 	 The balance in small account at any point of time exceeds 
`50,000.
After 12 months of operations, additional checks ensure that 
accounts without KYC are frozen. Customization allows users to 
unfreeze the account only after KYC is updated. The system permits 
a small account without KYC to remain operational for an initial 
period of 12 months. If no valid documentation is submitted within 
this period, the account is automatically frozen.
In line with regulatory directions, a new drop-down menu “KYC 
applied” (80KYC) has been created in Finacle, allowing customers 
to operate the account for an additional 12 months if proof of valid 
OVD application is provided. These accounts remain frozen until the 
KYC status is updated to either "KYC Submitted" or "KYC Applied."
After 24 months, accounts marked with "KYC Applied" status are 
frozen again, and unfreezing is only allowed once KYC is obtained 
and updated in the system. 
The bank sanctioned a working capital demand loan to a 
corporation against amounts receivable by way of subsidies from 
Government.
In order to avoid any such instances in future, Bank will take more 
cautious approach and diligently peruse RBI guidelines, and also 
seek clarification from RBI in case of any request for loan where 
revenues of the borrower also include of Govt. grants/ subsidies.

continuity plan aims to carry Business Impact Analysis (BIA) of all the business processes and applications required to 
run these processes. The BIA helps in defining the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
for all the applications. Based on the outcome of BIA, the activities/functions of the Bank were classified as Critical, 
Essential and Desirable and accordingly their recovery time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) has 
been established. Critical functions are the business functions, which if interrupted or unavailable for some time, can 
completely jeopardize the business and cause heavy damages.  Essential functions are those functions, whose loss 
would affect the bank’s business in the long run. Desirable functions are those functions that are normally required 
for achieving business and strategy objectives of the organization. Within the “Critical” category, the processes are 
further classified into two levels which would help in prioritizing the recovery operation.

minimum disruption to the business.
