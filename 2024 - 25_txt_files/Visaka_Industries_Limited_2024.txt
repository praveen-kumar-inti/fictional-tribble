	y
This is an opportunity 
as the output of the FG 
more than the input. 
By maintaining the 
output efficiency, the 
dependency on the 
materials will come 
down.
	y
Output efficiencies are 
predefined and continuous 
R&D activities maintain the 
consistency in efficient usage 
of materials used in it. Hence, 
maintaining the output material 
efficiency by selecting quality 
products is critical.

Sustainable 
Business (GHG

Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: Material sourcing, 
transportation and 
emissions in the 
manufacturing processes 
increases the carbon 
footprint. Govt Regulations 
are changing fast would 
impact the targeted 
markets.
Opportunity: Priority to 
sustainable initiatives and 
green building concepts by 
producing green products.
We are continuously working 
on reduction of emissions in 
the manufacturing. Through 
R&D activities, we have started 
developing local materials so 
as to reduce the emissions in 
transportation. Our Vnext Boards 
& panels have low CO2 emissions 
during manufacturing and business 
expanding in this line.
ATUM Solar, our BIPV product line, 
promotes operational sustainability 
for rooftops by reducing the carbon 
footprint for concrete roofs as well 
as renewable energy generation. 
Wonder Yarn, made from PET 
pellets/bottles, tackles plastic 
pollution in oceans.
We are promoting customers for 
LEED certification for new building 
constructions by encouraging 
them with sustainable product 
supply. Mitigating sustainability risks 
involves reducing emissions by 
adopting renewable energy sources, 
adopting sustainable practices, 
enhancing process efficiency, 
ensuring equity, and engaging 
stakeholders for a resilient future.

Opportunity
Risk: Increase of energy 
costs and depletion of 
natural resources for power 
generation.
Opportunity: Optimizing 
the energy usage by 
implementing energy 
efficient measures and 
impacting in reduction of 
cost
We actively implemented highly 
efficient energy saving drives 
to reduce the consumption and 
installed the renewable energy 
generating solar projects in all the 
manufacturing units. The results 
are visible in cost savings against 
generation of renewable energy 
units by around 6 lacs units plus per 
month.

Opportunity
	y
Keeping in view 
of customer 
awareness against 
sustainable products, 
needs continuous 
development against 
these products.
	y
We are continuously investing 
on R&D which is the key for 
Visaka to develop one of a kind 
innovative product like ATUM 
solar.
	y
Innovation is not a thought in 
Visaka but a culture. We actively 
conduct brainstorming sessions 
against sustainable products 
which is being a part of our 
routine jobs.

5.
Water – As a 
critical resource
Risk & 
opportunity
	y
Risk: Water is a major 
key component in 
our manufacturing 
processes. As water 
stress areas are 
increasing and zones 
are changing to critical 
one, purchasing water 
is a costly matter.
	y
Opportunity: Products 
Cost reduction 
happens through 
efficient water 
usage, installation of 
telemetry water flow 
meters for controlled 
usage & recycling 
measures through 
water harvesting pits to 
improve ground water 
levels.
	y
As a responsible organization 
& adopted sustainable 
approaches such as In process 
of Installing digital water meters 
to monitor the usage and to 
control the excess consumption. 
We have installed rainwater 
harvesting pits with bores in it 
based on the roof top collection 
and rainfall in the concerned 
locations.
	y
Implemented inhouse STPs to 
facilitate water treatment & its 
reuse for gardening.

Risk: Product safety 
concerns impact value to 
the customers.
Opportunity: Better 
product design for 
environment and safe 
working procedures in the 
manufacturing process 
increases the sustainable 
approach towards 
environment and value to 
the customers.
Implemented Improved dust 
extraction systems for safe

process. As innovation holds key at 
VISAKA, new product designs and 
development is business as usual.
Done EPD and LCA for fibre cement 
board and panel products to 
determine emissions and started 
acting on the areas to be improved.
