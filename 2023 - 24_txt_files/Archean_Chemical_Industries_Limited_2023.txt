These principles not only align with our values but also contribute significantly to long-term value creation 
and resilience.
Environmental stewardship underscores our commitment to minimizing our ecological footprint, conserving 
resources, and mitigating environmental risks. Social responsibility drives us to foster inclusive workplace, 
prioritize employee well-being and engage meaningfully with communities. Governance excellence 
ensures transparency, ethical conduct, and accountability across all levels of our organization.

innovation, growth and competitive advantage. Our dedication to ESG not only benefits our stakeholders 
but also contributes positively to the broader societal and environmental goals we aspire to achieve.

We are committed to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our 
operations. By enhancing the positive impact on our products on health, safety, and the environment 
throughout their life cycles, we adhere to the principles of product stewardship. Our goal is to enhance the 
quality of life in the communities where we operate. We prioritize addressing critical issues such as climate 
change, resource management, (including energy and water), waste management, and preserving nature 
and biodiversity.
To support our journey in addressing the ESG issues, we have implemented robust policies such as 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Policy, Integrated Management System (IMS) policy, Code 
of Conduct etc. We conduct our business in a manner that benefits the community, our workforce, 
and human capital. We provide clean, safe, healthy, and fair working conditions to our employees and 
business partners.
Our aim is to be a trusted neighbour in the communities we serve, promoting inclusive and equitable 
growth. Through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) measures, we contribute to the development of 
these communities, striving to create a positive impact that extends beyond operations.
Our short-term vision (0-3 year) focuses on energy efficiency upgrades, waste reduction initiatives, 
and employee engagement programs. Our goal is to strengthen our dialogue with key stakeholders to 
understand their sustainability expectations and concerns and incorporate their feedback into actionable 
plans.
Moving into our medium-term vision (3-5 years), we are committed to integrate sustainability considerations 
into our core business processes and decision-making frameworks. This includes embedding sustainability 
principles throughout our organization, aligning with UN Sustainability Development Goals (UNSDGs), 
and developing action plans to achieve them. We will also prioritize strengthening partnerships with 
suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders to drive collective action on shared sustainability challenges, 
leveraging collective expertise and resources.
Looking further ahead, our long-term vision aims for transformative changes by reimagining our business 
models and value chains, with sustainable development as a core driver of our business strategy .This 
involves continuous investment in research and development to drive innovation in sustainable products, 
services, and business models, while actively exploring new opportunities aligned with our long-term 
sustainability goals and building resilience to emerging sustainability risks and opportunities such as 
climate change impacts, resource scarcity and social inequality through proactive risk management and 
adaptive strategies.
The integration of ESG principles into our business strategy is not just a commitment; it is a strategic 
imperative. We recognize that businesses with strong ESG practices are better positioned to navigate 
risks, capitalize the opportunities, and create long-term value for all stakeholders. As we embark on this 
journey towards sustainability and impact, we invite our partners, employees, customers, and communities 
to join us in shaping a brighter, more sustainable future for generation to come.

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
In this reporting period, FY2023-24, we conducted a desktop-based materiality assessment, and the 
process we followed in detailed below.
	
We began by identifying key ESG issues under leading standards such as SASB, DJSI, and MSCI, 
specially focussing on the speciality chemicals sector. This involved a thorough analysis of the 
ESG criteria outlines by these international standards, ensuring we captured the most relevant and 
pressing topics for our organization. Following this, we reviewed the ESG material topics of both 
local and global peers and we considered four local and three global peers for our analysis. The 
identified material topics were then classified into the pillars of Environment, Social and Governance.
	
Next, we mapped these material topics against both peers and Industry standards. This process 
involved listing the material topics across the ESG pillars to identify the most relevant and critical 
issues for the organization. We also considered additional selection and rating criteria by assessing 
the performance of our peers across various rating agencies. This helped us identify potential gaps 
and focus areas that could be important to us. Furthermore, we collated risks identified by our 
organization, general industry risks noted by rating agencies and national bodies, as well as sector-
specific risks by geography. Based on this comprehensive assessment, we provided a final list of 
material topics for management’s internal review and assessment. Following a detailed review and 
discussion, the management validated and firmed up the material topics, ensuring they accurately 
reflect the company’s impact and objectives.

1.
Carbon 
Emission
R
Considering the global climate change 
and given the nature of our operations, 
carbon emissions is a material issue that 
could adversely impact the environment, 
and pose a risk to our business and ESG 
goals 
Our mitigation plan involves a 
strategic shift towards energy 
efficient methods of operation 
and sustainable sources of 
energy. Towards this initiative 
we are currently exploring 
alternative low carbon 
resources and Solar power
Negative
2.
Water 
Stewardship
O
Water stewardship presents a significant 
opportunity for our company through 
implementation of robust water 
management practices and embracing 
sustainable water usage strategies. 
We not only look to contribute to water 
conservation and protection but also 
enhance operational efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. This approach allows to 
minimize water-related risks, improve 
regulatory compliance, and strengthen 
our reputation as a responsible corporate 
citizen.

Energy 
Efficiency
R
Higher dependency on coal and diesel 
poses a significant risk to higher 
operational costs. This also increases 
our carbon footprint and adversely affects 
the environment. Inefficient usage of 
energy resources results in wastage, 
which further impacts achieving the 
sustainability goals
Increased usage of more 
efficient forms of energy 
such as low carbon electricity 
and solar plants. The other 
initiatives which can be 
undertaken would be
1. Conducting regular energy 
audits
2.  Investing in energy-
efficient technologies
3. Implementing energy 
management systems
Positive
4.
Health & 
Safety
R
Health and Safety risks are paramount 
in our industry due to the nature of 
chemical processes and substances 
involved. These risks include potential 
exposure to hazardous substances, 
accidents due to spills and leaks, fire 
and explosion hazards and ergonomic 
issues from manual handling or repetitive 
tasks. Additionally, inadequate safety 
protocols and trainings can lead to 
increased incidents and injuries amongst 
employees affecting productivity, morale 
and overall operational efficiency.
We conduct regular safety 
training sessions to enhance 
employee well-being and 
maintain a safe work 
environment. We also ensure 
robust health and safety 
measures, comprehensive 
training programs, regular risk 
assessment, and compliance 
to regulatory standards are 
essential to mitigate these 
risks and create a safe 
working environment.
Negative
5
Talent 
attraction, 
retention & 
development
O
Retaining skilled and experienced 
employees not only ensures continuity 
and stability but also fosters a positive 
work culture and enhances productivity. 
Attracting top talent enables us to bring 
fresh perspectives, diverse skills, and 
innovative ideas to drive our business 
forward. Moreover, investing in talent 
development through training mentorship 
programs, career advancement 
opportunities, and continuous learning 
initiatives not only empowers our 
employees but also strengthens our 
competitive advantage in the industry. By 
prioritizing talent retention, attraction, and 
development, we can build a strong and 
capable workforce that contributes to our 
long-term success and sustainability.
