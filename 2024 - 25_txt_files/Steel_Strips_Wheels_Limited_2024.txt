The Company expects all its
employees to adhere to the
Code of Conduct of SSWL and
practice Ethical behaviour.
The Company follows zero
tolerance 
for any 
non-
compliance as this will have an
adverse impact on the
Company. Due to the dynamic
nature of laws, rules and
regulations, it has become
imperative for the company to
ensure their compliance. Any
failure to comply with the same
may impact on the reputation
of the Company adversely.
Managing safety and health is
a top priority at SSWL. Safe
places and the good health of
employees/workers at work
contribute 
to 
better
productivity.
Risk 
Assessment 
is 
a
continuous process followed
by measures to effectively
control them to ensure safety
and good health of our
employees/workers at work.
Employees’ engagement and
productivity contribute to the
growth of the Company. To meet
the organization goals and
customer 
expectations,
employees with creativity,
innovative ideas and expertise
in different areas are an asset
to the Company. Attrition of
talent has a negative impact
on the growth of the company.
SSWL’s Code of Conduct,
Whistle Blower Policy, Code of
Conduct for prevention of insider
trading, code of practices and
procedures for fair disclosure of
unpublished price sensitive
information, Policy on materiality
of Related Party Transaction
and Grievance Redressal
across stakeholders ensures
ethical behavior and compliance
with applicable laws and
regulations. The said Codes and
policies provide for a framework
for employees and other
stakeholders to ensure that
business is governed only by
ethical practices. Further, any
amendments to the laws, rules
and regulations are checked on
a regular basis. The said policies
and code of conduct alongwith
any changes thereon are duly
communicated to the concerned
stakeholder groups.
To mitigate the risk, we strictly
follow the rules and procedures
laid down by our stringent health
and 
safety 
management
systems. We regularly conduct
trainings to create awareness of
safe working conditions and
building confidence of the
employees/workers. Further, the
Company conducts routine
health check-ups and maintains
internal health centers to
monitor the well-being of our
employees/workers.
Focused approach on employee
engagement and retention of
talent through multiple initiatives
includes 
providing 
cross
functional access, training
opportunities, recognitions and
skill development. The Company
continuously makes efforts to
promote diversity and offer equal
opportunities to all irrespective
of their age, gender, colour or
religion etc.

Well-being
Competition in the business
has increased significantly
causing a serious adverse
impact on the margins of the
auto 
component
manufacturers. Customer
dissatisfaction with price,
quality, delivery performance
and design could lead to a loss
of market share.
In contrary to above, shift of
the un-organized market to
brand-based product offerings
and 
developing 
new
components 
turn 
the
competition into opportunity.
SSWL’s assumptions while
estimating social costs like
gratuity funding are subject to
actuarial risks and any shortfall
could put pressure on financial
performance of the Company.
The Company believes in
corporate excellence and
social welfare. This corporate
philosophy is the force for
integrating Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) into
Company’s values, culture,
operation and business
decisions at all levels of the
organization. 
Being 
a
responsible corporate citizen,
the Company has a value
system of giving back to
society and improving the
quality of life of communities
and 
the 
surrounding
environment. The company is
committed to its social
responsibility by taking various
initiatives in the fields of
education, public health,
environment and community
welfare, etc. which would
benefit society at large.
The Company continues to
strive to improve its operational
performance, strict quality
controls and develop new
components, 
which 
are
technologically superior and
have 
an 
edge 
over 
its
competitors.
The Company works closely with
its key customers on product
development and remains
ahead on the technology curve.
A framework to manage social
cost risks has been deployed to
ensure that obligations remain
affordable and sustainable.

Manufacturing sectors are

Growing

concerns have made the
Companies to focus its
investments on renewable
sources of energy and
controlling & modifying of
various 
manufacturing
processes having adverse
impacts on the environment.
Fresh water is an important
input for both manufacturing
processes and domestic
purposes of the Company.
Processes such as paint
booths are water intensive
processes in automotive
industry. It is important to use
quality water to maintain the
paint quality. Water scarcity is
India’s silent crisis and
unpredictable rainfall across
India 
makes 
the
manufacturing plants more
vulnerable for water shortages.
Hence, insulating against
water risk is one of the
identified business risks and
priorities.
SSWL is working on alternate
sources of energy, water
recycling and enhanced use of
returnable 
packaging 
to
minimize waste and maximize
reuse. 
The 
company 
is
constantly striving ahead in
converting its fossil fuel based
power consumption to renewable
resources. The Company has
further invested in Clean Max
Astria Pvt. Ltd. (CMAPL), a
special 
purpose 
vehicle
engaged in the business of
production, generation, supply
and distribution of wind, solar
and/or hybrid power in order to
off-take Electricity generated by
it under captive consumption.
During the year, the company
made further investment in
CMAPL in this regard. The
Company has installed rooftop
solar facilities at all its plants.
The implementation of which
has resulted in substantial
conversion of fossil fuel power
consumption to renewable
sources. All plants have moved
completely 
on 
fresh
polycarbonate 
sheets 
to
improve lux levels and save
power consumption.
The Company strives to mitigate
the water risk by adopting
following methods:
•
Optimum usage of water in
all operations through
various water efficiency
measures adopted such as
low volume water taps,
arresting 
leakages 
in
pipelines, amongst others.
•
Rainwater harvesting: By
increasing rainwater storage
capacity.
•
Recycling: By installing ETP/
STP and RO plants, we
strive to increase our water
recycling capacity.
•
Ground water recharge: By
installing specially designed
deep aquifer pits for
improving ground water
table 
to 
ensure 
the
availability of water for the
community.

Cyber security
The complexity and global
span of automotive industry
supply 
chains 
expose
companies to significant
sustainability and disruption
risks, impacting operational
continuity and leading to
decline in sales and margins.
The use of energy is an
inevitable 
part 
of 
the
Company’s operations.
However, efficient use and the
implementation of our own
renewable energy sources will
help 
in 
improving 
the
Company’s operations. In the
short-term, there may be a
negative impact from investing
in renewable sources of
energy, however, in the long-
term there would be a positive
impact from methodical use of
these energy sources and
aligning 
with 
industry
expectations.
The fast pace at which the auto
sector is growing at present, it
is bound to face concerns
relating to Internet Protocols,
data privacy and risk-shifting
for warranty issues that would
need to be addressed to settle
uncertainties 
amongst
stakeholders. Further, threats
of external cyber-attacks,
hacking and internal leakage,
modification of information,
failure to protect information
are other concern issues.
SSWL aims to develop a
resilient supply chain framework
by diversifying suppliers and
integrating sustainability criteria
into supplier selection. At SSWL
we 
have 
implemented
transparent 
supply 
chain
practices to ensure compliance
with environmental and social
standards, thereby reducing
potential risks.
SSWL is constantly striving
ahead in converting its fossil fuel
power 
consumption 
to
renewable resources. The
Company is actively engaged in
energy management. The
Company has invested in Clean
Max Astria Pvt. Ltd. (CMAPL), a
special 
purpose 
vehicle
engaged in the business of
production, generation, supply
and distribution of wind, solar
and/or hybrid power to off-take
Electricity generated by it under
captive consumption. The
Company has installed rooftop
solar facilities at all its plants. All
plants have moved completely
on fresh polycarbonate sheets
to improve working conditions
and save power consumption.
The Company focuses on
continuous 
protection 
of
confidential information across
the IT landscape to prevent loss/
theft of confidential data through
installation 
and 
regular
updations of various antivirus
and 
malware 
protection
softwares, 
firewalls, 
etc.
Periodic audits are conducted to
ensure adherence to the
processes. Additionally, the
company has obtained ISO-
27001 certification to comply
best in class IT norms.
