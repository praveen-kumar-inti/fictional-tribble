Data Privacy
Risk
Regulations 
have 
been 
implemented for businesses to 
handle personal data and for 
organisations that transmit user 
data to such companies, yet data 
leaks have been the headlines quite 
very often. Big data challenges 
can pose trouble when it comes to 
accumulating adequate user data, 
without which exact scrutiny cannot 
be carried out. Viewers are being 
more sensitive than ever, towards 
their data and are troubled on how 
their personal data is being used.
Data 
privacy 
policies 
are 
implemented throughout the 
organization 
with 
adequate 
internal control and quarterly

Copyright 
and Piracy 
issues
Risk
With the rise of digitisation, more 
big data problems have emerged 
such as sharing of account 
information 
through 
which 
multiple users can view content 
from the same account, using 
the password. It then becomes 
difficult 
for 
the 
production 
houses to categorize what genre 
of content is favorable to an 
adult and to a child. Pinpointing 
on the demographic details of 
an account user also becomes 
extremely difficult. Many people 
have started using the content 
available on online platforms for 
their own use; pirate and spoof 
this data to make it look like their 
own new creation and upload it to 
generate revenue.
Preventing unauthorized access 
to its content using content

Risk
Regulatory compliance and good 
corporate governance form the 
foundation of our business and 
non-compliance in any form can 
severally impact our business, 
brand name as well as credibility.
Further Building a culture of 
integrity 
and 
transparency 
is 
linked 
with 
fulfillment 
of 
mandates 
as 
well 
as 
strengthening relationships with 
stakeholder.
Our approach towards mitigating 
compliance 
and 
governance 
related risks consist of the 
following initiatives:
• Implementation of compliance 
monitoring system
• In-house 
professionals 
as 
well as consultation with 
experts
• Continuous 
monitoring 
of 
regulatory changes
• Periodic
