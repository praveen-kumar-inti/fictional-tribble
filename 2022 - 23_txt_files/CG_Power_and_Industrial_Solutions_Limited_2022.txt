The past stands reconciled. The present 
optimised. Time now to seed the future. 
Yes, at CG, we are now seeding the future. A 
future of immense potential. To engineer better, 
to manufacture leaner, to sell across more, to 
invent faster, to retain and allocate more. In a 
world striving to add efficiency, comfort and 
predictability; capital goods as well as CG ought 
to rise to the occasion. 
Responding to the opportune landscape, we 
are expanding our manufacturing capacities for 
motors and transformers both. Learning from 
our recent exploration of operational excellence, 
we are blending debottlenecking and greenfield 
expansion both to achieve higher capital 
efficiency. 
Furthering our gains in market share and 
customer confidence, and on the back of added 
capacities, we are heading to sell more in the 
global markets. Adding impetus to our in-house 
research and development, we are exploring 
technological collaborations to fast forward our 
approach to newer and bigger opportunities.

Dear shareholders, 
Over the last few years, I believe that we 
have successfully overcome the phase of 
addressing legacy issues. From grappling 
with severe financial constraints and 
mounting debts, we have transformed 
into a debt-free entity. Our progress is 
exemplified by our ability to not only 
meet the needs of our employees and 
vendors but also fund our future capital 
expenditure through internal accruals. 
We have overcome existential challenges 
and achieved remarkable growth in both 
revenue and profitability for the second 
consecutive year.
Chairman's Letter
Chairman's Letter
The resurgence, within just nine quarters, 
in 
CG's 
performance 
signifies 
the 
strength, determination, prudence and 
governance of both the Murugappa 
Group's Tube Investments and CG. I 
take great satisfaction in these initial 
results, and I wholeheartedly thank 
all stakeholders, including our Board, 
Management, Staff, Customers, and 
Suppliers for their contribution.
We now stand at the cusp of a new era. 
We look towards the future with renewed 
vigour and confidence as the efforts that 
have propelled our recent success have 
also laid a solid foundation for a promising 
future. 
The external environment continues to 
be supportive, with a healthy flow of 
enquiries and orders in both our operating 
segments – Industrial Systems and Power 
Systems. The Government segment's 
demand is expected to increase during 
the next capital expenditure cycle, while 
the softening of commodity prices and 
gradual easing of inflation bode well for 
the future.
In line with our future growth strategy, we 
are initiating the implementation of three 
principal pillars: (1) expansion of capacity, 
(2) enhanced focus on exports, and (3) 
accelerated technological advancements. 
We 
believe 
that 
these 
pillars 
are 
complementary and will fuel the next 
phase of our growth.
The capacity expansion pillar aims not 
only to debottleneck and modernize 
existing facilities but also to add new 
capacity. Plans have been drawn up to 
substantially expand the capacity across 
Ahmednagar, Goa, Bhopal and Malanpur 
plants. These projects would involve an 
aggregate outlay of around ` 400 Crore 
over the next two years.
For the second pillar, we are developing 
a detailed strategy that lays out the 
specific geographies, defines the product 
offerings, and determines the go-to-
market strategy. We are confident that 
we can increase the revenue contribution 
from exports from 5% to 20% over the 
next 4-5 years.
The third pillar is focused on accelerated 
technological advancement. Our robust 
R&D 
mechanism 
has 
kept 
us 
technologically relevant over the years and 
has actively worked on future products & 
technologies. We continue to strengthen 
our R&D efforts and explore collaborative 
partnerships to augment our internal 
efforts.
I am pleased to announce that CG has 
already made its first dividend pay-out 
since the recent change in ownership. I 
express my gratitude for your continued 
trust & patronage and invite you to partner 
with us in co-creating a more diverse, 
global, and competitive CG.
Thank you
Warm regards,

Dear fellow 
shareowners, 
You would be happy to see the 
all-round performance recorded by your 
Company in the fiscal year ended March 
2023. Over the last nine quarters, we 
have 
sequentially 
navigated 
through 
the phases of stabilisation, turnaround, 
and growth successfully and we are 
now taking steps for the next phase 
of 
consolidation, 
expansion, 
and 
profitable growth.
FY23 proved to be a year of growth 
moderation for economies worldwide 
including India. Geo-political challenges, 
mounting inflation, increasing interest 
rates, heightened and volatile commodity 
prices, strained supply chains - economies 
had to navigate through a multitude of 
challenges. In this backdrop, India deftly 
manoeuvred its march forward to appear 
once again as the fastest growing major 
economy. The growth was aided by a 
slew of factors including near universal 
vaccination, strong performances from 
manufacturing, agriculture and services 
sectors, encouraging exports growth, 
government’s infrastructure push and a 
rebound in MSME sector. 
Coming to our Company’s performance, 
we continued to build on our efforts 
towards 
operational 
excellence, 
lean 
manufacturing, and cost, time, and 
resource optimisation. In the backdrop 
of heightened volatility in commodity 
prices, we sharpened our focus on 
margin protection and a favourable 
product 
mix. 
The 
results 
of 
these 
companywide 
initiatives 
are 
visible 
in our combined as well as divisional 
performances.  We chalked out and 
started some debottlenecking exercises 
aimed at releasing added capacities and 
increased throughputs.
On Standalone basis, revenue and PBT 
before exceptional items recorded in FY23 
is the highest in the last 11 years. All the 
businesses grew significantly over the last 
year with good margins.
Standalone revenue for FY23 was higher 
at ` 6,580 Crore, recording a growth of 
28% over FY22. Profit before tax reached 
` 927 Crore as compared with `502 
Crore in FY22. Margins were higher on 
account of volume growth, higher sales 
realization, procurement efficiencies, and 
higher other income. ROCE for FY23 was 
39% as against 27% in FY22. The free 
cash flow generated for the year was 
` 749 Crore. Order intake for FY23 was 
` 7,828 Crore. Order book on hand 
as on 31 March 2023 aggregate to 
` 4,319 Crore.
Consolidated revenue for FY23 was higher 
at ` 6,973 Crore, recording a growth of 
27% over FY22. Profit before tax reached 
` 950 Crore as compared with ` 504 Crore 
in FY22. Margins were higher on account 
of volume growth, higher sales realization, 
procurement 
efficiencies, 
and 
higher 
other income. ROCE for FY23 was 62% 
against 45% in FY22. The free cash flow 
generated for the year was ` 802 Crore. 
Order intake for FY23 was ` 8,451 Crore.

` 2,865 Crore for FY23. Unexecuted 
Order book as of 31 March 2023 stood at 
` 2,279 Crore, recording a 46% growth 
over the previous year.
To summarise, FY23 was a record-
breaking year. The Company built on its 
strengths and delivered across financial 
and 
operational 
parameters. 
Several 
landmarks were achieved - highest ever 
sales by the Motor Division, highest ever 
sales by the Railways Division, and highest 
ever order booking for the Transformer 
Division. The Company declared and paid 
interim dividend, marking its return to 
dividend pay-out after a gap of 7 years. 
The Company prepaid all its remaining 
term loan of ` 100 Crore, redeemed the 
NCDs outstanding and became debt-free. 
India Ratings upgraded the Company's 
long-term 
rating 
to 
‘AA’ 
and 
the 
short-term rating to ‘A1+’.
We have drawn up plans to substantially 
expand the manufacturing capacity of 
Motors at our Ahmednagar and Goa 
plants, the transformer manufacturing 
capacity at Bhopal and Malanpur plants 
are also being expanded. These projects 
would involve an aggregate outlay of 
around ` 400 Crore, to be incurred 
over the next two years. Your Company 
is confident of funding these out of 
internal accruals. 
We have entered FY24 with a forward 
strategic orientation, one which prepares 
and steers us for the next 4-5 years. 
Three pillars of this strategic roadmap are 
capacity expansion, exports focus and 
operational excellence. A two-pronged 
approach henceforth would enable us to 
further fortify our core strengths at one 
hand while simultaneously seeding the 
future. The approach is being backed by 
an expanded R&D, one which intensifies 
our in-house research and development 
activities while also exploring collaborative 
approach of technology access for a faster 
and wider access to market opportunities 
including global destinations. 
The strength of a healthy balance sheet 
coupled with a predictable free cash flow 
regime empowers us to pursue future 
growth with confidence.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
GLOBAL 'SOCIO-ECONOMIC' LANDSCAPE 
The year gone by (calendar year 2022 for the world 
and fiscal year 2022-23 for India) was a year of 
continued volatility and steadfast resilience. On the 
verge of the two-year-long pandemic that crippled 
lives and livelihood, mankind’s hope of a somewhat 
stable year met with a catastrophic Russia-Ukraine 
conflict in February 2022. The return of war to Europe 
after almost nine decades post the second world war 
spiraled into a truly global event with widespread 
financial, energy and technological sanctions against 
Russia. Geographic significance of strife-affected 
areas aggravated constraints on already challenged 
global supply chains, especially for food, fertilizer and 
energy.
With easing out of pandemic restriction from the 
vast swathes, except for certain regions in China, 
the global demand situation steadily improved 
throughout 2022. Concurrent supply bottlenecks 
fueled inflation to a record high. Consequent policy 
response of increasing interest rates applied further 
brakes to global economic recovery.
A severe economic crisis in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, 
civic unrest in Iran, unprecedented public push back 
against zero-Covid policy in China and heightened 
political instability in the United Kingdom left their 
own mark on the global economic landscape.
Defying the widespread global trends with an 
astute management of internal as well as external 
affairs, India continued to remain the silver lining of 
economic recovery. Coincidentally, 2022 witnessed 
India gaining G-20 presidency with a responsibility of 
steering the world together on the path of economic 
and social development.
Global economic growth 
The International Monetary Fund’s latest (April 2023) 
World Economic Outlook ("WEO") has estimated the 
world economic growth to have dropped down to 3.4% 
in 2022 from 6.3% in the previous year. Economic 
growth for Advanced Economies ("AE") and Emerging 
Markets and Developing Economies ("EMDE") are 
estimated to have slowed down to 2.7% (5.4% in 
2021) and 4.0% (6.9% in 2021) respectively. 
Taking cognizance of the recent financial sector 
turmoil, higher debt levels and continuation of 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, WEO has predicted further 
moderation in 2023 with economic growth for the 
world, AE and EMDE projected at 2.8%, 1.3% and 
3.9% respectively.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE: INDIA
Insulating itself to a greater extent from global 
volatilities and uncertainties, India remained steadfast 
in pursuing its 5-trillion-dollar economy dream. Its 
fiscal year 2022-23 (FY23) benefitted from near 
universal vaccination that helped contact-intensive 
sectors such as trade, hospitality and transport stage 
a comeback. Return of migrant labour to construction 
activities helped housing, infrastructure and industrial 
segments to speed up capital formation.
The Central Government’s amped up stance of 
capital expenditure got paired with a healthy growth 
in private consumption. Exports growth continued its 
FY22 momentum in the first half of FY23. Country’s 
MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector 
witnessed a very healthy credit offtake.
The strengthening of balance sheets of the 
Corporates and a robust, well capitalized banking 
sector fortified the foundation for the next round of 
Capex cycles across manufacturing, infrastructure 
and logistics sectors. Continued investments in 
public digital platforms coupled with recent enablers 
such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics Policy 
and the Production linked Incentive schemes augur 
well for driving a sustained growth in manufacturing 
sector.
The momentum of the previous fiscal (FY22) helped 
sustain accelerated growth during the first half of 
FY23. The aftereffects of external factors, European 
conflict and unprecedented inflationary pressure 
across advanced economies, however accentuated 
inflationary pressures as well as slowdown in export 
growth during the second half of FY23.
India - GDP growth 
In FY23, the Indian economy once again demonstrated 
its inherent resilience and underlying strengths to 
emerge as the fastest growing major economy in the 
world. In spite of a gradual moderation in the second 
half, IMF’s April 2023 WEO estimated the Indian 
Economy to have recorded a healthy growth rate of 
6.8%. 
Hailing India as the real bright spot of global growth in 
the near future too, WEO estimates suggest that the 
country will continue to be the fastest growing major 
economy in FY24 and FY25 too with projected growth 
rates of 5.9% and 6.3% respectively. 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS
In the country’s march forward to become a 5-trillion-
dollar economy, a key underlying theme is the 
manufacturing boom. Three factors supporting this 
underlying theme are:
•	 Internal 
strengths: 
India’s 
working 
age 
population of nearly 800 million with diverse skill 
and globally competitive wage structure makes 
the country a natural fit for becoming the next 
manufacturing back-office of the world. The rapid 
push towards bridging the infrastructure gap is 
steadily addressing the logistics bottleneck that 
long crippled our manufacturing and exports 
potential. Recent rationalization of corporate taxes 
coupled with a slew of initiatives such as Make 
in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Production Linked 
Incentive ("PLI") scheme and a sharp focus on 
improved ratings on ease of doing business are 
all set to attract not only global manufacturing but 
also manufacturing investments in the country. 
	
Geo-political stability, world-leading economic 
growth, 
substantial 
domestic 
demand 
and growth aspiration and appetite aptly 
demonstrated by the central leadership are 
all fueling steady growth in the country’s 
manufacturing sector.
•	 External realignments: The frailty of a 
concentrated global supply chain that emerged 
and strengthened over the previous two-three 
decades got aptly exposed in the run up to 
and aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent 
Russia-Ukraine conflict further emphasized 
the advantage of insulating supply chains from 
conflict prone regions. India’s rich legacy of key 
multinational companies manufacturing in India 
for several decades strengthens its credentials. 
	
At a time when Corporations worldwide are 
shifting towards the China + 1 strategy, India, with 
its vast pool of skilled white collar and blue collar 
workmen, globally competitive technological 
ecosystems and wage productivity stand to gain 
significantly from above trends. 
•	 Timing: Much before the frailties of concentrated 
supply chains got exposed, the world’s fastest 
growing economy was already preparing for a 
manufacturing boost. With making its intent clear 
to the world with the global roll out of the Make 
in India 1.0 campaign, the country continued to 
make massive public investment towards large 
scale infrastructure creation.  Backing it up with 
aforementioned reforms, India is fast welcoming 
global manufacturers on its fertile turf.
In the Union Budget 2023–24, the government 
increased capital expenditure outlays by 33 per cent 
to ` 10 lakh Crore from ` 7.5 lakh Crore in FY23. 
The Budget’s focus on infrastructure development 
through capital expenditure is expected to crowd in 
private investment and strengthen job creation and 
demand.
Not surprising then, the capital goods sector is 
dominating the monthly growth chart of industrial 
production activity in FY23. In the 11-month period 
(Apr22- Feb23) for which updates were available 
at the time of finalising this report, Capital Goods 
production recorded the highest and second highest 
growth rates 7 times and 3 times respectively.

MOTORS
Between April - December 2022 (9-month period), 
FHP, LT and HT motors recorded a growth of -2.6% 
(negative), 3% and 38% respectively, as per the 
latest IEEMA report of 6 April 2023. In our own 
assessment, lower demand will lead to de-grow FHP 
motor segment. However, LT motors will continue to 
grow on the back of growth in ethanol, bio-gas and 
infrastructure projects. The fastest growth is pegged 
to be witnessed in HT motor segment, duly aided by 
aggressive government investment in water projects 
such as Jal Jeevan Mission and National River 
Linking Project.
RAILWAYS
Having completed a glorious 170-year long journey 
in 2023, the Indian Railways is the second biggest 
rail network in the world with over 108,000 km of 
running lines. Leveraging its multi-gauge assets, it 
transports passengers and cargo across the length 
and breadth of the country, traversing plains, forests, 
deserts and snowy mountains.
Railway transportation is viewed as one of the central 
pivots of the grand vision of making India a ten-
trillion-dollar economy by 2030. Consequently, the 
Indian Railways is undertaking steps for creating 
an enabling physical and social infrastructure that 
aids economic growth, ease of living, sustainable 
developments and reducing emissions.

Accelerating its modernisation drive in a mission 
mode, the vast legacy network of the Indian Railways 
is undergoing an inside-out transformation in recent 
times. The National Rail Plan, Vision 2024, aims to 
speedily implement critical projects – multi-tracking 
of congested routes, universal route electrification, 
speed upgrades to 160 kmph for Delhi-Howrah and 
Delhi-Mumbai routes and 130 kmph on all other 
golden quadrilateral-golden diagonal ("GQ/GD") 
routes, and elimination of all level crossings on the 
GQ/GD route – by 2024.
The Indian railways aims to harness and leverage 
indigenous technical capabilities in relevant fields 
of High Speed Railways ("HSR") with a view to 
develop professional expertise across all aspects 
of HSR. It will also contribute to the development of 
HSR specific standards in India. 17 billion dollars has 
already been invested in introducing High Speed train 
network for operation of “bullet trains”. This would 
modernise the rail network and make the railway 
industry globally competitive.
There is also a plan to introduce coaches made up 
of aluminium. These would be lightweight coaches, 
which would further reduce travel time.
Development highlights
•	 Aligning with “Made in India” initiatives for zero 
import of rail components
•	 400 new Vande Bharat trains slated to be 
produced over the next 5-7 years
•	 1st indigenously designed and developed 
hydrogen-fuelled train is slated to be rolled out by 
December 2023, 35 such trains to be operated 
on heritage and hill routes
•	 Rolling Stock Equipment & Components and Way 
Side Equipment (transformer, switchgears etc.) 
including indigenous TCAS/Kavach technology is 
slated to be implemented over 2,000 km of the 
network to increase capacity and ensure safety
•	 100 
PM-GatiShakti 
Cargo 
Terminals 
for 
multimodal logistics facilities to be built over the 
next three years
•	 Replacement of outdated Multi Cabin Mechanical 
Signalling System with modern Signalling System.
•	 Infrastructure spending includes an allocation of 
` 31,850 Crore for new line projects, ` 30,749 
Crore for track doubling, ` 4,600 Crore for gauge 
conversion, ` 17,296.84 Crore for track renewals 
and ` 27,482 Crore for the Eastern and Western 
Dedicated Freight Corridor projects
•	 Budgetary provision made for the manufacture 
of 1000 additional and smaller eight-car Vande 
Bharat EMUs, 25 hydrogen-powered trains and 
150 air-conditioned EMUs
•	 A total of 1290 electric locomotives to be built 
at IR Locomotives production units and 55,000 
newly designed wagons to be procured under 
public-private partnership ("PPP") mode
POWER SYSTEMS
The overall generation (including generation from 
grid connected renewable sources) in the country 
has increased from 1110.458 BU during 2014-15 
to 1624.158 BU during 2022-23, representing a 
growth of 4.87% CAGR during the period.
Y-o-Y growth for FY23 stood at 8.87% over 1491.859 
BU generated during FY22. The growth was driven by 
an impressive 18.99% increase in Solar, Wind and 
other RES segments. Thermal category too recorded 
a healthy growth of 8.2% in FY23.
The electricity generation target (Including RE) for the 
year 2023-24 has been fixed as 1750 Billion Unit ("BU"), 
corresponding to an annual growth of around 7.2%.
The Indian Power Sector is poised for high growth 
for a long period. Two major enabling shifts on the 
generation side are increasing share of power from 
renewable sources as well as of private sector 
entities. Transmission segment too is geared up for 
renovation of legacy lines and addition of new lines 
to aggregate and integrate generation from relatively 
smaller capacity renewable sources. Distribution side 
too is fast progressing towards necessary reforms 
and modernization.
The Central Electricity Authority ("CEA") estimates 
the 
country’s 
power 
requirement 
to 
reach

ease to use unified system and 
database to access real time 
dashboard reports with huge cost 
saving on efforts and landscape 
management.

AUTOMATION
Being a legacy company with eight+ decades 
of existence and an early adopter of information 
technology, our SAP ECC system had organically 
grown over the last couple of decades with loads 
of redundant data as well company codes (active 
and non-active).  Additionally, the database of ECC 
system was 12 TB and plenty of custom code and Z 
Programs, custom reports, and batch jobs.
In light of this fact, it was decided by management 
to opt for latest technology of SAP Hana with active 
company codes data and custom reports relevant to 
CG. The journey of conversion with data carve out, 
which commenced in July 2022, was successfully 
made live on 10 April 2023.

committee approves the Risk 
based Audit plan proposed by the 
independent Internal Auditors at 
the beginning of the year. Risk 
based audits are performed for all 
business and verticals (Corporate, 
Regional offices and Plants). 
The scope and objectives of 
internal audit reviews go beyond 
transactional risks. Emerging risk 
avenues are also considered while 
defining the audit plan.
The internal auditor focuses on 
business process and system 
audits to assess adequacy of 
internal controls, tracks evolution 
of risks and mitigation plan, 
compliance with the Company wide 
Delegation of Authority ("DoA"), 
adherence to company’s policies, procedures and 
prudent business practices.
Significant internal audit observations and status of 
implementation of action plans for risk mitigation 
are submitted to the Audit Committee every quarter 
for review. The Audit Committee assesses adequacy 
and effectiveness of inputs given by internal audit, 
and suggests improvement for strengthening internal 
controls from time to time.
The Company has also established whistle-blower 
mechanism operative across the Company for 
reporting of any unethical behaviours by employees 
or directors.
With the intent to build a strong control environment 
and recommendations from the 
internal audit, the management 
is continuously improving the 
systems and processes through 
various initiatives in recent years. 
Some of the select initiatives 
include:
Technology initiative includes
•	 Enterprise-wide 
Resource 
Platform system – SAP 
which enables the business 
processes has been recently 
upgraded (to S4 HANA 
version). This improves the 
efficiency and scalability of 
business processes along 
with well-designed inbuilt 
system controls.
•	 Compliance management tool has been upgraded 
for effective governance and monitoring of 
compliance to statutory laws and provisions 
applicable at Corporate, regional office, plants 
and warehouses.
Process initiatives
•	 The Company has recently carried out GRC 
Assessment review from independent external 
consultant to identify and remediate the 
conflicting roles and access rights within 
the system, thereby ensuring the adequate 
segregation of duty controls and smooth conduct 
of the operations.
•	 The Company has defined the risk management 
framework for Commodity hedging to manage 
the risk of fluctuating metal prices.
•	 Internal Financial Controls Framework (including 
Risk Control Matrices ("RCM") of all financial 
processes and IT general controls) are redesigned 
to align to existing process and system controls. 
These Internal financial controls are annually 
tested by the independent internal auditors to 
assess effectiveness of internal controls over 
financial reporting.
•	 Contractual Term of Business has been now 
vetted by legal team and standardized across 
the business verticals and locations, thereby 
reducing risk of contractual non-compliances.
People initiatives
Periodic workshops are carried out with process 
owners to create awareness about importance of 
risk management and internal control system. The 
training are mandatory and training modules are 
also available in form of e-learns which are readily 
accessible to employees.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
We are operating in a highly interconnected and 
dynamic world and the business landscape is shaped 
by a variety of shifting forces. The volatile environment 
that we operate in, demands that we need to be more 
prepared to face risks and uncertainties in the ever-
evolving business landscape. We are committed 
towards protecting and maximizing value towards our 
stakeholders and it is our constant endeavor to take 
effective and risk-informed business decisions. 
Risk Management is one of the key pillars of good 
corporate governance and contributes towards long

Maintaining effective risk management practices 
is one of our strategic priorities and is closely 
monitored by the Risk Management Committee of 
the Board of Directors and Senior Management. 
CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited ("CG") 
recognizes the importance of having a robust and 
comprehensive risk management system and is in a 
process of revamping the existing risk management 
policy, procedures and framework which will lay the 
foundation for Risk Management activities.

Our revised policy is designed to establish more 
robust and structured approach to Enterprise Risk 
Management. This will establish a systematic 
approach for risk management across various levels 
of the organization, including Unit-Level, Business-
Division Level, Leadership Level. At each level, risk 
management roles and responsibilities have been 
defined. This will involve the use of Risk Management 
framework, to identify potential risks under various 
categories including both internal and external.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Ever since coming under the majority ownership of 
Tube Investments (Murugappa Group) in November 
2020, CG has completed the second full year of 
operations in FY23. While FY22 marked the period of 
stabilisation across multiple facets, FY23 witnessed 
Company’s switch towards actualisation of its true 
potential. The Company’s business performance 
bears testament to its reclaiming of lost/missed 
territory in terms of market presence, share and 
relevance. And also its competence and drive to 
pursue profitable sustainable growth.
FY23 witnessed a slew of measures aimed at 
structural strengthening. From operational efficiency 
With this approach, we believe that we will be able 
to minimize potential losses while achieving our 
objectives. Our Risk Management Framework in 
conjunction with the Risk Management Policy will 
provide the Management and other stakeholders with 
an assurance that critical risks are identified at the 
right time and efficiently managed.
Company’s business, financial condition and results 
of operations are subject to certain risks and liabilities 
that may affect the Company’s performance and 
ability to achieve its objectives. The factors that the 
Company believes could cause its actual results to 
differ materially from expected and historical results 
have been discussed hereunder. However, there 
are other risks and uncertainties that may affect 
the Company’s performance and ability to achieve 
its objectives that are not currently known to the 
Company, or which are deemed immaterial. The 
principal risks and uncertainties that might affect the 
Company’s business are identified below. The listing 
agreement with the stock exchanges mandates the 
identification, minimization and periodical review 
of these risks and uncertainties. However, it is not 
possible for the Company to implement controls to 
adequately respond to all the risks that it may face 
and there can be no complete assurance provided 
that the steps that the Company undertakes to 
address certain risks, including those listed below 
under “Risk Response Strategies,” will manage 
these risks effectively or at all. The risk factors and 
uncertainties mentioned herein have not been listed 
in order of their importance.

term growth, CG undertook a holistic 360-degree 
overhaul of its growth pivots.

utilisation and share in targeted market segments, 
the Company initiated the Capex phase consisting 
of two rounds of investments, the first aimed at de-
bottlenecking and the second aimed at new additions.

dividends of being at the right place at the right time 
and most importantly in the right shape.
Three clear enablers of a positive growth for 
CG include steady volume growth that would be 
supported by an intense export focus, sustained 
margin protection that would emanate from 
efficiency measures, continued expansion of the 
playing turf that shall result from new initiatives 
being seeded towards sunrise areas such as EVs,

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations 
given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 
31, 2023, its profit including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of 
our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code 
of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with

the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements

our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were 
of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Note 27 of the standalone financial statements)
The Company has two operating segments, namely, Power and Industrial Segment.
The type of customers varies across these segments, ranging from Large Government 
companies / corporations to Original Equipment Manufacturers and Industrial Customers 
etc.
Majority of the Company’s revenue is from sale of goods which are recognized at a 
point in time based on the terms of the contract with customers which may vary case to 
case. Terms of sales arrangements with various customers within each of the operating 
segments, including Incoterms determine the timing of transfer of control and require 
judgment in determining timing of revenue recognition.
Due to the judgement relating to determination of point of time in satisfaction of 
performance obligations with respect to sale of products, this matter is considered as 
Key Audit Matter.
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We read the Company’s accounting policy for timing of revenue recognition 
and assessed compliance in terms of Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers.
•	 We performed walkthroughs of the Company’s revenue processes, including design 
and implementation of controls and tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
such controls in relation to revenue recognition.
•	 On a sample basis, we tested contracts with customers, purchase orders issued by 
customers, and sales invoices raised by the Company to determine the timing of 
transfer of control along with pricing terms and the timing of the revenue recognition 
in respect of such contracts.
•	 We compared revenue with historical trends and where appropriate, conducted 
further enquiries and testing.
•	 On a sample basis, we analyzed revenue transactions near the reporting date and 
tested whether the timing of revenue was recognized in the appropriate period with 
reference to shipping records, sales invoices etc. for those transactions.
•	 We assessed the disclosures for compliance with applicable accounting standards.

The tax losses were primarily on account of write off of receivable balances in relation 
to various transactions in earlier years which are under investigations by regulatory 
authorities. Basis legal opinion, management has considered these written-offs as an 
allowable expense under the Income tax and recognized deferred tax assets on such 
losses.
The recognition of deferred tax asset is identiﬁed as key audit matter considering the 
signiﬁcance of amounts and judgements involved. 
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We obtained an understanding, assessed and tested the operating effectiveness of 
internal control relating to the measurement and recognition of deferred tax.
•	 We involved our tax specialist to assess tax computation as per the local ﬁscal 
regulations in India.
•	 We tested on a sample basis the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of differences 
between the recognition of assets and liabilities according to tax law and ﬁnancial 
reporting in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards.
•	 We have evaluated the Company’s assumptions and estimates in relation to the 
likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income based on most recent 
budgets and plans, prepared by management principally by performing sensitivity 
analyses and evaluated and tested the key assumptions used to determine the 
amounts recognized.
•	 We assessed the reasonableness of management’s business plans considering the 
relevant economic and industry indicators.
•	 We obtained and read the legal opinion considered by the management for recognition 
of deferred tax assets on losses.
•	 We assessed the disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance 
with the requirements of Ind AS 12 “Income Taxes”.
Claims and exposures relating to taxation and litigation (as described in Note 36 of the standalone financial statements)
The Company has disclosed contingent liabilities in respect of disputed claims / levies 
under tax and legal matters.
Taxation and litigation exposures have been identiﬁed as a key audit matter due to 
signiﬁcant outstanding matters with authorities and management assessment towards 
potential ﬁnancial impact of these matters will involve signiﬁcant judgement and 
assumptions.
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We understood the process and assessed the internal control environment relating to 
the identiﬁcation, recognition and measurement of provisions for disputes, potential 
claims and litigation, and contingent liabilities.
•	 We obtained details of legal and tax disputed matters from management and assessed 
management’s position through discussions on both the probability of success in 
signiﬁcant cases, and the magnitude of any potential loss.
•	 We involved tax specialists to assist us in evaluating tax positions taken by management.
•	 We circulated legal conﬁrmation for material litigations to external legal counsel and 
reviewed their assessment and had a discussion on their assessment with the senior 
management of the Company.
•	 We assessed the relevant disclosures made in the Standalone Financial Statements for 
compliance with the requirements of Ind AS 37.
 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED (Contd.)
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s 
Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does 
not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in 
equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting

 Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. 
Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED (Contd.)
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED  
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements of CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited (“the Company”) as of 
March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards 
on Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 
adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Standalone 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively 
as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

(xiii)	 Transactions with the related parties are in compliance with sections 177 
and 188 of Companies Act, 2013 where applicable and the details have 
been disclosed in the notes to the standalone financial statements, as 
required by the applicable accounting standards.
(xiv)	 (a)	
The Company has an internal audit system commensurate with the 
size and nature of its business.
(b) 	
The internal audit reports of the Company issued till the date of the 
audit report, for the period under audit have been considered by us.
(xv)	
The Company has not entered into any non-cash transactions with its 
directors or persons connected with its directors and hence requirement to 
report on clause 3(xv) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.
(xvi)	 (a)	
The provisions of section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 
1934 (2 of 1934) are not applicable to the Company. Accordingly, the 
requirement to report on clause (xvi)(a) of the Order is not applicable 
to the Company.
(b) 	
The Company is not engaged in any Non-Banking Financial or 
Housing Finance activities. Accordingly, the requirement to report on 
clause (xvi)(b) of the Order is not applicable to the Company.
(c)	
The Company is not a Core Investment Company as defined in 
the regulations made by Reserve Bank of India. Accordingly, the 
requirement to report on clause 3(xvi)(c) of the Order is not applicable 
to the Company.
(d)	
The Group has two Core Investment Companies as part of the Group. 
For the purpose of reporting under this clause we have reported those 
Core Investment Companies of the Group which have been registered 
with the Reserve of Bank of India.
(xvii)	 The Company has not incurred cash losses in the current financial year and 
in the immediately preceding financial year.
(xviii)	 There has been no resignation of the statutory auditors during the year 
and accordingly requirement to report on Clause 3(xviii) of the Order is not 
applicable to the Company.
(xix)	 On the basis of the financial ratios disclosed in note 53 to the standalone 
financial statements, ageing and expected dates of realization of financial 
assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying 
the standalone financial statements, our knowledge of the Board of Directors 
and management plans and based on our examination of the evidence 
supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which 
causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of 
the audit report that Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing 
at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of 
one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an 
assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that 
our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we 
neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due 
within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged 
by the Company as and when they fall due.
(xx)	
(a)	
In respect of other than ongoing projects, there are no unspent 
amounts that are required to be transferred to a fund specified in 
Schedule VII of the Companies Act (the Act), in compliance with 
second proviso to sub section 5 of section 135 of the Act. This matter 
has been disclosed in note 39 to the standalone financial statements.
(b) 	
There are no ongoing projects and hence the requirement to report 
on clause 3(xx)(b) of the Order is not applicable to the Company and 
hence not commented upon.

of accumulated impairment loss, if any.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Depreciation is provided on straight-line method over the useful lives of assets. Depreciation commences when an asset is ready for its intended use. The 
management’s estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, other than the following asset classes, where the useful lives 
was determined by technical evaluation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on additions to / deductions from assets is provided on pro-rata basis with 
reference to the date of addition / deletion.
	
The range of useful lives of the property, plant and equipment are as follows:
	
•	
Plant and machinery – 1 to 21 years 
	
•	
Furniture and fittings – 1 to 15 years 
	
•	
Office equipments – 1 to 15 years    
	
•	
Buildings – 3 to 60 years
	
•	
Vehicles – 1 to 8 years
	
Buildings constructed on leasehold land are depreciated based on the useful life specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, where the lease period of land 
is beyond the useful life of the building.
	
In other cases, buildings constructed on leasehold land are amortised over the primary lease period of the land.
	
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each financial year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value as per the previous GAAP for Plant and machinery, Furniture and fittings, Office 
equipments and Vehicles as its deemed cost. Also, the Company has elected to measure Freehold land, Leasehold Land and Building at its fair value and considered 
it as deemed cost as on the date of transition to Ind AS.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
2.3	
Intangible assets: 
	
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the Company and the cost of the 
asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the useful economic life 
and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, if any are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
	
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in statement of profit and loss.
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Intangible assets are amortised as follows:
•	
Specialised software  	
: Over a period of five years;
•	
Technical know-how	
: Over a period of five years (from the date of availability for its use); and
•	
Commercial rights 	
: Over a period of ten years;
	
Research and development expenditure:
	
Revenue expenditure on research activities is expensed under the respective heads of account in the period in which it is incurred.
	
Development expenditures on an individual project are recognized as intangible asset, if all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
	
(i)	
 the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
	
(ii)	
 the Company has intention to complete the development of intangible asset and use or sell it;
	
(iii)	
 the Company has ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
	
(iv)	
 the manner in which the probable future economic benefit will be generated;
	
(v)	
 the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to  use or sell the intangible asset; and
	
(vi)	
 the Company has ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
	
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over a period of five years. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value as per the previous GAAP for all intangible assets as its deemed cost.
2.4	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
At least at the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired and also whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is 
required, if any, the Company determines the recoverable amount and impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, when the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
	
Recoverable amount is determined:
	
•	
In the case of an individual asset, at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use; and
	
•	
In the case of cash generating unit (a group of assets that generates identified, independent cash flows), at the higher of the cash generating unit’s (CGUs) fair 
value less cost to sell and the value in use.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
2.5	
Inventories:
	
Inventories are valued as under:
	
•	
Raw materials, packing materials, construction materials, stores and spares, loose tools and traded goods at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
determined on weighted average basis.
•	
Work-in-progress and finished goods (manufacturing) at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads 
based on normal operating capacity. Finished goods cost is determined on weighted average basis.
	
The cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchases, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Obsolete and slow moving items of inventories are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Goods and Materials in transit are valued at actual cost 
incurred up to the reporting date. Materials and supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down if the finished products in which they will 
be used are expected to be sold at or above cost.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.
2.6	
Cash and cash equivalents:
	
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above.
2.7	
Foreign currency transactions:
	
Initial recognition
	
Transactions in foreign currencies entered are accounted at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
	
Measurement as at Balance Sheet Date
	
Foreign currency monetary items that are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date are restated at year end exchange rates.
	
Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of initial transactions.
	
Treatment of exchange differences
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement/ restatement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as income or expense in the statement 
of profit and loss. 
2.8	
Revenue recognition:
	
(a)	
Revenue from sale of goods and services
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally coincides with the 
delivery of goods to customers. Revenue from services is recognised when services are rendered.
	
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
In contracts where freight is arranged by the Company and recovered from the customers, the same is treated as a separate performance obligation and 
revenue is recognised when such freight services are rendered. Revenue is adjusted for variable consideration such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, 
price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other similar items in a contract when they are highly probable to be provided. The variable 
consideration is estimated at contract inception updated thereafter at each reporting date or until crystallisation of the amount. Liquidated damages are 
recognised as a part of variable consideration.
	
In revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – 
i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it. The consideration is allocated 
between separate products and services in the arrangement based on their standalone selling prices.
	
However, Goods and Services tax (GST) are not received by the Company on its own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added to the commodity by 
the seller on behalf of the government. Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.

(b)	
Revenue from construction contracts
	
Performance obligations with reference to construction contracts are satisfied over the period of time, and accordingly, Revenue from such contracts is 
recognised based on progress of performance determined using input method with reference to the cost incurred on contract and their estimated total costs. 
Revenue is adjusted towards liquidated damages, and price variations / escalation, wherever, applicable. Variation in contract work and other claims are 
included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and generally when it is agreed with customer. Estimates of revenue and costs are reviewed 
periodically and revised, wherever circumstances change, resulting increases or decreases in revenue determination, is recognised in the period in which 
estimates are revised.
	
(c)	
Dividend and interest income
	
Dividend income is accounted for when the shareholder’s right to receive the same is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is recognised taking into account the amount outstanding and effective interest rate.
2.9	
Employee benefits: 
	
Short-term employee benefits
	
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related services, are 
classified as short term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, short-term compensated absences, performance incentives etc. and the expected cost 
of bonus, ex-gratia are recognised during the period in which the employee renders related service.
	
Liabilities recognised in respect of short term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amounts of the benefits expected in exchange for the related 
services.
	
Post-employment benefits
	
Defined contribution scheme:
	
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered the service entitling them to the contributions.
	
Defined benefit plans:
	
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method with the actuarial valuations being carried out at 
the end of each annual reporting period.
	
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised 
immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to the profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period of plan amendment or when the Company recognised 
related re-structuring costs.
	
The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit expenses in profit or loss:
	
•	
service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
	
•	
net interest expense or income.	
	
Gratuity:
	
The cost of providing benefit under gratuity plan is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting date. The 
scheme is funded with the CG Gratuity Fund. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the 
reporting period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit and loss subsequently.
	
Leave encashment:
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. The Company measures the expected 
cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date.
	
The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such 
long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting date. Remeasurements, 
comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of profit and loss.
	
Provident Fund:
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident 
fund. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution 
payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as 
a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet 
date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
	
Termination benefits:
	
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefits or when the Company recognises 
any related restructuring costs whichever is earlier.
2.10	 Share Based Payments (Employee Stock Option Scheme):
	
Stock options are granted to the employees under the stock option scheme. The costs of stock options granted to the employees (equity-settled awards) of the 
Company are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted. For each stock option, the measurement of fair value is performed on the grant date. The 
grant date is the date on which the Company and the employees agree to the stock option scheme. The fair value so determined is revised only if the stock option 
scheme is modified in a manner that is beneficial to the employees.
	
This cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in stock options outstanding account in equity, over the period in which the performance and / or 
service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period 
and is recognised in employee benefits expense.
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
	
If the options vests in instalments (i.e. the options vest pro rata over the service period), then each instalment is treated as a separate share option grant because 
each instalment has a different vesting period.
2.11	 Borrowing costs:
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time (generally over twelve 
months) to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 
occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
2.12	 Segment accounting:
	
Operating segments are those components of the business whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in the Company 
to make decisions for performance assessment and resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated based on the profit or loss of reportable segment and is 
measured consistently.
	
The Operating segments have been identified on the basis of the nature of products / services.
(i)	
Segment revenue includes sales and other income directly identifiable with / allocable to the segment including inter- segment revenue.
(ii)	
Expenses that are directly identifiable with / allocable to segments are considered for determining the segment result. Expenses which relate to the Company 
as a whole and not allocable to segments are included under unallocable expenditure.
(iii)	
Income which relates to the Company as a whole and not allocable to segments is included in unallocable income.
(iv)	
Segment result includes margins on inter-segment sales which are reduced in arriving at the profit before tax of the Company.
(v)	
Segment assets and liabilities include those directly identifiable with the respective segments. Unallocable assets and liabilities represent the assets and 
liabilities that relate to the Company as a whole and not allocable to any segment.

2.13	 Leases:
	
The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Company as a lessee
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognises right-of-use (‘ROU’) asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which 
it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases and leases of low-value assets). For these short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets, the Company recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
A ROU asset is recognised representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The cost of the ROU asset measured at inception comprises of 
the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received, plus any initial direct costs incurred. The ROU asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
	
The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date using the straight-line method over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. Right-
of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss.
	
The Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily 
determinable. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments or a change 
in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
The range of useful lives of the ROU assets are as follows:
	
•	
Leasehold land – 30 to 99 years
	
•	
Buildings – 2 to 9 years
	
•	
Furniture and fittings – 5 years
	
Company as a lessor
	
Leases for which the Company is a lessor are classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
	
Rental income from operating lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents 
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
	
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to 
accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
2.14	 Earnings per share:
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation of shares), if any occurred during the reporting period, that have changed the number of 
equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
The number of shares and potential dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of the standalone financial statements by the Board of Directors.
2.15	 Income taxes:
	
Income tax expense for the period comprises of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when they are 
relating to items that are recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case, it is also recognised in relating to items recognised directly in OCI or equity respectively.
	
Current tax
	
Current tax comprises the expected income tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous 
years. It is determined by using tax rates in accordance with the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Deferred tax
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
standalone financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilized.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on 
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
2.16	 Provisions, Contingent liabilities, Contingent assets and Commitments:
	
General
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
	
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into 
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
	
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it 
is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
	
Warranty provisions
	
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of relevant product or service, at the best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Company’s obligation.
	
Onerous contracts
	
If the Company has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous contract is considered 
to exist where the Company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected 
to be received from the contract.
2.17	 Exceptional items:
	
An item of income or expense which by its size, type or incidence is such that its disclosure improves the understanding of the performance of the Company, such 
income or expense is classified as an exceptional item and accordingly, disclosed as such in the standalone financial statements.

2.18	 Current and non-current classification:
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current / non-current classification.
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle,
	
•	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading,
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period,or
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
A liability is treated as current when:
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle,
	
•	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading,
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period,or
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets / liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Operating cycle:
	
A portion of the Company activities (primarily long-term project activities) has an operating cycle that exceeds twelve months. Accordingly, assets and liabilities related 
to these long-term contracts, which will not be realised / paid within twelve months, have been classified as non-current. For all other activities, operating cycle is 
twelve months.
2.19	 Fair value measurement:
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its 
non-performance risk. A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial 
assets and liabilities.
	
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
	
•	
Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	
•	
Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable
	
•	
Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
2.20	 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations:
	
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification.
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the statement of profit and loss. Also comparative statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start 
of the comparative period.
	
Assets and liabilities classified as held for disposal are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.
2.21	 Financial instruments:
	
The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
(i)	
Financial assets:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component which are 
initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety either at amortised cost or at fair value depending on the classification of the 
financial assets.
	
Where financial assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised entirely in the statement of profit and loss (i.e. fair value through 
profit or loss or ‘FVTPL’), or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair value through other comprehensive income or ‘FVTOCI’).
	
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost (net of any write down for impairment) if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the 
asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represents solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
All other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
	
All equity investments are measured at fair value, with fair value changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except for those equity investments 
for which the entity has elected to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income. However, dividend on such equity investments are recognised 
in statement of profit and loss when the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
	
	
Investment in associates, joint venture and subsidiaries
	
The Company accounts for its investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, at cost less impairment loss except where investments is accounted 
for in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, when they are classified as held for sale.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit 
and loss. Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
	
	
•	
The 12 months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 
12 months after the reporting date); or
	
	
•	
Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).
	
For trade receivables the Company applies a simplified approach under which loss allowance is recognised based on expected lifetime ECL losses to be 
recognised on each reporting date. The Company uses a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience adjusted for relevant forward-
looking factors. For other assets, the Company uses 12 months ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there 
is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition full lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
Derecognition
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and 
the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109.
	
(ii)	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of financial liabilities, which are 
not at fair value through profit or loss, are deducted from the fair value on initial recognition.
	
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.

Corporate Overview

Financial Statements
	
	
Subsequent measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is 
classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net 
gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also 
recognised in profit or loss.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts
	
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the Company to make specified payment to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company 
are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of, the amount of loss allowance 
determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount of income recognised.
	
	
Derecognition
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
(iii)	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting:
	
The Company uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency / price risk on unexecuted firm commitments and highly probable 
forecast transactions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are 
carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to statement of profit and loss, except for the effective portion of cash 
flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of equity which is later reclassified to statement of 
profit and loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss.
	
(iv)	
Offsetting of financial instruments:
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
3(A).	 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
	
The preparation of the Company’s standalone financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities within the next financial year.
	
Judgements
	
Lease of assets not in legal form of lease
	
Significant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules under Ind AS 116. In assessing the applicability to arrangements entered into by the Company, 
management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying assets, substance of the transaction including legally enforced arrangements and 
other significant terms and conditions of the arrangement to conclude whether the arrangements meet the criteria under Ind AS 116.
	
Estimates and assumptions
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.
	
(i)	
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
	
Management reviews useful lives of property, plant and equipment at least once a year. Such lives are dependent upon an assessment of both the technical 
lives of the assets and also their likely economic lives based on various internal and external factors. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation 
expected in future period.
	
(ii)	
Development costs
	
Development costs are recognised as an asset when all the criteria are met, whereas research costs are expensed as incurred. Management assesses and 
monitors whether the recognition requirements for development costs continue to be met. There is inherent uncertainty in the economic success of any product 
development. The Company uses judgement in assessment of development cost eligible for capitalisation.
	
(iii)	
Impairment of non-financial assets
	
In case of non-financial assets Company estimates asset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or cash generating units (CGU’s) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
	
(iv)	
Impairment of financial assets
	
The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company uses judgement in 
making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing market conditions as well as 
forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
	
(v)	
Income taxes
	
Deferred tax assets for unused tax losses are recognised only when it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the 
level of future taxable profits.
	
(vi)	
Defined benefit obligation
	
In accounting for post-retirement benefits, actuarial method uses several statistical and other factors to anticipate future events that are used to calculate 
defined benefit obligation. These factors include expected return on plan assets, discount rate assumptions and rate of future compensation increases. To 
estimate these factors, actuarial consultants also use estimates such as withdrawal, turnover, and mortality rates which require significant judgment. The 
actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results in future periods due to changing market and economic conditions, 
regulatory events, judicial rulings, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter participant life spans.
	
(vii)	 Revenue from contract with customers
	
The Company estimates variable considerations in the nature of volume rebates, discounts, performance bonuses, penalties and similar items and adjusts the 
transaction price for the sale of goods and services. These expected variable considerations are analysed either at customer or contracts basis against agreed 
terms with customers and may differ from actual results.
	
(viii)	 Contingencies
	
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Company. Potential liabilities that are possible 
but not probable of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably are treated as contingent liabilities. Such liabilities are disclosed in notes but are not 
recognised, the cases which have been determined as remote by the Company are not disclosed.
3(B). NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS
	
The Company applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April, 2022.
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules 2022 dated 23 March, 2022, to amend the following Ind 
AS which are effective from 1 April, 2022.
	
(i)	
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to Ind AS 37
	
An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract costs (i.e., the costs that the Company 
cannot avoid because it has the contract) exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
	
The amendments specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, the Company needs to include costs that relate directly to a 
contract to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related 
to contract activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract management and supervision). General and administrative 
costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April, 2022. These amendments had no impact on the standalone financial 
statements of the Company.
	
(ii)	
Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendments to Ind AS 16
	
The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not 
be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant and equipment.
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April, 2022. These amendments had no impact on the standalone financial 
statements of the Company as there were no sales of such items produced by property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the beginning 
of the earliest period presented.

Notes:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(i) 	
From time to time, the Company is involved in claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Management is not currently aware of any 
matters that will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
(ii) 	
It is not practicable to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of matters at A(a) to A(d) above, pending resolution of the arbitration / appellate 
proceedings.		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(iii)	
Sales tax / VAT / goods and service tax cases include disputes pertaining to disallowances of input tax credit and non-submission of various forms with 
authorities.
(iv) 	
Excise duty / custom duty / service tax cases include disputes pertaining to inadmissibility of cenvat credit, short payment of service tax on work contracts, 
refund of excise duty on export of transformers, interest payment on provisional assessment cases, etc.
(v) 	
Contingent liabilities for Income tax cases pertains to difference on account of cenvat credit and valuation of closing inventory, disallowance of expenses, etc.
(vi)	
The Company had received notice of demand under Income Tax Act for ` 606.30 crores for financial year 2016-17, and the Hon’ble Bombay High Court has 
granted the interim stay against the notice of demand until admission of appeal before the High Court. The Company has filed its detailed submissions in 
response to notices received for the appeal filed before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). Considering the facts and underlying documents with respect 
to the demand raised under Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the management strongly believes that the demand is not sustainable, bad in law and 
will be reversed at appellate levels.

Segment assets and liabilities:
	
Segment assets include all operating assets used by the operating segment and mainly consist of property, plant and equipment, trade receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents and inventories. Segment liabilities primarily include trade payables and other liabilities. Common assets and liabilities which cannot be allocated to any

 46.	 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1. 	
The Company has not disclosed the fair value of financial instruments such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash 
and cash equivalents, current financial assets - loans, current financial assets - others, current financial liabilities - borrowings, trade payables and other 
financial liabilities because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value and hence these have not been categorised in any level in the 
table given below. Further, for financial assets, the Company has taken into consideration the allowances for expected credit losses and adjusted the carrying 
values where applicable.
2. 	
The fair values of the quoted investments / units of mutual fund schemes are based on market price / net asset value at the reporting date.
3. 	
The fair values for loans given are calculated based on discounted cash flows using current lending rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. 
Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for expected losses of these loans given. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments are not 
materially different from their carrying values. They are classified as level 2 fair values in the fair value hierarchy.
4.	
Fair values of the Company’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using discounted cash flow method using the current borrowing rates. Fair value 
of such instruments are not materially different from their carrying values, accordingly non-current borrowings are classified as level 2 fair values in the fair 
value hierarchy.
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3: Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly unobservable.

47. 	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Company’s activities expose it to certain financial risks namely credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The financial risks are managed in accordance with the 
Company’s risk management policy which has been approved by its Board of Directors.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises of 
three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include foreign currency receivables, payables, 
loans and borrowings, derivative financial instruments and FVTOCI investments.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s 
exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Company has managed 
its interest rate risk by balancing the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments in its total portfolio.

Foreign currency risk
The Company’s functional currency is Indian Rupee. The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently the Company is 
exposed to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective 
currencies. The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and the Company follows established risk management 
policies.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company 
is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including loans, foreign exchange transactions and 
other financial instruments. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the Company 
periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and 
ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are generally set to manage credit risk. General payment terms include credit period ranging from 45 to 90 days 
and where applicable, mobilisation advance, progress payments and certain retention money to be released at the end of the project.
	
Where the loans or receivables are impaired, the Company continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due.
	
The Company is exposed to credit risk for trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments, other bank balances, loans given, other financial assets and 
financial guarantees.
	
In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Company to banks and financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Company is exposed to is the 
maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon or in case where settlement is agreed, the settlement amount. Based on the 
expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees 
provided except as otherwise stated in respect of guarantees where settlement is agreed.

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of CG Power 
and Industrial Solutions Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”), 
its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”) comprising of the consolidated Balance sheet as at March 31, 2023, 
the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive 
income, the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial 
statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations 
given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate 
financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2023, 
their consolidated profit including other comprehensive income, their consolidated 
cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended 
on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section 
 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED
of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ‘Code of 
Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of 
most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in 
the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit 
included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The 
results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components 
not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the 
management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Note 28 of the consolidated financial statements)
The Group has two operating segments, namely, Power and Industrial Segment. The type 
of customers varies across these segments, ranging from Large Government companies/ 
corporations to Original Equipment Manufacturers and Industrial Customers etc.
Majority of the Group’s revenue is from sale of goods which are recognized at a point 
in time based on the terms of the contract with customers which may vary case to 
case. Terms of sales arrangements with various customers within each of the operating 
segments, including Incoterms determine the timing of transfer of control and require 
judgment in determining timing of revenue recognition.
Due to the judgement relating to determination of point of time in satisfaction of 
performance obligations with respect to sale of products, this matter is considered as 
Key Audit Matter. 
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We read the Group’s accounting policy for timing of revenue recognition and assessed 
compliance in terms of Ind AS 115- Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
•	 We performed walkthroughs of the Holding Company’s revenue processes, including 
design and implementation of controls and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of such controls in relation to revenue recognition.
•	 On a sample basis, we tested contracts with customers, purchase orders issued 
by customers, and sales invoices raised by the Holding Company to determine the 
timing of transfer of control along with pricing terms and the timing of the revenue 
recognition in respect of such contracts.
•	 We compared revenue with historical trends and where appropriate, conducted 
further enquiries and testing.
•	 On a sample basis, we analyzed revenue transactions near the reporting date and 
tested whether the timing of revenue was recognized in the appropriate period with 
reference to shipping records, sales invoices etc. for those transactions.
•	 We assessed the disclosures for compliance with applicable accounting standards.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset (as described in Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements)
The Group has Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) of ` 445.32 crores as at March 31, 2023 on 
tax losses based on availability of future taxable proﬁts against which DTA will be utilized. 
The tax losses were primarily on account of write off of receivable balances in relation 
to various transactions in earlier years, which are under investigations by regulatory 
authorities. Basis legal opinion, management of Holding Company has considered these 
written-offs as an allowable expense under the Income tax and recognized deferred tax 
assets on such losses.
The recognition of deferred tax asset is identiﬁed as key audit matter considering the 
signiﬁcance of amounts and judgements involved.
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We obtained an understanding, assessed and tested the operating effectiveness of 
internal control relating to the measurement and recognition of deferred tax.
•	 We involved our tax specialists to assess tax computation as per the local ﬁscal 
regulations in India.
•	 We tested on a sample basis the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of differences 
between the recognition of assets and liabilities according to tax law and ﬁnancial 
reporting in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards.
•	 We have evaluated the Holding Company’s assumptions and estimates in relation to 
the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income based on most recent 
budgets and plans, prepared by management principally by performing sensitivity 
analyses and evaluated and tested the key assumptions used to determine the 
amounts recognized. 
•	 We assessed the reasonableness of Holding Company’s management business plans 
considering the relevant economic and industry indicators.
•	 We obtained and read the legal opinion considered by the management of the Holding 
Company for recognition of deferred tax assets on losses.
•	 We assessed the disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance 
with the requirements of Ind AS 12 “Income Taxes”.
Claims and exposures relating to taxation and litigation (as described in Note 37 of the consolidated financial statements)
The Group has disclosed contingent liabilities in respect of disputed claims/ levies under 
tax and legal matters.
Taxation and litigation exposures have been identiﬁed as a key audit matter due to 
signiﬁcant outstanding matters with authorities and Holding Company’s management 
assessment towards potential ﬁnancial impact of these matters will involve signiﬁcant 
judgement and assumptions.
Our audit procedures amongst others included the following:
•	 We understood the process and assessed the internal control environment relating to 
the identiﬁcation, recognition and measurement of provisions for disputes, potential 
claims and litigation, and contingent liabilities.
•	 We obtained details of legal and tax disputed matters from the Holding Company 
management and assessed Holding Company management’s position through

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report 
Thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but 
does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation 
and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the 
requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity 
of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 
133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,

Corporate Overview
 Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
The respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective 
companies and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of 
Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the 
ability of their respective companies to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 
also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective 
companies.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED (Contd.)
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by 
management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation. 
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the Group of which 
we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have 
audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit 
of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other 
entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been 
audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and 
such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we 
are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Other Matters
(a)	
We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, 
in respect of 6 subsidiaries, which are part of continued operations of the 
Group, whose financial statements include total assets of ` 1083.12 crores

inflows of ` 2.82 crores for the year ended on that date. We did not audit 
the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of 4 
subsidiaries, which are part of discontinued operations of the Group, whose 
financial statements include total assets of ` 109.01 crores as at March 
31, 2023, and total revenues of ` 94.27 crores and net cash inflows of 
` 0.75 crores for the year ended on that date. These financial statement 
and other financial information have been audited by other auditors, which 
financial statements, other financial information and auditor’s reports have 
been furnished to us by the management. Our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms of sub-
sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
subsidiaries, is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.
	
Certain of these subsidiaries are located outside India whose financial 
statements and other financial information have been prepared in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective 
countries and which have been audited by other auditors under generally 
accepted auditing standards applicable in their respective countries. The 
Holding Company’s management has converted the financial statements of 
such subsidiaries located outside India from accounting principles generally 
accepted in their respective countries to accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. We have audited these conversion adjustments made by 
the Holding Company’s management. Our opinion in so far as it relates to 
the balances and affairs of such subsidiaries located outside India is based 
on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by 
the management of the Holding Company and audited by us.
(b)	
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include unaudited 
financial statements and other unaudited financial information in respect 
of 2 subsidiaries, part of continued operations of the Group, whose financial 
statements and other financial information reflect total assets of ` 83.38 
crores as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of ` 71.31 crores and 
net cash outflows of ` 0.18 crores for the year ended on that date. The 
accompanying consolidated financial statements include unaudited 
financial statements and other unaudited financial information in respect 
of 4 subsidiaries, part of discontinued operations of the Group, whose 
financial statements and other financial information reflect total assets of 
` 73.25 crores as at March 31, 2023, and total revenues of ` Nil and 
net cash outflows of ` 1.64 crores for the year ended on that date. These 
unaudited financial statements and other unaudited financial information 
have been furnished to us by the management. Our opinion, in so far as it 
relates amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, 
and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act in 
so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on such 
unaudited financial statements and other unaudited financial information. In 
our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by 
the Management, these financial statements and other financial information 
are not material to the Group.

ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of CG Power 
and Industrial Solutions Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) 
as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”), which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, which are 
companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on 
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and 
the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 
adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence 
obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CG POWER AND INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED (Contd.) 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion 
In our opinion, the Group, which are companies incorporated in India, have, 
maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. 
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating 
effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to these 3 
subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries incorporated in India.

 NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.	
CORPORATE INFORMATION:
	
CG Power and Industrial Solutions Limited (the ‘Company’ or ‘Parent’) with CIN No: L99999MH1937PLC002641 is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in 
India whose shares are publicly traded. The registered office is located at 6th Floor, CG house, Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai – 400 030, India.
	
The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the ‘Group’) is a global enterprise providing end-to-end solutions to utilities, industries and consumers for the 
management and application of efficient and sustainable electrical energy. It offers products, services and solutions in two main business segments, viz. Power 
Systems and Industrial Systems for the year ended 31 March, 2023.
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March, 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 
08 May, 2023.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
2.1	
Basis of preparation:
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and presentation requirements of Division 
II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:
	
•	
Derivative financial instruments,
	
•	
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.
	
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (‘`’) and all values are rounded to the nearest crores, except when otherwise indicated.
2.2	
Basis of consolidation:
	
The Group consolidates all entities which are controlled by it. The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those 
which significantly affect the entity’s returns. The entities are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.
	
The consolidated financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealised 
gain/loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in 
use at the Group. Profit or loss on each component of other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the 
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
	
The Financial Statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the Parent Company, i.e., year ended on 
31st March. When the end of the reporting period of the Parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional 
financial information as of the same date as the Financial Statements of the Parent to enable the Parent to consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, 
unless it is impracticable to do so.
	
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity 
while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.
	
Changes in the Group’s holding that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s holding and the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative holding. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are 
adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of the parent.
	
Joint Ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control. Investments 
in Joint Ventures and Associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is 
increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition date. The Group’s investment in Joint Ventures and 
Associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
2.3	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises the purchase price, 
net of trade discounts and rebates, directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. When 
significant parts of the plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow to the Group. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred.
	
Capital work-in-progress includes cost of property, plant and equipment under installation / under development as at the balance sheet date and stated at cost, net 
of accumulated impairment loss, if any.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
	
Depreciation is provided on straight-line method over the useful lives of assets. Depreciation commences when an asset is ready for its intended use. The 
management’s estimate of useful lives are in accordance with Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, other than the following asset classes, where the useful lives 
was determined by technical evaluation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on additions to / deductions from assets is provided on pro-rata basis with 
reference to the date of addition / deletion. 
	
The range of useful lives of the property, plant and equipment are as follows:
	
•	
Plant and machinery –  1 to 21 years 
	
•	
Furniture and fittings- 1 to 15 years 
	
•	
Office equipments - 1 to 15 years    
	
•	
Buildings  – 3 to 60 years
	
•	
Vehicles – 1 to 8 years
	
Buildings constructed on leasehold land are depreciated based on the useful life specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, where the lease period of land 
is beyond the useful life of the building.
	
In other cases, buildings constructed on leasehold lands are amortised over the primary lease period of the lands.
	
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each financial year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
Foreign companies:
	
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment has been provided at the rates required / permissible by the GAAPs of the respective countries. The management 
believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used.
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to continue with the carrying value as per the previous GAAP for Plant and machinery, Furniture and fittings, Office 
equipments and Vehicles as its deemed cost. Also, the Group has elected to measure Freehold land, Leasehold Land and Building at its fair value and considered it 
as deemed cost as on the date of transition to Ind AS.
2.4	
Intangible assets: 
	
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the useful economic life 
and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, if any are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
	
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in statement of profit and loss.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Intangible assets are amortised as follows:
•	
Computer software 	
: Over a period of five to six years;
•	
Technical know-how (including technology)	
: Over a period of five years (from the date of availability for its use);
•	
Commercial rights 	
: Over a period of ten years;
•	
Brand name and customer lists	
: Over a period of ten years; and
	
(including trade mark)
•	
Other intangible assets	
: Over a period of three to fifteen years.
	
Research and development expenditure:
	
Revenue expenditure on research activities is expensed under the respective heads of account in the period in which it is incurred.
	
Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as intangible asset, if all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
	
(i)	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
	
(ii)	
The Group has intention to complete the development of intangible asset and use or sell it;
	
(iii)	
The Group has ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
	
(iv)	
The manner in which the probable future economic benefit will be generated;
	
(v)	
The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and
	
(vi)	
The Group has ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
	
Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over a period of five years. During the period 
of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
	
On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to continue with the carrying value as per the previous GAAP for all intangible assets as its deemed cost. 
2.5	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
At least at the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired and also whether there is an indication 
that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
if any, the Group determines the recoverable amount and impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, when the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
	
Recoverable amount is determined:
	
•	
In the case of an individual asset, at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use; and
•	
In the case of cash generating unit (a group of assets that generates identified, independent cash flows), at the higher of the cash generating unit’s (CGU’s) 
fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
2.6	
Inventories:
	
Inventories are valued as under:
•	
Raw materials, packing materials, construction materials, stores and spares, loose tools and traded goods at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
determined on weighted average basis.
•	
Work-in-progress and finished goods (manufacturing) at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads 
based on normal operating capacity. Finished goods cost is determined on weighted average basis.

2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
The cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchases, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Obsolete and slow moving items of inventories are valued at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Goods and Materials in transit are valued at actual cost 
incurred up to the reporting date. Materials and supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down if the finished products in which they will 
be used are expected to be sold at or above cost.
	
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.
2.7	
Cash and cash equivalents:
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
	
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above.
2.8	
Foreign currency transactions:
	
Initial recognition:
	
Transactions in foreign currencies entered are accounted at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
	
Measurement as at Balance Sheet Date:
	
Foreign currency monetary items that are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date are restated at year end exchange rates.
	
Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of initial transactions.
	
Treatment of exchange differences:
	
Exchange differences arising on settlement/restatement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are recognised as income or expense in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
Consolidation of subsidiaries situated in foreign countries:
	
The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to the presentation currency (`) is performed for assets 
and liabilities using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the average exchange rate for the 
respective periods. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are included in currency translation reserves under OCI.
	
When a subsidiary is disposed of, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. However, when a change in 
the parent’s ownership does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are recorded through equity.
	
Any goodwill arising in the acquisition / business combination of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.
2.9	
Revenue recognition:
	
(a)	
Revenue from sale of goods and services:
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally coincides with the 
delivery of goods to customers. Revenue from services is recognised when services are rendered.
	
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In 
contracts where freight is arranged by the Group and recovered from the customers, the same is treated as separate performance obligations and revenue 
is recognised when such freight services are rendered. Revenue is adjusted for variable consideration such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price 
concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other similar items in a contract when they are highly probable to be provided. The variable 
consideration is estimated at contract inception updated thereafter at each reporting date or until crystallisation of the amount. Liquidated damages are 
recognised as a part of variable consideration.
	
In revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if 
a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it. The consideration is allocated between 
separate products and services in the arrangement based on their standalone selling prices.
	
However, Goods and Services tax (‘GST’) are not received by the Group on its own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added to the commodity by the 
seller on behalf of the government. Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
(b)	
Revenue from construction contracts:
	
Performance obligations with reference to construction contracts are satisfied over the period of time, and accordingly, revenue from such contracts is 
recognised based on progress of performance determined using input method with reference to the cost incurred on contract and their estimated total costs. 
Revenue is adjusted towards liquidated damages, and price variations / escalation, wherever, applicable. Variation in contract work and other claims are 
included to the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and generally when it is agreed with customer. Estimates of revenue and costs are reviewed 
periodically and revised, wherever circumstances change, resulting increases or decreases in revenue determination, is recognised in the period in which 
estimates are revised.
	
(c)	
Dividend and interest income:
	
	
Dividend income is accounted for when the shareholder’s right to receive the same is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend. 
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is recognised taking into account the amount outstanding and the effective interest rate.
2.10	 Employee benefits: 
	
Short-term employee benefits:
	
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related services, are 
classified as short term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages, short-term compensated absences, performance incentives etc., and the expected cost 
of bonus, ex-gratia are recognised during the period in which the employee renders related service.
	
Compensation to employees of certain subsidiaries consist of pension plan, which are either fee or benefit based. 
	
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amounts of the benefits expected in exchange for the related 
services.
	
Post-employment benefits:
	
Defined contribution scheme:
	
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered the service entitling them to the contributions.
	
Defined benefit plans:
	
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method with the actuarial valuations being carried out at 
the end of each annual reporting period.
	
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised 
immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are 
not reclassified to the consolidated statement profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period of plan 
amendment or when the Group recognised related re-structuring costs.
	
The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss:
	
•	
service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
	
•	
net interest expense or income.
	
Gratuity:
	
Gratuity is a defined benefit obligation plan operated by the Company and a subsidiary incorporated in India for its employees covered under Group Gratuity Scheme. 
The cost of providing benefit under gratuity plan is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting date. The 
scheme is funded with CG Gratuity Fund of the Group. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the statement of other 
comprehensive income in the reporting period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to the consolidated profit and loss subsequently. Some of the 
overseas subsidiaries operate Gratuity scheme plan for employees as per laws of the respective countries, liability in respect of the same is provided on the accrual 
basis, estimated at each reporting date.
	
Leave encashment:
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. The Group measures the expected cost 
of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date.

2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
The Company and its Indian subsidiaries treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for 
measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the 
reporting date. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
	
Overseas subsidiaries provide liability in respect of compensated absences for employees as per respective local entity’s policies. The same is measured based on 
the accrual basis as the payment is required to be made within next twelve months.
	
Provident Fund:
	
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident 
fund. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution 
payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as 
a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet 
date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
	
Termination benefits:
	
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefits or when the Group recognise any 
related restructuring costs whichever is earlier.
2.11	 Share Based Payments (Employee Stock Option Scheme):
	
Stock options are granted to the employees under the stock option scheme. The costs of stock options granted to the employees (equity-settled awards) of the Group 
are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted. For each stock option, the measurement of fair value is performed on the grant date. The grant 
date is the date on which the Group and the employees agree to the stock option scheme. The fair value so determined is revised only if the stock option scheme is 
modified in a manner that is beneficial to the employees.
	
This cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in stock options outstanding account in equity, over the period in which the performance and / or 
service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period 
and is recognised in employee benefits expense.
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
	
If the options vests in instalments (i.e. the options vest pro rata over the service period), then each instalment is treated as a separate share option grant because 
each instalment has a different vesting period.
2.12	 Borrowing costs:
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time (generally over twelve 
months) to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 
occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
2.13	 Segment accounting:
	
Operating segments are those components of the business whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in the Group to 
make decisions for performance assessment and resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated based on the profit or loss of reportable segment and is 
measured consistently.
	
The operating segments have been identified on the basis of the nature of products / services.
	
(i)	
Segment revenue includes sales and other income directly identifiable with / allocable to the segment including inter-segment revenue.
(ii)	
Expenses that are directly identifiable with / allocable to segments are considered for determining the segment result. Expenses which relate to the Group as 
a whole and not allocable to segments are included under unallocable expenditure.
(iii)	
Income which relates to the Group as a whole and not allocable to segments is included in unallocable income.
(iv)	
Segment result includes margins on inter-segment sales which are reduced in arriving at the profit before tax of the Group.
(v)	
Segment assets and liabilities include those directly identifiable with the respective segments. Unallocable assets and liabilities represent the assets and 
liabilities that relate to the Group as a whole and not allocable to any segment.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
2.14	 Leases:
	
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Group as a lessee:
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it 
is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases and low value assets). For these short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, 
the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
A ROU asset is recognised representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The cost of the ROU asset measured at inception comprises of 
the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received, plus any initial direct costs incurred. The ROU is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses if any, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
	
The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date using the straight-line method over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. Right-
of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
The Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
	
The range of useful lives of the ROU assets are as follows:
	
•	
Leasehold land – 30 to 99 years
	
•	
Buildings – 2 to 9 years
	
•	
Furniture and fittings – 5 years
	
Group as a lessor:
	
Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
	
Rental income from operating lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents 
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
	
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to 
accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
2.15	 Earnings per share: 
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the reporting period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation of shares), if any occurred during the reporting period, that have changed the number of 
equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year, are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
The number of shares and potential dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.
2.16	 Income Taxes:
	
Income tax expense for the period comprises of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except when 
they are relating to items that are recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case, it is also recognised in relating to items recognised directly in OCI or equity 
respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
Current tax:
	
Current tax comprises the expected income tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous 
years. It is determined by using tax rates in accordance with the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961.
	
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and 
establishes provisions where appropriate.
	
Deferred tax:
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in 
the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilized.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on 
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
2.17	 Provisions, Contingent liabilities, Contingent assets and Commitments:
	
General:
	
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
	
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into 
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When provision is measured using the cash flow estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of these cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
	
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is 
either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet.
	
Warranty provisions:
	
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations are recognised at the time of sale of relevant product or service, at the best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the Group’s obligation.
	
Onerous contracts:
	
If the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognised and measured as a provision. An onerous contract is considered 
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to 
be received from the contract.
2.18	 Government grants:
	
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with.
	
Where the grant relates to an asset the cost of the asset is shown at gross value and grant thereon is treated as capital grant which is recognised as income in the 
statement of profit and loss over the period and in proportion in which depreciation is charged.
	
Revenue grants are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the same period as the related cost which they are intended to compensate are accounted for.
	
Where the Group receives non-monetary grants, the asset and the grant are recorded gross at nominal amounts and released to the statement of profit and loss over 
the expected useful life and pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments.
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
2.19	 Exceptional items:
	
An item of income or expense which by its size, type or incidence is such that its disclosure improves the understanding of the performance of the Group, such income 
or expense is classified as an exceptional item and accordingly, disclosed as such in the consolidated financial statements.
2.20	 Business combinations and goodwill:
	
The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss 
as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. 
	
Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 
exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.
	
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
	
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control are accounted at historical costs. The difference between any 
consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded in shareholders’ equity.
	
Goodwill arising on business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised 
for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired 
is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the 
fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing 
the same through OCI.
	
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of 
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
	
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for 
goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
2.21	 Investment in associates and joint ventures:
	
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions 
of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
	
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint 
control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control.
	
The Group’s investments in its associate and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. 
	
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or a joint venture is included in the carrying 
amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment individually.
	
The consolidated statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate or a joint venture. Any change in OCI of those 
investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or a joint venture, the 
Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between 
the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

Financial Statements
	
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit and loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown in the consolidated statement of profit and loss outside operating 
profit and represents profit and loss after tax of the associate and joint venture.
	
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
	
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or a joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is 
such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then 
recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate or a joint venture’ in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. 
2.22	 Current and non-current classification: 
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current / non-current classification. 
	
An asset is treated as current when it is: 
	
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle,
	
•	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading,
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or 
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
	
A liability is treated as current when: 
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle, 
	
•	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading,
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or  
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
	
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Deferred tax assets / liabilities are classified as non-current.
	
Operating cycle:
	
A portion of the Group’s activities (primarily long-term project activities) has an operating cycle that exceeds twelve months. Accordingly, assets and liabilities related 
to these long-term contracts, which will not be realised / paid within twelve months, have been classified as non-current. For all other activities, operating cycle is 
twelve months.
2.23	 Fair value measurement: 
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-
performance risk. A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets 
and liabilities.
	
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
	
•	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
	
•	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable 
	
•	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable 
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
2.24	 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations:
	
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification. 
	
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued 
operations in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Also comparative consolidated statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
	
Assets and liabilities classified as held for disposal are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. 
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.
2.25	 Financial instruments: 
	
The Group recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
(i)	
Financial assets:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement: 
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component which are 
initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.
	
	
Subsequent measurement:
	
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety either at amortised cost or at fair value depending on the classification of the 
financial assets.
	
Where financial assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised entirely in the statement of profit and loss (i.e. fair value through 
profit or loss or ‘FVTPL’), or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair value through other comprehensive income or ‘FVTOCI’).
	
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost (net of any write down for impairment) if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the 
asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represents solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
All other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
	
All equity investments are measured at fair value, with fair value changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except for those equity investments 
for which the entity has elected to present fair value changes in ‘other comprehensive income’. However, dividend on such equity investments are recognised 
in consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
	
	
Impairment of financial assets:
	
The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (‘ECL’) model, for evaluating impairment of financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and 
loss. Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
	
	
•	
The 12 months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 
12 months after the reporting date); or
	
	
•	
Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).

Corporate Overview
 Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
	
For trade receivables the Group applies a simplified approach under which loss allowance is recognised based on expected lifetime ECL losses to be 
recognised on each reporting date. The Company uses a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience adjusted for relevant forward-
looking factors. For other assets, the Company uses 12 months ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there 
is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition full lifetime ECL is used.
	
	
Derecognition:
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and 
the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109.
	
(ii)	
Financial liabilities:
	
	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of financial liabilities, which are 
not at fair value through profit or loss, are deducted from the fair value on initial recognition.
	
	
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, and derivative financial instruments.
	
	
Subsequent measurement:
	
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is 
classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net 
gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss. Any gain or 
loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts:
	
A Financial guarantee contracts is a contract that requires the Group to make specified payment to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are 
initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at the higher of, the amount of loss allowance determined 
as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount of income recognised.
	
	
Derecognition:
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by 
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
	
(iii)	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting:
	
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency / price risk on unexecuted firm commitments and highly probable forecast 
transactions. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried 
as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to consolidated statement of profit and loss, except for the effective 
portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of equity which is later reclassified 
to the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the hedge item affects profit and loss.
	
	
Cash flow hedges:
	
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss as other expenses.
	
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments, as well as 
forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised 
in finance costs and the ineffective portion relating to commodity contracts is recognised in other operating income or expenses. 
2.	
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd.)
	
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or 
financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts 
recognised as OCI are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
	
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as 
a hedge is revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI remains 
separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign currency firm commitment is met.
	
(iv)	
Offsetting of financial instruments: 
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
3(A).	 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
	
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities within the next financial year.
	
Judgements:
	
Lease of assets not in legal form of lease:
	
Significant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules under Ind AS 116. In assessing the applicability to arrangements entered into by the Group, 
management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying assets, substance of the transaction including legally enforced arrangements and 
other significant terms and conditions of the arrangement to conclude whether the arrangements meet the criteria under Ind AS 116.
	
Estimates and assumptions:
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.
	
(i)	
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment:
	
Management reviews useful lives of property, plant and equipment at least once a year. Such lives are dependent upon an assessment of both the technical 
lives of the assets and also their likely economic lives based on various internal and external factors. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation 
expected in future period.
	
(ii)	
Development costs:
	
Development costs are recognised as an asset when all the criteria are met, whereas research costs are expensed as incurred. Management assesses and 
monitors whether the recognition requirements for development costs continue to be met. There is inherent uncertainty in the economic success of any product 
development. The Group uses judgement in assessment of development cost eligible for capitalisation.
	
(iii)	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
In case of non-financial assets Group estimates asset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or cash generating units (CGU’s) fair value less costs 
of disposal and its value in use.
	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
	
(iv)	
Impairment of financial assets:
	
The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making 
these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Group’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking 
estimates at the end of each reporting period.

(v)	
Income taxes 
	
Deferred tax assets for unused tax losses are recognised only when it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the 
level of future taxable profits. 
	
(vi)	
Defined benefit obligation:
	
In accounting for post-retirement benefits, actuarial method uses several statistical and other factors to anticipate future events that are used to calculate 
defined benefit obligation. These factors include expected return on plan assets, discount rate assumptions and rate of future compensation increases. 
To estimate these factors, actuarial consultants also use estimates such as withdrawal, turnover, and mortality rates which require significant judgment. 
The actuarial assumptions used by the Group may differ materially from actual results in future periods due to changing market and economic conditions, 
regulatory events, judicial rulings, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter participant life spans.
	
(vii)	 Revenue from contract with customers:
	
The Group estimates variable considerations in the nature of volume rebates, discounts, performance bonuses, penalties and similar items and adjusts the 
transaction price for the sale of goods and services. These expected variable considerations are analysed either at customer or contracts basis against agreed 
terms with customers and may differ from actual results.
	
(viii)	 Contingencies:
	
In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from litigation and other claims against the Group. Potential liabilities that are possible but not 
probable of crystallising or are very difficult to quantify reliably are treated as contingent liabilities. Such liabilities are disclosed in notes but are not recognised. 
The cases which have been determined as remote by the Group are not disclosed.
3(B).	  NEW AND AMENDED STANDARD
	
The Group applied for the first-time certain standards and amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 01 April, 2022. 
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standard) Amendment Rules 2022 dated 23 March, 2022, to amend the following Ind 
AS which are effective from 01 April, 2022. 
	
(i)	
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to Ind AS 37:
	
An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract costs (i.e., the costs that the Group cannot 
avoid because it has the contract) exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
	
The amendments specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, the Group needs to include costs that relate directly to a contract 
to provide goods or services including both incremental costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to 
contract activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract management and supervision). General and administrative 
costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. 
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 April, 2022. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.
	
(ii)	
Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendments to Ind AS 16:
	
The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not 
be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant and equipment.
	
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 01 April, 2022. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group as there were no sales of such items produced by property, plant and equipment made available for use on or after the 
beginning of the earliest period presented.

Impairment testing of goodwill 
	
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill relating to continuing business segments has been allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) as follows:
	
CGUs /Segments
As at 31-03-2023
As at 31-03-2022
	
Industrial Systems
 162.14 
 152.37 
	
Total goodwill
 162.14 
 152.37 
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment on annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount based on a number of factors including business plan, operating results, future cash flows and economic conditions. The recoverable amount of cash 
generating units is determined based on higher of value in use and fair value less cost to sell. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU 
representing the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the Group’s operating 
segment.
	
The Group generally uses discounted cash flow based method to determine the recoverable amount. These discounted cash flow calculations use five-year projections 
that are based on financial forecasts. Cash flow projections take into account past experience and represent management’s best estimate about future developments. 
	
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The discount rate calculation is derived from weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 
of CGU’s. Terminal value growth rates take into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data and industry specific trends.
	
The following table presents the key assumptions used to determine value in use / fair value less costs to sell for impairment test purposes.

The pre-tax discount rate (WACC) used 10% (as at 31 March, 2022 10.00%)
	
An analysis of the calculation’s sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (revenue growth, operating margin, discount rate and long-term growth rate) based on 
reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.

(ii)	
It is not practicable to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of matters at A(a) to A(d) above, pending resolution of the arbitration / appellate 
proceedings.
(iii)	
Sales tax / VAT / Goods and Service tax cases include disputes pertaining to disallowances of Input tax credit and non-submission of various forms with 
authorities.
(iv)	
Excise duty / custom duty / service tax cases include disputes pertaining to inadmissibility of cenvat credit, short payment of service tax on work contracts, 
refund of excise duty on export of transformers, interest payment on provisional assessment cases, etc.
(v)	
Contingent liabilities for Income tax cases pertains to difference on account of cenvat credit and valuation of closing inventory, disallowance of expenses, etc.
(vi)	
The Parent Company had received notice of demand under Income Tax Act for ` 606.30 crores for financial year 2016-17, and the Hon’ble Bombay High 
Court has granted the interim stay against the notice of demand until admission of appeal before the High Court. The Parent Company has filed its detailed 
submissions in response to the notices received for the appeal filed before Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). Considering the facts and underlying 
documents with respect to the demand raised under Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the management strongly believes that the demand is not 
sustainable, bad in law and will be reversed at appellate levels.

 41.	 SEGMENT REPORTING	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Group has the following reportable segments:	
	
Power Systems	
	
	
	
:	
Transformer, Switchgear, Automation and Turnkey Projects 
	
Industrial Systems  	
	
	
: 	
Electric Motors, Alternators, Drives, Traction Electronics and SCADA
	
Identifications of segments:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The chief operational decision maker monitors the operating results of its Business Segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation 
and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the consolidated financial 
statements. Operating segments have been identified on the basis of the nature of products / services and have been identified as per the quantitative criteria 
specified in the Ind AS.
	
Segment revenue and results:		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The expenses and incomes which are not directly attributable to any business segment are shown as unallocable expenditure (net of unallocated income).
	
Segment assets and liabilities:
	
Segment assets include all operating assets used by the operating segment and mainly consist of property, plant and equipment, trade receivables, cash and cash 
equivalents and inventories. Segment liabilities primarily include trade payables and other liabilities. Common assets and liabilities which cannot be allocated to any 
of the segments are shown as a part of unallocable assets / liabilities.
	
Inter segment transfer:
	
Inter segment prices are normally negotiated amongst segments with reference to the costs, market price and business risks. Profit or loss on inter segment transfers 
are eliminated at the Group level.

 45.	 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing 
parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1.	
The Group has not disclosed the fair value of financial instruments such as trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, bank balances other than cash and 
cash equivalents, current financial assets - loans,  current financial assets - others (except derivative instruments), current financial liabilities borrowings, trade 
payables and other financial liabilities (except derivative instruments and current maturities of long term borrowings) because their carrying amounts are a 
reasonable approximation of fair value and hence these have not been categorised in any level in the table given below. Further, for financial assets, the Group 
has taken into consideration the allowances for expected credit losses and adjusted the carrying values where applicable.
2.	
The fair values of the quoted investments / units of mutual fund schemes are based on market price / net asset value at the reporting date.
3.	
The fair values for loans given are calculated based on discounted cash flows using current lending rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. 
Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for expected losses of these loans given. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments are not 
materially different from their carrying values. They are classified as level 2 fair values in the fair value hierarchy.
4.	
Fair values of the Group’s interest-bearing borrowings are determined by using discounted cash flow method using the current borrowing rates. Fair value of 
such instruments are not materially different from their carrying values, accordingly non-current borrowings are classified as level 2 fair values in the fair value 
hierarchy.

46. 	 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks namely credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The financial risks are managed in accordance with the 
Group’s risk management policy which has been approved by its Board of Directors.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises of 
three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include foreign currency receivables, payables, 
loans and borrowings, derivative financial instruments and FVTOCI investments.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s 
exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group has managed its 
interest rate risk by balancing the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments in its total portfolio.

foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods, commodities and services in the respective currencies. 
The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and the Group follows established risk management policies.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group 
is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities including loans, foreign exchange transactions and 
other financial instruments. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counter party may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the Group 
periodically assesses the financial reliability of customers, taking into account the financial condition, current economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and 
ageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are generally set to manage credit risk. General payment terms include credit period ranging from 45 to 90 days 
and where applicable, mobilisation advance, progress payments and certain retention money to be released at the end of the project.
	
Where the loans or receivables are impaired, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. 
	
The Group is exposed to credit risk for trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments, other bank balances, loans given, other financial assets, financial 
guarantees.
	
In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Group to banks and financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum 
amount which the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon or in case where settlement is agreed, the settlement amount. Based on the expectation 
at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided except 
as otherwise stated in respect of guarantees where settlement is agreed.

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023 dated March 31, 2023 to amend the following Ind 
AS which are effective from 01 April, 2023.
	
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. It has also 
been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 01 April, 2023 and apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start 
of that period. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
	
(ii)	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 
‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept 
of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to Ind AS 1 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 
01 April, 2023. Consequential amendments have been made in Ind AS 107. 
	
(iii)	
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable 
profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and 
decommissioning obligations. Consequential amendments have been made in Ind AS 101.  The amendments to Ind AS 12 are applicable for annual periods 
beginning on or after 01 April, 2023.
