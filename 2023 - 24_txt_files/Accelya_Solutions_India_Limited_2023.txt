LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Shareholders,
I would like to begin by expressing our sincere gratitude for your continued trust 
and support to Accelya Solutions India Limited. This past year has seen a positive 
trajectory for our business, underpinned by our customers' trust and hard work 
of our talented employees. We are proud of the performance and are pleased 
to reward our shareholders with dividends that reflect our financial results. The 
total dividend for 2023-24 is Rs. 65 (Rupees Sixty-five) per share, which includes 
Rs. 40 per share recommended as final dividend.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to place on record my sincere 
appreciation for the guidance provided by Ms. Sangeeta Singh who has retired 
as an Independent Director effective 17th July 2024 after serving on the Board 
for 10 years. I warmly welcome Mr. Ravindran Menon, who joined our Board as 
an Independent Director on 17th April 2024. 
Our People
Our employees are our greatest asset, and we are committed to fostering a 
workplace that promotes high performance, collaboration, and continuous 
growth.  Our objective is to attract, develop, and retain top talent, ensuring that 
Accelya remains an employer of choice in this highly competitive market.
In FY24, we successfully implemented the Workday software platform, 
introducing modules like Core HR, Performance Management, Talent 
Management, Recruitment, and more. This transition to Workday has enhanced our processes and provided a more automated 
and improved employee experience. The launch of our first employee engagement survey through Workday’s Peakon tool 
provided valuable insights into our workforce’s engagement levels, enabling us to take targeted actions to further enhance 
employee satisfaction and productivity.
Learning & Team Communication
The Accelya Academy, launched during the beginning of the year, has been instrumental in promoting skill acquisition and 
growth among our employees. The Academy offers a variety of in-house enablement content alongside resources from 
LinkedIn Learning and Pluralsight.
 On the technology front, we introduced L100 Accelya product and industry certifications, aimed at familiarizing employees 
with our offerings and the broader aviation industry. To further support learning and development, we integrated Workday 
Learn into our HRIS, allowing employees to access a wealth of educational content in one place.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. This year, we expanded our Women’s Employee Resource 
Group (ERG) with regional chapters, completed a mentoring program for members, and hosted specialized events featuring 
guest speakers and networking opportunities. 
Revenue Accounting continues to be our core solutions. This year, a core product focus will be on integrating these Settlement 
solutions into the IATA Offers & Orders initiative, an initiative to modernize and streamline the way airline products and services 
are sold, ordered, and fulfilled across the travel industry. 
What’s Next
Looking forward, we remain focused on enabling innovation-led growth for the airline industry, putting control back in the hands 
of airlines, and empowering them to delight their customers. With the demand for air travel expected to grow significantly in 
the coming years, Accelya is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth through our best-in-class solutions, market-leading 
innovation, and world-class team.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to our valued shareholders and thank you for your unwavering trust in us. Your 
continued support is deeply appreciated.
Yours truly,
Gurudas Shenoy
Managing Director

Annexure ‘F’
Addendum to Directors Report for observations by Secretarial Auditors
In respect of Secretarial Audit Report, the following explanation is given by the Board of Directors to the observations 
made by the Secretarial Auditors
Explanation to point no. 1: There was a delay of 9 hours and 36 minutes in disclosing the proceedings to the stock 
exchanges. This was an inadvertent delay.
Explanation to point no. 2: Since the explanation to Regulation 46(2)(o) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”) (as amended) specifies ‘meet’ to mean group meetings or group 
conference calls conducted physically or through digital means and in our case the analyst 'meet' is held with only a 
single analyst, in our view the gap of 2 working days for scheduling an analyst meet may not be applicable in this case. 
However, henceforth, we will ensure that all the analyst meetings are held after giving notice of at least 2 working days 
to the exchanges.
Explanation to point no. 3: As regards the Policy for determining materiality of events, the amendment to Regulation 30(4)
(c) of LODR Regulations providing the threshold mentioned therein is any way applicable to the Company irrespective of 
whether it is included or not in the Policy, and the same need not be included in the Policy. However, we have noted the 
observation and have amended the Policy.

Governance, leadership, and oversight 
7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets, and achievements. 
I am pleased to present Accelya's inaugural Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the financial 
year 2023-24. At Accelya, we recognise the significant value that effective Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) programs bring to our business and society. Over the past twelve months, we have taken decisive steps to 
strengthen our commitment to ESG.
Environmental
During the reporting period, Accelya has diligently measured its carbon footprint since FY 20. To ensure accuracy 
and relevance, we set emissions boundaries in alignment with international best practices, using the GHG Protocol 
framework. This transparent approach allows us to account for our carbon emissions and take necessary actions to 
reduce them.
Following the GHG reporting exercise, Accelya has established ambitious GHG reduction targets for scope 1, scope 2, 
and scope 3 emissions. These targets are aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative and the Paris Agreement, 
ensuring that Accelya is on a path to meaningful carbon reduction.
As part of our environmental commitments, we have also invested in certified carbon offsets to compensate for our 
residual carbon emissions.
Social
At Accelya we embrace diversity and equality in all aspects of our business. We are committed to building a team 
with a variety of backgrounds, skills and views – a place where every employee can be themselves so they can reach 
their full potential and help us achieve our business skills.
The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.
This year we have continued our focus on fostering an environment for inclusion, strengthening our Women’s ERG 
with regional Chapters, completion of a mentoring program for members and a number of specialized events with 
guest speakers and networking opportunities.
Governance
Accelya remains committed to maintaining transparency, ethical practices, and robust governance. During the 
reporting period, we reviewed and updated policies and procedures to ensure compliance with relevant regulations, 
prevent corruption, and safeguard data.
DIRECTORS' REPORT

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
A key focus area was enhancing our whistleblowing channels to empower employees to raise concerns. We 
invested in a new external helpline and provided comprehensive training to all employees on the importance of 
whistleblowing.
To govern our ESG efforts effectively, we formed an ESG Committee, comprising members of the Board of Directors 
and the Heads of Sustainability, Diversity, and Ethics and Compliance. The committee meets quarterly to review 
progress, performance, and address any issues that require the attention of the Board.
Conclusion
As Accelya advances on its sustainability journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment to address ESG challeng­
es and contribute positively to society and the environment. We recognize that continuous improvement is vital, 
and we embrace the opportunities and responsibilities that lie ahead. We extend our gratitude to our stakeholders 
for their trust and support, as we strive to build a sustainable and responsible future together.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
Annexure ‘I’
Conservation of Energy
(i) 	 Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy
During the reporting period, Accelya has diligently measured its carbon footprint since FY 20. To ensure accuracy 
and relevance, we set emissions boundaries in alignment with international best practices, using the GHG Protocol 
framework. This transparent approach allows us to account for our carbon emissions and take necessary actions to 
reduce them.
Following the GHG reporting exercise, Accelya has established ambitious GHG reduction targets for scope 1, scope 2, 
and scope 3 emissions. These targets are aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative and the Paris Agreement, 
ensuring that Accelya is on a path to meaningful carbon reduction.
(ii) 	 Steps taken by the company for utilising alternate sources of energy
As part of our environmental commitments, we have also invested in certified carbon offsets to compensate for our 
residual carbon emissions.
(iii) 	 Capital investment on energy conservation equipment
Being an IT company, the avenues and scope for investments in R&D through specific technologies to improve 
environmental and social impacts of IT products and processes were very minimal.
Technology absorption
(i) 	 Efforts made towards technology absorption;
The Company is investing in its Order Accounting platform to meet the anticipated demand from airlines transitioning 
to One Order in the future.
The investment in modernizing the Revenue Assurance solution with web-enabled technology is also progressing, 
which will significantly enhance the Company’s service delivery to customers.
Additionally, the Company’s Refund Platform is being upgraded to leverage new APIs released by PSS providers, 
offering centralized refund services through its call centers or via the Company’s AMS services.
(ii) 	 Benefits derived like product improvement, cost reduction, product development or import substitution
The Company is well-aligned with upcoming industry changes related to IATA’s NDC and One Order initiatives. With 
Accelya US Inc's proven solutions for NDC and substantial work in the Order space by the Group (and the Company), 
we are poised to realize the vision of a new airline platform that spans the entire lifecycle from offer to settlement.
The new platform is set to play a significant role in the airline ecosystem as airlines transition from traditional Tickets 
and EMDs to providing a full retailing experience for passengers. The Company’s accounting solution is already 
certified by IATA under the new 21.3 standards and is being enhanced to include new capabilities for Interline and 
Agency Billing and Settlement.
Customers have begun engaging with Order Accounting, and there are already a few early adopters with RFIs in the 
market seeking to understand and collaborate with the Company on these initiatives.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK:
Global air passenger traffic continued its solid growth, up 13.8% compared to 2023. Airlines have increased their total 
capacity to meet the rising demand for travel. Both international travel and capacity have grown on a year-on-year basis. 
While domestic demand has also increased, it has done so at a slower rate compared to international travel.
Carriers in the Asia-Pacific region continue to lead growth compared to their peers in other regions. All other regions 
have also started to grow at rates exceeding 10%, except for the Americas, which are growing at a comparatively lower 
rate.
The growth in passenger volumes and sustainable cargo transportation has ensured that airlines turned profitable in 
2024, surpassing the forecasted margins. Airlines have started placing large orders for aircraft in anticipation of growing 
passenger demand and improving efficiencies by retiring older aircraft. 
New Distribution Capability (NDC) transactions have been growing year-on-year as airlines focus on providing new 
ancillary services. Passengers now have a choice of purchasing seats, meals, lounge access, and travel upgrades 
throughout their journey. These ancillaries have gradually added to airlines' profitability.
Airlines are now looking to adopt One Order standards to streamline the issuance of ancillaries using a single document 
instead of multiple tickets and EMDs, as is currently the case. Once airlines start onboarding these orders, they will 
be able to sell not only their own services but also third-party services like tours, rental cars, and holiday packages, 
significantly improving their profitability.
With the anticipated growth in passenger and cargo traffic, airline revenue is expected to increase by 10% and potentially 
reach the one trillion-dollar mark. The higher capacities being added by leading airlines will help develop the overall 
topline and service traffic volumes, as well as generate higher passenger yields. Airlines are looking to deploy new 
revenue management concepts using a mix of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to manage forecast demand 
and profitability.
Airlines are projected to generate a net profit of over USD 30 billion in 2024, with a 3.1% net profit margin and a 6.0% 
operating margin. While this is still below the cost of capital rates, there is a bright outlook for an industry that has faced 
constant losses. In such an environment, airlines are investing in cost-saving measures with partners and implementing 
new solutions to improve toplines through augmented ancillaries and bottom lines through the deployment of AI/ML
ACCELYA GROUP’S STRATEGY: 
Accelya group’s financial services have now established themselves as an integral part of the airline decision-making 
process by providing timely and granular information. The emphasis on traceability and auditability has helped our 
solutions cement their place within the airline ecosystem.
Accelya group has established itself as the market leader in the NDC space, with over 50% of transactions currently using 
the Company platform. To maintain this leadership, Accelya group has been investing in new and improved capabilities 
like Dynamic Pricing and Bundling, as well as building a strong foundation for One Order. Accelya group’s platform will 
offer capabilities for Offer, Order, and Settle, enabling customers to launch new products and seamlessly settle and 
account for them. With our One Order focus, Accelya group is poised to drive technology transformation within the 
airline industry, which is embracing new ways of retailing and distribution. 
Accelya group’s Product Integration (API) project has entered the next phase of proof of concept (POC) after establishing 
basic connectivity and ensuring controlled flow of Orders from Offer to Settlement.
Our focus is to balance long-term objectives with short-term goals to create a robust foundation for future growth while 
staying resilient in an ever-evolving business environment. We continue to evolve our products and services to maintain 
our leadership position in the airline commercial and financial platform domain.
ACCELYA SOLUTIONS’ MAJOR OFFERINGS:
Revenue Accounting continues to remain Company’s key solutions.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
80
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
New Distribution Capabilities (NDC) transactions are now being monitored and reported to customers as they closely 
track their distribution strategy and focus on alternative methods to increase revenues.
We continue to add new capabilities to our Order Accounting solution so that it can work seamlessly with any Order 
Management System (OMS). Our goal is to provide our customers with the ability to transition from legacy tickets and 
EMDs to the Order world without losing existing capabilities. Interline settlement will be a crucial part of the Orders 
story, and with The Company’s ability to handle both old and new systems, The Company stands to gain an advantage 
over competitors.
While development focuses on new One Order Standards, the need to maintain and support existing processes and 
settlement standards is monitored to ensure backward compatibility.
The Company continues to partner with airlines through the Strategic Product Governance (SPG) group, established to 
ensure that partners have a say in the overall product roadmap and can effectively contribute to the growth of products 
and services. Airlines continue to leverage the existing Change Management process as they execute their internal 
strategies, such as changes in PSS and ERP systems.
Revenue Accounting
Revenue accounting is a complex business process in an airline, responsible for accurate and timely revenue declaration, 
ensuring correct interline payments, and adherence to IFRS and audit compliances. Crucial strategic decisions are made 
using revenue accounting data in an airline.
With over 30 years of experience and a leadership position in revenue accounting, The Company enables leading global 
airlines to streamline and simplify their revenue accounting processes. The Company continues to work with airlines in 
addressing business challenges, such as NDC, facilitating a seamless transition to the new retailing world.
Revenue Assurance
The Revenue Assurance Services portfolio covers a wide range of audit services spanning the entire ticket lifecycle, from 
original booking to the completion of the journey. This is supported by comprehensive recovery services, including the 
raising of Agent Debit Memos (ADMs) to fund collection.
Cost Management
The Company’s Cost Management Solutions enable airlines to manage their costs more effectively. It automates the 
payables process, provides deeper insights into costs, and facilitates wiser, more profitable decisions every day. As a 
result, airlines can control supplier overpayments and transform their procure-to-pay cycle.

RISKS, CONCERNS AND RISK MITIGATION
Increasing Competition
New providers and existing technology vendors are constantly foraying into the airline IT and finance domain. Accelya 
Solutions is constantly investing in people, solutions and processes to ensure maximum value to its customers. The 
company’s in-depth knowledge of the industry and its requirements makes it the partner of choice for airlines.
Uncertain Economic Environment
The airline industry is amongst the first to be impacted by any major economic or political situations. The Company is 
in a good position to mitigate this risk. The Company has a global customer base. The company has long term contracts 
with its customers which generates annuity revenues and provides good visibility on business.
Regulatory Risk
Proposed legislation in certain countries in which the Company operates, may restrict airlines in those countries from 
outsourcing work to the Company, or may limit its ability to send employees to certain client sites.
The Company has employees of different nationalities which helps in mitigating this risk to a certain extent.
Cyber Security and Data Privacy Risk
Global cyber security and data privacy threats are ever increasing. The Company has relevant controls and compliances 
in place to address these. The Company’s Privacy Management Program covers continuous risk analysis and mitigation 
for all its products, services and processes.
Currency Volatility
Being a global organization dealing with global customers, volatility in currency exchange movements may affect the 
results of Accelya Solutions’ operations.
The Company has currency hedging policies and practices in place which are regularly reviewed to mitigate this risk.

designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational 
information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions 
with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. The Company has a well-defined delegation 
of power with authority limits for approving contracts as well as expenditure. Processes for formulating and reviewing 
annual and long-term business plans have been laid down.

17 of SEBI Regulations 2015) as of June 30, 2024.
The Company has appointed Grant Thornton Bharat LLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its activities. The audit 
is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year and approved by the audit committee. The conduct of 
internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such as operations 
and revenue review, accounting and finance, treasury management, procurement, pre-sales & sales processes, statutory 
compliances, human resource and cyber security & IT processes.
The audit committee reviews reports submitted by the management and audit reports submitted by internal auditors 
and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective 
action.
Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies Act 2013 and Clause 18 of SEBI Regulations 2015), the

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Members of Accelya Solutions India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Accelya Solutions India Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and notes 
to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the 
Act (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 
30 June 2024, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended 
on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the standalone financial statements of the current year. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management and Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, 
AUDITOR'S REPORT
91
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial 
statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements 
in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify 
during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
ANNEXURE “A” TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
(Referred to in paragraph 1 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to 
the members of Accelya Solutions India Limited of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial statements of Accelya Solutions 
India Limited (“the Company”) as of 30 June 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to 
the standalone financial statements based on the internal control with reference to the standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and 
the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements  
A Company’s internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial 
control with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
ANNEXURE TO AUDITOR'S REPORT

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the 
Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to standalone financial statements 
and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as 
at 30 June 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
1.	
Corporate information
	
Accelya Solutions India Limited (“Accelya” or “the Company”) is a software solutions provider to the global Airline 
and Travel industry.
	
Accelya delivers world-class software products, managed processes, technology, and hosting services. Accelya’s 
industry solutions are driven by active partnerships with industry bodies and customers, and significant domain 
knowledge. Its customised approach in deploying these solutions supports clients with the best fit solutions to 
match their requirements. The Company is a public limited company and domiciled in India. The address of the 
registered office is 5th & 6th Floor, Building No. 4, Raheja Woods, River Side 25A, West Avenue, Kalyani Nagar, Pune 
411006.  The board of directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 and 
authorized for issue on 26 July 2024.
2.	
Material accounting policies
	
a)	
Statement of compliance with Ind AS
	
These standalone financial statements (‘the financial statements’) have been prepared in accordance with 
the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time.
	
b)	
Basis of preparation
	
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`) which is also the functional currency of the 
Company. All amounts are rounded off to the nearest lakhs, unless otherwise stated.
	
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets 
and liabilities including defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally 
based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
	
All assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of services 
rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and 
cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating 
cycle of 12 months.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer/ settle 
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of 
whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating 
the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability if 
market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements 
is determined on such basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116, and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value and 
value in use in Ind AS 36.
c)	
Use of estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities), income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
	
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
	
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty, and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are 
included in the following notes:
Notes to the standalone financial statements
NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
105
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
(i)	
Estimation of useful life and residual values of property, plant, and equipment
	
The useful lives and residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the management at the time 
the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. Their lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, 
such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence.
(ii)	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
Cost of defined benefit plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions 
that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include determination of discount rates, future 
salary increases, attrition and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its nature, 
a defined benefit is highly sensitive to change in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date.   
(iii)	 Impairment of trade receivables
	
The Company's trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component and the loss allowance on 
trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses i.e., expected cash shortfall.
	
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(iv)	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has a present value obligation because of past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current 
best estimates.  
(v)	
Revenue Recognition
	
Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using the percentage-of completion method. The Company 
uses judgement to estimate the future efforts-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine the 
degree of completion of the performance obligation.
(vi)	 Leases
	
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease based on the requirements of the relevant 
standard. Computation of the lease liabilities and right-to-use assets requires management to estimate the 
lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. 
	
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and 
exclude periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to 
exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend 
a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances 
that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the Option to extend the lease, or not to 
exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the 
non-cancellable period of a lease.
	
The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated 
or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.
d)	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
	
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition, including any attributable cost for bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation/ amortisation, and 
impairment loss.
Notes to the standalone financial statements  (Continued)
NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
106
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
	
Property, plant, and equipment not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as 
“Capital work-in-progress".
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising from the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount of the assets or CGU, as 
applicable, if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Depreciation on PPE has been provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the 
respective asset. These lives are in accordance with the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013 except in respect of Furniture and Fixtures, and Computer Equipment in which case the life of the 
assets has been assessed and is based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the asset, the 
estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support. Depreciation/ amortization for 
the year is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end.
	
The useful life of the assets considered for depreciation is summarized below:
Building
30 years
Plant and machinery and computer equipment
2 to 6 years
Furniture and fixtures, Equipment, and other assets
4 to 6 years
Vehicles
5 years
Leasehold improvements
To be amortized over the lesser of the period of 
lease and the useful life of the asset
	
The useful lives and residual values are reviewed by the management at each financial year-end and revised, if 
appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the revised remaining 
useful life.
	
Subsequent expenditure
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with 
the expenditure will flow to the Company.
e)	
Other Intangible assets
	
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are measured initially at cost. After initial recognition, an 
intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 
Amortization is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
	
The estimated useful life of software acquired and internally developed has been taken at 3 and 5 years, 
respectively. 
	
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. 
	
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits from the specific 
asset to which it relates. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use. 
Notes to the standalone financial statements  (Continued)
NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
107
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
	
Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of an intangible asset are measured 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Product Development cost
	
Product development costs are incurred on developing/upgrading the software products to launch new 
service modules and functionality to provide an enhanced suite of services. These development costs are 
capitalized and recognised as an intangible asset when the following can be demonstrated: 
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.
•	
Its intention to complete the asset.
•	
Its ability and intention to use or sell the asset.
•	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits.
•	
The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during development.
	
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied 
requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Amortization of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available 
for use. It is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future benefit i.e., the estimated 
useful life. Amortization is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
f)	
Impairment of non-financial asset
	
Property, plant and equipment and definite life intangible assets are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine if there is any indication of impairment. Infinite life intangible assets are mandatorily tested 
annually or at interim period end for impairment, for which the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For 
assets in respect of which any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
	
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (cash generating unit 
or “CGU”) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
of other assets or CGUs. 
	
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater in terms of its value in use and its net selling price. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset or CGU. 
	
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect 
of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to 
reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. 
	
If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists 
or has decreased, the assets or CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. For assets other than goodwill, the 
impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
	
g)	
Revenue recognition
	
Revenue is derived primarily from transaction processing, managed processes, technology and hosting 
services, licensing of software products, related implementation, and maintenance services.
	
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has 
been approved by the parties, and the parties to the contract are committed to fulfilling their respective 
Notes to the standalone financial statements  (Continued)
NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
108
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
obligations. Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
products or services. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until 
such uncertainty is resolved.
•	
Revenues from transaction processing service i.e., airline ticket and coupon processing charges is 
recognized on an output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions 
processed, etc.
•	
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised as the related services are performed and 
revenue from the end of the last billing to the balance sheet date is recognised as unbilled revenue. 
•	
Revenue from sale of user licenses where the customer obtains a ‘right to use’ the licenses is recognized 
at the time when license is made available to the customer, except in case of multiple element contracts 
which require significant implementation services and customization, the entire arrangement is 
considered to be a significant performance obligation and revenue is recognised using the percentage 
of completion method as the implementation and customization is performed.
	
In the case of significant implementation and customisation services provided to clients, those are 
analysed on a case-by-case basis to determine if a separate performance obligation exists. 
•	
Revenue from fixed-price contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and 
where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is recognised based 
on percentage of completion method considering the actual time spent on the contract to the total 
estimated time to complete the contract. 
•	
Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts is recognised based on time 
elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
•	
Revenue related to client training and other services are recognized as the related services are 
performed.
	
The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point 
in time or over a period. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as 
services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to 
payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks 
and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
	
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume 
discounts and price concessions, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes 
taxes collected from customers.
	
Contract assets are recognised when there is an excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts where 
the rights are conditional on something other than passage of time. Contracts are classified as unbilled 
receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only 
passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
	
Deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
	
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
	
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. 
The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the 
transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing 
obligation could undergo a change.

In the event the transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
	
The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers primarily by geographical market and 
service lines.
	
Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis considering the amount outstanding and the rate 
applicable.
	
Dividend is recognised in profit or loss only when the right to receive payment is established.

Leases
	
The Company as a lessee
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings.
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for 
a period in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of 
an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset.
	
(ii)	
the Company has substantially all the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the 
lease and
	
(iii)	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.  
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 
twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.      
	
The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease 
term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right -of-use asset measured at inception shall 
comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to 
be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset 
or site on which it is located. The right -of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease 
liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight -line method from the commencement date 
to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease term.
	
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher 
of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless 
the asset does not generate cashflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such 
cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.         
	
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, 
the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with 
a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment as to 
whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, 
the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the 
lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.

The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It 
is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in the Company’s 
assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.
 	
Lease liability is further bifurcated into current and non-current portion; and the right-of-use assets have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing activities in 
the Statement of Cash Flow. 
	
Further the Company has applied the practical expedient pertaining to COVID 19 related rent concessions, 
wherein the rent concessions are accounted as if it were not a lease modification i.e as a negative variable 
lease payment.
i)	
Foreign currency transactions and balances
	
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date 
of transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions settled during the year are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the Balance Sheet date are translated 
into Indian rupees at the closing exchange rates on that date. The resultant exchange differences are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value is measured. Exchange differences arising out of these translations are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
j)	
Financial Instruments:
	
I.	
Financial Assets:
	
Classification
	
On initial recognition the Company classifies financial assets as measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss based on its business model 
for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
All financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit 
and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. 
	
Financial assets at amortised cost
	
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
i)	
the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
ii)	
contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
	
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or 
premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
	
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
	
Financial assets included within the fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) category are measured at 
fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
	
Equity investments
	
All equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value. Equity 
instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the 
Company decides to classify the same either as at fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI) or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The 
classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
	
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on 
the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). There is no 
recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of such investments.
	
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its equity investments as recognized 
in the financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP 
and use that as the deemed cost as at the transition date pursuant to the exemption under Ind AS 101.
	
Investment in subsidiaries
	
Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.
	
Derecognition
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in 
which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in 
which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
and does not retain control of the financial asset.
	
If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its Balance Sheet but 
retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred 
assets are not derecognised.
	
Impairment of financial assets
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
i)	
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt 
securities, deposits, and bank balance.
ii)	
Trade receivables.
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables which do not contain a significant financing component.
	
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. 
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right 
from its initial recognition.
II.	
Financial Liabilities
	
Classification
	
The Company classifies all financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost, except for financial 
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are 
liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss or at amortised cost (loans and borrowings, and payables).
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
	
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
	
Loans and borrowings
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised.
	
Amortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
	
Derecognition
	
Financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
Derivative financial instruments
	
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts 
to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and 
as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
	
k)	
Cash and cash equivalent
	
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short term (with an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value.
	
l)	
Fair value measurement
	
‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the 
most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects 
its non-performance risk.
Notes to the standalone financial statements  (Continued)
NOTES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
113
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
	
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for 
both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the Company measures the fair 
value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded 
as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide 
pricing information on an ongoing basis.
	
If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Company uses valuation techniques that maximise 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation 
technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a 
transaction.
	
If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Company measures 
assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence 
of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair 
value of the consideration given or received.
	
m)	
Employee benefits
	
a.	
Short-term employee benefits
	
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified 
as short-term employee benefits.  These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and ex-gratia. The 
undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for employee service is 
recognised as an expense at an undiscounted amount in the Statement of Profit and Loss as the related 
service is rendered by employees.
	
b.	
Post-employment benefits
	
	
Defined Contribution Plan 
	
Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employee provident fund, employees’ state 
insurance, national pension scheme, labour welfare fund, etc. are charged as an expense based on the 
amount of contribution required to be made as and when services are rendered by the employees. 
Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain employees, is made to a government 
administered fund and charged as an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss. The above benefits 
are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Company has no further defined obligations 
beyond the monthly contributions.
	
Defined Benefit Plan 
	
The Company’s net obligation in respect of gratuity is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That 
benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. 
The present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based on actuarial 
valuation by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which recognizes each 
period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit entitlement and measures each 
unit separately to build up the final obligation. The obligation is measured at the present value of 
the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining the present value of the 
obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on Government securities as at 
the Balance Sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income.
	
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
•	
service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on 
curtailments and settlements);
•	
net interest expense or income; and
•	
remeasurement

c.	
Compensated absences
	
Provision for compensated absences cost has been made based on actuarial valuation by an independent 
actuary at balance sheet date.
	
The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry-
forward a portion of the unutilized accrued compensated absence and utilize it in future periods or 
receive cash compensation at termination of employment for the unutilized accrued compensated 
absence. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the 
employee renders the services that increase this entitlement. The Company measures the expected 
cost of compensated absence as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of 
the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.
n)	
Income taxes
	
Income-tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit. It is recognised in profit or loss 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
	
Current taxes
	
Tax expense for the year, comprising current tax and deferred tax, are included in the determination of 
the net profit or loss for the year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities in accordance with the taxation laws prevailing in India.
	
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and set off the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
	
Deferred taxes
	
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which they can be used. The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit 
may not be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Company recognises a deferred tax 
asset only to the extent it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realised.
	
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred 
tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to deferred tax assets when they are realised 
or deferred tax liabilities when they are settled, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities 
and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or 
on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax 
assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
o)	
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
	
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders 
for the year, by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. 
	
The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share comprises of weighted average number 
of shares considered for deriving basic earning per share, and also the weighted average number of equity 
shares which may be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential shares, unless the results would be anti – 
dilutive.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
p)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
	
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from 
a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be 
received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
	
When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
	
The Company uses significant judgement to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control 
of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be 
made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.
q)	
Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM assesses the financial performance and position of the 
company and makes strategic decisions. The company operates in one reportable business segment i.e. 
travel and transportation vertical.
r)	
Investments
	
Investments in subsidiaries is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the difference between net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
s)	
Government grants
	
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that (i) the Company will comply with 
the conditions attached to them, and (ii) the grant will be received. 
t)	
Going concern 
	
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, the 
Company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
u)	
Recent pronouncements
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 30 
June 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to 
the Company.

Remaining performance obligations	
While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or 
partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognize those 
revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed 
the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain 
to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and 
material, outcome based and event based contracts.
Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as 
terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in 
currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) 
performance obligations is ` 5,006.15 lakhs (30 June 2023: ` 4,940.25 lakhs) out of which approx. 33.09% (30 June 2023: 
approx. 60.50%) is expected to be recognised as revenue in next year and the balance thereafter.
Contract asset and liabilities
During the year ended 30 June 2024, the Company recognized revenue of ` 471.59 lakhs out of opening gross deferred 
revenue (Contract liabilities) of ` 474.46 lakhs.
During the year ended 30 June 2024, ` 1,128.03 lakhs of contract assets which had an amount of ` 1,137.28 lakhs as at 
01 July 2023, has been billed on completion of milestones and services.

Employee benefits
Defined contribution plan
The Company makes contributions in respect of qualifying employees towards Provident Fund and other funds. The 
Company has no obligations other than to make the specified contributions. The contributions are charged to the 
statement of profit and loss as they accrue. The amount recognized as an expense towards contribution to Provident 
Fund and other funds for the year aggregated to ` 547.94 lakhs (30 June 2023: ` 518.30 lakhs).
Defined benefit plan
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan. The present value of the defined benefit liability, and the 
related current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit method. The Company 
provides the gratuity benefit through annual contributions to a fund managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India 
(LIC). LIC administers the plan and determines the contribution required to be paid by the Company. No other retirement 
benefits are provided to these employees.
Investment risk
	
The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.	
	
Interest rate risk
The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase in the 
ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability (as shown in 
financial statements).

Demographic risk
The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Company is exposed 
to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
	
Salary escalation risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan participants 
in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used 
to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, attrition 
rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably 
possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions 
constant. The results of sensitivity analysis is given below:

B.	
Measurement of fair values
Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices in an active market. This includes 
listed equity instruments, traded debentures and mutual funds that have quoted price/ declared NAV.
The financial instruments included in Level 2 of fair value hierarchy have been valued using quotes available for 
similar assets and liabilities in the active market. The investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy have 
been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value. The cost of unquoted investments approximate 
the fair value because there is a range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of 
fair value within that range. The carrying value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost approximates 
their fair value.
	
C.	
Financial risk management
	
	
The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
- 	
Credit risk;
-	
Liquidity risk; and
-	
Market risk
i.	
Risk management framework
	
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity 
risk. The Company’s primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk 
on its financial performance. The Company’s risk management assessment and policies and processes are 
established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, 
and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and 
processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The 
Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s risk assessment and 
management policies and processes.
ii.	
Credit risk
	
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers, 
unbilled receivables and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants 
credit terms in the normal course of business.
	
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk at the reporting date:

The Company does not expect any credit risk on the amount recoverable from related parties.
	
Trade receivables
	
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each 
customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which 
the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through 
continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in

Expected credit loss assessment:
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to 
determine incurred and expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not 
reflect any significant credit losses. Given the critical nature of the services of the Company to its customers, 
the Company expects the historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue. Further, management believes 
that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on 
historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. The impairment loss as at 30 
June 2024 relates to several customers that have defaulted on their payments to the Company and are not 
expected to be able to pay their outstanding balances, mainly due to economic circumstances.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year 
was as follows.

Unbilled receivables are ` 210.06 lakhs and ` 847.47 lakhs as at 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 respectively. 
The Company’s unbilled receivables generally ranges from 0 – 90 days.
One customer accounted individually for more than 10% of the accounts receivable for the year ended 
30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: Four customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable). Three 
customers accounted individually for more than 10% of the unbilled receivable and contract asset for the 
year ended 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: Three customers accounted for more than 10% of unbilled receivable 
and contract asset).

Cash and cash equivalents, deposits and mutual funds
The Company held cash and cash equivalents, deposits and mutual funds with credit worthy banks and 
financial institutions of ` 12,237.27 lakhs as at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: ` 6,886.74 lakhs). The credit 
worthiness of such banks and financial institutions is evaluated by the management on an ongoing basis and 
is considered to be good.
Other than trade and other receivables, the Company has no other financial assets that are past due but not 
impaired.
iii.	
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become 
due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risk to the Company’s reputation. 
The Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view 
to maintaining financial flexibility.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse 
changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity 
prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates 
and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency 
receivables and payables and all short term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk 
primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. 
Thus, the Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue 
generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

Currency risk
The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the profit and loss account 
and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are 
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are 
subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to 
fluctuations in USD, SGD, GBP and Euro against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its 
subsidiaries.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses forward contract derivative instruments primarily to 
hedge foreign exchange. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative 
purposes.

Interest rate risk

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Members of Accelya Solutions India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Accelya Solutions India Limited (“the Parent”) 
and its subsidiaries, (Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2024 and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year 
ended on that date, and notes to financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act 
(‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as 
at 30 June 2024, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated cash 
flows and their consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) 
specified under section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current year. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.

information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
AUDITOR'S REPORT
156
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and 
consolidated changes in equity of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for  maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of 
the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors 
of the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective management and Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of the Group. 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
AUDITOR'S REPORT
157
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial 
statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements 
in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial control that 
we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

AUDITOR'S REPORT

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
ANNEXURE “A” TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the 
members of Accelya Solutions India Limited of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Accelya Solutions India Limited (“the 
Parent” or “the Company”) as of and for the year ended 30 June 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Parent, is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements based on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to the respective Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Parent’s internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on 
Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
system with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Parent’s internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
ANNEXURE TO AUDITOR'S REPORT
161
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the 
Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to consolidated financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In  our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Parent, has, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements 
and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as 
at 30 June 2024 based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
established by the Parent considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Material accounting policies
a)	
Statement of compliance with Ind AS
	
These consolidated financial statements (‘the financial statements’) have been prepared in accordance 
with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to 
time.
b)	
Basis of preparation
	
The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`) which is also the functional currency of the 
Company. All amounts are rounded off to the nearest lakhs, unless otherwise stated.
	
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets 
and liabilities including defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally 
based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
	
All assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of services 
rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash 
and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an 
operating cycle of 12 months. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer/ settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In 
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset 
or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these 
financial statements is determined on such basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope 
of Ind AS 116, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as 
net realisable value and value in use in Ind AS 36.
c)	
Historical cost convention
	
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for following 
item:
Item
Measurement basis
Certain financial assets and liabilities
Fair value
Contingent consideration in business combination
Fair value
Net defined benefit (asset)/liability
Fair value of plan assets less present value of 
defined benefit obligation
d)	
Use of estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, (including contingent liabilities) income and expenses. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis.
	
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
	
Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty, and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are 
included in the following note.
	
(i)	
Estimation of useful life and residual values of property, plant, and equipment
	
The useful lives and residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the management at the 
time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. Their lives 
are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which 
may impact their life, such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence.
(ii)	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation
	
Cost of defined benefit plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based 
on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves 
making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include 
determination of discount rates, future salary increases, attrition and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its nature, a defined benefit is highly sensitive to change 
in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
(iii)	
Impairment of trade receivables
	
The Company's trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component and loss 
allowance on trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses i.e., 
expected cash shortfall.
	
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(iv)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities
	
A provision is recognized when the Company has a present value obligation because of past events 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect 
of which a reliable estimate can be made. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
(v)	
Impairment of goodwill
	
The Company   estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future 
cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating 
results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated 
cash flows are developed using internal forecasts.
(vi)	
Revenue Recognition
	
Revenue for fixed-price contract is recognised using percentage-of completion method. The 
Company uses judgement to estimate the future efforts-to-completion of the contracts which is 
used to determine the degree of completion of the performance obligation.
(vii)	
Leases
	
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease based on the requirements of the 
relevant standard. Computation of the lease liabilities and right-to-use assets requires management 
to estimate the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.
	
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; and exclude periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably 
certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise 
an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the 
Option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises 
the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.
	
The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being 
evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.
e)	
Basis of consolidation
i.	
Business combination
	
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the date of 
the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Company. The consideration 
transferred in the acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent 
liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at fair values on their acquisition 
date. 
	
Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as 
goodwill. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Transaction costs are expensed 
as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
	
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships with the acquiree. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
ii.	
Subsidiaries
	
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed 
to, or has right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until 
the date on which control ceases.
iii.	
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
	
Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity 
accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in 
the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

f)	
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition, including any attributable cost for bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation/amortisation and 
impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed 
as “Capital work-in-progress". 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount of the assets or CGU, 
as applicable, if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. An impairment loss 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation on PPE has been provided on the straight-line method over the estimated `useful life of 
the respective asset. These lives are in accordance with the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of Furniture and Fixtures, and Computer Equipment in which 
case the life of the assets has been assessed and is based on technical advice, taking into account the 
nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history 
of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support. 
Depreciation/ amortization for the year is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Depreciation 
methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end.
The useful life of the assets considered for depreciation is summarized below:
Building
30 years
Plant and machinery and computer equipment
2 to 6 years
Furniture and fixtures, Equipment, and other assets
4 to 6 years
Vehicles
5 years
Leasehold improvements
To be amortized over the lesser of the period of 
lease and the useful life of the asset
The useful lives and residual values are reviewed by the management at each financial year-end and 
revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the 
revised remaining useful life.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
g)	
Goodwill and other Intangible assets
i.	
Goodwill
For measurement of goodwill that arises on a business combination (see note 2(e) (i)). Subsequent 
measurement is at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
ii.	
Other Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are measured initially at cost. After initial 
recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any. Amortization is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives.
The estimated useful life of Software acquired and internally developed has been taken at 3 and 5 
years, respectively.
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
172
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits from 
the specific asset to which it relates. An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
iii.	
Product Development Cost
Product development costs are incurred on developing/upgrading the software products to 
launch new service modules and functionality to provide an enhanced suite of services. These 
development costs are capitalized and recognised as an intangible asset when the following can be 
demonstrated: 
•	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use 
or sale; 
•	
Its intention to complete the asset; 
•	
Its ability and intention to use or sell the asset; 
•	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits;
•	
The availability of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
asset; and
•	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during 
development.
	
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model 
is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Amortization of the asset begins when development 
is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortized on a straight-line basis over the 
period of expected future benefit i.e., the estimated useful life. Amortization is recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
h)	
Impairment of non-financial asset
Property, plant and equipment and definite life intangible assets are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine if there is any indication of impairment. Infinite life intangible assets are mandatorily tested 
annually or at interim period end for impairment, for which the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For assets in respect of which any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (cash 
generating unit or “CGU”) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset or CGU. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in 
respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and 
then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. 
If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists 
or has decreased, the assets or CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. For assets other than goodwill, the 
impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had 
been recognised. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not subsequently reversed.

i)	
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived primarily from transaction processing, managed processes, technology and hosting 
services, licensing of software products, related implementation, and maintenance services.
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract 
has been approved by the parties, and the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective 
obligations. Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those 
products or services. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until 
such uncertainty is resolved.
•	
Revenues from transaction processing service i.e. airline ticket and coupon processing charges is 
recognized on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions 
processed, etc.
•	
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised as the related services are performed and 
revenue from the end of the last billing to the balance sheet date is recognised as unbilled revenue.
•	
Revenue from sale of user licenses where the customer obtains a ‘right to use’ the licenses is 
recognized at the time when license is made available to the customer,  except in case of multiple 
element contracts which require significant implementation services and customization, the entire 
arrangement is considered to be a significant performance obligation and revenue is recognised 
using the percentage of completion method as the implementation and customization is performed.
	
In the case of significant implementation and customisation services provided to clients, those are 
analysed on a case-by-case basis to determine if a separate performance obligation exists. 
•	
Revenue from fixed-price contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time and 
where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is recognised 
based on percentage of completion method considering the actual time spent on the contract to 
the total estimate time to complete the contract. 
•	
Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts is recognised based on 
time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
•	
Revenue related to client training and other services are recognized as the related services are 
performed.
The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied 
at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer 
consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence 
of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, 
transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume 
discounts and price concessions, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also 
excludes taxes collected from customers.
Contract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts where 
the rights are conditional on something other than passage of time. Contract are classified as unbilled 
receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only 
passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there is billings in excess of revenues.
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. 
The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the 
transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing 
obligation could undergo a change.
In the event the transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted 
for.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers primary by geographical market and 
service lines.
Interest income is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and 
the rate applicable. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividend is established.
Dividend is recognised in profit or loss only when the right to receive payment is established.
j)	
Leases
The Company as a lessee
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings. 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset
	
(ii)	
the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the 
period of the lease and
	
(iii)	
the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.".
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term 
of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.      
The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease 
term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right -of-use asset measured at inception shall 
comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs 
to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying 
asset or site on which it is located. The right -of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets is depreciated using the straight -line method from the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use assets or the end of the 
lease term.         
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher 
of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cashflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, 
the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.         
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, 
the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment 
as to whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. For leases with reasonably similar 
characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate 
specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.
The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It 
is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in the Company’s 
assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.
Lease liability is further bifurcated into current and non-current portion; and the right-of-use assets have 
been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing

activities in the Statement of Cash Flow. 
Further the Company has applied the practical expedient pertaining to COVID 19 related rent concessions, 
wherein the rent concessions are accounted as if it were not a lease modification i.e as a negative variable 
lease payment.
k)	
Foreign currency transactions and balances
i.	
Foreign currency Transactions and Balances
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the 
date of transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions settled during 
the year are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the Balance Sheet date are 
translated into Indian rupees at the closing exchange rates on that date. The resultant exchange 
differences are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency, are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the fair value is measured. Exchange differences arising out of 
these translations are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Translation of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements, 
branches) including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into 
INR, the functional currency of the company, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The 
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date 
of the transaction.
When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant 
influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that 
foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on 
disposal. If the group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the 
relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is re-allocated to NCI. When the group disposes of 
only a part of its interest in an associate or a joint venture while retaining significant influence or 
joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
l)	
Financial Instruments:
I.	
Financial Assets:
Classification
On initial recognition the Company classifies financial assets as measured at amortised cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss on the basis of its 
business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through 
profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
Financial assets at amortised cost
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
i)	
the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting 
contractual cash flows, and
ii)	
contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)

or premium and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in 
finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Financial assets included within the fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) category are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss
Equity investments
All equity investments other than investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides 
to classify the same either as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or FVTPL. The 
Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable. 
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on 
the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). There is no 
recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of such investments.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its equity investments as recognized in 
the consolidated financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous 
GAAP and use that as the deemed cost as at the transition date pursuant to the exemption under Ind AS 
101.
Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in 
which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in 
which the company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and 
does not retain control of the financial asset.
If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its Balance Sheet but 
retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred 
assets are not derecognised.
Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement 
and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
	
i)	
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt 
securities, deposits, and bank balance.
	
ii)	
Trade receivables.
	
	
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade 
receivables which do not contain a significant financing component.
	
	
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit 
risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, 
right from its initial recognition.
I.	
Financial Liabilities
Classification
The Company classifies all financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost, except for financial 
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are 
liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss or at amortised cost (loans and borrowings, and payables).
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
177
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings 
and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Derecognition
Financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 
or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the Balance 
Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts 
to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. Such derivative financial instruments are 
initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair 
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
m)	
Cash and cash equivalent
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short term (with an 
original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.
n)	
Fair value measurement
‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the 
most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that date. The fair value of a liability 
reflects its non-performance risk.
A number of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, 
for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When one is available, the Company measures 
the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is 
regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume 
to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Company uses valuation techniques that maximise 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation 
technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a 
transaction.

38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Company measures 
assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price. The best evidence 
of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the 
fair value of the consideration given or received.
o)	
Employee benefit
i.	
Short-term employee benefits
Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are 
classified as short-term employee benefits.  These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus and 
ex-gratia. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for 
employee service is recognised as an expense at an undiscounted amount in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss as the related service is rendered by employees.
ii.	
Post-employment benefits
Defined Contribution Plan 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employee provident fund, employees’ state 
insurance, national pension scheme, labour welfare fund, etc. are charged as an expense based 
on the amount of contribution required to be made as and when services are rendered by the 
employees. Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain employees, is made to 
a government administered fund and charged as an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Company has no further 
defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
Defined Benefit Plan 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of gratuity is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is 
deducted. The present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based 
on actuarial valuation by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method, which 
recognizes each period of service as giving rise to additional unit of employee benefit entitlement 
and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation. The obligation is measured 
at the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for determining 
the present value of the obligation under defined benefit plan are based on the market yields on 
Government securities as at the Balance Sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in 
other comprehensive income.
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
•	
service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on 
curtailments and settlements);
•	
net interest expense or income; and
•	
remeasurement
iii.	
Compensated absences
Provision for compensated absences cost has been made based on actuarial valuation by an 
independent actuary at balance sheet date.
The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry-
forward a portion of the unutilized accrued compensated absence and utilize it in future periods or 
receive cash compensation at termination of employment for the unutilized accrued compensated 
absence. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the 
employee renders the services that increase this entitlement. The Company measures the expected 
cost of compensated absence as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result 
of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date.

p)	
Income taxes
Income-tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit. It is recognised in profit or 
loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive 
income.
Current taxes
Tax expense for the year, comprising current tax and deferred tax, are included in the determination of 
the net profit or loss for the year. Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities in accordance with the taxation laws prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and set off the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which they can be used. The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that 
future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent losses, the Company 
recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent it has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there 
is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which such deferred tax 
asset can be realised.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to deferred tax assets when 
they are realised or deferred tax liabilities when they are settled, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis 
or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
q)	
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders for the year, by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share comprises of weighted average 
number of shares considered for deriving basic earning per share, and also the weighted average number 
of equity shares which may be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential shares, unless the results 
would be anti – dilutive.
r)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered 
from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will 
be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
180
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material).
The Company uses significant judgement to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either 
not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate 
of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial 
statements.
s)	
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM assesses the financial performance and position of the 
company and makes strategic decisions. The company operates in one reportable business segment i.e. 
travel and transportation vertical.
t)	
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the difference between 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
u)	
Government grants
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that (i) the Company will comply 
with the conditions attached to them, and (ii) the grant will be received.
v)	
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, the 
Company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
w)	
Recent pronouncements
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended 30 
June 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable 
to the Company.

Remaining performance obligations
While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied 
(or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognize 
those revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not 
disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations 
which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically 
involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.
Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as 
terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes 
in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially 
satisfied) performance obligations is approx. ` 5,064.92 lakhs (30 June 2023: ` 5,120.63 lakhs) out of which 
approx. 33.67% (30 June 2023: approx. 59.52%) is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the 
balance thereafter.

Employee benefits
	
Defined contribution plan
The Company makes contributions in respect of qualifying employees towards Provident Fund and other funds. 
The Company has no obligations other than to make the specified contributions. The contributions are charged 
to the statement of profit and loss as they accrue. The amount recognized as an expense towards contribution to 
Provident Fund and other funds for the year aggregated to ` 547.94 lakhs (30 June 2023: ` 518.30 lakhs).
Defined benefit plan
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan. The present value of the defined benefit 
liability, and the related current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit 
method. The Company provides the gratuity benefit through annual contributions to a fund managed by the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). LIC administers the plan and determines the contribution required to be paid 
by the Company. No other retirement benefits are provided to these employees.
Investment risk
The probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.

197
38th Annual Report 2023-24          	Accelya Solutions India Limited
Interest rate risk
The plan exposes the Company to the risk of fall in interest rates. A fall in interest rates will result in an increase 
in the ultimate cost of providing the above benefit and will thus result in an increase in the value of the liability 
(as shown in financial statements).
Demographic risk
The Company has used certain mortality and attrition assumptions in valuation of the liability. The Company is 
exposed to the risk of actual experience turning out to be worse compared to the assumption.
Salary escalation risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan 
participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of 
increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.

# Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required.
B.	
Measurement of fair values
Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices in an active market. This 
includes listed equity instruments, traded debentures and mutual funds that have quoted price/ declared 
NAV.
The financial instruments included in Level 2 of fair value hierarchy have been valued using quotes 
available for similar assets and liabilities in the active market. The investments included in Level 3 of fair 
value hierarchy have been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value. The cost of unquoted 
investments approximate the fair value because there is a range of possible fair value measurements and 
the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range. The carrying value of financial instruments 
measured at amortized cost approximates their fair value.	
C.

i.	
Risk management framework
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Company’s primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse 
effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company’s risk management assessment 
and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the 
same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit 
Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s risk assessment and management policies 
and processes.
ii.	
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s 
receivables from customers, unbilled receivables and investment securities. Credit risk is managed 
through continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants 
credit terms in the normal course of business.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date:

The Company does not expect any credit risk on the amount recoverable from related parties.
Trade receivables
The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of 
each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and 
country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit 
risk is managed through continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the 
Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Financial Assets are written off 
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from the customer.

Expected credit loss assessment:
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the 
Company to determine incurred and expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment 
of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given the critical nature of the 
services of the Company to its customers, the Company expects the historical trend of minimal 
credit losses to continue. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past 
due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and 
extensive analysis of customer credit risk. The impairment loss as at 30 June, 2024 relates to several 
customers that have defaulted on their payments to the Company and are not expected to be able 
to pay their outstanding balances, mainly due to economic circumstances.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during 
the year was as follows.

One customer accounted individually for more than 10% of the accounts receivable for the year 
ended 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: Three customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts 
receivable). One customer accounted individually for more than 10% of the unbilled receivable and

an ongoing basis and is considered to be good.

due but not impaired.
iii.	
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they 
become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will 
always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company’s reputation.
The Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets 
with a view to maintaining financial flexibility.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result 
from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange 
rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such 
adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive 
financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short term and long-
term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, 
interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company’s exposure to market 
risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating 
activities in foreign currencies.

Currency risk
The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the profit and loss 
account and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/
liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its 
operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The 
risks primarily relate to fluctuations in USD, SGD, GBP and Euro against the respective functional 
currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses forward contract derivative instruments 
primarily to hedge foreign exchange. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments 
for trading or speculative purposes.

Impairment testing of Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the single cash 
generating unit (CGU) to Accelya Solutions UK Limited.

generally calculated as the net present value of the projected cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash 
generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated.
The Company has reassessed the future prospects on account of change in business environment of the CGU 
during the year which has triggered the impairment for entire balance of goodwill amounting to ` 3361.05 lakhs.

The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management's assessment of future trends in the relevant 
industries and have been based on historical data from both external and internal sources.
The cash flow projections included specific estimates for five years developed using internal forecasts, and a 
terminal growth rate thereafter. The planning horizon reflects the assumptions for short-to-midterm market 
developments.
The average growth rate used in extrapolating cash flows beyond the planning period is nil.
Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to CGU. The discount rate is estimated 
based on the weighted average cost of capital for CGU. Discount rate used is 13.05%.
