towards greener options, such as 
onsite solar projects and the purchase 
of renewable energy through power

We are committed to implement effective waste management practices which aim to minimize environmental impact and 
promote sustainability. Additionally, our company has adopted a comprehensive strategy to reduce the usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in both our products and processes. We prioritize the responsible management of such wastes to ensure 
the safety of our employees, communities, and the environment.
	
The biological sludge hazardous waste Cat.35.3 generated from our ETP treatment facility undergoes a carefully designed 
process to ensure its proper management. Initially, the sludge drained from the ETP is collected in a dedicated sludge tank 
before being directed to the Thickner tank. From the Thickner tank, the supernatant water is recycled back into the ETP process, 
while the thick sludge at the bottom is fed into a Screw press. Within the Screw press, the sludge is efficiently separated into 
two parts. The water portion, extracted from the screw press, is once again recycled within the ETP system. The remaining 
sludge, consisting of approximately 15% to 20% solid content and 80% water content, is carefully directed to a sludge dryer. 
This specialized equipment facilitates the drying process, resulting in sludge powder with a moisture content of 8%. It is 
important to note that we strictly adhere to environmentally responsible practices and refrain from utilizing any hazardous or 
toxic chemicals throughout our processes. The dried sludge, meeting the necessary moisture criteria, is disposed of through 
an Authorized CHWTSDF (Centralized Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility). By implementing these 
meticulous procedures, we ensure the safe and sustainable management of our biological sludge hazardous waste, minimizing 
any potential negative impacts on the environment.
