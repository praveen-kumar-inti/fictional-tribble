Opportunity Venus recognizes and values the

it 
as 
a 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
organizational 
success. 
We 
are 
confident

produce favorable financial results 
while enhancing customer satisfaction, 
loyalty, and brand reputation. This 
strategic focus is poised to drive 
competitive 
advantage, 
facilitate 
market differentiation, and contribute 
to long-term profitability. 
Positive 
 
Risk 
Challenges in product innovation, 
quality 
management, 
and 
safety

Opportunity By prioritizing ethics and compliance, 
we 
establish 
a 
positive 
work 
environment that enhances employee 
loyalty and strengthens our ability to 
attract and retain top talent. A 
motivated and engaged workforce 
drives 
higher 
productivity 
and 
cultivates a cohesive corporate culture. 
Moreover, our steadfast commitment 
to ethical practices and regulatory 
compliance 
draws 
investors 
and 
nurtures 
a 
positive 
corporate 
atmosphere. 
This 
focus 
propels 
sustainable growth, sparks innovation, 
and secures a competitive advantage, 
all while ensuring enduring value for 
our stakeholders. 
Positive  
Risk 
Ethical lapses, breaches of integrity, 
and 
inadequate 
governance 
can 
severely 
undermine 
a 
company, 
resulting in reputational harm, legal

trust. Such failures threaten the

GHG emission Opportunity  In response to the growing awareness 
and concern about climate change 
among its stakeholders, including 
investors, customers, local 
communities, and employees, Venus 
recognizes this global challenge as a 
significant company risk. Accordingly, 
the company is proactively 
undertaking initiatives to transform 
this risk into a strategic opportunity. 
Venus has already established a solar 
power plant to reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions from its 
manufacturing operations.  
Additionally, the transition from 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to 
Piped Natural Gas (PNG) has further 
contributed to reduced GHG 
emissions. PNG, with its higher 
hydrogen-to-carbon ratio compared 
to LPG, results in lower carbon 
dioxide emissions per unit of energy 
produced, thereby positioning PNG as 
a cleaner burning fuel relative to LPG 
Positive 
Risk 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
present 
substantial 
environmental 
risks, contributing to climate change, 
extreme weather events, and resource 
scarcity. Failing to mitigate these 
emissions may lead to regulatory 
penalties, supply chain disruptions, 
and reputational damage, thereby 
exposing the company to potential 
financial 
losses 
and 
operational 
challenges 
Negative 
 
7 
Waste 
Management 
Opportunity  The company's steadfast dedication to 
sustainable development is deeply 
ingrained in its business strategy, with 
a primary focus on environmental 
protection through initiatives such as 
water and energy conservation, waste 
reduction, and eco-friendly disposal

methods. The company's strategic 
endeavors to curtail the use of 
hazardous and toxic chemicals are 
guided by a structured risk mitigation 
hierarchy that emphasizes 
elimination, reduction, and 
substitution. By deploying effective 
waste management strategies, the 
company unlocks opportunities for 
cost savings, resource recovery, and 
heightened environmental 
stewardship. Through the adoption of 
recycling, reuse, and waste reduction 
practices, the company aims to 
significantly minimize environmental 
impact, elevate operational efficiency, 
and reinforce brand reputation. 
Risk 
Ineffective 
waste 
management 
practices can lead to environmental 
pollution, regulatory non-compliance, 
and health risks for surrounding 
communities. 
Improper 
disposal 
methods may result in legal liabilities, 
fines, and reputational harm, while 
inefficient waste handling processes 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
inflate 
operational 
costs 
and 
exacerbate 
resource inefficiencies.

Supply Chain 
Management 
Risk 
The 
prevailing 
global 
climate, 
characterized 
by 
conflicts 
and 
instability has significantly disrupted 
supply chain systems. Supply chain 
disruptions, whether caused by natural 
disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or 
supplier 
failures, 
can 
result 
in 
inventory 
shortages, 
production 
delays, and revenue loss. Our strategic 
initiative aims to enhance our ability to 
manage uncertainties and provides us 
with a competitive advantage in the 
market by optimizing costs.

Employee 
Health and 
safety 
Risk 
Venus emphasizes on creating a safe 
work environment, aligning with its 
"Zero Harm Vision" that extends to 
life, environment, and property. 
Furthermore, there is a dedication to 
continuous improvement, aiming to 
enhance product quality and working 
conditions for employees. Neglecting 
employee health and safety can lead 
to workplace accidents, injuries, and 
legal liabilities, which can harm 
morale, reduce productivity, and 
damage the company's reputation. 
Negative 
10 
Human rights 
and labour 
standards 
Risk 
By establishing and maintaining safe 
and fair working conditions, we 
contribute to the creation of a more 
equitable society and a stable 
economy. However, failing to respect 
human rights and labor standards can 
lead to negative impacts on people 
and communities, including 
workplace injuries or illnesses and 
inadequate living standards for 
workers due to poor wages. 
Positive 
11 
Human 
resource 
management 
Opportunity Effective human resource 
management practices, encompassing 
the acquisition, development, and 
retention of talent, serve as the 
cornerstone in elevating employee 
engagement and amplifying 
productivity, thereby orchestrating 
the success of the organization. These 
judicious practices cultivate a positive 
work culture and bestow a 
competitive edge upon the enterprise

in fortifying brand reliability, thus

Corporate 
Governance 
Opportunity Addressing sustainability and 
governance provides a promising 
avenue to ascend the sustainability 
maturity model, yielding substantial 
cost savings and manifold advantages, 
all while necessitating conscientious 
corporate conduct. The Corporate 
Sustainability strategy, accompanied 
by an adept governance framework, 
permeates the entirety of the 
Company's business operations, 
distinguished by precise objectives 
and robust reporting mechanisms.. 
Positive 
Risk 
Deficient corporate governance 
practices, characterized by a paucity 
of transparency, accountability, and 
ethical standards, have the potential 
to engender conflicts of interest, 
regulatory infractions, and financial 
improprieties. Such shortcomings 
compromise investor trust and 
destabilize the company's 
foundational integrity 
Negative 
14 
Data privacy & 
cyber security 
Risk 
Cyber incidents, including data 
breaches, can adversely impact 
individuals' right to privacy and 
precipitate non-compliance with both 
local and international laws and 
regulations concerning data privacy 
and cybersecurity..

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling,

Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
The company operates within the specialized sector of stainless-steel tubes and pipes, with a strong 
focus on exporting its products globally. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, the company 
effectively enhances market dynamics. The majority of its products are crafted from steel or 
specialty steel, which are readily recyclable by local vendors and possess a high resale value at the 
end of their lifecycle. Although the company's use of recycled materials as process inputs is limited 
due to the nature of its business, it ensures that waste generated during the manufacturing process 
is responsibly recycled as follows: 
 
a) Plastic waste is sold to authorized recyclers. 
b) Other recyclable hazardous waste and electronic wastes are sold to registered recyclers. 
c) Additional saleable waste is sold to vendors. 
 
This conscientious approach underscores the company's commitment to sustainability and 
responsible waste management practices.

Yes, Venus Pipes and Tubes Ltd. is committed to regulatory compliance and as part of our 
environmental stewardship initiatives, we have initiated the registration procedure on EPR portal 
under the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2018 as brand owner. This action 
reflects our dedication to sustainable practices and positive contributions to environmental 
safeguarding. 
 
As Venus Pipes and Tubes Ltd. falls under the 'brand owner' category identified by the Plastic Waste 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines, we have calculated our EPR obligations in 
accordance with the 'Guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for Plastic Packaging.' This 
encompasses all aspects related to recycling, the use of recycled content, reuse, and the end-of-life 
disposal of plastic waste. We have established a comprehensive inventory mechanism to track the 
plastic waste generated from our operations. 
In our pursuit of responsible waste management, we have engaged authorized plastic waste 
recycling partner to ensure the efficient handling and processing of the plastic waste produced by 
our operations. Furthermore, as required, we intend to procure EPR certificates from the registered 
recycling agency to fulfill our compliance and environmental responsibility mandates effectively.

such wastes. 
Venus is steadfast in its commitment to sustainable waste management practices, ensuring both 
environmental sustainability and compliance with regulatory standards. The Company strategically 
focuses on minimizing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals by implementing a risk mitigation 
hierarchy, which encompasses elimination, reduction, and substitution on a case-by-case basis. 
 
Utilizing state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies, Venus is dedicated to optimizing operational 
efficiency and minimizing waste generation. In India, we rigorously manage hazardous wastes in 
accordance with the "Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016." This is achieved through authorization obtained from regulators and adherence to 
guidelines set forth by the respective State Pollution Control Boards. 
 
During FY 2024-25, the Company continued engaging in the co-processing of ETP sludge in 
collaboration with a GPCB-authorized third party, subsequently facilitating its sale to industries such 
as cement and infrastructure for use as an energy source, thereby reducing the volume of waste sent 
to landfill. 
 
In alignment with these regulations, Venus ensures that all waste streams are responsibly disposed 
of through authorized re-processors, enabling the recovery and reuse of valuable resources whenever 
feasible. Furthermore, the Company invests in training programs for employees and workers to 
promote waste minimization and effective handling practices, thereby fostering a culture of 
environmental responsibility and stewardship throughout the organization.
