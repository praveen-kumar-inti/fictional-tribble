Human 
Rights
Risk
We are committed to 
respecting human rights 
everywhere we operate and 
throughout our entire value 
chain.
Any deviation from Human 
Rights policy can lead to 
tx{z~ttzyzqŀyp~lyowprlw
actions. Being complicit in 
human rights risk violations 
could negatively impact 
APSEZ’s reputation and can 
also affect our ability to 
attract talent.
APSEZL human rights 
strategy for our business and 
suppliers is aligned with the 
United Nations (UN) Guiding 
Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and focuses on:
 
 Embedding human rights 
policies into our business
 
 Implementing 
due 
diligence 
processes 
to 
identify, prevent, mitigate, 
and account for human 
rights impacts due to our 
business operations and 
our supply chain.
 
 Providing remedial actions 
when needed
 
 Communicating 
transparently with our 
stakeholders about our 
processes and actions
Engaging constructively with 
employees, suppliers, local

Climate 
Change
Risk
Our port operations are 
impacted by any natural 
phenomenon like cyclone, 
heavy rains, wind etc. 
Thus, without considering 
the impact that climate 
change will have on port 
infrastructure we will be 
placing our fundamental 
business asset at risk.
We have set our road map to 
achieve Carbon Neutrality by 
2025 and achieve net zero 
emissions afterward.Our 
strategies for mitigating these 
climate-related risks include:
 
 Reduce energy intensity 
by 50% in 2025 from the 
level in 2016.
 
 Achieve 
fuel-switch 
s}zrs
pwpn}tŀnltzy
of 
equipment 
such 
as 
RTGs, MHCs, ITVs, and 
locomotives.
 
 With a target to have 100% 
renewable in electricity 
mix by 2025, we plan to 
install around 250 MW 
renewable capacity.
APSEZL has conducted a 
Climate Change Vulnerability 
Risk Assessment of the 
infrastructure related to 
port operations. A broad 
Adaptation Plan was 
developed to address the 
~trytŀnlynwtxlp}t~v~
through adaptation measures 
for each of the 4 most 
vulnerable ports.

Biodiversity 
and 
Land Use
Risk
We recognize that our 
operations are likely to 
cause adverse effects on 
the marine ecosystem and 
land utilization. Therefore, 
it is imperative that we 
take measures to mitigate 
the intensity and extent of 
these impacts. If we fail to 
address the risks associated 
with biodiversity and land 
use, it could harm our 
image, market position, and 
ŀylyntlwpwwëmptyré
APSEZL is committed towards 
protecting biodiversity in our 
operations with an aim to 
achieve overall Net Positive 
Impact (NPI) on biodiversity by 
2050.
APSEZL has prepared

 Hazardous waste is handled, segregated, stored, and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. Hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound

 
APSEZL has successfully accomplished its objective of establishing a single-use plastic-free port across 
nine of its sites as part of its commitment to the 5R's principle.
 
 Under the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL 73/78 convention, vessels that call at our port 
deliver their waste safely to our facility at a nominal charge, in alignment with the ‘polluter pays’ principle’.
 
 We continuously educate and train our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that 
they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices. In addition, we 
work with our customers to manage their waste through appropriate channels.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
We recognize that consultation with the stakeholders is a continuous process and is led by Leadership from 
the front through regular engagements at various platforms. We have a systematic stakeholder engagement 
process in place. We seek interactions to respond to trends, global environment, and market requirements. 
This approach enables us to proactively evaluate situations. We believe that stakeholders possess the ability to 
influence APSEZL’s decisions and in turn, be influenced by the actions of the company.
To guide our approach to stakeholder engagement, we have established Stakeholder Engagement Policy 
(Stakeholder 
engagement 
policy) 
https://origin-webapp.adaniports.com/-/media/Project/Ports/Investor/
corporate-governance/Policies/Stakeholder-Engagement-Policy.pdf. The appointment of respective stakeholder

to enable two-way engagement between the organization and stakeholders. There is continuous dialogue with 
the community stakeholders which is reviewed at Business Unit levels. Also, every two years through the third-
party engagement, impact, baseline and need assessment, feedback from the stakeholders is taken. In addition 
to this through regular engagements at various platforms there is continuous dialogue with the stakeholders 
and the same is also presented to the Board. Public consultations are part of the new project and expansion 
plans, where feedback and views of the stakeholders is considered for project design.
Board-level committee: Corporate Responsibility Committee and Stakeholder Relationship Committee is 
responsible for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on Sustainability Strategy and long-term 
goals & targets, also plays a key strategic role in all business decisions to ensure workplace safety, eliminating 
any potential damage to the environment, enhancing a commitment towards stakeholders, and maintaining 
Company’s reputation as one of leading Ports company.

7. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
APSEZL has zero tolerance towards discrimination, bullying, harassment and inappropriate or abusive conduct 
by its stakeholder groups. We have the following measures to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant 
in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
To keep an eye on any harassment and discrimination cases within our company, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee ensures a strategic alignment of sustainability and human rights with the business. The Risk 
Management Committee oversees the potential and actual risk pertaining to human rights at every stage 
of the project including merger and acquisition through human rights due diligence. Ultimate oversight for 
human rights resides with the Board of Directors, which are briefed on a quarterly basis by the ESG Head.

To make our stakeholders aware of relevant guidelines pertaining to human rights, we upload these on 
our Company website for easy access to all employees and stakeholders. Awareness and familiarization 
sessions for different sets of employee population are also conducted.

8. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
Yes, all the suppliers and vendors are required to adhere to APSEZ’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights 
guidelines which provides comprehensive guiding principles and embodies our commitment to internationally 
recognized standards, including UN Global Compact, the core conventions of the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) and United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and prevalent industry standards 
for our vendors and suppliers. APSEZL has zero tolerance towards violation of human rights and keeps a strict 
vigil on the policies and practices followed by the suppliers. Also, we try to enforce the best practices on human 
rights in our supply chain using the influence we have on our suppliers. Our expectation of respect for human 
rights from all our business partners is unambiguously conveyed at multiple levels of engagement. During the 
on-boarding process and later, the suppliers undergo third party audit of their operations for compliance with 
safe working condition requirements, avoidance of child and forced labour, environmental and social impacts, 
and human rights due diligence. The human rights aspects are also covered in-depth in our annual survey of 
the vendors and the training programs organized for them. In the survey, the suppliers are required to disclose 
their policy to avoid child labour, forced labour, workplace harassment, gender & ethnic discrimination and their 
human rights due diligence process. The suppliers are assessed on whether their policy is aligned with the 
requirements set by APSEZL for their suppliers and business partners.
Human right due diligence is carried out for mergers and before acquisitions which includes due diligence of 
country reputation in term of respecting human rights, ongoing controversy pertaining to human rights violation

9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
APSEZL, being in the service industry (i.e., provides services for cargo handling & logistic, operations & 
maintenance of port sector) does not produce any products using hazardous and toxic chemicals. As such, 
we don’t have potential to recycle generated waste in our operations. However, APSEZL complies with all the

been implemented in the handling and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at all operating 
port locations by focusing on 5R principles of waste management i.e., Reduce, Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and 
Recover. Essential measures we take towards effective waste management:
 
 We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and 
using it as manure.
 
 Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap are sent to recyclers.
 
 Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants for 
co-processing.
 
 STP sludge was used as soil conditioner/manure.
8. Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format

 
 APSEZL has successfully accomplished its objective of establishing a single-use plastic-free port across its 
sites as part of its commitment to the 5R’s principle.
 
 We continuously educate and train our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that 
they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices.

3. Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
The Company’s grievance reporting initiatives comprised a 24x7 grievance reporting mechanism through its 
website, dedicated telephone numbers and drop boxes at prominent locations. Several people across the 
company’s sites (supervisors, seniors, and department heads) can be reached directly for reporting grievances. 
The Company provides communities with a grievance reporting system (recorded, reviewed, escalated, and 
actioned upon within a timeframe). A Grievance Management System was implemented for the aggrieved to 
view status, resolution, and feedback. The Company is further in the process of developing and rolling out of an 
integrated Grievance Management System wherein all types of grievance will feed into one integrated system.
