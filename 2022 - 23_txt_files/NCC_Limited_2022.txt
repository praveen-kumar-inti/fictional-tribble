10. Health and safety management system
a. 
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, 
what is the coverage of such a system.
 
Yes, NCC Limited is certified to ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System standard and 
it covers all construction project sites and operations. Management systems have been put in place in compliance with ISO 
45001:2018 which is consistent with NCC’s vision, philosophy, and QEHS policy. The QEHS Management System outlines 
the necessary conditions for the organization’s methodical administration and execution.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity.
 
NCC Limited implemented a systematic risk management method to recognize and manage all risks in offices and building 
project sites.  The essential factor in reducing the risk of QEHS in business is the Company’s risk management strategy, 
which is implemented through five processes (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting).  Prior to 
beginning any work activity, risk assessments and safe work procedure statements are produced and approved with input 
from all relevant stakeholders, such as construction engineers, design and planning engineers, and QEHS team members. 
NCC LIMITED

identified risks and risk mitigation measures.

Yes, the company has procedures in place for employees to report hazards at work and safeguard themselves against such 
risks.

12.  Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
 
A project specific EHS plan is created at the start of every new project as part of the QEHS management system, and it 
establishes the general guidelines for QEHS Management. This EHS plan identifies the risky operations that fall under the 
purview of the work as well as the risk associated with those operations. It even specifies the required integrated preventive 
measures (Controls) to mitigate the same.
 
The Management provides strong demonstrable visible leadership and commitment towards QEHS through personal examples 
and actions. This is the first principle of the leadership commitment of NCC L.I.F.E. (Live Injury Free Each Day).  To promote and 
foster a constructive attitude towards EHS across NCC Projects and operations, management has taken part in EHS meetings 
and carried out site inspections and QEHS audits communicated.
 
This is further supported by the fact that there is a systematic risk management approach in place to locate and manage every 
risk in projects and units that calls for conformance certification. As a result, a procedure has been set up for performing internal 
QEHS audits.  This procedure requires that internal audits be organized for all ongoing projects, and the Head Office Audit Team 
must at least once every six months verify it.  Based on their status, relevance, and risk profile, specific projects were chosen for 
frequent audits.  In addition to any external audits performed by certified auditors, this was done.

15. Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / 
concerns arising from assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions.
 
The Company’s Safety Council reviews all accidents and incidents at every project and develops procedures based on risk 
analysis of information obtained from the relevant project sites. The measurement of occurrences and risky behavior, as well 
as predictive analysis, all make use of this data. This makes it possible to identify the main risk areas, which in turn directs the 
projects to actively manage and concentrate resources to avoid any mishaps or catastrophes. This analysis is disseminated 
among the team members in support of NCC Mission Zero’s accident objective.
 
In view of this collective approach, efforts have been made in understanding the Company’s high- risk profile holistically as well 
as in general. QEHS risk management culture has been inculcated across the Company. Various steps have been taken including: 
• 
Implementation of QEHS surveillance rating 
• 
Developed QEHS training modules on high-risk activities. 
• 
Developed standardized template of QEHS Lessons Learnt and these alerts are shared in the centralized knowledge sharing 
platform which can be accessed by all employees. 
• 
Enrolled Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into the QEHS management community of central knowledge sharing module. 
• 
Implementation of senior management audits based on standard checklist developed by the QEHS Council. 
 
The initiatives have succeeded in capturing the high-risk hazardous activities that are prevalent throughout many NCC Business 
verticals. This helps in the creation of an action plan to improve stakeholders’ capacity to manage such activities with a better 
level of awareness and appropriate training from qualified external agencies as well as subject matter experts. Every member of 
organization works hard to connect their behaviors and corporate choices with QEHS excellence in their specific roles.

The Company, based on all EHS analysis data gathered, has developed several procedures aligned to Sub-contractor procurement 
and management. The Health, Safety & Environment Management system has been reviewed and aligned to be a part of 
and fully incorporated into the contract between sub-contractor and the Company. Its purpose is to set forth the areas of 
EHS concerns and requirements routinely. This subcontractor system is intended to supplement any contractual requirements, 
including EHS Management System manual, guidelines, Standard Operating Procedures, any requirements of client, as well as 
sub-contractor’s own EHS programmes.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
 
NCC believes that every employee is a trustee of its stakeholders and must adhere to the Company’s Code of Conduct and 
conduct himself or herself at all times in a professional and ethical manner. 
 
The company has a “Whistle-blower Policy” which encourages stakeholders to bring to the Company’s attention, instances 
of unethical behaviour, discrimination, harassment, actual or suspected incidents of fraud or violation of the NCC Code of 
Conduct, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations, business performance and / or reputation. The Company 
investigates such reported incidents in an impartial manner and takes appropriate action to ensure that the requisite standards 
of professional and ethical conduct are always upheld.
 
The policy also mentions about non-retaliation against complainants stating “No employee who reports a violation shall suffer 
any harassment, retaliation, or adverse employment condition because of such reporting. Any employee who retaliates against 
a person reporting a violation will be subject to disciplinary proceedings, which may extend to termination of employment.”
