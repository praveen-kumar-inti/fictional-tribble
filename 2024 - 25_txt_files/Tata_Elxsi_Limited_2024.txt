Since 1989, Tata Elxsi has been at the forefront of engineering and design-led innovation, helping businesses 
reimagine their products, services, and customer experiences through a human-centred, digital-first lens. At Tata 
Elxsi, purposeful design is more than a differentiator – it is the Company’s response to an evolving world that 
demands innovation with intent and impact.
The Company’s theme – ‘Design Digital – Purpose Driven Experience’ captures this mindset, extending 
beyond products to the very way it builds a responsible and future-ready business. In a world facing pressing 
environmental, social, and economic challenges, the Company recognises that long-term value creation is only 
possible when sustainability is embedded into the core of strategy, operations, and culture.
Tata Elxsi’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report reflects this integrated approach – combining design, 
technology, and ESG stewardship to drive systemic change, build resilient value chains, and create a greener, more 
inclusive tomorrow.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and

Yes, Tata Elxsi has placed judicious use of water on its high priority requisites with regards to its environmental commitments. 
The organisation is into software development, owing to which, water treatment is limited to sewage water treatment, and the 
installation of an ETP (Effluent Treatment Plant) is not required. Efforts are being made by the Company to implement initiatives 
to have Zero Liquid Discharge. The Tata Elxsi-owned facilities have sewage treatment plants that are continuously monitored with 
standard operating procedures, treated water samples are tested, and the plant is manned 24/7. The treated water is fully consumed 
for gardening purposes. The leased facilities also have Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) wherein water is treated and reused for 
flushing purposes. At the headquarters (Hoody), ten water harvesting pits have been constructed to collect rooftop rainwater which 
is used to maintain the groundwater levels. Further, surface rainwater runoff is diverted to the harvesting pits to maximise water 
percolation.

The only identifiable source of air emissions is from diesel generator (DG) operations, which are infrequent and used only during power 
outages. As these emissions (excluding GHGs) are minimal and not material, they are not measured. All DG sets undergo regular pollution

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
	
Tata Elxsi has committed to reducing its carbon footprint to 50% of the benchmarked carbon footprint by 2025. This goal is taken 
up earnestly and targeted by opting to use green energy in many of the locations. Listed below are some of the major steps taken 
to achieve the objective. 
	
	
All the newly leased facilities are selected based on the criteria that the facility has provisions to supply green power
	
	
In the RN Development Centre, the Company has implemented measures to purchase green power directly from utility 
service providers by enacting an agreement
	
	
Invested in a rooftop solar project at the SBH facility in Pune to implement 120 kW of rooftop solar. This entails an overall 
capacity of 320 kW of rooftop solar, which is a 60% increase from the existing capacity
	
The organisation has targeted a 50% reduction in carbon footprint by 2025 and has taken multiple steps to achieve it by opting for 
green power in the PPA model at Hoody premises and mandating owners of leased facilities where the organisation has taken up 
space to opt for green power like what we have at BTP facility. Installation and commissioning of rooftop solar plants, optimised 
energy use by replacing old HVAC assets with high energy-efficient assets, migrating to LED light fittings across all facilities and 
imparting training to employees during induction for minimising energy use and separate training to outsourced staff to minimise 
energy use are some of the steps taken to reduce Green House Gas emission.
