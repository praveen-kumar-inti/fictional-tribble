1. 	
The entity shall report the total water withdrawn for any use, along-with a break-up of its source into the following:
	
¾
Surface water- refers to water that occurs naturally on the Earth’s surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, 
lakes, rivers, and streams
	
¾
Ground water – refers to water that is being held in, and that can be recovered from, an underground formation
	
¾
Third party water – refers to municipal water and other private suppliers of water
	
¾
Sea-water / desalinated water – refers to water in a sea or ocean
	
¾
Other sources - Entities may specify the other sources, in case the same are significant.
2. 	
The entity shall report the total water consumption. Total water consumption is a measure of water used by an organization, that it 
is no longer available for use by the ecosystem or local community, such as water that has been withdrawn and incorporated into 
products or has evaporated or is polluted to the point of being unusable by other users, and is therefore not released back to surface 
water, groundwater, seawater, or a third party. It also includes water that has been stored during the reporting period for use or 
discharge in a subsequent reporting period.
	
If the entity cannot directly measure its water consumption, it may calculate this using the following formula:
	
Total water consumption = Total water withdrawal – total water discharge.
3. 	
Water intensity per rupee of turnover shall be calculated as the total water consumed divided by the total turnover in rupees.

For each respective category of waste generated (plastic, e-waste, bio-medical waste, construction and demolition waste, battery 
waste, radio-active waste, other hazardous and other non-hazardous waste), the entity shall report the waste that is recovered 
through recycling, preparing for re-use or through other recovery operations. Guidance on these terms is given below:
•	
Waste may be recovered through any operation wherein products, components of products, or materials that have become 
waste are prepared to fulfill a purpose in place of new products, components, or materials that would otherwise have been 
used for that purpose. Preparation for re-use and recycling are examples of recovery operations.

Preparation for re-use means checking, cleaning, or repairing operations, by which products or components of products that 
have become waste are prepared to be put to use for the same purpose for which they were conceived.

company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such

Premier explosives have obtained Consent for Operation (CFO) for both our Peddakandukuru and Katepally units.
	
Peddakandukuru: CFO No. TSPCB/ZO/RCP/NLG/58/CFO/2021-1035, dated October 11, 2021, valid until October 31, 2026.
	
Katepally: CFO No. TGPCB/ZO/RCP/NLG/1069/CFO/2025-250525746734, dated March 1, 2025, valid until January 31, 2030.
	
Generally, the manufacturing process involves the assembly of hardware and the mixing of materials into a homogenous product, 
which typically does not generate any waste. Any residual explosives left over after the process are disposed of by burning with 
the necessary safety precautions at designated locations within our factory premises.
	
Liquid effluent generated during the Nitration process is collected, neutralized, and then either sent to a Common Effluent 
Treatment Facility (in the case of Peddakandukuru) or treated in a forced evaporation plant, with the condensed water collected 
and reused (in the case of Katepally). All raw materials used in our processes comply with customer requirements or are approved 
by the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization (PESO).
	
Regarding hazardous waste management, we generate two types: solid and liquid, these wastes are treated at the factory and 
transported to Telangana pollution control board authorised waste management facilities for further treatment and disposal as 
mentioned in the Consent for operation order.
	
For the disposal of solid hazardous waste, Premier Explosives has an agreement with the Hyderabad Waste Management Project 
in Dundigal, Medchal-Malkajgiri district. For liquid effluent, we have an agreement with the MANA Effluent Treatment Plant in 
Mallapur, Hyderabad.
	
As a manufacturer of explosives, we are unable to send any explosive-contaminated material or residual explosives to third 
parties due to their inherent explosive nature. Therefore, such materials are disposed of within our factory premises at designated 
locations, in accordance with the Explosive Rules 2008.
