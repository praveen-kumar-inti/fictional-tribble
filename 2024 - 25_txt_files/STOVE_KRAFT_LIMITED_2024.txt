1.
Energy
Management
Opportunity
The 
implementation 
of 
solar rooftop systems at the 
Bengaluru 
factory, 
which 
generates up to 50% of annual 
energy needs from renewable 
sources, 
showcases 
the 
Company's 
commitment 
to 
sustainable 
practices. 
This 
reduces 
reliance 
on 
non-renewable 
energy. 
Additionally, the transition to 
LED lighting across facilities 
enhances energy efficiency, 
resulting in lower electricity 
consumption and operational 
expenses. 
By 
conducting 
regular audits and monitoring 
energy usage, Stove Kraft 
identifies inefficiencies and 
continuously 
improves 
its 
processes. These measures 
help the company mitigate 
energy-related risks, reduce 
its carbon footprint, and align 
with 
global 
sustainability 
standards.
-
Positive
The financial implications 
of Stove Kraft's energy 
management 
initiatives 
are 
multifaceted. 
On 
one hand, the adoption 
of solar rooftop systems 
represents a significant 
capital investment aimed 
at reducing dependency 
on 
non-renewable 
energy 
sources. 
This 
expenditure, 
however, 
is offset by long-term 
cost 
savings 
from 
decreased 
electricity 
bills 
and 
improved 
energy 
efficiency. 
Transitioning 
to 
LED 
lighting and optimizing 
manufacturing processes 
further 
contribute 
to 
operational 
cost 
reductions. 
Regular 
audits and tracking of 
energy consumption help 
pinpoint 
inefficiencies, 
fostering 
continuous 
improvement that aligns 
with sustainability goals.
2.
Water and
Wastewater
management
Risk
Inadequate management of 
water and wastewater can 
interfere with manufacturing 
operations. 
Mishandling 
wastewater 
can 
lead 
to 
increased disposal costs and 
difficulties in complying with 
regulatory requirements.
Stove 
Kraft 
embraces 
sustainable 
water 
management 
through 
rainwater harvesting, water 
reuse, 
and 
regular 
risk 
assessments 
to 
combat 
water 
scarcity. 
Domestic 
water is treated with a 
Solar 
Photovoltaic 
(SPV) 
system for gardening, while 
manufacturing 
water 
is 
processed via an Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP) for 
cooling operations. A 500 
KL Sewage Treatment Plant 
(STP) is underway to recycle 
90% of water, minimizing 
fresh water usage. These 
efforts 
underscore 
the 
company's 
dedication 
to 
environmental sustainability 
and resource efficiency
Positive:
By implementing efficient 
water 
management 
practices, 
Stove 
Kraft 
has reduced operational 
costs 
associated 
with 
water consumption and 
wastewater 
treatment. 
Recycling and reusing 
of water has lowered 
expenses and minimized 
dependency on external 
water sources.
Additionally, 
adopting 
advanced 
wastewater 
treatment 
technologies 
has 
helped 
Stove 
Kraft 
to 
comply 
with 
environmental 
regulations, 
avoiding 
potential 
fines 
and 
penalties.

Human
Rights
Risk
Ignoring human rights within 
the Company or its supply 
chain can lead to labour 
exploitation, 
damage 
to 
the 
company’s 
reputation, 
and may provoke negative 
consumer 
reactions. 
This 
neglect may also result in legal 
consequences, harmful media 
coverage, and difficulties in 
attracting and retaining a 
diverse, skilled workforce.
Stove Kraft has put in place 
a human rights policy that 
reflects its commitment to 
safeguarding human rights 
and preventing violations. 
The company also provides 
training to employees to 
enhance 
their 
awareness 
of human rights issues and 
promote best practices.
Positive
By 
fostering 
ethical 
labour 
practices 
and 
ensuring safe working 
conditions, the company 
can enhance employee 
satisfaction 
and 
productivity, 
reducing 
turnover and associated 
recruitment costs.
Moreover, 
compliance 
with 
human 
rights 
standards minimizes the 
risk of legal penalties and 
operational disruptions, 
ensuring 
smooth 
business operations.

Health & 
Safety
Risk &
Opportunity

both 
opportunities 
and 
risks for Stove Kraft. On the 
opportunity side, prioritizing 
employee 
well-being 
boosts productivity, morale, 
and 
workplace 
culture. 
Compliance with standards 
can open new markets and 
partnerships, driving growth .
Risk: 
On 
the 
risk 
side, 
neglecting health and safety 
could 
lead

workplace 
accidents, legal penalties, and 
reputational damage, which 
can result in financial losses 
and operational disruptions.
Stove 
Kraft 
mitigates 
risks 
through 
robust 
health and safety policies, 
regular audits, and strict 
compliance with standards. 
Multi-stage inspections and 
random sampling uphold 
product 
quality, 
while 
non-conforming items are 
scrapped. Employee safety 
training, including induction 
programs 
and 
monthly 
sessions, ensures a safe and 
efficient workplace.
Positive
Investing in health and 
safety 
has 
significant 
financial 
benefits 
for 
Stove Kraft. By ensuring 
safe working conditions 
and 
providing 
regular 
training, the company 
reduces 
the 
risk 
of 
workplace 
accidents, 
which 
can 
lead 
to 
costly 
legal 
penalties, 
compensation 
claims, 
and 
operational 
disruptions. 
These 
measures also enhance 
employee 
morale 
and 
productivity,

rates 
and

Statement by director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business responsibility 
report, 
highlighting 
ESG
related 
challenges, 
targets 
and 
achievements
At Stove Kraft, we remain steadfast in our commitment to Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles as we continue to grow and innovate. However, this journey 
is not without its challenges. Addressing environmental sustainability while maintaining 
operational efficiency, meeting evolving compliance standards, and fostering inclusivity 
remain key hurdles. Minimizing resource consumption and creating a culture that prioritizes 
employee well-being and community engagement are focal areas in our strategy.
Despite these challenges, we are proud to share remarkable achievements over the past 
year. To enhance energy efficiency, traditional fans have been replaced with BLDC (Brushless 
Direct Current) motors, and we have shifted from hazardous PTFE-coated cookware to 
safe and health-conscious ceramic coatings. We have also transitioned from aluminium to 
reprocessed materials, promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact. We are 
also in the process of establishment of a 500 KL Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), which 
will recycle 90% of the water used in operations, significantly contributing to sustainability 
efforts. Additionally, sustainable water management practices like rainwater harvesting and 
recycling have enabled us to reduce water consumption, while energy-efficient manufacturing 
technologies have helped lower our carbon footprint.
On the social front, our regular training programs, employee safety initiatives, and 
community outreach projects reflect our commitment to creating a positive impact on lives. 
A strong focus on inclusivity is demonstrated by our Factory workforce composition, which 
has a female-to-male ratio of 3:1, showcasing excellent representation of women across the 
organization.
We also aim to further reduce waste, enhance the use of renewable energy, and promote 
diversity across our workforce. These targets are integral to building a sustainable future and 
delivering value to all our stakeholders.
At Stove Kraft, we firmly believe that sustainability is a continuous journey, not a destination. 
We are dedicated to improving our practices, embracing innovation, and aligning with global 
ESG goals to remain a responsible and forward-thinking organization.

*Our company has established various internal systems to provide employees with multiple channels to 
raise concerns or grievances. These include a Whistle Blower Policy and a POSH (Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment) Internal Committee, among others. Additionally, we have a walk-in system that enables 
employees to approach their line manager, plant head, or the highest authority, promoting transparency, 
open communication, feedback, and discussion. This fosters an environment where issues can be addressed 
swiftly and proactively. The system also ensures that employees can raise human rights concerns 
confidentially. Complaints are investigated by the designated focal point (Mrs. Saraswathi, Assistant 
Manager, HR & Welfare), and if necessary, the Human Resources Head is involved to take the appropriate 
remedial action.
Our Whistle Blower Policy aims to foster a culture where employees feel safe to report any significant 
deviations from key management policies, as well as non-compliance or misconduct, including unethical 
behaviour, fraud, legal violations, or inappropriate conduct. The policy ensures direct access to the Chairman, 
MD and, in exceptional cases, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, allowing employees to raise concerns 
without fear of retaliation.

and safety management system has 
been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of 
such system?
Yes, Stove Kraft has implemented an occupational health and safety 
management system.
	
At Stove Kraft we understand the critical importance of safeguarding 
the health and well-being of our employees and workers, particularly 
given the nature of our industry. To support this, we have put in place 
a comprehensive Health and Safety Policy, supported by effective 
processes. Additionally, the Company organizes regular workshops and 
training programs for workers, focusing on crucial areas such as safety, 
prevention of sexual harassment (POSH), and disaster preparedness. 
These initiatives are designed to raise awareness and nurture a culture of 
safety and well-being within the workplace.
b)
What are the processes used to 
identify work-related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
As part of Stove Kraft’s safety protocols, all work-related hazards 
associated with routine activities are thoroughly identified and assessed 
through regular inspections by the Plant Head, Safety Head, and periodic 
maintenance of machines by the maintenance team. In addition, daily 
safety checks are conducted by the maintenance team, along with safety 
talks for shift workers. This structured approach allows us to proactively 
identify potential hazards and assess the associated risks. Based on these 
assessments, appropriate control measures are implemented to mitigate 
or eliminate the identified hazards.

c)
Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work-related 
hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, At Stove Kraft, we have established robust procedures for reporting 
work-related hazards to supervisors, designated quality personnel, and the 
Safety Head. These procedures include both formal reporting channels, such 
as incident reports, and informal ones, such as verbal communication.
	
We understand the importance of providing multiple avenues for 
workers to report hazards, ensuring that all incidents large or small 
are communicated promptly and addressed appropriately. It is clearly 
communicated to all workers that if they notice any irregularities 
in machine operation or unsafe conditions, they must stop work 
immediately until the issue is verified and corrected by the line engineer 
or maintenance team.
	
Furthermore, we prioritize training to ensure our workers can effectively 
identify and report hazards in their work environment. Internal safety 
staff conduct regular training sessions to ensure our workers are well-
equipped with the knowledge to identify and report potential hazards.
	
Our commitment to safety extends beyond merely implementing 
reporting systems. In the event of an incident, the Quality and Safety 
Head takes immediate action to resolve the situation, and all employees 
are quickly informed about the incident, including its cause, reasons, and 
corrective actions taken. This ensures that all workers are fully aware of 
the incident and can take the necessary precautions to prevent similar 
incidents from occurring in the future.

services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, Stove Kraft employees and workers have access to non-occupational 
medical and healthcare services. These initiatives reflect the company’s 
commitment to employee well-being, ensuring access to medical care 
beyond workplace-related health needs
	
As part of our commitment to safety and wellness, we provide on-site 
access to medical consultation services for both occupational and non-
occupational health concerns. In addition, we conduct annual health 
check-ups for all employees and workers to proactively address any 
potential health issues, regardless of whether they are work-related. To 
further enhance the well-being of our workforce, we have secured third-
party and general insurance coverage. This comprehensive approach 
underscores our dedication to maintaining a healthy and secure work 
environment for all.

12.	 Measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace: 
	
Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Stove Kraft has implemented various measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace, employing a 
proactive approach to mitigate potential hazards. These measures include:
	
•	
Conducting regular safety rounds by Plant Head, Safety Officer, Admin Managers and periodical 
maintenance of machines by maintenance team enable the Company to identify risks and address 
potential hazards. This involves thorough inspections of the workplace to identify any potential risks, 
followed by appropriate measures to mitigate or eliminate them. Risk assessments are conducted to 
evaluate the severity and likelihood of hazards, enabling the development of effective control measures. 
We also undertook Safety Audit by third party (BNV SHECON) to ensure maximum safety points are 
checked, attended and corrected well in advance.
	
•	
Providing comprehensive safety training to workers and equipping them with appropriate personal 
protective equipment (PPE). This includes training on hazard identification, safe work practices, 
emergency response procedures, and proper use of PPE. Workers are provided with necessary safety 
equipment including hand gloves, earplugs, goggles, helmets, and masks, to protect them from 
workplace hazards. Each plant is equipped with an eye wash station to offer initial assistance to workers 
exposed to chemicals.
	
•	
The names and contact information of the emergency team, first aid team, and firefighting team 
are displayed at the entrance of each plant to ensure immediate access in case of any unforeseen 
contingency. This practice enables the individual to reach out to the right personnel in the event of any 
potential accident.
	
•	
We have implemented clear protocols for reporting and addressing work-related hazards, ensuring that 
any potential risks are promptly identified and resolved. Additionally, we have established mechanisms 
that allow workers to provide feedback and suggest improvements, fostering an open and collaborative 
environment focused on continuous safety enhancement.
	
•	
The Company offers on-site medical consultation services for both occupational and non-occupational 
health issues. Additionally, we conduct annual health check-ups for all employees and workers to 
proactively identify and address potential health concerns. We have partnered with Dayanand Sagar 
Hospital, Harohalli, which is located within 2 kilometres of our office, ensuring quick access to medical 
care. For more advanced treatments, employees are referred to Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospitals in 
Bangalore. These partnerships guarantee that employees and workers receive timely and effective 
treatment in emergency situations.

A) ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
1.	
Identification of stakeholders group: 
Describe the processes for 
identifying key stakeholder 
groups of the entity
At Stove Kraft, we have a systematic approach to identifying individuals or groups with a 
vested interest in the company’s products and activities. We follow a step-by-step process 
to identify the company’s stakeholders:
	
Determine the impact: Determine the impact that the product has on different groups 
of people, including customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders considering 
both the positive and negative impacts of the product.
	
Identify internal stakeholders: Identify internal stakeholders, such as employees, 
managers, and shareholders, who have a direct interest in the success of the product. 
This may include individuals who are involved in the design, development, production, 
marketing, and sale of the products.
	
Identify external stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, regulators, and the local 
community, who have an indirect interest in the product. These stakeholders may be 
affected by the product in various ways, such as through employment opportunities, 
environmental impact, or regulatory compliance.
	
Prioritize stakeholders: Prioritize the stakeholders based on their level of interest and 
influence. Prioritizing stakeholders will help the company to focus its efforts on those 
stakeholders who are most critical to the success of the product.
	
Engage with stakeholders: Once stakeholders have been identified and prioritized, the 
company engages with them to understand their needs, concerns, and expectations. 
This may involve conducting surveys, hosting focus groups, or meeting with stakeholders 
individually.
	
Monitor stakeholder feedback: Once the company has engaged with stakeholders, it 
monitors their feedback to ensure that it is meeting their needs and expectations. This 
feedback can be used to inform future product development and marketing efforts.
