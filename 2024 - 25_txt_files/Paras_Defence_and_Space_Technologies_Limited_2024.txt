Climate 
Change   
Risk
Climate change poses risks to Paras Defence, 
impacting operations, supply chains, and financial 
stability.  Furthermore, escalating operational costs 
and evolving geopolitical conditions may compel the 
company to invest heavily in innovation and adaptive 
strategies
We evaluated the climate 
change risk exposure of 
all our operational sites 
and developed a plan to 
mitigate 
the 
potential 
impacts. The Company 
ensures 
that 
energy-
efficient 
equipment 
is 
installed 
across 
its 
manufacturing units. The 
maintenance team is in 
charge of overseeing this 
and considerations such 
as energy ratings are taken 
into account during the 
procurement process.

Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
We have a highly experienced management team, with 
our promoters having over three decades of expertise 
in the design, development and manufacturing of a 
wide range of engineering products for the defence 
and space sectors. This extensive experience has 
allowed us to establish strong, long-term relationships 
with customers and suppliers. The company has also 
assembled a skilled management and execution 
team, including many former employees from BEL and 
DRDO, further strengthening its industry capabilities.
-
Positive

Employee 
Satisfaction 
and Wellness
Opportunity
Focusing on employee satisfaction and wellness 
offers significant opportunities, including enhanced 
productivity, innovation and operational resilience. 
Prioritizing employee well-being also aids in attracting 
and retaining top talent, reduces turnover, and 
strengthens the company’s reputation as a responsible 
employer. Additionally, wellness initiatives can lower 
healthcare costs, reduce absenteeism, and improve 
stress management, all contributing to better financial 
performance and sustainable growth.

Environment 
footprint – 
Waste and 
Emissions
Opportunity 
and Risk
Proactively managing environmental impact can lead 
to enhanced regulatory compliance, cost savings and 
improved reputation, positioning the company as a 
sustainability leader. This focus can also drive innovation, 
opening new market opportunities and future-proofing 
the business. However, failure to effectively manage 
these metrics could result in regulatory penalties, 
increased operational costs, reputational damage, and 
potential competitive disadvantages, making it crucial 
for us to balance these factors.
The company has a proven 
waste 
management 
practice in place that 
makes sure that proper 
waste removal as per the 
waste category defined 
by the MPCB and State 
Pollution Control Board(s) 
is carried out.

Initiatives like ‘Make in India’, ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ 
and rising defence budgets are accelerating demand

materials but add substantial value through domestic
