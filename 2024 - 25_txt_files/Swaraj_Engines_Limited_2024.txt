orientation. The atmosphere encourages learning and informal communication.
The Company is having Performance Management System (PMS) to objectively measure the performance of the individual

To further increase the competency level of the employees, systematic and structured training is provided at different levels.
Such trainings cover aspects related to leadership development, communication effectiveness and team building etc. This has
made a significant contribution to the Company's business.
Industrial relations remained cordial throughout the year under review.
Permanent employee strength (excluding apprentice) as on 31st March, 2025 stood at 289 (31st March, 2024 - 297).
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS
Since Company's principal business is selling diesel engines for tractors manufactured by M&M-Swaraj Division, it would be
appropriate to take note of developments in the tractor industry.
The Indian tractor industry is characterized by a well-organized structure dominated by few key domestic players alongside the
presence of international companies. Catering to the diverse needs of Indian farmers, the industry offers a wide range of
tractors from low-horsepower models suitable for small farms to high-horsepower variants designed for large-scale mechanized
farming. The sector has witnessed significant developments, including an increase in farm mechanization, driven by rising rural
incomes, growing awareness among farmers, and government support through subsidies and financing schemes. Advancements
in technology are reshaping the industry, with innovations such as GPS-enabled systems, IoT-connected tractors etc. gradually
gaining traction. Despite challenges such as dependence on monsoons and fluctuating input costs, the Indian tractor industry
continues to evolve as a critical contributor to agricultural modernization, rural development, and overall economic growth.
The domestic tractor industry for FY25 at 9,39,700 units registered a growth of 7.3% over last year's 8,75,700 units.

OUTLOOK AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Indian tractor industry medium term outlook remains robust, driven by strong demand for agricultural mechanization and
supportive government initiatives. As the world's largest tractor market, India is expected to benefit from rising rural incomes,
expected favourable monsoons, and increased allocation to rural infrastructure projects such as irrigation and roads. Farmers
are likely to show a growing preference for Medium & higher horsepower tractors to cater to larger landholdings and modern
farming techniques, while compact tractors may gain traction in horticulture and niche applications. Advancements in technology,
including GPS-enabled and IoT-integrated systems, are set to transform the industry. While dependence on monsoons and
rising input costs may pose some challenges, government subsidies, financing schemes, and sustainable farming practices
will continue to drive growth, positioning the Indian tractor industry as a key contributor to the nation's agricultural development.
As the tractor industry expected to grow in medium to long term, the engine business of the company is also likely to move in
tandem with the industry.
THREATS, RISKS & CONCERNS
As a supplier to M&M, your Company would be directly affected by factors impacting tractor industry. These would include
issues like the rain-dependent nature of our agriculture, Government policy on procurement, credit availability, commodity price
trends, new regulations for tractors etc.

ANNEXURE – A TO DIRECTORS' REPORT
Dividend Distribution Policy
The Dividend Distribution Policy ("the policy") establishes the principles to ascertain amounts that can be distributed to equity
shareholders as dividend by the Company as well as enable the Company strike balance between pay-out and retained
earnings, in order to address future needs of the Company. The policy shall come into force for accounting periods beginning
from 1st April, 2021.
Dividend would continue to be declared on per share basis on the Ordinary Equity Shares of the Company having face value
Rs.10 each. The Company currently has no other class of shares. Therefore, dividend declared will be distributed amongst all
shareholders, based on their shareholding on the record date.
Dividends will generally be recommended by the Board once a year, after the announcement of the full year results and before
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the shareholders, as may be permitted by the Companies Act. The Board may also
declare interim dividends as may be permitted by the Companies Act.
The Company has had a consistent dividend policy that balances the objective of appropriately rewarding shareholders through
dividends and to support the future growth.
As in the past, subject to the provisions of the applicable law, the Company's dividend payout will be determined based on
available financial resources, investment requirements and taking into account optimal shareholder return. Within these parameters,
the Company would endeavor to maintain a total dividend pay-out ratio in the range of 65% to 90% of the annual Profit after Tax
(PAT) of the Company.
While determining the nature and quantum of the dividend payout, including amending the suggested payout range as above,
the Board would take into account the following factors:
•
Internal Factors:
i.

b.

ii.

v.
Related Industry outlook for the future years,

vii.

Apart from the above, the Board also considers past dividend history and sense of shareholders' expectations while determining
the rate of dividend. The Board may additionally recommend special dividend in special circumstances.
The Board may consider not declaring dividend or may recommend a lower payout for a given financial year, after analyzing the
prospective opportunities and threats or in the event of challenging circumstances such as regulatory and financial environment.
In such event, the Board will provide rationale in the Annual Report.
The retained earnings of the Company may be used in any of the following ways:

Investment in new business(es) and/or additional investment in existing business(es),

Revenue Recognition
The Company's revenue recognition policy is aligned to the principles enunciated in Ind AS 115. The company recognises
revenue from contracts with customers when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or
service to a customer.  Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction
price allocated to the performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of
variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part of the contract, if
any.
Transaction price is the amount of a consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for
transferring good or service to a customer. Payment terms agreed with a customer are as per business practice and
there is no financing component involved in the transaction price.
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the control of the same is transferred to the customer and it is probable
that the Company will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange of goods.
Rendering of services
Revenue from rendering services is recognised when performance obligation is satisfied and customer obtains the
control of the transferred services. Following criteria is required to be met for transfer of control of services:
i)
the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services transferred.
ii)
the Company has an enforceable right to payment for services transferred.

Interest income is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of
income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the deposits and at the
interest rate settled with the Banks/Financial Institutions.
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
119
1.10 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on Straight line method, so as to reflect the pattern in which the
assets economic benefits are consumed.
Intangible Asset under Development
The expenses incurred on development phase are initially recognized as Intangible assets under development until the
development phase is complete, upon which the amount is capitalized as intangible asset.
Other Intangible Assets
i)
 Development expenditure:
Development expenditure incurred on technical services and other project/product related expenses are amortized
over the estimated period of benefit, not exceeding five years. Amortization commences as and when the asset is
available for use.
ii)
 Software Expenditure:
The expenditure incurred is amortised over three financial years equally commencing from the year in which the
expenditure is incurred.
1.11 Taxes on Income
Current tax is determined as the amount of tax payable in respect of the taxable income for the year.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
1.12 Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are
adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets carried at amortised cost (AC)
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset
in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. For financial assets
maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts are approximate to fair value due to the
short maturity of these instruments. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured
at transaction price.
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
120
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial liabilities are recognized at fair value.
Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. For trade and other payables
maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short
maturity of these instruments.
Derecognition of financial instruments
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability
(or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the
contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
1.13  Impairment of Assets
The carrying value of assets at each balance sheet date are reviewed for Impairment. If any indication exists, the
recoverable amount of such assets is estimated and impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of these assets
exceeds their recoverable amount.
1.14  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
In respect of warranty on sale of engines, the estimated cost of warranty is accrued at the time of sale. The estimate for
accounting of warranty is periodically reviewed and revisions are made as and when required.
1.15 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying
disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Depreciation / amortisation and useful lives of property plant and equipment/ intangible assets:
Property, plant and equipment / intangible assets are depreciated / amortised over their estimated useful lives, after
taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values of the
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
121
assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation / amortisation to be recorded during any reporting
period. The useful lives and residual values are based on the Company's historical experience with similar assets and
take into account anticipated technological changes. The depreciation / amortisation for future periods is revised if there
are significant changes from previous estimates.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements
were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to
market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the
assumptions when they occur.
Provision for product warranty
The Company recognizes provision for product warranties in respect of its products that it sells. Provisions are discounted,
where necessary to its present value based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet
date. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjust to reflect the current best estimates.
1.16 Earnings per share
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average
number of equity and dilutive equity equivalent shares outstanding during the year.
1.17 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits with any qualifying financial institution repayable on
demand or maturing within three months from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of
change in value.
1.18 Leases
The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS116. The Company
uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate
which is generally based on the interest rate specific to the lease being evaluated or if that cannot be easily determined
the incremental borrowing rate for similar term is used.
The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as per expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
The Company as a lessee
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease
payment made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and restoration cost, less any
lease incentives received.
The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a
straight-line basis. In addition, the right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments.
1.19 Accounting Policies not specifically referred above are consistent with generally accepted Accounting practices.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Members of Swaraj Engines Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of Swaraj Engines Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the Statement
of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of material accounting policies
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the Financial Statements").
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Financial
Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended ("Ind AS") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India,
of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025, its profit and total comprehensive income, its changes in equity
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section
143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditors' Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("the ICAI") together with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that
the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Financial
Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial
Statements for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the
matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report:
Key Audit Matters on Related Party Transactions
Key Audit Matter
As a part of the business activity, the Company deals with entities which are related parties and
significant revenue sources are from related parties only.
The arm's length pricing of the transactions with Related Parties, risks of material misstatement
associated with related party relationships and transactions may have a significant impact on the
interest of the Company, and true and fair presentation of related party relationships and transactions
in the financial statements of the Company.
Principal Audit
We performed the following audit procedures relating to related party relationships and transactions.
Procedures
We inquired of management regarding:
•
The identity of the Company's related parties, including changes from the prior period;
•
The nature of the relationships between the Company and related parties; and the type and
purpose of the transactions with related parties;
•
Identify, account for, and disclose related party relationships and transactions in accordance
with the applicable financial reporting framework;
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
150
•
Confirmations obtained from related parties for an outstanding balances as part of our audit
procedures;
•
Performed appropriate substantive audit procedures relating to identified related parties and
related party transactions;
•
Evaluate the terms of the related party transactions that these are consistent with management's
explanations;
•
Ensured that all Related Party Transactions are placed before the Audit Committee for approval.
Prior omnibus approval of the Audit Committee is obtained for the transactions which are
repetitive in nature; and
•
Inquired that the Company has adopted a Related Party Transactions Policy approved by the
Board and transactions are as per the policy.
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report thereon
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board's Report, and the related annexures but does not include the
financial statements and our Auditors' Report thereon.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including
other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles
generally accepted in India.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
151
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout
the audit.
We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal controls.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on
whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such
controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by the management.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt
on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance
in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore, the key audit matters. We describe these matters
in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements under Clause (i) of sub-section (3) of
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Swaraj Engines Limited ("the Company")
as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business including adherence to the
Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of
the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting ("the Guidance Note") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the
Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial
controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements
was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system
with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Company's internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to financial
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
SWARAJ  ENGINES  LIMITED
155
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material
respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and such internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal
financial control with reference to financial statements established by the Company considering the essential components of
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
