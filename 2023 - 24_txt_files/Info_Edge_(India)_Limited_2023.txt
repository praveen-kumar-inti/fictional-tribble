Social: Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity
Despite the high turnover rate in 
the internet software & service 
sector, the potential to enhance 
productivity, 
innovation, 
and 
operational efficiency through 
investment in employee training 
and 
development 
remains 
significant. 
This 
approach 
allows the sector to address 
skill 
gaps, 
reduce 
turnover 
costs, and cultivate a more 
skilled and engaged workforce. 
It is important to manage the 
talent pool, foster employee 
engagement 
and 
ensure 
employee retention.
Info Edge promotes employee 
well-being 
through 
mental 
health 
apps, 
health 
camps, 
training sessions, and benefits 
like medical insurance, creche 
facilities, and parental leave. We 
also invest in upskilling programs 
and foster an inclusive workplace 
to encourage innovation and a 
safe working environment. We 
have put in place employee-
friendly work policies to provide 
an 
inclusive 
workplace 
that 
promotes innovation and fosters 
development of original ideas.
Positive:
-	
A 
healthy 
work 
environment 
positively 
impacts 
the 
physical 
and 
mental 
health 
of 
employees, 
increasing 
productivity. This in turn 
affects 
the 
Company’s 
ability 
to 
cater 
to 
customer 
requirements 
and grow revenues.
-	
Reduced 
employee 
turnover costs.
-	
Enhanced 
employer 
reputation.
Risk
Negative:
-	
High 
cost 
of 
talent 
acquisition and training, 
which 
may

business 
in 
terms 
of 
growth in revenue and 
innovation.
-	
Reputational damage.

is 
essential for any business's 
success, as it drives brand 
loyalty, repeat business, and

technology 
implementation
Opportunity
Data center operations and 
office facilities in the sector 
are energy-intensive, leading to 
high energy consumption and 
associated costs. Investment 
in energy-efficient technologies 
and renewable energy sources 
can lead to reduced energy 
costs & operational efficiencies.
The Company is committed to 
reduction and optimal utilization 
of 
energy 
using 
automated 
energy 
monitoring 
solution 
named 
as 
‘Zenatix’, 
energy 
efficient 
illumination 
fixtures, 
power 
factor 
rationalization 
and addition of VFDs in the 
HVAC system. The Company's 
dedication 
to 
clean 
tech 
investment is exemplified by 
the successful installation and 
commissioning of 50 kW & 100 
kW rooftop solar power plant.

At Info Edge, we are a mission-driven company committed to building a mindful, righteous, and

effectively integrating both human and technological aspects across our operations. As a market 
leader in the verticals of matrimony, recruitment, real estate, and education, our strategy is built

towards achieving our sustainability objectives this year.
In FY24, the Company conducted a comprehensive gap assessment followed by an ESG materiality

gaps and devise a roadmap to achieve the objectives set. The Company has invested in technology 
to empower people in all areas of life and are leveraging game-changing breakthroughs to further our 
goals of long-term growth while ensuring inclusive development for all. The Company is cognizant 
of its environmental impact and took steps to address it by focusing on energy efficiency, water 
stewardship, ramping up solar energy consumption, and implementing efficient waste management 
practices. Employees are the most important facet of the business, and the Company has taken 
concerted efforts to ensure their continuous training and development, prioritize their health and 
safety, and implement comprehensive employee engagement initiatives. Furthermore, the Company 
places great emphasis on delivering exceptional customer service, incorporating customer feedback 
into our service offerings, and exploring measures to enhance the sustainability of our supply chain. 
Under our Board’s supervision and direction, the Company expects to significantly increase its ESG

for all Employees and Directors to uphold their ethical responsibilities while performing their duties and prevent potential 
or actual conflicts of interest. This policy applies to the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, associates and business 
partners and all internal and external stakeholders are expected to operate within its framework. We maintain a zero-tolerance 
approach towards bribery and corruption, which is consistently demonstrated in our daily conduct. For example, we strictly 
prohibit employees from accepting gifts and require them to surrender any such gifts to the HR department in line with the 
Company’s Gift Policy.
We also ensure that vendors and contractors comply with ethical standards through specific clauses included in their work 
contracts. These contractual provisions cover anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery measures, confidentiality, and other relevant 
aspects. ABAC policy is available on the website of the Company at https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/anti-bribery-and-anti-

2.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) If 
yes, provide details of the same.
Yes, the Company prioritizes the establishment of a positive and ethical work environment through its Conflict of Interest 
clause within the Code of Ethics & Conduct. With a commitment to integrity and business sustainability, we recognize the 
significance of avoiding conflicts of interest while respecting the rights and choices of our employees. The Code of Ethics 
& Conduct applies to all employees, the Board of Directors, wholly-owned subsidiaries, contractors, service providers and 
other business partners. It provides detailed guidance on identifying and addressing various conflict of interest scenarios, 
emphasizes disclosure methods and outlines the consequences of non-compliance. The Code of Ethics & Conduct is available 
on the website of the Company at www.infoedge.in/pdfs/code-of-ethics.pdf
Additionally, the Company has implemented a policy titled ‘Policy for Personal Investments and Engagement by Executive 
leadership with Other Entities.’ This policy regulates external commitments of full-time Directors and executive leadership, 
setting limitations and defining an approval process for employee engagement and investment for employees in executive 
positions, including Whole-time Directors.
The aforesaid policy most importantly ensures that the focus on core business of the Company is maintained and there is no 
conflict of interest between the obligations of Executive Leaders towards the Company and other engagements. A copy of the 
said policy is uploaded on the website of the Company at https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/Policy_for_Personal_Investments_
and_Engagment_by_Executive_Leadership_with_other_Entities.pdf 
Furthermore, the Company has developed a comprehensive Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor, and Report Trading 
by Insiders. This code aims to prevent insider trading among the management and staff by establishing clear guidelines, 
monitoring procedures, and reporting mechanisms. A copy of the said Code is uploaded on the website of the Company at

Note: The Company views technology, including artificial intelligence, as a potent driver for advancing sustainability. Given 
the nature of its services, it has directed the R&D and capital expenditures towards improving its Information Technology 
efficiencies. Over the previous years, the Company has made substantial investments to bolster our capital assets, 
particularly in upgrading its IT infrastructure including software, communication networks, and equipment to enhance our 
digital capabilities, leveraging artificial intelligence where applicable. Furthermore, the Company is actively implementing 
measures to promote environmental sustainability across its operations.
2.	
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Since the Company is a service entity and being an internet company, we are relatively less resource intensive in terms of 
material inputs. However, as a responsible corporate citizen, we have formulated a policy on ‘Sustainable Supply Chain’ that 
has procedures in place to ensure that the procurement of products and services occurs in a sustainable and safe manner. 
The Company has also endeavored to reduce the environmental impact of its operations by tracking the consumption of 
resources critically. As part of the Company’s operations, a small amount of e-waste is generated by the Company which is 
dealt with as per the statutory norms governing the handling and management of such waste. Link to the policy: https://www.
infoedge.in/pdfs/sustainable-supply-chain-policy.pdf 
	
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
While the Company has not captured data for sustainably sourced inputs in the current financial year, we plan to put in place 
mechanisms for measurement from the next year onwards.

Plastics (including packaging)
Given the service-centric nature of the Company's operations, the reliance on material 
resources is relatively low, rendering product recycling not relevant to the organization's 
activities. The waste generation at the Company's office facilities remains minimal. However, 
the company has established robust procedures to ensure the proper disposal of e-waste 
through authorized vendor channels. Furthermore, the Company engages third-party agencies, 
duly authorized by the district authority, to manage the collection and disposal of other waste 
streams, such as wastepaper and paper products, in a responsible manner.

provide steps taken to address the same.
Given the service-oriented nature of the Company’s business operations, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not 
applicable. As the Company does not engage in the manufacturing of any physical products, the requirement to submit an 
EPR plan to Pollution Control Boards does not pertain to the Organization’s activities.

The Company’s business model is focused on the provision of services, which inherently do not generate physical products

Sustainability Report

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
As the Company’s regular business operations have minimal direct interactions with surrounding communities, the issue of 
mechanisms to receive and redress grievances is not directly applicable to its core activities.
However, through the Company’s dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, it actively enages with and 
provides support to the communities it serves. The Company’s CSR programs aim to positively impact the lives of individuals 
within these communities by addressing their fundamental needs, such as healthcare, nutrition, hygiene, and education. By 
focusing on these critical areas, our organization strives to make a meaningful contribution to the overall well-being and 
development of the communities where its CSR projects are implemented.
The Company has a formal grievance redressal mechanism for its stakeholders and the CSR efforts involve close collaboration 
and communication with the communities to understand their needs and priorities. This approach helps ensure that the CSR 
initiatives are aligned with the communities’ well-being and development goals.
