Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
Yes, TPML has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism at its Phoenix Palladium Mall in Lower Parel. This is 
achieved through the installation of a state-of-the-art Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with a capacity to recycle approximately 
680 cubic meters of water per day. The STP enables the mall to operate as a Zero Liquid Discharge facility by ensuring that no 
wastewater is released into the environment.
	
The recycled water is efficiently utilized for various purposes, including flushing, landscaping, gardening, and cooling tower 
operations. During FY24-25, the plant successfully recycled and reused approximately 132860 kilolitres of water within the 
mall, significantly reducing the mall’s freshwater consumption and contributing to sustainable water management practices.
	
This initiative reflects TPML’s commitment to environmental stewardship and resource conservation, ensuring that its operations 
align with best practices in sustainability.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such waste.
	
At TPML, we are committed to implementing comprehensive waste management practices that prioritize environmental 
sustainability and the reduction of hazardous and toxic chemical usage.
	
Waste Management Practices:
1.	
Hazardous Waste:
	
TPML has established partnerships with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board 
(MPCB) certified agencies to ensure the safe and proper disposal of hazardous waste. This collaboration guarantees 
that hazardous materials are managed in compliance with stringent environmental regulations, minimizing any potential 
impact on the environment.
2.	
Non-Hazardous Waste:
	
TPML employs a systematic approach to the segregation of non-hazardous waste into dry and wet categories. We have 
partnered with third-party vendors who specialize in recycling dry waste, ensuring that these materials are processed and 
repurposed efficiently. For wet waste, TPML utilizes on-site Organic Waste Converter Units with a recycling capacity of up 
to 1.5 tonnes per day. This process converts wet waste into nutrient-rich manure, which is then used for landscaping and 
gardening purposes within our facilities.
	
Reduction of Hazardous and Toxic Chemical Usage:
	
TPML is also focused on minimizing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in its operations. The company adopts 
environmentally friendly alternatives wherever possible, striving to reduce chemical dependency across its processes. This 
strategy not only helps in reducing the generation of hazardous waste but also contributes to a safer and healthier work 
environment. TPML continuously evaluates and updates its processes to incorporate more sustainable practices, aligning with 
global best practices in environmental stewardship.
	
Through these initiatives, TPML demonstrates its commitment to responsible waste management and the reduction of 
environmental impact, reinforcing its role as a leader in sustainability within the industry.
