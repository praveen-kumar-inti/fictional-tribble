Financial

Opportunity Non-Banking 
Financial 
Companies 
(NBFCs) 
have 
been 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
financial 
inclusion in the Country, 
lending to underserved 
segment such as small 
business 
and 
rural 
households. 
NBFCs 
played 
an 
important 
role in deepening access 
to formal credit and 
promoting 
inclusive 
growth. 
NBFCs 
have 
reached out to rural, 
semi-urban and metro 
areas, 
where 
access 
to formal credit is often 
limited. 
The expertise that NBFCs 
provide is underwriting 
risk with the nuanced 
ability to assess income 
and 
repayment 
capability over the tenor 
of the loan. Furthermore, 
NBFCs address the gap 
between 
the 
Banks 
and 
the 
consumers 
by 
offering 
low-ticket 
loan amounts tailored 
product 
with 
less 
paperwork to suit the 
relevant needs of the 
customer.

Without

sector 
of 
Non-Banking 
Finance 
Companies 
cannot 
survive 
in

Hence, 
customer satisfaction is 
essential for NBFCs. An 
unsatisfactory Customer 
experience may pose a 
risk to business continuity, 
while a positive customer 
experience can ensure 
enhanced 
profits 
and 
brand reputation.
To mitigate this kind of 
risk, we at Paisalo has 
mechanism 
to 
collect 
feedback 
from 
the 
Customers 
about
