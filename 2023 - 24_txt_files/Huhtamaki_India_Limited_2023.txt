constantly seeking ways to enhance our policies and procedures in order to attain world-class performance in these 
areas. To ensure that our sustainability work focuses on the most important issues, we constantly monitor the most 
recent developments and trends in sustainability and the changes in regulations and feedback from stakeholders. We also 
update our materiality assessment on a regular basis. In 2023, we globally refreshed our double materiality assessment 
and the same would be published in next year’s Global report. The following materiality assessment describes the risk and 
opportunity matrix from a more India-specific point of view, basis the assessment done in FY2023.

1
Product 
safety
Risk
Since our primary customers 
are from the pharmaceutical 
and FMCG sectors, packaging 
material plays a critical role in 
maintaining the composition 
of medicines and food quality, 
shelf life, and safety during 
shipment, and any critical 
shortcoming in product safety 
or quality could negatively 
impact our Company’s 
reputation, resulting in an 
impact on sales.
We employ stringent quality 
control methods in all of our 
production activities, as well 
as formal testing processes 
for new products and 
materials. Quality and hygiene 
management systems, such 
as ISO 9001 and BRCGS, 
provide a strong foundation 
for ensuring consistency in 
product safety.
We primarily offer our packaging 
solutions to B2B clients, where any 
decline in sales owing to a loss of 
reputation can result in significant 
revenue losses as the business 
coming from them is mostly bulk 
and recurring purchases. Also, any 
additional expenses to replace and 
resolve client complaints will be 
borne by us.
2
Materials 
management
Risk and 
opportunity
Material management is 
an important aspect of the 
packaging industry since it 
can lead to a high chance 
of product damage during 
shipping and distribution, 
resulting in significant 
financial and reputation loss. 
Furthermore, if proper packing 
material is not used, it might 
result in the accumulation 
of hazardous waste in the 
environment.
As part of our innovation 
process, we are focused 
on sustainable packaging 
solutions to meet 
socioeconomic demands.
The right packaging solution not 
only extends the shelf life of the 
products and keeps them safe 
for consumption but also helps 
to develop the brand image of 
our Company and reduce the 
environmental impact.
3
Energy
Risk and 
opportunity
Improving energy efficiency 
throughout our activities is a 
key component of our Energy 
Strategy. This is extremely 
critical given our high-growth 
goals; we must always develop 
methods to produce more 
effectively in order to offset 
the emissions caused by 
increased output. Increasing 
the percentage of renewable 
power is another important 
tool for combatting our 
emissions.
Our Company’s environmental 
strategy and activities 
toward energy efficiency 
are driving tremendous 
improvement in energy 
reduction. The objective is to 
ensure that everyone in the 
organisation understands our 
environmental obligations by 
designing and implementing a 
global energy plan to enhance 
energy efficiency, transition 
to low-carbon fuels, and 
raise the global proportion of 
renewable power.
Shifting more towards renewable 
energy in the manufacturing 
of packaging solutions can 
lower maintenance costs and 
requirements. It also helps in a 
cleaner and greener environment, 
thus contributing to a sustainable 
ecosystem.
4
Climate and 
emissions
Risk
Extreme environmental 
changes can harm any 
organisation due to the 
disruption of raw material 
procurement, the production 
process, and the supply chain. 
Government regulations 
and norms on climate and 
emissions can also have a 
huge impact on business.
We have started identifying 
and evaluating climate 
change risks as part of our 
due diligence procedures and 
taking necessary mitigating 
and adapting action. Our 
climate goals are ratified by 
the Science-Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi). This will 
also aid in the transition to a 
carbon‑neutral society. Our 
goal is to achieve carbon-
neutral production by 2030.
Climate change can have both 
direct and indirect impacts on 
our Company. Direct impact may 
include physical damage and loss 
of essential resources, and indirect 
impact may include supply chain 
disruption, rising costs in different 
phases of production and other 
adverse impacts.

5
Transition 
to a circular 
economy
Risk and 
opportunity
Most flexible packaging in 
India currently is intended for 
single-use and is discarded 
rather than reused or 
recycled. Packaging consumes 
numerous resources, including 
energy, water, chemicals, 
petroleum, minerals, wood, 
and textiles. Its production 
frequently produces air 
pollutants such as greenhouse 
gases, heavy metals and 
particulates, as well as 
hazardous wastewater  
and/or sludge.
We are ensuring our products 
are recyclable, compostable, 
or reusable and minimising our 
environmental footprint across 
the value chain by focusing on 
designing for circularity and 
promoting sustainable end-of-
use packaging.
Our Blueloop programme 
was initiated to ensure that 
all our packaging solutions 
are recyclable, reusable or 
compostable by 2030. Our 
innovation and research 
efforts are strongly focused on 
delivering packaging solutions 
that adhere to this design 
philosophy.
We are also compliant with 
the plastic waste management 
rules in India and are ensuring 
that we meet our Extended 
Producers Responsibility 
(EPR) targets.
Packaging waste accounts for a 
large portion of landfill waste, 
which contributes to climate 
change and air pollution and can 
endanger ecosystems and species 
adversely. There is no quantifiable 
financial implication, however, it 
does have an impact on our overall 
business operation.
6
Waste and 
recycling
7
Water
Risk
We value water as a precious 
natural resource that is 
essential for food, people, 
and the environment and 
in Huhtamaki, water is 
essential as it is utilised in 
manufacturing activities. 
Recognising the human right 
to water and sanitation, we 
concentrate on controlling and 
reducing our effect on water 
resources.
In our water management 
strategies, we emphasise 
controlling and reducing our 
impacts on water resources. 
We safeguard water 
ecosystems, especially in 
water-stress areas.
The plans include alignment 
with the Huhtamaki 
strategy, site-specific water 
risk assessments, targets 
connected with performance 
indicators, and control and 
monitoring metrics that permit 
follow-up and detection 
of issues.
The global sustainability 
unit is driving this strategic 
endeavour by assisting local 
stakeholders in undertaking 
water resource analysis and 
management.
We have initiated our focus to 
achieve zero liquid discharge 
status at our factories. Four 
of our sites have already 
achieved ZLD status.
Water scarcity can disrupt 
manufacturing activities and water 
storage and transfer infrastructure 
can incur substantial amounts of 
costs to the Company.

Human 
rights
Opportunity
Businesses that respect 
human rights exhibit their 
dedication to developing 
long-term, mutually beneficial 
relationships with people 
who affect or are influenced 
by their activities, such as 
consumers, communities, 
workers, and investors.
We reviewed our existing 
policies and processes, as well 
as conducted a worldwide 
evaluation of our possible 
human rights risks and 
implications.
Huhtamaki India conforms 
to the Programme on 
Responsible Sourcing under the 
AIM‑PROGRESS consortium. 
Under this, the process of 
verification/audit of compliance 
is called SEDEX (SUPPLIERS 
ETHICAL DATA EXCHANGE) and 
the Model Responsible Sourcing 
Audit is called SMETA ( SEDEX 
Members Ethical Trade Audit).
The scope of SMETA audit are 
(a) Business Integrity (b) Health & 
Safety (c) Labour (d) Environment. 
There is a prescribed audit 
checklist for the audit, where the 
auditors will look for compliance 
to applicable local law and/or the 
customer specific requirement, 
whichever is stricter. This 
certification can be done using 
the services of approved certifying 
agencies. There are few customers 
who have their own model, which 
is similar to SMETA. For those 
customers, applicable conversion of 
report is done by the certification 
body engaged.
SMETA audit does not lead to 
any certification and Individual 
customers are expected to 
review the audit report of the 
site and provide a compliance 
validity. Minimum compliance 
is for 1 year, and maximum can 
be 3 years. As a good practice, 
Huhtamaki India ensures that all its 
packaging and label manufacturing 
sites undergo SMETA audit at 
least once a year. Except for 
the Ambernath unit, which got 
commissioned very recently, all 
plants have gone through the 
requisite audit in the last one year 
and put in due diligence for closure 
of the findings.
At a global level, as a pilot project, 
Huhtamaki has conducted its first 
human rights impact assessment 
at one of our sites. The findings 
of both the global review and the 
local-level evaluation will help us 
increase our human rights due 
diligence and expand other aspects 
of social sustainability throughout 
the organisation.
9
Diversity 
and equal 
opportunity
Opportunity
We seek to foster an inclusive 
and diverse workplace. To 
achieve that we aim to attract, 
develop, and retain the 
finest talent in a conducive 
work environment by 
imparting appropriate training 
programmes, by modifying 
polices and by embracing the 
differences.
We celebrate diversity and 
promote equality by being 
inclusive of all.
We believe that diverse teams, 
in terms of gender, ethnicity, and 
characteristics, bring fresh views, 
greater creativity and innovation 
to the table. Diversity in teams 
increases performance, efficient 
decision-making, and effective 
collaboration.

Employee 
attraction 
and retention
Opportunity
When it comes to talent, 
hiring the right people and 
putting in place the necessary 
measures to allow them to 
flourish are critical to building 
a productive, high-performing 
culture.
By adhering to our principles 
of Care, Dare and Deliver, we 
all become the driving force 
behind putting our plan into 
action.
We strive to provide 
employment experience 
in which employees feel 
protected, appreciated, 
and included, as well as an 
atmosphere in which they 
can make their distinctive 
contribution.
Developing our diverse talent is 
a key component of our 2030 
Strategy and it is the key to our 
future success. Talent development 
is the process through which we 
improve our workers’ talents and 
capacities so that they may thrive 
in their positions.
11
Employee 
training
Opportunity
At Huhtamaki, we believe that 
learning is the foundation of 
superior performance and 
employees should carve their 
own path by determining 
where they want to go in their 
careers.
We help them by offering 
organised learning, on-the‑job 
training, opportunities to 
learn from others and various 
training and development 
programmes.
We provide continuous 
skill development and 
learning opportunities 
through organised training 
programmes, career 
conversations, and individual 
development programmes for 
high performance and career 
progression.
Training and development help 
in attracting and retaining top 
personnel, increasing employee 
satisfaction and morale, increasing 
productivity, and increasing profits.
12
Labour 
retention
Opportunity
We believe that labour 
relations are essential in 
manufacturing focused 
business. We have followed 
principles set out by the 
International Labour 
Organisation.
Good labour relations 
translate in overall productivity 
and leads to higher work 
satisfaction levels.
Our various projects focus 
on improving efficiency of 
manufacturing network, labour 
productivity and reduce wastages 
from operations to boost the 
long-term competitiveness of our  
Company.
13
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
It is vital to provide a safe 
working environment in order 
to minimise absenteeism 
and boost employee morale. 
Risks related to incidents 
that potentially compromise 
health and safety can impose 
various threats to human lives 
associated with our Company.
Huhtamaki places a high 
priority on Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHS).
We are developing a safe 
work culture to integrate 
safety across the Company. 
Our objective is to create a 
mindset along with training 
targeted towards the aim 
that no one is affected, and 
everyone returns home safely 
at the end of the day. Machine 
safety has always been a top 
priority for our Company.
Working days are lost owing to 
work-related illness and injury, 
which impedes our product 
production and supply.
14
Supply 
chain and 
responsible 
sourcing
Risk
The supply chain is extremely 
important in the packaging 
sector, and any interruption 
in this may expose our 
Company to different types 
of risks. Since the majority 
of our clients manufacture 
and use our packaging 
material for their products 
and commodities that are 
fast moving and essential, the 
stock must be replenished and 
supplied to retailers within 
the stipulated time to meet 
the growing demands of 
customers.
Our enhanced supply chain 
due diligence methodology 
is designed to detect supply 
chain risks and covers 
all ethical, social, and 
environmental standards. 
All-important suppliers, 
accounting for the top 80% of 
procurement expenditure, are 
now systematically screened 
in the Group’s supplier 
monitoring tool against 
sanctions lists, watch lists, and 
unfavourable media, assisting 
Huhtamaki in identifying 
and addressing issues in the 
supply chain.
Supply chain interruptions caused 
by the pandemic and other 
unprecedented challenges can 
result in unusual input cost inflation 
in raw resources, freight, energy, 
and labour.

The Huhtamaki Ethics and

focuses on Huhtamaki’s 
commitment to ethics 
and legal compliance. The 
programme is a toolbox that 
assists Huhtamaki in operating 
its business in accordance 
with laws, rules, and ethical 
principles, as well as ensuring 
that the Company has proper 
processes in place to prevent 
Huhtamaki from engaging in 
unethical business practices.
At Huhtamaki, we believe that 
strong ethics make excellent 
business sense, and our 
business operations reflect 
this commitment to upholding

ethical code is that it will build 
an environment of trust, ethical 
behaviour, integrity, and excellence 
amongst the Company, its 
employees and all the stakeholders

We are dedicated to ensuring that our supply chain abides by the Huhtamaki Code of 
Conduct for Suppliers and that we engage with responsible suppliers in all of our global 
operations. It serves as the cornerstone for our supply chain due diligence and the 
compliances and ethical conduct we expect from our suppliers on social and environmental 
parameters. The NAVEX Risk Rate tool tracks the number of significant suppliers who have 
acknowledged the Code. Huhtamaki’s suppliers are also responsible for the compliance of 
their subcontractors. If their own Code of Conduct meets the standards of Huhtamaki, we 
may accept it as a substitute.

[UN SDG: 16.5]
	
Yes, our Company’s Code of Conduct includes an anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy, which has been disseminated to 
our employees and workers through e-learning modules and face-to-face training sessions to raise their awareness and 
assist them in evaluating scenarios and making responsible decisions.
	
The Huhtamaki Code of Conduct is the core element of Huhtamaki’s Global Ethics and Compliance programme. The 
Code works as a compass, helping the Group to navigate and use consistent legal and ethical judgement in its daily work. 
Anti-bribery and corruption provisions are an integral part of the Code. In addition, these provisions are included in the 
Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki Suppliers. The Global Ethics and Compliance function oversees the implementation of 
the Company’s Ethics and Compliance programme by advising and supporting conduct of business with high integrity and 
in compliance with laws and regulations, including anti-bribery and corruption provisions.
	
Huhtamaki strongly believes that conducting business with integrity is the right thing to do and is also its license to 
operate. The structured Ethics and Compliance programme also helps Huhtamaki to answer to the growing interest 
of external stakeholders on ethics and compliance matters, and to the needs of Huhtamaki’s global organisation by 
establishing a standard, structured approach to handle ethics and compliance matters across all Huhtamaki units globally.

of all shareholders and has a positive impact on sustainable development.

we expect our suppliers to comply with. It covers topics related to business ethics, as well as social and environmental 
responsibility. The number of key suppliers who have acknowledged the Code is monitored through the NAVEX RiskRate 
tool. For other suppliers, monitoring is done at the unit level. Our suppliers are also responsible for their subcontractors’ 
compliance with the requirements. We also provide suppliers with the opportunity to share their own Code of Conduct 
with us. If their own Code of Conduct fulfils the requirements of Huhtamaki, it is possible for us to accept it as a 
substitute. Our suppliers and workers in the value chain can report any violations of the Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki 
Suppliers or other Huhtamaki policies via Huhtamaki’s global whistleblowing system, the Huhtamaki Speak Up channel.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
Huhtamaki as an organisation is making significant investments in innovation and research because we believe it will allow 
us to develop cutting-edge products that will not only be sustainable but will also provide value to our customers and satisfy 
the demands of their end consumers. We are willing to support the local vendors, vulnerable groups, and other supply chain 
partners who can assist us in meeting our strategic goals and long-term sustainable aspirations as supporting them since doing 
so would imply contributing to the economy’s overall success.

The Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki Suppliers is the foundation for our supply chain due diligence and sets out 
what we expect our suppliers to comply with. It covers topics related to business ethics, as well as social and 
environmental responsibility.
	
The NAVEX Risk Rate tool, which screens all important suppliers against sanction lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed 
Persons lists, and negative media, is a critical component in responsible procurement. The screening process will continue 
as long as the supplier remains an active strategic supplier for Huhtamaki. If there are any matches in the above-mentioned 
lists, Risk Rate will immediately notify us with more case information. During the onboarding process, suppliers are also 
handed a questionnaire based on their initial risk assessment. All suppliers are required to declare conformity with the 
Huhtamaki Suppliers Code of Conduct. Medium-risk suppliers are evaluated to determine the likelihood of corruption and 
legal compliance. Potential high-risk suppliers are evaluated on sanctions, ethics, and compliance.

Principle 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their 
value chains
Employee satisfaction is paramount to us because it leads to increased levels of engagement, productivity, morale, and lower 
turnover. Employees are an organisation’s most valuable asset since they not only serve as a link with the customers but 
also greatly contribute to the organisation’s success. Employees feedback is acknowledged in our organisation, and their 
perspective is essential to us. To maintain their satisfaction, we give industry-leading benefits to our entire workforce. Our 
Speak Up channel and other redressal mechanisms enable workers to report issues from wherever in the organisation and 
allows them to be addressed rapidly and effectively.

Details on assessment of value chain partners:
	
[UN SDG: 5.2, 8.8, 16.1]
	
A key element of Huhtamaki’s due diligence processes is the use of the NAVEX RiskRate tool. All key suppliers are screened 
in RiskRate against sanction lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons lists and adverse media. The screening continues 
for as long as the supplier is an active key supplier for Huhtamaki. If there are any matches in the above‑mentioned lists, 
RiskRate will automatically alert us with more case details.

Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks/concerns arising from 
assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions of value chain partners:
	
[UN SDG: 3.6, 8.8, 16.1]
	
Based on the suppliers’ initial profile risk level, they are also sent a questionnaire. All suppliers are asked to acknowledge 
compliance with the updated Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki Suppliers. Medium-risk suppliers are asked questions 
that help assess the risk of corruption and compliance with law. Possible high-risk suppliers receive additional questions 
on sanctions as well as ethics and compliance. We have defined risk scorings for the questions, and if necessary, each 
questionnaire answer is checked individually to determine whether further actions or explanations are required from 
the supplier. Both the screening results and the answers to the questionnaire are combined in the final risk rating of the 
supplier. This final risk rating also uses a three-level system: low, medium or high risk. We have defined internal processes 
for the review and approval of the results, which vary depending on the risk level.
Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
For Huhtamaki, primary stakeholders include the government, shareholders, consumers, suppliers, investors, and communities 
who are seeking to learn more about our sustainability performance in various areas. It has become vital for us to continue 
recording and disclosing both quantitative and qualitative indicators to exhibit transparency and communicate clearly with all of 
them and address the sustainability issues that are critical to the business’s performance. Collaboration and co-creation with 
stakeholders are essential to accomplish our sustainability goals. Stakeholder dialogue not only helps us match our objectives

There were two cases of sexual harassment that was filed during the year which were addressed by the internal 
complaints committee. One of the cases was successfully resolved while one is pending for resolution. We are working 
on strengthening the mechanisms and policies to prevent such incidents in the future.
7.	
Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases:
	
[UN SDG: 16.6]
	
Any form of workplace violence is prohibited at Huhtamaki. The use of threats or intimidation is also prohibited. No employee 
may use or carry firearms or other weapons while on Huhtamaki property or while conducting business on Huhtamaki’s behalf 
in order to help promote a safe work environment for all employees. Huhtamaki does not tolerate any form of harassment, 
including sexual, racial, or any other hostile, inconsiderate, abusive, or undignified behaviour.
	
In compliance with the terms of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 
2013 (the “Act”) and Rules made thereunder, we have adopted an anti-sexual harassment policy, which is gender agnostic, 
and the Company has established an internal complaints committee. Our Company runs awareness campaigns in each of its 
divisions to teach staff members how to treat their coworkers with dignity.
	
To report actual or suspected frauds and violations of the Code of Conduct and/or Ethics Policy, a whistleblower may do so 
through a variety of ways. The Whistleblower Policy lays down a thorough procedure for reporting, processing, and investigating 
fraudulent activity and provides the necessary protection to employees who disclose such fraudulent operations or unethical 
behaviour. No employee has been prevented from bringing their concerns before the Audit Committee. Any alleged violation 
may be reported by an employee, amongst others, to the India Investigation Lead by e-mailing IndiaInvestigationLead@
huhtamaki.com. A letter marked “Confidential” may also be sent by an employee to the India Investigation Lead at the Company’s 
registered office.
	
To highlight the value of ethics and compliance in the workplace, Huhtamaki India has launched an awareness campaign dubbed 
#DoRight – The Huhtamaki Way! The campaign’s aim is to inform and instruct employees on the business’ whistleblower 
policy, how to use the Speak Up platform more efficiently, and, most importantly, how to #DoRight – The Huhtamaki Way! The 
campaign’s mascot, CoCo, delivers a series of messages during the campaign.
	
Our Code of Conduct which is applicable to every employee mandates that complete protection be given to a Whistle-Blower 
against any unfair practice like retaliation, threat or intimidation or termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, 
transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion, discrimination, any type of harassment, biased behaviour or the like including any 
direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the whistleblower’s right to continue to perform their duties/functions including 
making further Protected Disclosure. The policy also clearly states that retaliation against an employee reporting any form of 
harassment is strictly prohibited.

Sexual harassment
Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers covers topics related to business ethics, as well as social 
and environmental responsibility. A key element of Huhtamaki’s due diligence processes is the 
use of the NAVEX RiskRate tool. All key suppliers are screened in RiskRate against sanction 
lists, watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons lists and adverse media. The screening continues 
for as long as the supplier is an active key supplier for Huhtamaki. If there are any matches in 
the above-mentioned lists, RiskRate will automatically alert us with more case details.
Based on the suppliers’ initial profile risk level, they are also sent a questionnaire. All suppliers 
are asked to acknowledge compliance with the updated Code of Conduct for Huhtamaki 
Suppliers. Medium risk suppliers are evaluated to assess that help assess the risk of corruption 
and compliance with law. Possible high-risk suppliers are evaluated on sanctions as well as 
ethics and compliance.
We have defined risk scorings for the questions, and if necessary, each questionnaire answer 
is checked individually to determine whether further actions or explanations are required from 
the supplier. Both the screening results and the answers to the questionnaire are combined 
in the final risk rating of the supplier. This final risk rating also uses a three-level system: low, 
medium or high risk. We have defined internal processes for the review and approval of the 
results, which vary, depending on the risk level.

There have been no significant risks or concerns as mentioned earlier. Where there were concerns, appropriate preventive 
and corrective actions were taken.
Principle 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
With a growing emphasis on the welfare of the planet, packaging also plays an important role in decreasing food waste, which 
is still by far the most significant environmental impact of food systems on climate change. We updated the Huhtamaki Group 
Environmental Policy to reflect our commitment to protecting food, people, and the environment via sustainable packaging 
solutions. The policy’s objective is to ensure that everyone in the organisation understands our environmental obligations. It 
addresses climate and energy; water and effluent; sustainable forestry and biodiversity; waste, circular design, and chemicals. 
Through innovation, we intend to raise awareness and build the infrastructure needed to recycle and eradicate packaging 
waste in the environment, which will not only benefit all the stakeholders but also the ecosystem at large.

In 2022, Huhtamaki India sponsored a trust (Huhtamaki Foundation) to 
recycle post-consumer multi-layered plastic waste. Post-consumer MLP waste 
collected from the city of Pune is cleaned, segregated and recycled to form 
granules which can be then used to manufacture value added items. MLP 
waste is thought to be non-recyclable and ends up in landfills and garbage 
dumps because of lack of financial feasibility of MLP recycling. This one-of-
its-kind initiative has been implemented to start a transparent and ethical 
recycling setup enabling circularity for Multi layered plastics.
