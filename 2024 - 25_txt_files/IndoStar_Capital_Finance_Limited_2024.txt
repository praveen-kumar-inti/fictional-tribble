A brief on types of customers
 
The Company, as a non-banking financial institution, primarily focusses on retail lending with key areas, 
including vehicle finance, housing finance, corporate lending, and SME finance. The customer segments 
vary across product categories, as outlined below:
 
Vehicle Finance: 
 
The Company primarily caters to transport operators, particularly Small Road Transport Operators 
(SRTOs), and provides financing solutions for farm equipment, two-wheelers, four-wheelers, and 
construction vehicles. It aims to become the preferred lender for this customer base by offering 
competitive credit facilities that meet their needs while managing associated risks and tapping into 
the ongoing demand in this space. 
 
Housing Finance: 
 
Through its former wholly-owned subsidiary, Niwas Housing Finance Private Limited (NHFPL) (erstwhile 
IndoStar Home Finance Private Limited), a non-deposit taking housing finance company registered 
with the National Housing Bank (NHB), the Company served customers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns 
as well as peripheral urban regions. The focus was on individuals looking to purchase or construct 
residential properties for self-use. 
 
SME Finance: 
 
The SME lending business supports small and medium-sized enterprises in meeting their business 
funding requirements, which may include working capital, business expansion or other commercial 
needs. These loans are typically secured against self-occupied residential or commercial property. 
The key clientele includes traders, manufacturers, professionals, and service-based businesses. A 
considerable share of disbursements under this segment qualifies as Priority Sector Lending (PSL). 
 
Corporate Lending: 
 
IndoStar Capital Finance Limited extends tailored structured finance solutions to mid-sized and large 
corporates. Lending activities span multiple sectors such as real estate, steel, cement, pharmaceuticals, 
FMCG, financial services, media and entertainment, and dairy, among others, addressing project funding 
and other business requirements.
 
Micro LAP: 
 
The Micro LAP product primarily serves small-scale traders, manufacturers, and service providers in 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns, offering fully secured, small-ticket loans to meet working capital, business 
expansion, and other productive needs. Its customers typically seek collateral-backed credit with 
manageable tenures and ticket sizes, ensuring strong repayment discipline and risk coverage.

The Company considers well-defined commitments crucial for 
monitoring its alignment with the principles outlined in the National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). Sustainability 
remains a key area of focus, supported by various short- and 
medium-term measures already underway. Recognising the value of 
setting structured goals, the Company plans to define measurable 
targets in upcoming reporting periods. Efforts are also being made 
to evaluate the environmental and social impacts of its operations, 
with a continued emphasis on embedding ESG considerations into 
organisational decision-making.
6
Performance of the entity against 
the specific commitments, goals 
and targets along with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
As the Company continues to integrate ESG principles into its 
operations during these initial phases, it anticipates providing a more 
detailed and comprehensive update in future reporting cycles. The 
objective remains to support business growth while aligning with long-
term sustainability goals. In line with this commitment, the Company 
has undertaken the digitisation of various loan approval processes to 
minimise paper usage and has replaced CFLs with energy-efficient 
LED sensor lighting at its corporate office.

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related 
challenges, targets and achievements 
We take pride in presenting the BRSR Report of ICFL for FY 2024–25. Backed by a strong liquidity and 
capital position, and a retail-focussed business model, we continue to serve customers through vehicle 
finance, SME finance, corporate lending, and micro LAP.
At IndoStar, we believe that integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into everyday 
decision-making is critical for long-term sustainability. During the year, we focussed on aligning internal 
policies with evolving ESG regulations, enhancing data systems, and deepening awareness across the 
organisation.
Key ESG achievements include:
• 
Strengthening governance with Board and ESG Working Committee oversight.
• 
Adopting an Anti-Corruption Policy, reinforcing our zero-tolerance stance.
• 
Supporting community initiatives in education, healthcare, sanitation, and women’s empowerment, 
including programmes to train women as commercial drivers and build awareness in legal rights, 
hygiene, and financial literacy.
• 
Extending support to NGOs focussed on dropout reduction, inequity, and psychological well-being.
• 
Prioritising employee welfare through medical and term insurance, wellness seminars, and engagement 
initiatives.
Looking ahead, we aim to further embed ESG principles across business functions, enhance transparency, 
and drive meaningful community impact while remaining committed to responsible growth and sound 
governance.
