1
Energy 
Management
Risk
Given 
the 
mounting 
regulatory 
landscape 
surrounding 
energy 
management 
and 
alternative 
fuels, 
it’s 
crucial for the Company 
to prioritize efficient and 
environmental friendly 
energy sources.
The Company consistently 
conducts 
energy-saving 
assessments 
to 
identify 
opportunities for enhancing 
energy efficiency across its 
operations. 
Key 
initiatives 
encompass the deployment of 
energy-efficient technologies, 
infrastructure 
upgrades, 
and the adoption of smart 
energy management systems. 
Additionally, they prioritize the 
utilization of renewable energy 
sources and aim to elevate their 
proportion in the energy mix.
Negative financial 
impact is incurred 
due to increased 
operational 
costs 
from 
fluctuating 
energy prices or 
potential regulatory 
changes
2
Occupational 
Health & Safety
Risk
The chemical sector’s 
workforce is consistently 
exposed to hazards and 
chemical risks. As a 
responsible corporate 
citizen, it is imperative 
for the Company to 
protect its workforce by 
implementing initiatives 
and strict protocols to 
minimize the risk of 
incidents and mishaps.
The company emphasizes 
employee well-being with a 
thorough Health and Safety 
Management Plan. Prioritizing 
prevention and mitigation, they 
actively identify and manage 
potential hazards for a safe 
working environment. The 
Process Safety and Risk 
Management protocols include 
stringent measures aligned 
with or surpassing industry 
standards to prevent accidents 
and control risks.
Negative financial 
impact is incurred 
due to increased 
expenditure 
over 
initiatives and assets 
management. 
3
Waste 
Management
Risk 
Effective 
waste 
management is crucial for 
the Company to uphold 
responsible operations 
and 
ensure 
safety. 
Given the nature of its 
operations, the Company 
produces 
substantial 
waste, 
including 
solvents and chemicals

environment and human 
health. 
Encouraging 
safe disposal practices 
is 
imperative

disposing of it at authorized 
landfills 
and 
incinerators 
according to its policy.

4
Climate Change Risk
Given 
the 
growing 
focus on governance 
concerning 
carbon 
emissions and climate 
change, it’s crucial for 
the Company to closely 
monitor exhaust and 
complex emissions to 
avoid financial losses 
in the form of fines and 
penalties. 
The Company gives priority 
to utilizing renewable energy 
sources for powering its 
operations. Additionally, 
it 
invests 
in 
energy-efficient 
equipment and technologies to 
decrease energy consumption 
and lower greenhouse gas 
emissions. As part of its 
environmental stewardship, the 
company actively investigates 
opportunities 
for 
Carbon 
Capture, Utilization, and Storage 
(CCUS) to mitigate its carbon 
footprint.  
Additional 
costs 
are 
incurred 
for 
the 
monitoring 
and management 
of 
emissions, 
resulting in negative 
implications. 
5
Compliance
Risk
Ethical 
operations 
and 
governance 
is 
the 
reflection 
of 
responsible compliance 
of the Company. Being, 
a chemical manufacturer 
it is critical for the 
company to be compliant 
with applicable set of 
regulations and norms 
and hence, avoid getting 
penalized. 
The Company is dedicated 
to fulfilling all relevant legal 
obligations, ensuring that its 
operations fully comply with 
the law. To oversee compliance 
efforts, 
regular 
quarterly 
assessments are conducted. 
These assessments entail a 
comprehensive examination 
of processes, procedures, and 
practices to detect any instances 
of non-compliance or potential 
risks. 
Through 
proactive 
compliance monitoring, the 
Company promptly addresses 
issues 
and 
implements 
corrective actions. 
Negative implications 
are observed due 
to investments to 
ensure compliance 
within the processes 
and 
Implications 
would be positive 
as the company 
adheres 
to 
Compliances and 
this outweighs the 
cost that would be 
incurred due to non-
compliance

Water & effluent Risk
Water plays a critical role 
in multiple processes 
within the Company’s 
operations. Responsible 
management not only 
enhances stakeholder 
trust but also ensures the 
systematic discharge of 
effluents, thereby averting 
penalties. 
The Company has robust 
initiatives to ensure 100% 
wastewater effluent treatment 
as follows: 
• 	 Karakhadi, 
Vadodara 
Plant contains an effluent 
treatment plant with primary 
(chemical), 
secondary 
(biological), and tertiary 
(disinfection) 
treatment 
facilities. 
• 	 Mahape Plant disposes off 
liquid effluent in a shared 
wastewater treatment plant. 
• 	 Dahej SEZ plant successfully 
operates a zero liquid 
discharge (ZLD) system, 
which processes 100% of 
the wastewater generated 
for recovering and recycling 
water. 
• 	 Patancheru has an STP for 
domestic water treatment; 
however, 
no 
industrial 
water was generated in 
the current financial year. 
For F.Y. 2025-26, a project 
is planned to initiate the 
installation of an ETP for 
treating industrial water 
which will be generated.
Financial negative 
impact is incurred 
due to potential 
risk of increased 
cost of waste water 
treatment. 
7
Human Rights
Risk
Ensuring adherence to 
human rights throughout 
all 
operations 
and 
preventing any form of 
exploitation is paramount 
to 
the 
Company. 
Noncompliance 
with 
human rights standards 
damages the Company’s 
reputation. 
The Company upholds and 
respects the fundamental 
human rights of its employees, 
customers, and stakeholders. 
It is committed to fostering an 
inclusive and diverse work 
environment that promotes 
equality, non-discrimination, 
and fair treatment for all. 
Furthermore, the Company’s 
Prevention 
of 
Sexual 
Harassment (POSH) policy 
and whistleblower policy provide 
protection to complainants 
and offer guidance on raising 
concerns regarding misconduct 
and ill-treatment. 
Negative impact is 
incurred because of 
possible increased 
compliance costs, 
potential legal labilities 
and 
these 
risks 
may affect investor 
confidence, lead to 
higher operational 
expenses.

Business Ethics Opportunity
Good governance and 
ethical operations lead to 
virtuous work outcomes. 
It is essential for the 
Company to prioritize 
transparent practices and 
uphold business ethics 
to enhance stakeholder 
trust. 
The Company maintains the 
highest ethical standards, guided 
by its Code of Conduct, which 
applies to all employees and 
senior management. This code 
underscores their dedication 
to integrity, transparency, and 
responsible business practices. 
The HR Policy further solidifies 
this commitment by advocating 
for fairness, equal opportunity, 
and respect in employment 
matters. 
Upholding 
these 
policies ensures that ethical 
conduct remains central to 
their operations, fostering 
trust with stakeholders and 
the communities they serve. 
Additionally, the Company’s 
Whistleblower Policy offers 
guidance on reporting any 
misconduct or fraud within 
the organization. 
Positive impact is 
incurred financially. 
By 
prioritizing 
sustainability and 
ethically responsible 
practices, 
the 
company 
can 
tap into growing 
markets that value 
ethical standards, 
ultimately 
driving 
profitability and long-
term growth. 
9
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk
It is important for the 
Company to operate with 
resilience and delivery 
without disruption. 
The Company consistently 
collaborates with suppliers 
to establish alignment on 
quality 
standards, 
ethical 
practices, and sustainability 
objectives. Through its well-
managed supply chain, the 
Company ensures efficient 
procurement, timely deliveries, 
and uninterrupted operations. 
By fostering these enduring 
relationships, the Company 
cultivates a mutually beneficial 
environment 
that

Materials
Risk
To maintain continuous 
operations and deliver 
quality products, it is 
essential for the Company 
to ensure a steady supply 
of materials that are cost-
effective and meet quality 
standards. 
The Company’s procurement 
team ensures that a large portion 
of essential raw materials is 
sourced from multiple suppliers. 
Furthermore, the Companies 
cultivate strong, long-term 
relationships with suppliers 
to access raw resources at 
competitive prices. Additionally, 
the 
Company 
maintains 
sufficient inventory levels to 
mitigate associated risks. 
Negative Implications, 
as Neogen Chemicals 
may face financial 
implications 
due 
to the volatility and 
rising costs of raw 
material like lithium 
which is crucial for 
product line.

PRINCIPLE 2: BUSINESSES SHOULD PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT IS 
SUSTAINABLE AND SAFE
Businesses are not just sellers of goods and services they are also responsible for the impact these offerings create. This 
principle serves as a reminder that every product leaves a footprint. It is essential to ensure that all offerings are safe, high-
quality, and sustainable across their entire lifecycle from raw material sourcing to end-of-life disposal. It is necessary to think 
proactively, innovate continuously, and act responsibly to reduce harm and support long-term well-being.
Reflecting this commitment, Neogen Chemicals invested in technologies that enhance the environmental and social profile of 
its products and processes during the year. The company has robust sustainable sourcing procedures and ensures responsible 
end-of-life management for plastics and other waste through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance. Internal 
e-waste is safely recycled, and all waste collection plans are aligned with regulatory requirements. These actions underscore 
Neogen’s proactive approach to minimizing its environmental footprint while delivering safe, high-quality products.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end

a. 	
Plastic Waste (Including Packaging)
	
	
Plastic waste generated from our product packaging is collected under Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
through authorized third parties, in compliance with Plastic Waste Management Rules. This waste is gathered via 
curbside recycling programs and drop-off points, then sorted by type (e.g., PET, HDPE, PP) using both automated 
and manual methods to remove contaminants. Most of the sorted plastic is mechanically recycled, shredded, washed, 
and melted into flakes or pellets for use in manufacturing new products while certain durable items are cleaned and 
reused where possible.
	
b. 	
E-waste
	
	
NGL does not generate E-waste through its products, as our operations are focused on manufacturing specialty 
chemicals. Any E-waste produced internally is responsibly collected and handed over to authorized vendors for 
recycling and environmentally safe disposal.
	
c. 	
Hazardous Waste
	
	
Our products serve as intermediates for various industries in the production of finished goods, and any hazardous 
waste arising from their use is handled by our customers in line with applicable regulatory requirements.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, the company adheres to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations, aligning its waste collection plan 
accordingly. This plan has been submitted to the Pollution Control Board.
PRINCIPLE 3: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND PROMOTE THE WELL-BEING OF ALL EMPLOYEES, 
INCLUDING THOSE IN THEIR VALUE CHAINS.
Employees are the backbone of any organization. Their well-being is not just a moral obligation but a strategic necessity. This 
principle emphasizes creating a workplace that is safe, inclusive, and empowering. It means ensuring fair wages, promoting 
diversity, supporting mental and physical health, and investing in continuous learning. When employees thrive, businesses 
flourish and so does society.
Neogen Chemicals demonstrates this principle through comprehensive well-being measures, with all employees and workers 
covered by health and accident insurance, and robust maternity and paternity benefits in place. The company invests in well-
being initiatives, complemented by inclusive activities such as marathons, safety weeks, and team-building events to foster 
engagement and morale. All premises are accessible to differently abled individuals, and equal opportunity is ensured through 
formal policies. These efforts, combined with rigorous health and safety management systems and high training coverage, 
reflect Neogen’s proactive approach to creating a safe, supportive, and empowering workplace.

PRINCIPLE 4: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF AND BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL ITS 
STAKEHOLDERS
No business operates in isolation. Actions taken by an organization affect a wide range of stakeholders from customers and 
employees to communities and investors. This principle calls for meaningful engagement with all stakeholders. It involves 
listening, understanding, and responding to their concerns and expectations. By building strong, trust-based relationships, 
organizations can co-create value and drive long-term success.
Neogen Chemicals brings this principle to life through a structured and inclusive stakeholder engagement process. The 
company systematically identifies key stakeholder groups ranging from shareholders and customers to employees, suppliers, 
regulatory bodies, and local communities ensuring their expectations are understood and addressed. Engagement channels 
such as surveys, meetings, reports, and community initiatives are tailored to each group and occur at regular intervals, from 
monthly to annually, or as needed. By actively listening and responding to stakeholder concerns on topics like transparency, 
responsible production, and local development, Neogen fosters trust and co-creates value, reinforcing its commitment to long-
term, sustainable success.

PRINCIPLE 5: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS
Human rights are universal and non-negotiable. Businesses must ensure that their operations and those of their partners 
uphold the dignity and rights of every individual. This includes eliminating discrimination, preventing child and forced labour, 
and promoting freedom of expression and association. Respecting human rights goes beyond compliance; it is about fostering 
a just and equitable world.
Neogen Chemicals operationalizes this principle by ensuring that its employees and workers receive training on human 
rights policies and issues each year. The company assures that all staff are paid above minimum wage, maintains a strict 
zero-tolerance policy for child and forced labour, and enforces robust anti-discrimination and anti-harassment mechanisms. 
Dedicated committees and confidential grievance redressal systems safeguard employee rights, with no reported cases 
of human rights violations or workplace harassment in the reporting period. These actions reflect Neogen’s unwavering 
commitment to upholding dignity, equity, and respect throughout its operations and value chain.

PRINCIPLE 6: BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPECT AND MAKE EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE THE 
ENVIRONMENT
The planet is facing unprecedented environmental challenges, and businesses have a critical role in addressing them. This 
principle calls for minimizing the ecological footprint through resource conservation, emission reduction, responsible waste 
management, and biodiversity protection. Sustainability must be integrated into every business decision, as the health of the 
planet determines the future of both the business and humanity.
Neogen Chemicals integrates this principle into its core business by continuously investing in resource efficiency, emission 
reduction, and responsible waste management. In F.Y. 2024-25, the company increased renewable energy usage, implemented 
Zero Liquid Discharge at its Dahej SEZ plant, and maintained third-party monitoring of air and water quality. These actions 
reflect Neogen’s ongoing commitment to minimizing its environmental footprint and supporting the restoration and protection 
of natural resources.
