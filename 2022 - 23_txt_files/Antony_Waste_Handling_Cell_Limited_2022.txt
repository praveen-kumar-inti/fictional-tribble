Resource 
Management
Opportunity
Municipal waste embodies 
intrinsic reservoirs of valuable 
resources, encompassing 
recyclable materials and 
organic waste amenable to 
reclamation. Inadequacies in 
proficient resource recovery 
and recycling infrastructures 
culminate in resource scarcity 
and heightened reliance on 
landfilling practices.
The Company looks to adopt 
innovative technologies 
for waste segregation, 
recycling and composting, 
thereby reducing the 
reliance on virgin resources 
and promoting a circular 
economy.
Positive

Unregulated 
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
In India, a significant portion of 
waste management is handled 
by the informal sector, 
comprising waste pickers and 
recyclers. These workers often 
face poor working conditions, 
low wages, and inadequate 
access to social security.
Engaging with the workers 
through formalization, 
capacity-building on fair-
trade practices to contribute 
to social development 
and enhance supply chain 
resilience.
Positive

Air and Water 
Pollution
Risk
Inadequate waste 
management methodologies, 
such as uncontrolled 
combustion and unmanaged 
leachate discharge from 
landfills, substantively 
contribute to atmospheric 
and aquatic pollution. This 
engenders notable health 
hazards for the resident 
communities in close 
proximity.
Investing in technologies 
for landfill gas capture, 
wastewater treatment, and 
pollution control measures 
to ensure compliance with 
environmental standards.

Health and 
Safety
Risk & 
Opportunity
Inadequate waste 
management infrastructure 
can lead to occupational 
health and safety hazards for 
workers involved in waste 
collection and disposal.
Prioritize the well-being of 
employees by implementing 
proper training, safety 
protocols, and providing 
personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to minimize

Specific commitments, goals, and targets set by the entity with defined timelines, if any.
We are dedicatedly improving waste management practices that have minimal impact on the environment and promote 
sustainability. Our efforts persistently aim for reductions in our carbon footprint, higher recycling rates, and the integration 
of innovative technologies to enhance the use of resources.
We fully recognize the significance of nurturing safe and inclusive workplaces for our employees. Concurrently, we engage 
with local communities through initiatives that contribute positively to their well-being. Our objective involves upholding 
transparency and open communication, actively listening to stakeholder feedback, and integrating it into our strategic 
decisions.
In addition, we prioritize on ethical business conduct, compliance with regulations, and effective risk management by 
maintaining a sturdy governance framework. 
6.
Performance of the entity against the specific commitments, goals, and targets along with reasons in case the same 
are not met.
Your Company is deeply committed to establishing a sustainable and circular business model by effectively sorting municipal 
solid waste (MSW) and converting it into compact refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and recyclable materials. This approach aims 
to not only reduce waste but also minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Notably, we have successfully prevented the 
release of approximately 3284 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) into the atmosphere by mitigating methane emissions.
To ensure the consistent growth and development of our employees, we conduct regular training sessions, enhancing 
their expertise and understanding of our responsible waste management practices. Upholding our strong ethical values, 
we ensure that our 'Code of Conduct for Responsible and Ethical Suppliers' is strictly adhered to by all our suppliers, 
vendors, and subcontractors. In addition, we maintain a comprehensive POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) policy 
that covers all our operational sites, prioritizing a safe and respectful work environment.
Our governance framework is designed to foster transparency and confidence among both internal and external 
stakeholders. To facilitate this, we have established various committees led by Independent Directors. These committees, 
including Audit, Nomination and Remuneration, and Stakeholder Relationship Committees, play a crucial role in maintaining 
the Vigil Mechanism, which encourages the reporting of legitimate concerns or grievances.
Recognizing the significance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, our Board has endorsed an ESG 
policy. We have taken a step further by empowering Risk Management Committee to oversee critical ESG matters. The 
Company has constituted Central Working Group and Site Working Groups to drive the ESG journey. These actions reflect 
our ongoing commitment to aligning our business practices with sustainable principles, ensuring a positive impact on the 
environment and society while upholding strong governance standards.

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director accountable for the Business Responsibility Report at AWHCL, I wish to emphasize our unwavering 
commitment to addressing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) challenges head-on. Our journey has been marked 
by both challenges and triumphs in these areas.
In terms of Environment, we have dedicated ourselves to enhancing waste management practices that minimize environmental 
impact and promote sustainability. We continue to target reductions in our carbon footprint, increased recycling rates, and 
the adoption of innovative technologies to optimize resource utilization.
On the Social front, we recognize the importance of fostering safe and inclusive working environments for our employees, 
while also engaging with local communities through initiatives that contribute positively to their well-being. Our goal is 
to maintain a transparent and communicative approach, listening to stakeholder feedback and incorporating it into our 
strategies.
Our commitment to strong Governance principles remains resolute, exemplified by our focus on ethical business conduct, 
regulatory compliance, and effective risk management. By maintaining a robust governance framework, we ensure our 
operations remain aligned with our broader ESG objectives.
The Company’s achievements in these areas underscore our dedication to sustainable growth and responsible business 
practices. However, we also acknowledge the evolving nature of ESG challenges, and we are steadfast in our pursuit of 
continuous improvement to create lasting positive impacts.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
	
Yes, the entity has a project related to reducing Greenhouse gas emissions. The Company’s PCMC Waste to Energy plant will 
generate ~14 MW of green energy by incinerating the MSW. The net power of about 11.9 MW will be exported to the grid for 
revenue generation. The greenhouse gas and methane generated in the Bioreactor Landfill (BLF) cells are then captured and 
electricity is generated. Also, methane and greenhouse gases are liberated at the leachate treatment plant and electricity is 
generated. Methane generated from the BLF cells technology process is collected and used as a renewable source for power 
generation and consumption, limiting the environmental risk due to methane emissions escape and hazard. The total GHG 
emissions avoided as a result of arresting Methane was to the tune of 3284 tCO2e during the financial year. Similarly, 1596.41 
MWh of electricity generated at the Kanjurmarg site through renewable sources has enabled the organisation to avoid GHG 
emissions to the tune of 1,293.09 tCO2e. The site at Kanjurmarg has been instrumental in generating a total Refuse Derived 
Fuel (RDF) of ~15,688 MT with a calorific value of ~4,000 Kcal/kg resulting in the avoidance of GHG emissions to the tune of 
~45,574 tCO2e.

If the entity has undertaken any specific initiatives or used innovative technology or solutions to improve resource 
efficiency, or reduce impact due to emissions / effluent discharge / waste generated, please provide details of the same 
as well as outcome of such initiatives, as per the following format:
	
Yes, AWHCL has initiatives to reduce impact due to emissions, effluent discharge and waste generated. The largest source of 
gaseous emissions is landfill methane (CH4), followed by nitrous oxide (N2O); besides minor emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
resulting from the incineration of waste containing fossil carbon (C) (plastic, synthetic textiles), emissions from transportation 
of wastes, and minor dust and particulate emissions due to manual sweeping. The site at Kanjurmarg is a 7,500 metric tons 
(MT)/ day Integrated Solid Waste Management facility based on Design, Build, Own, Operate, and Transfer (DBOOT) model, 
comprises of a Material Recovery Facility (MRF), a Bioreactor Landfill, a Compost, a Leachate Treatment Plant, and a Sanitary 
Landfill. As part of the project, MRF technology has been implemented to segregate the waste before it enters the composting 
unit. After this segregation, selected materials are sent to the composting plant, and Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), recyclable 
plastics, metals, and rejects get sorted out. 3000-6500 tons per day (TPD) of mixed municipal solid waste is then sent to the 
bioreactor landfill generating leachate and methane. The leachate gets recirculated back to the cells and the excess leachate 
is further treated in the Leachate Treatment Plant. The recirculation into the waste makes the waste degradation quicker and 
the process reduces the greenhouse gas emission at the site as per regulatory compliance.
