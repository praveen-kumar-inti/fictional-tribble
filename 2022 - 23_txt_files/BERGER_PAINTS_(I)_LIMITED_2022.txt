Management committee reviews the specific concern for relevant actions such as Installation of safety devices, monitoring and 
assessment procedures, if required the activity is suspended until proper measures are ensured. 
	
To address significant risks and concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions following 
measures are in place 
•	
Developing a comprehensive Health & Safety Management System (HSMS) to ensure that all employees are aware of their 
responsibilities and the risks associated with their work.
•	
Establishing a Health & Safety Committee to review and monitor safety performance and ensure that any risks and concerns 
are addressed.
 •	
Introducing a range of safety training programmes to ensure that all employees are aware of their responsibilities and the risks 
associated with their work. 
•	
Implementing a range of safety initiatives to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries, such as ensuring proper Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance and the use of safety signage and warning systems. 
•	
Carrying out regular risk assessments to identify any potential hazards and take appropriate action to reduce or eliminate them. 
•	
Working with external health and safety consultants to review and update safety policies and procedures.
 •	
Establishing a safety culture within the organisation to ensure that safety is given the highest priority.
	
Taking learnings from the Styrene gas leakage in Vizag, additional safety POKA-YOKE measures were put for monomer handling 
150
at the units like 5 Tier safety system for unloading of monomers, regular testing of polymerisation, automatic changeover for 
chilling units, alarm and visual indication for styrene tank temperature, etc.
	
The fire which broke at our Howrah based unit was also taken as a learning and for all Air conditioning units at other factories were 
ensured to be of FLP type with automatic changeover relay between two units and continuous room temperature monitoring with 
SMS detection features. 
	
Similar to this the accident which occurred at our Jejuri plant invoked many further safety measures to ensure that systems are 
mistake proofed for any human error. Ball Mill interlock for charging was innovatively developed and deployed at all locations 
with existing controls for static discharging and administrative control over deploying workers inside factory & visual identification 
based access control to work being deployed.

9.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Company has launched a project WOW (War On Waste) under Manufacturing excellence umbrella which aims at 4R (Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, Recreate) under which reduction of waste at source, Sticky loss recovery, powder RM reuse in batches and recreate 
a usable RM from waste is being done and system is set in place to monitor the process and ensure that no such material sent out 
as waste.
	
For filling operation all our plants have shifted towards use of automatics machines, where the chance of spillage is very less. 
Excess/less filing is stopped which could result in product rejection due to tinting.

Annual Report 2022-23
	
Defect prevention is targeted in products through RFT (Right First Time) implementation to minimize process waste generation.
	
Washing solvent generated from washing of equipment is being reused in subsequent production batches. Spent solvent is reused 
for cleaning purpose and after multiple such uses, fresh solvent is recovered in-house from waste solvent through distillation 
process. The recovered fresh solvent is recycled into paint manufacturing process related activities. ‘19th barrel syndrome’ – 
project taken to limit generation of washing solvent at plant so within 18 barrels washing solvent generated gets reused in washing.
	
Barrels used for production and storage purposes are re-used - another step towards Carbon Footprint reduction.
	
Plastic waste from raw material packaging and damaged packaging material is sent to an authorised plastic recycler. Under Plastic 
Waste management rules, Berger Paints has established action plan as per our EPR obligations and carried out the compliance for 
recycling with company appointed WMA (Waste Management Agencies). Also, recycled plastic content is used in our product 
packaging which ensured that use of virgin plastic can be reduced. 
	
Waste generated inside the plant is being collected and disposed through approved Cement plants for co-processing.
	
Powder collected from Dust extraction system is reused in making economy grade products.
	
Project JAL has been taken ahead by the plants to curb wastage of water and which has helped to save on an average of 2.88 lac 
Litres of water daily.
	
Through Project PARAGON our in-transit damages have reduced significantly causing lesser harm to environment and better 
storage condition at the depots.
	
We have also implemented a number of waste reduction initiatives, such as reducing packaging, using recycled materials, and 
encouraging employees to reduce their own waste. We have implemented a number of waste recycling programs, such as paper, 
plastic, Container segregation and its best utilization. These initiatives help us to reduce our environmental impact and ensure that 
our products and processes are safe and sustainable.

Sr. No
Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be provided along-
with summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Zero Liquid Discharge 
System
From the Effluent Treatment Plants installed at all of our Units, 
the treated water was earlier released after the characteristics 
of the effluent water were met as per the PCB recommendation 
but, to recycle & reuse that water & thereby, to reduce the water 
consumption of the Units, we have also installed ZLD (Zero Liquid 
Discharge) systems at applicable units which consists of various 
Filtration units along with RO module & MEE (Multiple Effect 
Evaporator). After treating the effluent water coming from ETP, 
through ZLD system, this water is used for domestic & industrial 
utility application.
1) Zero discharge of liquid 
effluent & reuse of the same 
after treatment.
2) Reduction of Water 
consumption
2
Effluent Treatment 
Plants in all Berger 
Units, with Activated 
Sludge Process & 
Tertiary Treatment.
Essentially, the paints manufacturing process, as such, does not 
directly generate any wastewater streams to cause any water 
pollution. However, at a typical paints manufacturing facility, the 
wastewater streams generated from the operations include those from 
equipment cleaning/reactor washing and from the support utilities. 
These waste water are collected from their respective point of 
generation & transferred to the ETP’s with Activated Sludge Process 
& Tertiary Treatment, where these are treated to maintain level for 
certain parameters like BOD, COD, TDS, TSS etc. within the limits 
prescribed by the PCB.
Reduction of BOD, COD, TSS 
etc. to the maximum extent in 
the treated water, to maintain 
the same within the prescribed 
limit of PCB.
3
Usage of Bio-Fuel 
instead of Diesel for the 
Thermic Fluid Heaters 
of Resin Plants.
In the Resin Plants, Thermic Fluid Heaters are used to supply process 
heat to the Reactors. Earlier we used Diesel as the fuel for this 
Thermic Fluid Heaters but now we have replaced the Diesel fired 
Heaters by Bio-fuel fired Heaters like use of Ground nut pellets, 
cashew nuts pellets, Sugarcane baggase, etc. with fully automatic 
closed loop charging system. Bio-fuel being much greener fuel 
compared to Diesel, the Carbon foot print & Green House gas 
emission has reduced dramatically, apart from the huge monetary 
savings obtained.
1) Reduction of huge amount 
carbon foot print.
2) Reduction of Green House 
gas emission.
4
Usage of PNG 
(CLEANER –Fuel) 
instead of  LSHS for the 
Thermic Fluid Heaters 
of Resin Plants and 
DUAL Fuel KIT PNG 
Based for operation of 
DG Set
1. PNG Cleaner Fuel has been used by replacing LSHS /HSD/ FO 
Pollutant Fuel earlier being used for operation of Resin Thermopac, 
which is much cleaner fuel means that it produces fewer emissions 
and pollutants when burned. This helps to reduce air pollution 
and improve air quality. 2. PNG is also more efficient than LSHS, 
meaning that it requires less fuel to generate the same amount of 
heat. This can result in lower operating costs for the thermic fluid 
heater. 3. PNG is also a safer fuel than LSHS, as it is non-toxic and 
lighter than air. This reduces the risk of fire and other accidents in 
the workplace. 4. Finally, PNG is a more sustainable fuel than LSHS, 
as it is derived from Fossils fuels and very cleaner fuel not left any 
residue .This helps to reduce the environmental impact of the thermic 
fluid heater.
1) Reduction of huge amount 
carbon foot print.
2) Reduction of Green House 
gas emission.

Usage of energy 
efficient, automatic Dust 
Extraction systems in 
Paint Plants
During manufacturing of Paints, Putty & allied products, lot of 
dusts are generated inside shop floor during Powder Raw material 
charging in the equipment, which is not hygienic for the shop floor 
environment. To arrest the same, we have implemented automatic, 
energy efficient Dust Extraction systems along with suitable Bag 
Filters to control the Dust emission to the atmosphere also within the 
prescribed limit of PCB.
1) Clean shop floor 
environment
2) Controlled Dust emission 
within the prescribed limit by 
PCB.
6
Usage of energy 
efficient, automatic 
Fume Extraction 
systems in Resin Plants
During manufacturing of Resins, at different stages of the process, 
fumes are generated during charging of Raw Materials, which makes 
the environment difficult for the operators. To capture these fumes, 
we have installed automatic, energy efficient Fume Extraction 
systems in all of our Resin Plants along with Counter Current Water 
Scrubber. The effluent water from the Scrubber is sent to ETP for 
further treatment.
1) Reduced VOC levels in the 
shop floor.
2) Healthy Work environment.
7
Project JAL
Taken across all our units with target to reduce our ETP intake water 
by 50% through re-using measures,  arresting leakages and spread 
awareness on less wastage of water and proper accounting.
1) 2.88 Lac Litres of water 
saved daily
2) No need to enhance ETP 
capacity with increase in 
production load
