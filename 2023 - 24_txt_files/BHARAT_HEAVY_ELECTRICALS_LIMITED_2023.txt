products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) 
E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.  
	
BHEL products fall under capital goods category where 
product life goes beyond 25 years in majority of cases. 
The market requirement is for extension of the life of 
products or systems through process of refurbishments. 
After end of desired life of capital goods, they become 
unfit for reuse and hence being disposed as scrap by 
owner of the capital good products.

is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with

steps taken to address the same.

If there are any significant social or environmental

3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material 
to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for 
service industry).
	
Company’s manufacturing processes generate fair 
amount of metal scrap, however engineering measures 
are taken to minimize waste generation. The scrap 
subsequently undergoes recycling within the company 
and is reused. For example, Central Foundry Forge 
Plant (CFFP) in Haridwar manufactures Steel Forgings 
and Castings for which steel scrap is a major raw 
material. Reusable material is also used in packaging 
manufactured goods.
	
The value of such recycled/reused items is not being 
captured at the moment.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of 
life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, 
recycled, and safely disposed, as per the following 
format: 
	
BHEL’s business is B2B in nature and products/ systems 
we supply fall under capital goods category with long 
lifecycle (25 years and beyond). All the associated 
packaging material for supplies become the property 
of our customers that spread across the country and 
abroad. In this given situation, it is not feasible to reclaim 
the product (end of life) or packaging material from the 
customer.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing 
Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
Yes. BHEL has set up nearly 35 MWp of capacity of Solar 
Power plants including rooftop ones which has helped the 
organization in reducing its GHG Emissions. This large-scale 
solarisation has helped us in carbon footprint avoidance to 
the tune of 23,033 MTCO2-equivalent during FY 2023-24.
Furthermore, conventional burners of reheat furnaces are 
replaced with regenerative based combustion system at 
CFFP Haridwar. This has been implemented in 6 numbers of 
reheat furnaces with a potential of annual savings of 30% in 
fuel consumption (~ 27.60 lakhs m3)
Energy conservation/ efficiency related projects are 
regular feature in our units which helps us in demand side 
management of energy and consequently reducing the 
associated carbon emission which would have occurred 
otherwise at enhanced level

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
In our manufacturing activity, reduction of waste 
generation is taken as a very important activity, and 
our nesting plan for cutting of metal sheet is prepared 
accordingly. However, once the scrap is generated, it is 
either used in the local foundry shop for making castings/ 
forgings or sent to authorized recycler for melting into the 
furnace for avoidance of new raw material consumption.
Across BHEL, solid wastes/ scrap having resale value were 
collected, segregated, stored and sold to authorized recyclers. 
Some of it, not having any resale value, is used for filling up 
low lying areas. Hazardous wastes/ e-waste are disposed of 
as per the stipulations in the relevant statutes.
The hazardous waste generated at units are disposed as 
per the regulatory requirement and necessary records for 
scrutiny of authority is duly maintained. Hazardous waste, 
which can be used outside, is sent to authorized recyclers. 
Rest of the hazardous waste, which is to be incinerated or 
buried in secured landfill, is sent to Treatment Storage and 
Disposal Facility (TSDF) of their respective states for ultimate 
disposal of such hazardous wastes.

Zero Liquid Discharge
For prevention of water pollution and 
sustainable management of wastewater 
the company has established 20 Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs) and 19 Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs). Through these ETPs/
STPs effluent is treated and reused inside 
our premises for process, toilet flushing,

our 11 units as Zero Liquid Discharge entities.
Due to non-discharge of 
effluent outside the premises, 
company has avoided land and 
water pollution

During 2023-24, BHEL became a part of 
World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) one trillion 
trees initiative by taking a pledge on 1t.org. 
It is a World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) 
initiative aiming to empower the reforestation 
community and ensure the conservation 
and restoration of one trillion trees. BHEL 
has taken a pledge to conserve 3 million 
existing trees in its campuses and augment 
the same further by planting more saplings. 
Company has created 3 Miyawaki forests at 
manufacturing units in this regard.
The initiative has led to 
development of nice verdant 
cover in BHEL premises. 
As a consequence, lower 
temperature is observed in 
BHEL premises as compared 
to surroundings and increased 
biodiversity.
As a responsible global citizen, the organization acknowledges the relation between Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and 
climate change. To address this global challenge, BHEL has been putting efforts in reducing carbon footprint of its products and 
services, thereby enabling the customers to generate power in a sustainable manner, with reduced environmental footprints over 
the life cycle of the plant. In internal operations also, the organization is putting a major thrust on energy efficiency and use of 
renewable energy sources. The company has established a total of 35 MWp of Solar Photo Voltaic (ground mounted and roof-
top) plants at various BHEL locations which have helped the company in making its energy mix more sustainable. Company’s 
inventory of renewable application also includes solar water heaters, solar street lighting etc. The Company has also taken a 
number of projects related to water and energy conservation, tree plantation, waste management, resource conservation, etc.
