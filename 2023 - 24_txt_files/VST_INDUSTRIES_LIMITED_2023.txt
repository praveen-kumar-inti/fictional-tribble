ESG pillars:
	
Responsible Governance: We maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity in dealing with our 
stakeholders and comply with the applicable laws, rules and regulations, as a responsible corporate citizen. 
Our policies and risk management framework provide guidance to preemptively identify, manage and 
mitigate business risks. While product integrity is a key focus area, we put equal impetus on reducing the 
negative impacts on the environment due to product manufacturing and packaging.
	
Sustainable Operations: We have made significant progress in integrating sustainability practices into 
our operations across all relevant stages. We continue to optimize natural resource use in our processes 
and products and aim to further improve our environmental performance aligned with technology-related 
advancement and evolving stakeholder expectations. Our Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy 
establishes and showcases our vision to go beyond the required compliances, legislations, and regulations. 
The management and employees jointly work together to accomplish our common goal of achieving a 
safe, healthy, and environment-friendly workplace. Both manufacturing facilities have a well-established 
environment management system which are also ISO 14001:2015 certified. Our Toopran unit received 
Platinum Rating IGBC Green factory building Certification from CII, IGBC Hyderabad. During the reported 
period, our Toopran facility was honored with the AWS "Gold certification," a milestone that we view as 
a significant contribution to sustainable water management. The goals of AWS encompass improving 
water governance, enhancing water quality, and promoting responsible water usage within industries and 
communities. Aligned with AWS's principles, we have identified relevant risks, engaged with the appropriate 
stakeholders, and developed action plans catered on water reduction strategies, as well as increasing water 
availability through harvesting and recycling techniques. We also maintain our rainwater harvesting share 
at 2.47 times the net water consumption in our own facilities. Additionally, renewable energy catered to 
approximately 25% of our electricity requirements during the FY23-24.
	
Care for People: At VST, we have focused at fostering high-performance culture to achieve exceptional 
business growth. Throughout this endeavor, we harness the pride, passion, and resilience of our dedicated 
employees, which form an integral part of our organizational culture. We prioritize on the wellness of our 
employees and provide distinctive career opportunities. As an equal opportunity employer, our recruitment 
procedures are consistent and fair towards potential employees based on caste, religion, disability, gender, 
sexual orientation, race, colour, ancestry, marital status, or affiliation with a political, religious, or union 
organisation or majority/ minority group. We are committed towards Zero Harm, we guarantee a workspace 
that is free from safety hazards by implementing safe work procedures, promoting a robust safety culture, 
and monitoring and controlling unsafe work conditions. To uphold high standards of health and safety, 
we have developed and implemented the Health & Safety Management system in accordance with ISO 
45001 requirements.

Sustainable Agriculture: Our sustainable development strategy revolves around generating value that 
benefits business, society, and the environment. A primary focus area is sustainable agriculture, which 
promotes responsible practices across the supply chain. This includes implementing good agricultural 
practices on a large scale to safeguard the environment, enhance farmer livelihoods, and bolster the 
resilience and well-being of farming communities.
	
The Farmer Handbook details these practices, supported by field technicians who offer ongoing guidance 
to farmers. Utilizing the GMS mobile application, these technicians oversee various farming activities to 
ensure adherence to agricultural labor practices and environmental standards. Data gathered through the 
GMS application is analyzed to monitor progress towards achieving sustainability objectives. 48% of our 
contracted farmers are GMS compliant.
	
We also take initiatives to enhance farmer resilience and livelihood. In this regard, we have made considerable 
achievements like, 48% of the contracted farmers have been trained in our ALP code and 48% of the 
contracted farmers have access to PPE kits to prevent themselves from GTS (Green Tobacco Sickness). In 
addition to this, we have been able to implement mechanization of field preparation and removal of stubbles 
for 100% of area under tobacco.
	
Inclusive Growth: We are dedicated to creating shared value and promoting inclusive growth for all our 
stakeholders throughout the entire value chain. We work closely with the local communities around the 
manufacturing facilities to identify the direct and indirect impacts of our operations on these communities 
and undertake development initiatives accordingly. The CSR policy and initiatives reflect our vision, mission, 
thrust areas and lists out various thematic areas for CSR implementation. We focus on rural development, 
health & sanitation, education and environment and sustainability through our CSR activities. Additionally, 
as a responsible corporate citizen, we continue to adhere to COTPA guidelines, for packaging and labelling, 
advertising, and promotion.
	
By dedicating resources in these thematic areas, we aim to create a positive and lasting impact that 
goes beyond immediate business interests. At VST, we work by collaborating with local stakeholders, 
understanding their needs, and contributing to their well-being while also advancing our ESG goals.

 We are committed to fostering strong and mutually advantageous 
relationships with partners along the value chain. By collaborating 
closely with suppliers, we identify opportunities for improvement 
and also provides guidance to retailers and wholesalers on adhering 
to COTPA regulations related to packaging, labeling, advertising, 
and sales promotion. A longstanding and vital component of our 
business growth is the deep-rooted partnership with the tobacco 
farming community. Our dedication to the sustainable livelihoods 
of farmers is evident in the promotion of good agricultural practices. 
These practices not only enhance crop yield but also bring 
environmental benefits. To support this, we have deployed field 
technicians who provide training and advice on various agricultural 
methods, such as soil, water, and nutrient management, cropping 
techniques, integrated pest management, and environmentally 
friendly curing processes.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
We have established comprehensive procedures for the sustainable sourcing of tobacco leaves and stems, 
ensuring a responsible supply chain that aligns with both environmental and social standards. By entering 
long-term contracts with farmers, we mandate compliance with applicable labor laws as outlined in the 
Agriculture Labour Practices (ALP) code, along with adherence to the good agricultural practices specified 
in the farmer handbook. Field technicians play a crucial role in educating farmers about these requirements 
and offer the necessary guidance to implement these practices effectively. To facilitate monitoring and 
data collection on farmer progress, field technicians utilize the GMS application, which aids in evaluating 
compliance across various measures such as seedbed management, transplanting, and crop protection, 
among others.
	
Our commitment to sustainability in the tobacco supply chain is evident through several key practices:
	
Toxicity and Pollution Control: By securing early purchases from farms and promoting natural conditions 
for de-raking tobacco leaves, we ensure low levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs).
	
Pesticide Usage: The provision of Crop Protection Agents (CPAs) approved by the Central Insecticides 
Board ensures that farmers use only recommended pesticides in prescribed doses, with tobacco leaves 
undergoing CPA residue analysis to maintain safety thresholds.
	
Soil Nutrient Management: Encouraging practices like crop rotation, usage of left over crop residue to 
enhance soil’s organic carbon and the addition of farmyard manure enhances soil health, contributing to 
sustainable cultivation.
	
Curing Processes: The adoption of sun curing by most farmers, and the efficient use of fuel in fire curing by 
others, reflects your efforts to minimize environmental impact while improving curing efficiency.
	
Non-tobacco Related Material (NTRM) Removal: Through vigilant monitoring during the bailing process 
and the use of NTRM sorters in factories, we ensure the purity and quality of the tobacco bales.
	
Health and Safety Measures: The distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and the provision 
of water for sanitation purposes safeguard against Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS) among farmers.
	
Human Rights Protection: Implementing the ALP code allows for regular monitoring and review of the 
tobacco supply chain to prevent discrimination, child labor, forced labor, and to ensure the payment of 
minimum wages and safe working conditions.
	
These practices underline our dedication to promoting sustainable and ethical practices throughout the 
supply chain, ensuring the well-being of farmers and the environment, and maintaining high standards of 
quality and safety in our products.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees 
and worker? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief.
Yes/No (If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers 
 We have implemented a structured mechanism to handle grievances from both 
permanent and non-permanent staff. This system is pivotal in nurturing trust and 
fostering a positive work culture by encouraging feedback aimed at improving 
the workplace.
Moreover, we undertake employee satisfaction surveys every 3 years, focused 
on six critical aspects: cultivating a positive work atmosphere, establishing trust 
in leadership, improving teamwork and communication, ensuring supportive 
management, engaging employees in meaningful tasks, and creating opportunities 
for professional development.
We also interact with our employees through Town Halls on a quarterly basis 
and have established a whistleblower policy and a POSH policy. We are highly 
supportive of our employees in addressing their issues and concerns, empowering 
managers to largely address the challenges employees may face.

We conduct environmental and social assessments for our tobacco farmers, with a special focus on ensuring 
their health and safety as well as improving their working conditions. A particular area of concern within the 
tobacco supply chain is the risk associated with Green Tobacco Sickness (GTS). In efforts to mitigate this 
risk, we place a strong emphasis on continuous education and supervision of farmers regarding the critical 
importance of wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the harvesting and curing stages. In 
FY 23-24, we have been able to provide PPE kits to 48% of our farmers. Going ahead, the goal is to assess 
the farmers through our sustainable supply chain assessment framework.
	
We also take measures to ensure that the farmers are trained in safe disposal of CPA. Our field technicians 
are responsible for monitoring compliance of contracted farmers and assisting with crop registration, 
providing expert guidance on nursery management and plantation activities, overseeing baling operations, 
and facilitating efficient purchasing transactions. Field technicians use mobile apps for data entry, ensuring 
accurate information is recorded in GMS, thus driving successful crop outcomes through comprehensive 
support and monitoring.

based on stakeholder concerns. We engage in a continuous process of evaluating material topics that are an 
integral part of our inclusive business strategy. This process involves identifying the common issues across 
the business, consulting with internal and external stakeholders and prioritizing the material topics. During 
FY 2023-24 the environmental and social topics were reviewed following the process given below:
	
•	
Identification: We identified an initial list of material topics through learning from our industry peers, 
referring to the sector specific material topics recommended by key global and national ESG standards 
and frameworks.
	
•	
Stakeholder consultations: We invited key internal and external stakeholders to participate in a 
structured consultation process and recorded their response on the impact and influence of each 
material topic.
	
•	
Prioritization: Post senior management review, followed by recommendations of ESG Council, the 
Board of Directors reviewed and approved the final list of material topics for the organization.
	
•	
Result: As a result of stakeholder consultation for material topics, existing policies were modified 
and new policies were framed, wherever required. Existing policies and SOPs were also relooked at to 
include the conclusions and observations arising from stakeholder engagement process evaluation of 
the working of its policies.

in advanced farming methods, we aim to boost farmers' productivity and sustainability. Additionally, 
we are also engaged in several initiatives intended to enhance living conditions within tobacco-growing 
communities. In pursuit to enhance social equity, our CSR programs are focused on rural development, 
health and sanitation, education and environment and sustainability. Some of the CSR activities include 
installing household toilets and implementing solar street lighting, upliftment of women farmer self-
help groups and farmer training in modern farming techniques. These activities are crafted to elevate the 
standard of living for farmers and their families by providing essential sanitation facilities and dependable, 
eco-friendly lighting solutions.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or 
issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. The Audit Committee oversees the examination of issues reported by employees through the 
Whistleblower mechanism. This mechanism encourages employees to voice any concerns regarding human 
rights abuses, including harassment, victimization, bullying, and discrimination, for thorough investigation 
and satisfactory grievance resolution.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
We have implemented a Whistleblower mechanism to enable individuals to safely report any issues 
concerning human rights violations directly to management without the fear of retaliation, through a 
specified email or contact details. This system also allows employees and Directors to directly reach out to 
the Chairperson of the Audit Committee in special circumstances. To ensure ethical practices and adherence 
to human rights standards as defined in the ALP code in our tobacco supply chain, we have deployed field 
technicians on the ground to continually survey farm holdings for any breaches. When human rights abuses 
are identified, they are logged through the GMS application. Subsequently, we undertake fitting measures 
based on severity of the situation to address the issue.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ 
web link.
	
We are dedicated to developing and sustaining a comprehensive Business Continuity Management System 
(BCMS) aimed at ensuring the resilience of our business activities. In pursuit of this goal, we have crafted a 
holistic BCMS that identifies potential threats to our operations and crafts effective strategies to mitigate 
their effects. This system is seamlessly integrated with our operational and technological processes 
throughout the organization, facilitating the swift restoration of business functions post-disruption to 
minimize adverse impacts on our operations, customers, and stakeholders, while also protecting the brand 
and reputation.
	
The goal is to create, implement, practice, and uphold Business Continuity Plans for essential business 
functions, ensuring they remain operational despite acceptable levels of disruption. Efforts are underway to 
enhance business continuity awareness among all employees and relevant parties via training sessions and 
consultations. We are committed to routinely assess the effectiveness of the BCMS to foster continuous 
enhancement and instill a culture of business continuity within the Company.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. 
What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
To promote responsible tobacco sourcing, we mandate adherence to our stringent audit processes defined 
in the Sustainable Tobacco Programme across the supply chain. Our agreements with farmers are structured 
to meet these standards, with compliance monitored by field technicians utilizing the GMS application to 
oversee farmers' adherence to both their contractual responsibilities and audit criteria.
	
Detailed below are the principal environmental risks tied to our tobacco value chain, alongside our 
approaches to mitigating these risks:
	
I.	
Waste Management: Tobacco cultivation necessitates substantial use of agrochemicals; the containers 
of these agrochemicals pose environmental risks. Our contracts include directives for the proper 
disposal of these containers. Farmers must thrice-rinse emptied containers, draining the rinse into 
the spray tank, then puncture the container to deter reuse. Finally, the container should be disposed 
of or recycled following the manufacturer's guidelines and/or national laws. Approximately, 48% of 
our contracted farmers have received training on use of agrochemicals and their safe disposal. Going 
forward, we are planning to encourage the use of bio-fertilizers and the distribution of CPA storage 
boxes and CPA waste collection boxes to the contracted farmers.
	
II.	
Water Management: A segment of our farmers relies on irrigation for tobacco cultivation. To address 
this concern, we are enhancing access to micro-sprinklers and drip irrigation systems to reduce water 
use and augment soil water retention via green manuring. During FY2023-24, 38.6% of our nurseries 
have been equipped with micro-sprinklers for irrigation.
	
III.	 Climate Change: The prevalent method for curing tobacco leaves globally is flue curing, leading to 
significant deforestation for firewood. In our supply chain, most farmers adopt sun curing, reducing the 
risk to biodiversity. During FY2023-24 the proportion of tobacco leaf purchased that was cured at no 
risk of deforestation of primary and protected forests stood at 100%. For the minority employing flue 
curing, we are reducing the environmental impact by encouraging the use of agricultural by-products 
like tobacco stalks, maize husk, sawdust, sunflower heads, groundnut shells, and cotton stalks as 
firewood alternatives. Going forward we also plan to encourage our farmers to use biofertilizers.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for 
environmental impacts.
	
14% of our value chain partners, including material suppliers and contract farmers, undergo continuous 
assessment based on environmental criteria.
