Risk
Security and protection of 
customer data is crucial to

Our

heavily on its technology 
infrastructure. As majority of 
transactions are processed 
digitally, it increases cyber/
information security risks.
Our Company has a strong Information 
and cyber security policy wherein cyber 
risk and its mitigation are monitored and 
updated. The IT Strategy Committee 
and  Board of Directors reviews and 
approves any updates in data and 
customer privacy related matters. The 
Chief Information Officer (CIO) and 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) 
are responsible for the Company’s 
data and customer privacy and take 
decisions on any related issues. Plans 
for managing data privacy matters have 
been constituted, like Cyber Security 
Emergency Response Plan (CSERP), to 
adapt/mitigate any data and customer 
privacy related occurrences. 
We have increased efforts to update 
employees, 
customers 
and 
other 
stakeholders of any potential cyber 
frauds, data privacy etc. Informative 
materials on data and customer privacy 
are shared via mail, SMS and on social 
media.

discrimination and harassment cases, which outlines unacceptable behavior and the consequences for violating 
the policies. These are communicated to all the employees and regular training is provided to ensure everyone 
understands the policies and knows how to report any incidents. 
The organization encourages employees to report any incidents of discrimination or harassment without any 
fear of retaliation. Employees have been made aware of the reporting mechanisms available to them, such as 
the hotline and internal grievance redressal committee.
The organization promptly investigates all reported incidents of discrimination or harassment. The investigations 
are conducted in a fair and impartial manner, and all parties involved are given the opportunity to present their 
side of the story. If an incident of discrimination or harassment is found to have occurred, the organization takes 
appropriate action based on the severity of the incident and the policy violation. This includes disciplinary action 
such as suspension or termination of employment and providing support to the victim.
A whistleblower policy is in place where an employee can raise a complaint anonymously. Throughout the 
investigation it is ensured that the complainant's ID is not disclosed. It is ensured that each complaint raised is 
proactively investigated and resolved quickly. 
Our Company has developed a work environment that is respectful, supportive, and inclusive, by providing 
regular training on diversity and inclusion, promoting a culture of respect and providing support to employees 
who may have experienced discrimination or harassment.
