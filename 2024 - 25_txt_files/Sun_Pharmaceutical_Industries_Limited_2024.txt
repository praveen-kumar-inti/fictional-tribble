Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders,
It is my pleasure to present our Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY2024-25. This BRSR 
highlights our focus on sustainability, our priorities, our goals 
and achievements. As we continue to integrate sustainability 
principles within our business, our overall focus is on 
delivering sustainable outcomes and long-term value for all 
our stakeholders.
I am happy to let you know that Sun Pharma has been included 
in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2025. Sun Pharma 
has qualified in the Top 5% of pharmaceutical companies 
assessed by S&P globally for this Yearbook. Within respective 
industries, this Yearbook aims to distinguish those companies 
that have demonstrated strengths in corporate sustainability. 
This recognition attests to Sun Pharma’s commitment to 
incorporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles through focused initiatives across its businesses.
Access to healthcare is a key focus area for us, underpinned by 
our core value of “Reaching People. Touching Lives”. Sustained 
investments in R&D, our diverse product portfolio and global 
presence enables us to deliver high-quality medicines for 
unmet patient needs.
Sun Pharma is dedicated to reducing environmental impacts 
and combating climate change. From improving energy 
efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy, to 
strengthening water conservation initiatives and advancing 
sustainable waste management, we are committed to reducing 
our environmental footprint.
We aim to achieve a 35% reduction in our absolute Scope 
1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 2030, compared to the 
baseline year of 2020 and have achieved a 24.69% reduction 
in our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions till date, 
compared to the baseline year of 2020. We continue to invest 
in projects in renewable energy and for our energy saving 
initiatives. Renewable energy now accounts for 49.77% in our 
overall energy mix. Our target of a 10% reduction in our water 
consumption by 2025, compared to the baseline year of 2020, 
has been achieved ahead of time with a 31.70% reduction in 
water consumption till date.
Our people are one of the key drivers of our success. Attracting, 
retaining and nurturing a highly diverse and skilled workforce 
are key focus areas for us. We continue to invest in the 
development and well-being of our employees. Respecting 
human rights is a fundamental value at Sun Pharma. We 
promote inclusion amongst our workforce by focusing on equal 
opportunities, non-discrimination and merit-based processes 
and we have set a diversity target to achieve 30% women 
representation across our global workforce by 2040.
Ensuring safety of our workforce is a key priority for us. Our 
multi-pronged approach targeted at workforce safety includes, 
health and safety training across all our locations and nurturing 
a culture of awareness and responsible behaviour. Our 
comprehensive Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy 
drives best-in-class safety practices at our operations. We also 
carry out various health and safety related training programs 
across all our locations directed at creating a culture of safety, 
awareness and responsible  behaviour.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives for 
the local communities are focused on areas like healthcare, 
education, water & sanitation, rural development, and 
environmental conservation. We implement focused and 
socially responsible initiatives with the objective of holistic 
development of our local communities. Furthermore, our CSR 
programs are designed to contribute towards the realisation 
of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN 
SDGs). For the reporting year we spent ` 508.34 million on CSR 
initiatives touching over 1 million lives.
Our comprehensive corporate governance framework 
underpins our commitment to uphold the highest standards 
of ethical governance and enabling sustainable outcomes 
for all our stakeholders. We continue to focus on increasing 
transparency and fostering reliability, trust and consistency. 
The Corporate Governance & ESG Committee, a sub-
committee of the Board, has oversight on our ESG initiatives. In 
addition, the Board has constituted various other committees 
with clearly defined roles and responsibilities to ensure 
effective implementation of corporate policies and other 
matters. We also have a robust grievance redressal mechanism 
to address all concerns from our stakeholders promptly and 
securely. Our Global Whistleblower Policy provides a safe way 
for all stakeholders to report any misconduct or violation of 
our Global Code of Conduct and other policies. Complaints 
regarding product quality, adverse events, or other issues can 
be submitted on our website without fear of reprisal.
We continue to be a member of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) supporting the 10 principles covering human 
rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption and we are 
committed to ensure that these principles are a part of our 
overall business strategy.
As we continue on this ESG journey, we welcome your feedback 
and suggestions.

Aalok Shanghvi

Financial implications of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Corporate 
Governance 
and Business 
Ethics
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Failure to maintain and 
uphold the highest standards 
of corporate governance and 
business ethics could result in 
regulatory consequences as well 
as financial and reputational 
damage
Opportunity: Compliance and 
alignment with ethical and 
responsible governance practices 
and standards will result in the 
sustainable creation of long-term 
value for all stakeholders.
1.    Consistent and regular engagement 
with regulatory agencies in all our 
markets, to ensure compliance and 
reduce any possibility of non-
compliance.
2.   Focused and regular training is 
provided to all staff members to 
ensure strict compliance with the 
Company’s business ethics and Global 
Code of Conduct. Strong focus is 
also given to quality control at all 
operational locations to maintain 
cGMP compliance.
Positive: The Company’s 
commitment to ethical and 
responsible business practices 
and continual regulatory 
compliance will be positively 
regarded by stakeholders, 
enhancing our reputation as an 
ethical corporate citizen.
Negative: Noncompliance 
with regulatory standards may 
adversely affect the Company’s 
reputation and long-term 
business continuity.
2.
Product 
Quality, Safety 
and Recall 
Management
Risk
Risk: As a pharmaceutical 
Company, we are highly 
vulnerable to product quality 
and safety concerns. Hence, it 
is imperative to address risks 
associated with product quality 
and operational safety.
1.   Ensure continued and strict compliance 
with global quality standards & 
protocols and the applicable local 
regulatory requirements.
2.    Provide for robust and centralised 
pharmacovigilance systems with 
thorough Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) to ensure effective 
monitoring and reporting of adverse 
events.
3.    Regular investment in technological 
advancement, training programs on 
current Good Manufacturing Practices 
(cGMP), automation, digitalisation, and 
employee skill development.
4.    Undertake detailed and regular quality 
assessments of third-party suppliers.
5.    Implement measures to protect our 
brand (intellectual property and 
trademarks) and combat counterfeiting, 
for ensuring the authenticity of our 
products in the market.
Positive: Sustaining the highest 
standards of product quality 
and safety builds the Company’s 
reputation with stakeholders 
and improves our brand image 
positively.
Negative: Significant concerns 
with product safety and quality 
could lead to recalls and 
regulatory alerts, temporarily 
impair business operations, 
and harm our reputation and 
brand. It could also result in legal 
repercussions, fines and penalties.
3.
Cyber Security 
and Data 
Privacy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Any potential cybersecurity 
and data privacy risk/threat 
directly affects the security and 
integrity of the IT system of the 
entire business.
Opportunity: Providing for a 
secured IT network through a 
strong governance mechanism 
for data integrity, technology, 
and digitalisation, which in 
turn enhances productivity 
and facilitates continuity of 
operations and thereby enhance 
the business performance.
1.    Regular vulnerability assessments 
and simulated hacker attacks of our 
IT systems are undertaken to prevent 
breaches of Company or stakeholders’ 
data.
2.    We’ve implemented patch 
management, antivirus software, IT 
monitoring systems, and perimeter 
protection to reduce the risks 
associated with cyber security and 
data breaches. Furthermore, we 
regularly provide training to our 
staff members on cybersecurity and 
reaffirm this knowledge through 
recurring internal emails that address 
secure data practices, safeguarding 
against phishing emails, and averting 
hacker attacks.
Positive: Compliance and 
alignment with data security 
and privacy laws is maintained 
through adoption of cutting-
edge technology, digitalisation, 
and adherence to data integrity 
principles ingrained in our 
processes. This safeguards against 
data loss, enhances productivity, 
and fosters sustainable long-term 
growth.
Negative: The absence of 
a strong data integrity and 
security mechanism significantly 
increases the risk of data 
breaches, potentially leading to 
the loss of valuable data with 
potential adverse effects on the 
business. Breaches of customer/
stakeholder data may expose us 
to litigation, fines, and penalties.

Innovation 
Management
Opportunity
Opportunity: Investing in 
innovation and technology to 
develop and commercialise 
a robust product portfolio, 
including generics and specialty 
products, enables us to address 
unmet patient needs and enhance 
product accessibility in global 
markets.
Positive: Enhancing our portfolio 
with innovative products will 
effectively meet the unmet 
healthcare needs of patients 
globally and thereby enhancing 
access to new therapies. 
Furthermore, process innovation 
can lead to increased productivity 
and resource efficiency in our 
operations.
5.
Human Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Human Capital 
Development encompasses 
talent management, including 
acquisition, retention, and 
employee well-being. Failure 
to meet or exceed employee 
expectations may negatively 
impact employee retention, 
productivity, and business 
continuity, given our business’s 
dependence on the well-being of 
our people.
Opportunity: The Company’s 
emphasis on enhancing employee 
welfare and development 
underscores its commitment to 
human capital development. This 
fosters retention and attracts 
top talent, driving productivity, 
innovation, long-term business 
growth, and value creation for all 
stakeholders.
1.    We implement various initiatives to 
attract and retain talent, including 
global talent management programs, 
competitive compensation, fostering 
an inclusive work culture, and offering 
employee benefits programs.
2.    We have established a formal 
succession planning program for all 
leadership positions.
3.    We prioritise employee skill 
enhancement through continuous 
training and development 
opportunities.
Positive: Concentrated efforts 
on human capital development 
yield a motivated workforce with 
high retention and satisfaction 
rates. These indicators showcase 
the Company’s commitment 
to nurturing a positive work 
environment and underscore a 
proactive approach to workforce 
development, crucial for long-
term growth and sustainability.
Negative: Neglecting to meet 
employee expectations could 
lead to adverse long-term effects 
on productivity and hinder the 
Company’s growth trajectory.
6.
Access to and 
Affordability of 
Medicines
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Addressing challenges 
related to the product portfolio, 
accessibility, and pricing is crucial 
in the pharmaceutical sector. 
Limited access to medicines due 
to pricing and availability issues 
negatively affects society’s access 
to healthcare and may pose 
obstacles to aligning with the 
Company’s vision and long-term 
growth potential.
Opportunity: Leveraging our 
robust generic and specialty 
product portfolio alongside our 
global presence, the Company is 
well-equipped to enhance access 
to medicines worldwide and 
meet the increasing demand for 
pharmaceutical products.
1.    We prioritise building a robust and 
diversified product portfolio through 
improved cross-functional synergies, 
organisational capabilities, project 
management, and governance 
throughout the product lifecycle.
2.    We enhance our capabilities in both in-
licensing and out-licensing of products.
3.    Our focus lies on the development and 
commercialisation of complex generics 
and specialty products, among other 
priorities.
4.    We emphasise operational excellence 
programs aimed at improving yields, 
ensuring supply chain continuity, and 
maintaining sufficient inventory levels
Positive: The Company’s 
commitment to product 
innovation and research elevates 
brand value through a diverse 
range of accessible and affordable 
products. This strategy enables us 
to address unmet patient needs 
and extends access to low and 
middle-income countries.
Negative: Long-term brand 
value and growth prospects 
may suffer if the Company’s 
products become inaccessible or 
if expansion into new geographic 
markets is hindered.
7.
Environmental 
Impact 
Management
Risk
Risk: For the business to have a 
positive environmental impact, 
waste and water management 
are essential. To show that 
the business is dedicated to a 
sustainable future and a healthy 
world, concentrated efforts 
must be made to limit waste 
generation, consumption of 
water, and proper disposal.
1.    We continue to identify opportunities 
to minimise any adverse 
environmental effect from our 
operations. We have adopted targets 
for waste management and water 
conservation. Our targets are to 
reduce water consumption by 10% 
compared to baseline year of 2020 and 
to co-process 30% of hazardous waste 
by 2025.
2.    We closely monitor and track our 
waste management and water 
consumption. Our priorities are to 
increase water efficiency, decrease 
water withdrawal, and increase water 
recovery. For waste management, we 
focus on co-processing hazardous 
waste and increasing recycling and 
reuse within our own operations.
Negative: Neglecting 
environmental effects can result 
in unfavourable legal, regulatory, 
and financial repercussions, a 
decline in shareholder trust and 
reputation, and finally could lead 
to potential loss of an operating 
license.

8.
Climate Change Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: In the absence of effective 
management of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, the business 
could be at risk of Physical and 
transition risks associated with 
climate change that could cause 
operations to be disrupted and 
have an impact on business 
continuity.
Opportunity: Adopting new 
low-carbon technology will help 
build business resilience and 
opportunities for more effective 
manufacturing procedures.
1.    The Company has set a 35% reduction 
target for absolute carbon emissions 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 
compared to baseline of 2020.
2.    To identify and assess the physical and 
transitional risks associated with our 
operations, we have also undertaken 
climate risk assessments.
3.   By boosting the proportion of biomass, 
obtaining renewable energy, and 
putting energy efficiency programs 
into place to maximise our energy 
usage, we are constantly looking for 
ways to lessen our dependence on 
fossil fuels in our operations.
Negative: Our assets could be 
harmed by possible direct physical 
threats to our activities, which 
consequently, can result in a halt 
to operations and a rise in the 
cost of repairing and rebuilding 
affected locations. The transition 
risks brought on by climate 
change may also lead to stricter 
laws in the nations where we do 
business and export, which would 
increase the cost of compliance 
or new technology investments. 
Losing reputation and the trust 
of stakeholders can also result 
from a failure to respond to 
the negative effects of climate 
change.
Positive: Businesses may be able 
to adapt newer technologies 
and more productive ways of 
producing goods by working 
toward climate change adaptation 
and mitigation.
9.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusivity
Opportunity
Opportunity: Fostering and 
providing for a diverse and 
inclusive workforce and 
work culture enhances our 
performance by bringing 
together people with varied 
experiences, knowledge and 
skills.
Positive: A diverse and inclusive 
workforce that includes members 
of all genders, ages, ethnicities, 
and special abilities fosters 
creative thinking, encourages 
employee engagement, and 
unlocks higher levels of efficiency.
10.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
and Responsible 
Procurement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: As a result of the Company’s 
dependence on the supply chain 
for critical raw materials and 
last-mile drug deliveries, any 
interruption in the supply chain 
could have an effect on the 
quality of the final product and/
or the business of the Company. 
There is also a risk associated 
with non-substitutable suppliers’ 
continuous availability of 
essential raw materials. The 
Company has a policy requiring 
its supply chain partners to follow 
its ESG standards; any violation 
might lead to a supply disruption.
Opportunity: An organisation’s 
supply chain has a major impact 
on its capacity to survive. 
Integrating sustainability 
principles within supply chain 
management aids the Company 
in creating a robust supply chain 
and enhancing environmentally 
and socially conscious behaviour 
throughout the value chain.
1.    We are constantly looking for ways to 
reduce supply chain risk, such as by 
assessing potential substitute sources 
for essential or non-replaceable raw 
materials.
2.    The suppliers are required to abide by 
the Company’s ESG requirements as 
part of the Supplier Code of Conduct.
3.    The Company has a high focus on 
developing quality products and safety 
of consumers. The quality of raw 
materials for our production process 
is ensured by conducting periodic 
supplier audits.
Negative: Long-term commercial 
partnerships with suppliers may 
be impacted if standards related 
to various social, environmental 
and safety aspects are not 
complied with by suppliers, 
leading to loss of business value. 
Non-substitutable and critical raw 
material suppliers may impact the 
business in case of any unforeseen 
disruptions.
Positive: The Company’s 
ability to address supply chain 
disruptions brought on by 
unprecedented circumstances 
is ensured by responsible supply 
chain practices. In addition, the 
Company’s adherence to its 
responsible sourcing enhances 
its social and environmental 
performance. Assessing alternate 
suppliers may also help reduce 
risk exposure and provide 
access to previously unexplored 
suppliers for raw materials. 
It may lead to discovery of 
local suppliers, which reduces 
environmental footprint and may 
result in better control over the 
supply chain.

11.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Risk: The Company’s 
commitment to occupational 
health and safety must include 
this crucial element in the 
direction of offering a secure 
and safe workplace. Numerous 
health and safety incidents could 
result from the inefficiency of 
the current health and safety 
management programs.
1.    The business maintains a robust 
Environmental Health and Safety 
(EHS) management system, comprising 
regular audits of its EHS procedures, 
both internal and external.
2.    Our Process Safety Management 
system’s guiding principles serve as 
the foundation for both our safety 
procedures and risk assessment 
methodology, which unifies our 
approach to health and safety from 
the perspectives of working conditions 
and risk assessment.
3.    After potential risks are identified 
and safety incidents are evaluated, 
a thorough corrective action plan is 
established to prevent occurrence of 
similar incidents in the future.
Negative: A regular occurrence 
of health and safety issues 
will negatively impact the 
performance of the Company 
concerning worker well-being and 
safety. This will have an effect on 
the Company’s reputation, brand 
image, and capacity to draw in and 
retain talent.
12.
Ethical Clinical 
Trials and 
Animal Testing
Risk
Risk: Addressing risks associated 
with clinical trials and animal 
testing is critical to demonstrate 
the Company’s commitment to 
responsible research practices, 
especially around the ethical and 
safety related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and animal 
testing. Adverse events related 
to research practices can cause 
delays in product development 
and lead to financial losses and 
negative public perception.
1.    The Company complies with all 
relevant regulatory requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. We have dedicated teams, 
responsible for ensuring compliance 
with these regulations, which involve 
obtaining necessary approvals, 
permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation.
2.    We also implement robust quality 
control and safety measures 
throughout the research process. 
This involves monitoring and auditing 
the conduct of clinical trials, data 
collection, and analysis to ensure 
accuracy, reliability, and compliance 
with relevant standards.
3.    Long term safety studies are 
undertaken for some of our 
innovative specialty products, post 
commercialisation, in order to evaluate 
and measure safety parameters over a 
longer time horizon.
4.    On certain projects we collaborate 
with academic institutions, research 
organisations, and regulatory agencies 
to share knowledge, expertise, and 
resources. Such collaborations also 
enable collective efforts, checks and 
balances to enhance the quality and 
ethical standards of clinical trials and 
animal testing.
Negative: Failure to comply with 
guidelines and regulations of 
clinical trials and animal testing 
can undermine the efficacy and 
safety of the Company’s clinical 
trials. It may also have an adverse 
regulatory/legal impact, lead to 
financial damages and reputation 
loss and have a negative impact 
on participant’s health and safety. 
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.
13.
Social Impact 
through 
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity: By aligning CSR 
programs with the needs of the 
community, through impact 
assessments and stakeholder 
engagement sessions, the 
Company focuses on creating an 
environment of mutual trust with 
the community. This will help in 
ensuring a long-term beneficial 
relationship with the community 
and enhance the social 
positioning of the Company.
Positive: The Company’s 
perception among the local 
community members is 
enhanced by its contributions 
to the community’s upliftment 
through various initiatives and 
partnerships that focus on health, 
Education, rural infrastructure 
development, sanitation, and 
environment conservation among 
others. These efforts also help to 
promote positive social outcomes.

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1. 
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
 
 The Company has a comprehensive complaint management process to facilitate timely redressal of the product quality 
complaints. Once a product quality complaint is received, either directly by the Company or through a third-party 
entity (appointed to handle product complaints), it is registered in the Company’s system and a preliminary assessment 
is undertaken. In US market, based on local requirements, a Field Alert Report (FAR) may be filed for the complaint 
depending on its nature and severity. Along with the initial evaluation, follow-ups are performed for the complaint 
sample and for any additional information to facilitate the preliminary assessment and the investigation. The initial risk 
assessment and the investigative process proceeds concurrently with the follow-up. A remedial action plan is launched 
after the investigation is completed and the root cause is determined. A complaint summary report is also prepared at 
the same time. The complaint is finally closed after a final risk assessment is completed and a response is delivered to the 
complainant if requested. Any market actions for the impacted product are considered and may be communicated with 
the local regulatory authorities depending on local requirements. The Company has a global Pharmacovigilance Policy and 
mechanism in place, which is supported by a product safety group, committed to responding to patient safety concerns 
and incidents.

fully compliant status.
 
 In September 2013, USFDA had placed Sun Pharma’s Mohali facility on Import Alert; the site was also subjected to certain 
provisions of the Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction entered against Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. in January 2012 
(Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. was merged with Sun Pharma in March 2015). In March 2017, USFDA removed the Import Alert 
on Mohali facility and indicated that the site was in substantial compliance with the provisions mentioned in the Consent 
Decree. In August 2022, USFDA inspected the Mohali facility, and the inspection was classified as OAI. In April 2023, 
USFDA issued a Consent Decree Correspondence/ Non-Compliance letter to the Mohali facility in which USFDA directed 
the Company to take certain corrective actions at the Mohali facility, and certain actions before releasing finished drug 
product batches into the United States. These actions include, but are not limited to, retaining an independent cGMP expert 
to conduct batch certifications of drug products manufactured at the Mohali facility for shipment to the U.S. market.
 
 In December 2023, USFDA inspected Sun Pharma’s Dadra facility and subsequently determined the inspection 
classification status of this facility as Official Action Indicated (OAI). In June 2024, USFDA issued a Warning Letter
