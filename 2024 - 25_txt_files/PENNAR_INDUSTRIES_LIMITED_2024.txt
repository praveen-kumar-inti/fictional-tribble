Climate 
Change 
Action
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate 
change 
poses 
a 
substantial 
risk 
to 
The 
Company, with impacts evident 
in the short, medium, and long 
term. The physical threats to 
the industry are significant,
including 
extreme 
weather 
events 
and 
water 
scarcity. 
Implementing 
responsible 
business practices is essential 
for securing long-term benefits. 
As 
the 
global 
economy 
shifts 
towards 
low-carbon 
alternatives, 
The 
Company 
may encounter regulatory and 
market challenges, such as 
evolving consumer preferences, 
rising product costs, and new 
government 
policies 
and 
regulations.
The Company is dedicated 
to 
combating 
climate 
change through effective 
measures. To reduce its 
carbon 
footprint, 
the 
Company 
invests 
in 
innovative 
technologies, 
utilises renewable energy 
sources, 
and 
enhances 
manufacturing 
processes. 
The Company has expanded 
its 
renewable 
energy 
footprint with additional 
installations.
Negative

Water
Risk
The Company Recognises the 
scarcity of fresh water and 
holds a responsibility to ensure 
its availability and conservation 
for the benefit of social and 
ecological systems.
The 
Company 
treats 
wastewater 
and 
reuses 
it 
in 
manufacturing 
processes. Additionally, it 
is considering introducing 
methods to minimise water 
usage and reduce overall 
water consumption.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Waste 
management 
poses 
both risks and opportunities 
for companies. The primary 
risks 
include 
potential 
environmental 
damage, 
regulatory noncompliance, and 
reputational harm if waste is not 
managed properly. Inefficient 
waste management can lead 
to increased operational costs 
and potential legal liabilities. 
However, 
effective 
waste 
management 
also 
presents 
significant 
opportunities. 
Companies can reduce costs 
through resource efficiency and 
recycling initiatives, potentially 
creating new revenue streams 
from 
waste 
by-products. 
Implementing 
innovative 
waste 
reduction 
strategies 
can 
enhance 
a 
company’s 
sustainability profile, attracting 
environmentally 
conscious 
customers and investors.
The Company’s approach 
to 
waste 
management 
at Pennar Industries Ltd 
embodies 
the 
principles 
of 
a 
circular 
economy: 
Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. 
It adheres to a zero-defect 
standard in manufactured 
products to minimise waste 
generation and maximise 
reuse 
and 
recycling 
postmanufacturing. 
Waste 
at all units is segregated 
into hazardous and non-
hazardous categories and 
disposed of appropriately, 
adhering to the applicable 
safety 
norms 
and 
regulations for each type of 
waste. Going forward,
the Company is committed 
to reducing landfill waste 
from Pennar Industries Ltd 
operations.
Negative
4
Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
By taking responsibility for 
the environmental and social 
impacts 
of 
their 
products 
throughout 
their 
lifecycle, 
companies 
can 
differentiate 
themselves 
in 
the 
market 
and appeal to increasingly 
conscious 
consumers. 
This 
approach can lead to innovative 
product designs that are more 
sustainable, 
efficient, 
and 
aligned with circular economy
principles. 
Such 
innovations 
can result in cost savings, 
reduced environmental impact, 
and improved brand loyalty.

The Company’s governance policies are firmly rooted in the principles of ethics, transparency, and timely disclosure. 
These policies are not merely guidelines, but a shared value that permeates every level of the organisation, from the 
Board of Directors to Senior Management and all other employees.
	
The Company encourages all stakeholders to align their actions with its core values and beliefs. This alignment is not 
only expected but also perceived by all involved. The Code of Conduct, applicable to Directors and Senior Management 
personnel, encapsulates this ethos. It underscores the importance of acting in the Company’s legitimate interest and 
recognising the Company’s responsibility towards its stakeholders as a cornerstone of its long-term success.
	
In its dealings with vendors and contractors, the Company is committed to engaging with those who uphold and 
adhere to ethical standards. The Company’s stakeholders are regularly informed about these values through various 
engagement channels. This approach ensures that the Company’s commitment to ethical conduct is not just an internal 
policy, but a value that is communicated and understood by all relevant parties.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
The Company operates a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) plant, which processes two types of effluents: Low TDS Rinse 
water and spent acid. The Low TDS Rinse water is neutralised to a pH of 9 using a Caustic lye solution, then passed 
through a filter press to separate suspended solids. These solids, primarily Iron sludge, are sent to co-processing units 
such as cement factories. The water is then processed through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The purified water is 
reused in the process, while the reject water is directed to a Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) feed tank. The spent acid 
effluent is neutralised with a Lime powder solution to a pH of 9 and passed through a filter press to separate suspended 
solids. The high TDS water is treated in the MEE system. The MEE condensate water is treated through RO and further 
used in the process. The reject water is passed through an Agitated Thin Film Dryer (ATFD) system to separate solids. 
These solids are disposed of through a TSDF Telangana Government certified industry, Re-Sustainability Ltd.
