Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
	
	
Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Code of Conduct covers aspects of Human Rights, Health and Safety, Operational Eco-efficiency, etc., and 
indicates applicability to the Bank’s vendors. Besides this, a focused 'Code of Conduct' for service providers’ forms part of the service 
agreements with outsourced vendors. 
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
As a financial services organisation, our direct consumption of consumables and input materials is limited. We strive to improve 
energy efficiency, use cleaner sources of energy and reduce paper consumption to a minimum. In FY 2024-25, Kotak adopted an 
initiative to utilise recycled paper; this has been implemented at select corporate offices, resulting in a total savings of 7.6 tonnes of 
virgin paper during the year. We have implemented usage of Green Seal Housekeeping chemicals, which are eco-friendly and reduce 
the impact on the environment.
	
	
We expect our vendors to comply with our Code of Conduct for service providers which includes aspects on Human Rights, Health 
and Safety, Operational Eco-efficiency, etc. All service contracts that were proposed to be signed and renewed in FY 2024-25 included 
the Code of Conduct for service providers as an annexure.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
	
As a financial services organisation and by the virtue of the services we offer, there may not be direct significant impacts to waste generation. 
However, we have undertaken measures such as partnering authorised waste management vendors to recycle our e-waste, sanitary waste 
and bio-medical waste, installing Organic Waste Composters (OWCs) across six of our corporate offices to convert our wet waste generated to 
manure, and have a buyback policy in place for batteries. We also have STPs which generate either no sludge or minimum quantities of the 
same. Please find further details of our approach to waste management on pages 93-95 of the ‘Embracing Sustainability’ section.

Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No, as we are a financial services company, the waste generated is incidental to providing the banking service. Therefore, Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable to our activities. As per the E-waste Management Rules, 2022, bulk consumers shall ensure 
that e-waste generated by them is handed over only to a registered producer, refurbisher, or recycler, and segregated waste is sent to 
authorized waste processing/disposal facilities/deposition centers, either on its own or through an authorized waste collection agency. 
Kotak recognises its responsibility as a bulk consumer and disposes its e-waste through CPCB/SPCB-authorized recyclers.

10.	 Health and safety management system#20:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage such system?
	
	
Yes, we have ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) implemented for eight of our key 
corporate offices.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
An OHSMS is in place, and its manual serves as a comprehensive guide that outlines the governance framework and an action plan 
for conducting audits by the oversight team. The manual also clearly defines the scope and responsibilities of the teams tasked 
with overseeing the OHSMS. A monitoring plan takes into account factors including parameters measured, locations, scope and 
the methods used. The senior management is responsible for overseeing the evaluation of OHS performance and determining its 
effectiveness. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercise as per the requirements of ISO 45001:2018 standard is 
conducted, where all the work-related hazards are identified and risks on a routine and non-routine basis are assessed, and their 
mitigation/preventive measures tabulated. The non-routine jobs are maintenance activities and extension of the premises etc. HIRA 
is reviewed annually or in light of any incident and revised accordingly if required. The updated HIRA is then circulated to all the 
relevant premises to ensure that the knowledge gathered is circulated and used by all.
	
	
At the ISO 45001:2018 certified premises, we adopted a process that includes, but is not limited to, how the work is organised, social 
factors, leadership and organisational culture, activities and situations, past relevant incidents, potential emergency situations, 
actual and proposed changes irrespective of the level and nature and changes in knowledge of and information about hazards. 
The Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Management Representative (HMR) ensures that hazard identification is conducted by 
persons with competence in relevant hazard identification methodologies and techniques and appropriate knowledge of the work 
activity. All jobs performed at our premises are supervised by the HMR. They ensure proper work permits are requested and granted 
prior to the job being undertaken, and also note and report work related hazards, if any. ‘Toolbox talks’ for routine and non-routine 
jobs are delivered to vendors undertaking work at our premises, as required which cover safety instructions and detailed processes 
to be followed to protect themselves from injuries or ill health and an OHSMS Hazard Identification Checklist is maintained. The 
methodology and criteria for the assessment of Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) risks are defined with respect to their scope, 
nature and timing to ensure they are proactive rather than reactive and are used in a systematic way. Employees are also encouraged 
to report any hazardous situations by either calling a designated helpline or writing to a location specific helpdesk to enable timely 
and appropriate action.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we have processes in place for our employees to report on work-related hazards and enable them to remove themselves 
from such risks.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, we provide our employees with access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. We promote well-being of our 
employees through facilitating pre-emptive medical check-ups, in-house doctors and on call consultations. We also offer health 
and wellness initiatives, including yoga, meditation, Zumba and quiz sessions, online and onsite. Our “Health to the Power Infinity” 
website provides doctor consultations, nutritionist services, an Emotional Assistance Programme and pharmacy discounts with 
professionals available both on call and in-house.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Safeguarding the health and well-being of our employees is of utmost importance to us. In FY 2024-25, we partnered with a service 
provider to offer the Annual Health Check across India. All eligible employees receive fully sponsored annual health check, while all other 
employees and their families can access these benefits at a discounted rate.
	
Additionally, we have introduced doctor and nutritionist consultations, emotional assistance programs, and pharmacy discounts at select 
premises. Employees can access these resources both on-call and through in-house facilities. Our Emotional Assistance Program (EAP) 
continues to support employees and their families. In FY 2024-25, employees accessed EAP services featuring sessions on depression, 
anxiety, stress, and conflict resolution. To support holistic well-being, we also offered online yoga, meditation, and Zumba sessions for 
employees and their families.
	
Beyond health initiatives, we prioritize employee safety through clear signage, regular training, toolbox talks, and safety features like 
handrails and anti-slip strips. A dedicated helpdesk addresses safety concerns, while fire drills and trained wardens ensure emergency 
preparedness. We also offer medical check-ups, in-house doctor consultations, ambulance access, ergonomic seating, and slip-
proof flooring.22

opportunities, and impacts, preparing surveys and conducting stakeholder consultations, analyzing the responses received, presenting 
the findings to the management and Board, and ultimately integrating the materiality outcomes into our strategy. The material topics 
identified through this approach informs our ESG policy framework found here –

them with utmost sensitivity in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Employees are provided with the option to raise 
anonymous complaints, which are accessible only to authorized personnel, such as the Business Head, Human Resources team, and 
other control functions, as permitted by law. The final action taken is documented and maintained for future reference.

good faith, report suspected unethical or illegal conduct. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, securities law or regulatory 
violations, potential breaches of company policies such as the Code of Conduct, or other inappropriate workplace behavior. Should 
an employee experience retaliation, they are encouraged to report the incident to the Human Resources team or through our 
designated Employee Portal (Kotak Worklife), where their concerns will be addressed promptly and appropriately.

Notes:
 
 
Coverage of reporting has been enhanced, it includes 13 new corporate offices, 203 additional bank branches including two 
international bank branches (reported first time), and 654 subsidiary premises from FY 2023-24 and hence the data is not 
comparable to FY 2024-25.
 
 
Wherever actual units consumed were not available we had estimated energy charges as percentage of overall electricity bill through 
random sampling of electricity bills sourced from various premises across regions. In FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, the state-wise 
average grid tariff was used for estimating the units consumed. In FY 2024-25, we have used state-wise tariff rates provided by SEBI's 
latest circular on Sustainable Reporting (BRSR) Core. These tariffs are higher than the rates used by us in FY 2023-24. As a result, the 
consumption units for FY 2024-25 would be lower even if the amounts spent were the same as FY 2023-24
 
 
For the Bank branches, offsite ATMs and subsidiary premises, where neither billing amount nor consumption data was available, we 
have estimated consumption based on average calculated from recorded data shared 
 
 
In FY 2024-25, we also included  units consumed from DG set owned by lessors for corporate offices wherever the data was available 
(First year of reporting on DG set units). Since, batteries get charged by grid electricity, the power supplied by the batteries is already 
covered in the grid electricity units.
 
 
In FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24, we had not included electricity consumption for premises, which were operational for less than six 
months. In FY 2024-25 we, we included the electricity consumption from such premises as well
 
 
Number of offsite ATMs has reduced (closed offsite ATMs account for 2/3rd of the reduction in electricity consumption vs. FY 2023-24). 
Balance reduction is from tariff change & energy saving initiatives.
 
 
FTE refers to full time employees of the Bank at the end of the financial year
 
 
*Renewable energy is primarily sourced from open access and also obtained from the rooftop solar installations at select premises
 
 
** This data also includes energy consumed at the Bank premises shared with a few subsidiaries
 
 
Intensity ratios have been computed based on Total Revenue which includes Interest Earned under Schedule 13 and Other Income, 
excluding profit/(loss) on sale of buildings & other assets (net) earned under Schedule 14 of the Audited Standalone Financial 
Statements of the Bank. For the purpose of calculation of revenue adjusted Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), conversion factor @20.66

Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) & its intensity, in the following format33:
	
Notes:
 
 
Coverage of reporting has been enhanced, it includes 13 new corporate offices, 203 additional bank branches including two 
international bank branches (reported first time) and 654 subsidiary premises from FY 2023-24, and hence the data is not 
comparable to FY 2023-24.
 
 
Scope 1 coverage includes emissions from firefighting equipment, diesel consumed in DG sets and refrigerant refilling in the air 
conditioning devices from the Bank managed premises.
 
 
Scope 1 data for the bank is inclusive of the offsite ATM data as well, as the data is negligible it has not been put out separately 
 
 
Scope 1 emissions from two international sites and for leased offices were not accounted for, as we do not have direct operational 
control over these facilities. As reporting for scope 1 is not 100% for all locations on all parameters, below mentioned are 
the  limitations:
 
 
Diesel reporting is limited to locations where DG sets are available and managed by Kotak 
 
 
Refrigerant and Fire extinguisher emissions are based on actuals for all offices and branches of the Bank. Scope 1 data for the 
Bank is inclusive of the offsite ATM data as well, as the data is negligible it has not been put out separately.
 
 
Scope 1 calculations done for FY 2024-25 are based on the emission factors taken from IPCC, AR6 – updated in August 2024 (this 
includes all the GWP values used for the refrigerant gases and fire extinguishers and the emission factors used to calculate emissions 
generated from diesel consumption), had we used the same emissions/conversion factors as used in FY 2023-24
 
 
Emissions from diesel would have been 0.3% more for the Bank 
 
 
Emissions from refrigerant refilling would have been 13.7% lesser for the Bank 
 
 
Emissions from fire extinguisher refilling would have been 4% lesser for the Bank 
 
 
In FY 2024-25, we also included the emissions from DG sets owned by lessors of leased premises that power Bank premises for key 
corporate offices under Scope 2
 
 
In FY 2024-25, we also included Scope 2 emissions from premises which were operational for less than 6 months, this was not 
accounted previously 
 
 
Renewable energy procured for three of our key corporate offices through open access was 5.28% of the total energy procured (5.5% 
of the total electricity procured for the Bank) for FY 2024-25. This was removed from the Scope 2 emission calculations as it was 
confirmed by the vendor to be green energy and was not registered under any RECs. This has resulted in a reduction35 of 5,053 tCO2e 
in Scope 2 emissions

Scope 2 GHG emissions are calculated based on emission factors in Central Electricity Authority, Govt. of India (CEA Version_20.0): 
Grid Emission Factors - Weighted Average Emission Rate (Incl RES), including cross-border electricity transfers which is 0.727 kgCO2 
per kWh for FY 2024-25 and was 0.716 for FY 2023-24.
 
 
Intensity ratios have been computed based on Total Revenue which includes Interest Earned under Schedule 13 and Other Income, 
excluding profit/(loss) on sale of buildings & other assets (net) earned under Schedule 14 of the Audited Standalone Financial 
Statements of the Bank. For the purpose of calculation of revenue adjusted Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), conversion factor @20.66 
₹/USD as per International Monetary Fund (IMF) website has been considered which is in line with the SEBI guidance

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.36 
	
Yes, we undertake initiatives to reduce our GHG emissions. We have sixteen LEED/IGBC certified premises across nine cities and seven 
additional premises are currently undergoing the certification process, targeted for completion by FY 2025-26. Each of the certified 
premise meets the requirements of the green building rating system certification established by the U.S. Green Building Council and India 
Green Building Council (IGBC) as per their certifications, while having best-in-class resource efficient installations. These installations help 
monitor and control energy consumption. There are other initiatives as well which help us reduce GHG emissions, such as:
 
 
Smart lighting solutions: Sensor-based lighting systems and timer-controlled lights were utilised across our premises to optimise 
energy usage during non-occupancy hours.
 
 
Sustainable lighting: Replacement of around 675 traditional light sources with LED lights for signboards and occupancy and 
daylight sensors installation in non-emergency light fixtures resulted in reduced energy consumption.
 
 
Efficient glow signage management: Timer controls were installed at over 1,900 premises to regulate operating hours of glow 
signage boards and minimise unnecessary energy usage.
 
 
Energy-efficient parking area lighting: Transition from normal lighting to dimmable lights at our parking areas was done to reduce 
electricity consumption during non-occupancy periods.
 
 
Temperature management: Consistent temperature of 24°C for air conditioning was maintained to minimise energy consumption 
and improve comfort levels.
 
 
AI-powered energy monitoring: AI-driven module to monitor energy consumption of air conditioners, enabling data-driven 
decision-making.
 
 
Virtual server adoption: Transition from physical servers has become 85% in FY 2024-25 from 75% in FY 2023-24, reducing both 
energy consumption and resource utilisation. 
 
 
Energy-efficient equipment procurement: Procurement of 3-star rated or higher energy-efficient electronic equipment, such 
as LED lights, air conditioning units, microwave ovens, and refrigerators was ensured to promote better energy efficiency, longer 
lifespan, lower electricity consumption, and reduced maintenance costs.
 
 
Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems: The implementation of pressure-independent VAV systems optimised air distribution, enabling 
temperature control according to user requirements and reducing energy consumption during non-occupancy periods.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
We have a Business Continuity Management (BCM) Policy that provides guidance for proactively identifying and mitigating risks that may 
cause disruption to business, to minimize the impact of disruption, and to ensure continuity of key products and services at acceptable 
levels. It is reviewed annually for its continual improvement. Critical Units in the Bank have a Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which 
prescribes tested half yearly, the results are communicated periodically and are reviewed to ensure their effectiveness. These results are 
also submitted to the regulator.
	
We also maintain a comprehensive IT Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan, which outlines our disaster recovery objectives, disaster determination 
and recovery procedures, replication methodologies, drill protocols and frequency, ongoing DR maintenance, and defined Recovery Time 
Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). Kotak has established a robust infrastructure comprising a Primary Data Center 
(DC), a Near-Disaster Recovery (NDR) site, and a Far Disaster Recovery (DR) site for identified set of applications. The Bank prepares and 
executes DR drills for these applications in accordance with a predefined calendar and in alignment with regulatory expectations.
6.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
	
There is an Environmental Management Systems Plan (EMSP) in place, which lays out the criteria to conduct due diligence and evaluation 
of select borrowers using an ESG lens. The borrowers are categorized in the EMSP, based on the potential of the sector to which a company 
belongs along with its associated social and environmental impact. The Plan indicates specific checklists for assessment, which depends 
on the nature of business and size of the transaction. Additionally, the EMSP outlines an exclusionary list, implementation of which is 
subject to periodic supervision and monitoring. In FY 2024-25, we have revamped the EMSP questionnaire by updating it in the context of 
current ESG standards and incorporating practical insights through implementation.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental

Currently, we do not assess environmental impacts for our value-chain partners. We have implemented a code of conduct for all our 
outsourced vendors, which is incorporated as part of the standard service contract with the objective of creating awareness on ESG and 
articulating our expectations form our vendors on ESG. We also encourage our value-chain partners to proactively align their business 
operations to environmental best-practices.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Bank has implemented a robust mechanism to receive and address consumer complaints and feedback effectively. As a service sector 
organization, customer centricity is our prime focus. We recognize the importance of prompt and efficient service delivery in ensuring 
customer satisfaction.
	
We adopt a holistic approach to establish service standards and continuously enhance the customer experience based on feedback 
received through multiple channels. Customers can conveniently provide feedback or lodge grievances through multiple modes. The 
Bank aims to ensure quick and effective handling of customer grievance, as well as prompt corrective & preventive action (including 
correction of the process, wherever required) in order to avoid recurrence of grievances.
	
We ensure a streamlined process for grievance redressal, encompassing three escalation levels:
	
Level 1: Customer Experience Centre, Net Banking / Web form, Branch, PO Box
	
Level 2: Dedicated Nodal Officer 
	
Level 3: Principal Nodal Officer 
	
Further, in line with the RBI recommendation, the Bank has incorporated the role of an Internal Ombudsman, who is an independent 
authority to review the Grievances raised by customers. Every complaint which is either partially or fully rejected, is shared with the 
Internal Ombudsman for review and consent. Only once the Internal Ombudsman consents, can the complaint be rejected. The decision 
taken by the Internal Ombudsman is binding on the Bank. If the customer is not satisfied with the response or has not received a response 
from the Bank within a month, then he/she can file a complaint with Banking Ombudsman. The details of the same is updated on the 
Bank’s website.
	
Every complaint has a specified turnaround time which the customer would be informed of at the time of lodging a complaint. Customer 
at the time of login of complaint, would ordinarily be informed of the same. The Bank has dedicated teams to handle complaints at 
Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Additionally, there are teams specifically working on the complaints escalated to the Chairman / Managing 
Director’s desk or the RBI banking Ombudsman under the Grievance Redressal desk.
	
In FY 2024-25, we have reinforced our grievance redressal framework by fortifying our Internal Ombudsman Support Desk 
with 11 members working closely with the 3 Internal Ombudsmen to address escalated issues effectively.
	
* We estimate CSR beneficiaries based on data provided by the implementing agencies. The numbers may not be unique beneficiary.

Company’) has commissioned DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited (‘DNV’, ‘us’ or ‘we’) to undertake an independent 
assurance of the Company’s disclosures in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (hereafter referred as ‘BRSR’) for 
the period FY 2024-25. The disclosures include the BRSR Core attributes as per Annexure 17A and the non-financial disclosures 
as per Annexure 16 of the Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155, dated November 11, 2024.

The scope of our engagement includes a reasonable level of assurance for the  
‘BRSR Core’ indicators and a limited Level of assurance for the remaining non-
financial disclosures in BRSR, for the financial year (FY) 2024-25.  
Reasonable assurance of BRSR Core: Boundary covers the performance of KMBL 
operations that fall under the direct operational control of the Company’s Legal 
structure. Based on the agreed scope with the Company, the boundary of 
reasonable assurance covers the India operations and 2 international branches 
(located in DIFC, Dubai and GIFT City, Gujarat*) of KMBL including all offices, 
branches and ATMs where the company has operational control, unless otherwise 
stated or specified in the BRSR disclosures by the company.

• 
BRSR Core Attribute 4 - Embracing circularity - details related to waste 
management by the entity (excluding E-waste, C&D waste**) reporting

Our Conclusion:  
Reasonable level of Assurance- BRSR Core 
Based on our review and procedures followed for a reasonable level of assurance, DNV is of the opinion that, 
in all material aspects the BRSR Core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under 9 ESG attributes (as listed in 
Annexure I of this statement)  for FY 2024-25 are reported in accordance with reporting requirements outlined 
in Industry Standard on Reporting of BRSR Core. 
Limited Level of Assurance- BRSR Disclosures 
On the basis of the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the non-
financial disclosures (as listed in Annexure I of this statement) in BRSR do not properly adhere to the reporting 
requirements as per BRSR reporting guidelines in Annexure 16 of SEBI’s Master Circular.

DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited 
Assurance Methodology/Standard and Level of Assurance   
This assurance engagement has been carried out in accordance with DNV’s VeriSustainTM protocol, V6.0, which is based on our 
professional experience and international assurance practice, and the international standard in Assurance  Engagements, ISAE 
3000 (revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. DNV’s VeriSustain TM 
Protocol, V6.0 has been developed in accordance with the most widely accepted reporting and assurance standards. DNV 
conducted a reasonable level of assurance for BRSR Core KPIs under 9 ESG attributes; and a limited level of assurance for rest 
non-financial disclosures in BRSR. 
 
Basis of our conclusion 
As part of the assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of assurance specialists performed assurance work for selected sites 
of KMBL. We carried out the following activities: 
 
BRSR Core Indicators – Reasonable level of Assurance 
Rest non-financial disclosures in BRSR – Limited Level of 
Assurance 
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR Core, encompassing the 
framework for assurance consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) under 9 ESG attributes. The Industry Standard on 
Reporting of BRSR Core used a basis of reasonable level of assurance. 
Reviewed the disclosures under BRSR reporting guidelines. Our 
focus included general disclosures, management processes, 
principle wise performance (essential indicators, and leadership 
indicators) and any other key metrics specified under the reporting 
framework. The BRSR reporting format used a basis of limited level of 
assurance. 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of key systems, 
processes and controls for collecting, managing and reporting the 
BRSR Core indicators. Assessment of operational control and 
reporting boundaries 
Understanding the key systems, processes and controls for 
collecting, managing and reporting the non-financial disclosures in 
BRSR. Understand and test, on a sample basis to evaluate adherence 
to the reporting principles. 
Seek extensive evidence across all relevant areas, ensuring a detailed 
examination of BRSR Core indicators. Engaged directly with 
stakeholders to gather insights and corroborative evidence for each 
disclosed indicator. 
Collect and evaluate documentary evidence and management 
representations supporting adherence to the reporting principles. 
We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our 
assurance efforts on the issues of high material relevance to the 
Company’s business and its key stakeholders. 
DNV audit team conducted on-site audits for data testing and also, to 
assess the uniformity in reporting processes and also, quality checks 
at different locations of the Company. Sites for data testing and 
reporting system checks were selected based on the percentage 
contribution each site makes to the reported indicator, complexity of 
operations at each location (high/low/medium) and reporting system 
within the organization. Sites selected for audits are listed in 
Annexure II.

Verification of the consolidated reported performance disclosures in context to the Principle of Completeness as per VeriSustainTM 
Protocol, V6.0 for limited level of assurance for the disclosure. 
On the basis of the assessment undertaken, for the GRI disclosures as mentioned in Annexure I, nothing has come to our attention 
to suggest that the disclosures are not fairly stated and are not prepared, in all material aspects, with reference to the reporting 
criteria and the principles as per DNV VeriSustainTM Protocol (V6.0) as stated below. 
 
1. 
Materiality 
The process of determining the issues that are most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders. 
The Report explains out the materiality assessment process carried out by the Company which has considered concerns of internal 
and external stakeholders, and inputs from peers and the industry, as well as issues of relevance in terms of impact for KMBL’s 
business. The list of topics has been prioritized, reviewed and validated, and the Company has indicated that there is no change in 
material topics from the previous reporting period.  
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Materiality. 
 
2. 
Responsiveness 
The extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues. 
The Report adequately brings out the Company’s policies, strategies, management systems and governance mechanisms in place 
to respond to topics identified as material and significant concerns of key stakeholder groups.  
Nothing has come to our attention to believe that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of 
Responsiveness.  
 
3. 
Reliability/Accuracy 
The accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data management 
systems. 
The Report brings out the systems and processes that the Company has set in place to capture and report its performance related 
to identified material topics across its reporting boundary. The majority of information mapped with data verified through our remote 
assessments with KMBL’s management teams and process owners at the Corporate Office and sampled sites within the boundary 
of the Report were found to be fairly accurate and reliable. Some of the data inaccuracies identified in the report during the 
verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation, and aggregation errors. These data inaccuracies 
have been communicated for correction and the related disclosures were reviewed post correction. 
Nothing has come to our attention to believe that the Report does not meet the principle of Reliability and Accuracy. 
 
4. 
Completeness 
How much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported? 
The Report brings out the Company’s performance, strategies and approaches related to the environmental, social and governance issues 
that it has identified as material for its operational locations coming under the boundary of the report, for the chosen reporting period 
while applying and considering the requirements of Principle of Completeness. 
Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the Principle of Completeness with respect to scope, boundary 
and time. 
 
5. 
Neutrality/Balance 
The extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organization’s performance, delivered in a neutral tone. 
The Report brings out the disclosures related to KMBL’s performance during the reporting period in a neutral tone in terms of content and 
presentation, while considering the overall macroeconomic and industry environment.
