Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.   
	
The Company has adopted a strong waste management system to meet the compliance with respect to local regulations. 
The well-established system is supporting our operations to properly segregate the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept 
to reduce, reuse & recycle. The waste generated within our premises is recycled through authorized recyclers and on-site 
composting machines (in facilities and residential establishments) and remaining waste is disposed through State Pollution 
Control Board approved landfill/incineration facilities. 
	
HAL is governed by various Acts and Rules like the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016, Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1981), Environment 
(Protection) Act, 1986, Water Act 1974 (Prevention and Control of Pollution), etc. 
	
All the Divisions are ISO 14001 certified and comply with the rules prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards. All 
emissions and waste generation is monitored as prescribed by the Pollution Control Boards.
	
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated from Townships and Factories is segregated at source in Townships and Factories 
(Wet, Dry, Garden, Sanitary and Rejects). Through the process of Vermi-Composting, the Bio-degradable waste comprising of 
domestic waste and horticulture waste is being converted to manure. For better utilization of biodegradable waste generated 
from HAL Estates, the Company has installed Solid Waste Management Units like Organic Waste Converters and Bio Gas 
Plants at select places. At Bangalore, 1.5 Tons per day capacity bio-gas plants are installed.
	
The Divisions which use and generate hazardous effluents such as chrome, acid/alkali, cyanide etc. have independent Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs) for treatment.
