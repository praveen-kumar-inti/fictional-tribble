GHG 
Emissions
Risk 
Mining 
activities 
require 
a 
substantial amount of energy 
and 
produce 
notable 
direct 
greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions, 
primarily 
carbon 
dioxide, stemming from fuel 
consumption in mining, ore 
processing, 
and 
smelting 
processes. The consequences of 
climate change have become 
more frequent and severe over 
time, emerging as a significant 
global risk.
To address the risk linked with GHG 
emissions, the Company prioritizes 
GHG reduction and efficient energy use 
by adopting suitable environmentally 
friendly technologies. Consequently, to 
diminish GHG emissions, the Company 
utilizes very low sulfur coal and has 
implemented twin bag filters and a 
cyclone separator. Additionally, the 
Company has set a target to become 
a net-zero emission Company by 2050 
and is actively taking steps towards 
achieving this goal.

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Safety 
holds 
paramount 
importance in mining operations 
because 
of 
the 
frequently 
perilous working environments. 
The mining sector experiences 
relatively high rates of fatalities 
compared to other industries. 
Fatalities or injuries can arise 
from various hazards inherent 
in 
the 
industry, 
such 
as 
powered haulage, machinery 
operation, and mine structural 
integrity. 
Substandard 
health 
and safety records can lead to 
fines, penalties, and escalated 
regulatory compliance costs due 
to heightened oversight.
Ensuring a safe work environment for 
employees is a crucial obligation, and 
as such, the Company continuously 
endeavors to furnish and uphold safe 
premises, 
machinery, 
systems 
and 
processes at its operational sites. Given 
its open-cast surface mining operations, 
the associated risks are significantly 
minimized.

Waste 
& Haz­
ardous 
Materials 
Manage­
ment 
Risk
The mining sector produces 
substantial quantities of both 
non-mineral and mineral waste, 
encompassing materials such 
as waste rock, tailings, slurries, 
slags, 
sludge, 
smelting 
by-
products, and industrial waste. 
Some of these materials may 
contain toxic, hazardous, or 
chemically reactive substances. 
Additionally, mineral processing 
operations 
occasionally 
necessitate the use of hazardous 
materials for metal extraction 
purposes resulting in life and 
health 
hazard. 
Inadequate 
disposal 
or 
inappropriate 
storage of hazardous materials 
or 
mining 
waste 
poses 
a 
significant 
long-term 
risk 
to 
human health and ecosystems 
by 
potentially 
contaminating 
groundwater or surface water 
used for drinking or agricultural 
purposes and can also result in 
land contamination.
Depending on its nature, waste 
generated during mining operations 
can undergo treatment, disposal, or 
storage either on-site or off-site, often 
in impoundments or disused mine 
pits and to ensure this, the Company 
maintains and implements proper 
measures for waste disposal at the 
operational level. Moreover, none of 
the Company's operations result in 
the creation of sludge, slags, etc. The 
overburden is responsibly utilized for 
backfilling mines.

Air 
Quality
Risk
The mining sector produces 
non-greenhouse gas (GHG) 
air emissions & ambient air 
contaminators that can lead to 
substantial localized impacts 
on human health and the 
environment. Depending on the 
type of metal, key pollutants 
include sulfur dioxide, lead, 
mercury, cadmium, arsenic 
and particulate matter, among 
others. The release of these 
emissions viz. Sulfur oxides 
(SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
suspended particulate matter 
(SPM), and particulate matter 
can cause health & life hazards 
to stakeholders inside & outside 
of operations premises of the 
Company.
To mitigate this risk, the Company 
actively monitors its emissions of SOx, 
NOx, and SPM on a periodic and 
scientific basis. Additionally, it has 
implemented systems to manage and 
reduce air pollutants discharged into 
the atmosphere, ensuring compliance 
with relevant laws and regulations. 
Furthermore, the Company does not 
engage in any smelting or refinery 
operations, thereby reducing chances 
of air contamination.

ances
Risk
Being a highly regulated 
industry, ongoing revisions 
to mining and environmental 
regulations (and them 
becoming stricter) may affect 
the Company's activities, 
potentially posing a risk of non-
compliance.
The Company possesses a thorough 
compliance management framework 
that undergoes regular updates. This 
framework is seamlessly integrated 
with business procedures, risks, and 
controls. Furthermore, any alterations 
in regulations are monitored and 
seamlessly 
integrated 
into 
the 
Compliance 
Management 
System, 
thereby 
ensuring 
the 
governance 
mechanism followed at the Company.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
In Ashapura Perfoclay’s Bleaching Clay unit, Effluent generated from processing, reactor washing, and utilities is treated in the existing Effluent 
Treatment Plant (ETP). Initially, the ETP provides primary treatment where acidic wastewater is neutralized using lime. Following neutralization 
and a soda lime softening process to remove hardness, the resulting slurry is transferred to a filter press via a high-pressure pump. The gypsum 
that remains on the filter press cloths is collected and moved to a storage area, while the filtrate water undergoes further treatment in a 
clarifier, sand filter, and ultrafiltration, followed by a Reverse Osmosis (RO) process. Once treated by the RO plant and verified to meet State 
Pollution Control Board norms, the effluent is reused in the manufacturing process and for gardening, thereby reducing the need for fresh water. 
The existing solar evaporation pond stores RO reject water, which is then sent to the Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) for further treatment. The 
recovered condensate is reused in the plant as needed. The company has installed a comprehensive effluent treatment system to ensure effective 
management of wastewater.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes
	
Waste management at Ashapura involves a comprehensive process that includes the identification, collection, transport, processing, recycling, 
and monitoring of waste materials. Primarily focused on materials produced by human activities, effective waste management is crucial to 
minimizing the negative impacts on health and the environment. Waste is generally categorized into hazardous, non-hazardous, food, and 
biomedical waste, each requiring specific handling and disposal methods. Proper planning and identification are essential to reducing waste 
generation, with hazardous waste requiring careful handling, including the use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
	
	
The collection and segregation of waste play a vital role in waste management. Waste should be collected in appropriately color-coded bins: blue 
for non-biodegradable waste, green for biodegradable waste, and yellow for hazardous waste. These bins should be strategically placed where 
waste generation is likely. Segregation is then carried out by sorting the waste into general waste, metal, wood, paper, and other categories 
before it is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Proper storage of waste, especially hazardous materials, is necessary to prevent 
environmental contamination, with specific areas designated for waste storage, including isolated, covered areas for hazardous waste.
	
The principles of reuse and recycling are integral to effective waste management. Recyclable materials such as plastic, metal, wood, and paper 
should be reused or sold to authorized recyclers. Records of waste generation and disposal should be meticulously maintained to ensure proper 
management. Onsite and offsite disposal methods vary depending on the type of waste; for example, biodegradable waste is handled by 
municipal collectors, while hazardous and electronic waste is disposed of through authorized recyclers. This systematic approach ensures that 
waste is managed in a way that minimizes environmental impact and supports sustainability.

The RO system effectively filters and purifies this wastewater, removing 
dissolved solids, heavy metals, and other impurities. By implementing 
this technology, we not only reduce our environmental footprint but also 
promote water conservation by enabling the reuse of treated water in our 
operations.
By implementing the RO system, we 
successfully recycled 50 cubic meters 
per hour of wastewater, significantly 
reducing the need for fresh water in 
our operations
2
MEE Installation
Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) system technology is designed to treat 
and concentrate wastewater by evaporating water content, leaving behind 
concentrated brine or solid waste. This process significantly reduces the 
volume of waste generated, allowing for safer disposal and minimizing the 
environmental impact of our mining activities. Additionally, the MEE system 
enables the recovery and reuse of water within our processes, contributing 
to water conservation efforts.
The implementation the MEE system 
has led to the recycling of 40 cubic 
meters per hour of water, significantly 
reducing the volume of wastewater 
produced and enhancing our water 
conservation efforts.

Installation of 
Bag Filters
Bag filters are highly efficient in capturing and removing particulate matter, 
dust, and other airborne contaminants generated during mining processes. 
By implementing this technology, we significantly decrease the emission 
of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, ensuring compliance with 
environmental regulations and improving the health and safety conditions 
for our workers and surrounding communities.
The deployment of bag filters in our 
mining operations has effectively 
controlled particulate matter (PM) 
emissions, significantly reducing 
the release of dust and airborne 
contaminants into the atmosphere.
