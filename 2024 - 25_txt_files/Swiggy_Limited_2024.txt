MD & Group CEO’s Message
At Swiggy, we’ve always believed that real progress comes 
from the choices we make every day – often small, often 
quiet, but always intentional. Whether it’s helping our 
delivery partners thrive, empowering local entrepreneurs, 
or reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, 
these consistent efforts - our “little lifts” - add up to lasting 
change. They remind us that meaningful impact is rarely 
about dramatic gestures; it’s about doing the right things, 
repeatedly and at scale.
It is with this spirit that I share Swiggy’s first Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Report 
(BRSR) 
for 
FY 2024-25. This has been a foundational year in our 
sustainability journey – one where we moved from intent 
to structured action, launching our 2030 Sustainability 
Goals across climate action, community upliftment, 
and responsible business practices. These goals are not 
parallel to our growth ambitions; they are integral to how 
we build Swiggy for the long term, proving that scale and 
responsibility can strengthen each other when pursued 
with clarity and intent.
MD & Group CEO
Sriharsha Majety
We’ve also spent this year laying the groundwork for the 
future – strengthening governance, building robust systems, 
and embedding sustainability into how we think, design, 
and grow. The challenges ahead will be complex and will 
evolve as our ecosystem grows. From improving visibility 
across our supply chain to creating new opportunities for 
partners, the road ahead will demand constant innovation 
and deeper collaboration.
What gives me confidence is the shared intent across 
Swiggy to treat sustainability with the same rigour and 
innovation that define our business. This is the beginning 
of a long-term journey – one where we will keep raising 
the bar, shaped by strong governance, collaboration, and 
the belief that every decision, big or small, should move us 
closer to building a responsible and resilient Swiggy.
As we look ahead, this belief will continue to guide us – true 
to our purpose of delivering unparalleled convenience, 
responsibly.
This is the beginning of a 
long-term journey – one where 
we will keep raising the bar, 
shaped by strong governance, 
collaboration, and the belief 
that every decision, big or 
small, should move us closer 
to building a responsible and 
resilient Swiggy.

*As part of its commitment to building an inclusive workplace, Swiggy conducted a voluntary, anonymous self-identification gender survey during 
the reporting period. For FY 2024-25, the total number of permanent employees stood at 4,488, including three individuals who self-identified as 
‘others’. However, given the anonymity of disclosures and the absence of such data in the previous reporting period, it is not feasible to present 
disaggregated information for the ‘others’ category across subsequent social performance indicators.
**For the purpose of BRSR reporting, Swiggy classifies delivery partners as a key component of its value chain. While they are not defined as 
employees or workers under prevailing regulations, their contribution remains central to our operations. Consequently, disclosures pertaining to 
delivery partners are included under value chain-related sections of this report, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Talent Attraction & Retention
At Swiggy, our people strategy is designed to attract high-intent, future-ready talent and retain it through purpose-driven 
culture, continuous growth, and a strong employee experience.
We drive quality hiring at scale through structured, tech-enabled processes, role clarity, and a candidate-first approach — 
ensuring speed, consistency, and brand advocacy. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are embedded across levels and markets. 
We continue to strengthen our early talent pipeline through national campus programmes, internships, and management 
trainee initiatives.
Retention is equally critical. In a fast-paced environment like ours, preserving institutional knowledge and internal leadership 
depth is a business priority. We invest in:
	
Recognition programmes that celebrate excellence, innovation, and values
	
Learning journeys and defined career tracks that enable internal mobility
	
Inclusive benefits spanning health, parenthood, pet care, and learning
Together, these efforts drive continuity, reduce attrition, and reinforce Swiggy’s position as a preferred employer in India’s 
digital economy.

Social: 
Delivery 
Partner Well-
being
Opportunity
Delivery partners form the backbone of Swiggy’s 
platform ecosystem. Ensuring their well-being is 
both a moral imperative and a strategic opportunity 
to strengthen platform resilience, build trust, and 
attract and retain a motivated value chain. As 
regulatory frameworks evolve and stakeholder 
expectations around gig welfare rise, proactive 
investment in partner safety, security, and socio-
economic inclusion is crucial.
Swiggy views partner well-being as central to 
delivering consistent service quality, ensuring 
operational continuity, and reinforcing our identity 
as a responsible corporate citizen.
Swiggy has a comprehensive partner-
first approach to advance the safety, 
security, and dignity of its delivery 
partners, while preserving their 
autonomy and flexibility. Key initiatives 
under the flagship Delivering Safely 
programme include:
Health & Accident Insurance: 
Delivery partners are covered 
under robust schemes that include 
personal accident coverage, 24*7 
teleconsultation services for mental and 
physical well-being, medical insurance, 
extending to spouses and up to two 
children, disability and death benefits. 
Swiggy bears 100% of the premium 
costs. All female delivery partners are 
eligible for maternity support, including 
wellness cover and medical aid.
On-Road Emergency Support: An 
in-app SOS feature enables partners 
to trigger real-time alerts in case of 
accidents or distress, connecting them 
to 24*7 on-ground support. We have 
tied up with Dial 4242 to provide pan 
India ambulance support which is free 
of cost. 
Weather Resilience Measures: In 
recognition of weather-related 
vulnerabilities, Swiggy provides delivery 
partners with high-quality weather-
appropriate gear, including raincoats, 
windbreakers, and jackets. Partners 
also receive real-time weather alerts 
and advisories, enabling informed 
decision-making.
Harassment Redressal & Partner 
Protection: Swiggy enforces a zero-
tolerance policy against any form of 
abuse, discrimination, or harassment 
— including from customers, restaurant 
partners, or fellow partners. The 
redressal mechanism is prompt, 
partner-sensitive, and includes the right 
to refuse service in unsafe situations.
Safety Training & Awareness: Delivery 
partners undergo customised and 
vernacular road safety trainings 
through periodic workshops. These are 
conducted in partnership with traffic 
departments and local authorities 
to instil best practices and reduce 
accident risk.
Rest & Recovery Infrastructure: Swiggy 
is committed to scaling partner resting 
points across major delivery zones to 
ensure partners have access to safe, 
hygienic spaces for rest, hydration, and 
recharging during long shifts in extreme 
weather conditions.
Positive 
Investing in partner 
well-being reduces 
attrition, improves 
service consistency, 
and enhances brand 
equity, resulting in 
improved operational 
efficiency and long-
term value creation.

Performance Recognition & Incentives: 
Through structured reward programmes 
and recognition platforms, Swiggy 
encourages safety adherence, service 
excellence, and partner loyalty with 
benefits that include incentives, partenr 
ratings, and community celebration 
events.
Environmental: 
Reducing 
Emissions
Opportunity 
& Risk
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operational 
energy consumption and last-mile deliveries pose 
a material risk to Swiggy’s long-term resilience. 
Responsible business practices, in compliance with 
evolving regulatory norms, are critical to long-
term business success. Climate change-induced 
disruptions — such as extreme weather events — 
also threaten logistics, delivery partner safety, and 
service continuity.
At the same time, climate action presents a 
strategic opportunity for innovation, cost savings, 
and sustainable growth. Transitioning to a low-
carbon operating model can unlock operational 
efficiencies, enhance brand value, and create new 
pathways to green markets, financing, and long-
term competitiveness.
Swiggy recognises the urgency of 
addressing climate risks through 
proactive mitigation and long-term 
transition strategies. Our approach 
is anchored in both ambition and 
accountability. We have committed to 
achieving a 100% low-carbon delivery 
fleet and 100% renewable electricity 
usage across direct operations by 2030, 
aligning with global best practices 
and India’s net-zero trajectory. This 
transition is being operationalised 
through a multi-pronged strategy: 
Fleet Electrification: We are scaling the 
use of electric vehicles (EVs) across our 
delivery fleet by enabling access to and 
affordability of EVs for delivery partners 
through ecosystem partnerships and 
incentives.
Eco Saver Mode: A feature within our 
platform that promotes order batching 
and route optimisation to reduce trips, 
lower last-mile emissions, and improve 
delivery efficiency. 
Tech-Enabled Route Optimisation: Our 
proprietary algorithms continuously 
evolve to improve last-mile efficiency, 
reduce idle time, and minimise carbon 
intensity. 
Renewable Energy Integration: We 
are progressively shifting to renewable 
energy sources particularly in locations 
under our direct operational control to 
reduce emissions. 
In parallel, Swiggy is working towards 
enhancing its climate preparedness. 
Together, these measures lay the 
foundation for a salient, climate-
conscious operating model that aligns 
Swiggy’s business growth with its 
environmental responsibility.
Positive/Negative
Proactive climate 
action enables long-
term cost efficiencies, 
investor confidence, 
and access to green 
financing. 
Inaction, on the other 
hand, may lead to 
regulatory penalties, 
service disruptions, and 
reputational risk.

Delivering 
Circular 
Change
Opportunity
Swiggy’s efforts in driving circularity — across 
plastic reduction, responsible packaging, food 
waste minimisation, and surplus food redistribution 
— represent a strategic opportunity to drive 
responsible consumption. These initiatives 
strengthen brand equity, foster trust among 
stakeholders, and build deeper partnerships 
across the value chain.
At the same time, early action on circularity 
supports compliance with evolving regulations 
such as Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR), converting regulatory preparedness into 
competitive advantage. As consumer awareness 
and expectations around sustainability rise, 
Swiggy’s leadership in this space also reinforces 
customer loyalty and future-proofs the business.
Swiggy is implementing a multi-pronged 
circularity strategy, with focussed 
interventions across the value chain:
Plastic Reduction & Offsetting: 
Swiggy has successfully reduced and/
or offset 100% of plastic used in its 
direct operations in 2025, through a 
combination of reuse, recycling, and 
sustainable packaging.
Sustainable Packaging Adoption: We are 
targeting a 100% transition to responsible 
packaging by 2030 for restaurant 
partners, with continued awareness, 
planned incentives, and solution 
partnerships.
Customer Nudges for Waste Reduction: 
Features such as cutlery opt-out 
empower users to minimise waste 
— driving impact at scale through 
behavioural design.
Waste Minimisation: We are aiming 
to reduce perishable waste in direct 
operations by 25% year-on-year, enabled 
through improved inventory processes 
and automation.
Surplus Food Redistribution: Through 
partnerships with NGOs and food 
recovery networks, Swiggy is working to 
redistribute 100 million meals by 2030, 
turning surplus into a high-impact social 
intervention.
Positive
Swiggy’s circular 
economy efforts 
reduce long-term 
compliance costs 
and regulatory risks 
while enhancing 
operational efficiency. 
They also drive 
brand differentiation, 
improving customer 
loyalty and access 
to capital from 
sustainability-aligned 
investors and partners.
Governance: 
Data Privacy &
Cyber Security
Risk
As a leading digital platform, Swiggy manages 
a high volume of daily transactions involving 
customer, partner, and business data. Ensuring 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
this information is essential to maintaining smooth 
operations and trusted relationships across our 
ecosystem.
With the evolving digital landscape and growing 
regulatory focus on data protection, strong 
cybersecurity and privacy practices have become 
a core enabler of responsible growth, operational 
continuity, and stakeholder confidence.
Swiggy adopts a proactive, multi-
layered approach to safeguard digital 
infrastructure and user data:
Advanced Encryption Protocols: End-to-
end encryption ensures 
secure transmission and storage of 
sensitive data.
Threat Detection & Response: Real-time 
monitoring and AI-driven threat detection 
systems enable early identification and 
neutralisation of 
cyber risks.
Vulnerability Assessments & Penetration 
Testing: Regular security audits 
and ethical hacking simulations are 
conducted to identify and fix system 
weaknesses.
Compliance & Governance: Swiggy aligns 
with global best practices and evolving 
data protection laws (e.g., India’s DPDP 
Act), supported by robust internal policies.
Cyber Awareness Training: Employees 
undergo regular information security and 
cyber hygiene training to prevent social 
engineering and insider threats.
Third-Party Risk Management: Vendors 
and partners handling sensitive data 
are subject to strict security checks and 
compliance protocols.
Negative 
Cyber incidents could 
result in significant 
financial losses due to 
business disruption, 
legal liabilities, 
customer attrition, and 
reputational damage. 
Ongoing investments 
in cybersecurity 
infrastructure and 
training help mitigate 
these risks, protecting 
Swiggy’s revenue, 
brand equity, and 
compliance standing.

bar on food integrity and quality at a national 
level. By proactively guiding and supporting 
partners through structured food integrity 
programmes, Swiggy can enhance customer trust, 
reduce quality variability, and drive long-term 
differentiation in a market where accountability is 
becoming a key purchase driver.
Swiggy has launched Swiggy Seal – Food 
Integrity Certification to systematically 
raise quality and hygiene standards 
across its restaurant ecosystem. 
Developed with FSSAI-recognised audit 
agencies and informed by over 7 million 
verified customer reviews, the certification 
goes beyond compliance — embedding 
a culture of continuous improvement. The 
Seal is dynamic, merit-based, and can 
be revoked in case of lapses, reinforcing 
credibility and accountability.
As part of its broader sustainability goals, 
Swiggy aims to confer the Seal on 1 
million partners by 2030 and already has 
2,95,000 Seal accredited restaurants in its 
ecosystem. 
By proactively embedding food integrity 
into its platform ecosystem, Swiggy not 
only mitigates reputational and regulatory 
risks — it builds competitive advantage, 
enhances equity, and deepens 
stakeholder trust across the value chain.
Positive 
Improved food 
standards reduce 
the risk of financial 
losses from customer 
claims and regulatory 
penalties, while 
enhancing brand 
equity and customer 
retention.
Governance: 
Strong 
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Robust corporate governance and active 
corporate citizenship are fundamental to Swiggy’s 
long-term success in a rapidly evolving regulatory, 
social, and digital environment.
Strong governance frameworks enable sound 
decision-making, effective risk oversight, and 
ethical conduct — building stakeholder trust, 
enhancing resilience, and positioning the 
company for responsible, sustainable growth. 
As regulatory expectations heighten, governance 
excellence becomes a core differentiator.
At the same time, corporate citizenship 
offers a strategic lever to create shared 
value — deepening community engagement, 
strengthening brand affinity, and reinforcing 
Swiggy’s social licence to operate. 
Swiggy is institutionalising strong 
governance through:
	
Board-level oversight, supported 
by Audit and Risk Committees that 
provide strategic direction and 
independent guidance.
	
A formal Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework that maps, monitors, 
and mitigates risks across strategic, 
operational, compliance, and 
reputational domains.
	
A centralised compliance 
management system to ensure 
timely and consistent adherence to 
applicable laws and internal controls.
	
A strengthened whistleblower 
mechanism that upholds 
transparency, protects confidentiality, 
and ensures responsive action on 
misconduct.
	
Ongoing investments in ethical 
leadership and capacity-building 
across functions to nurture a culture 
of integrity, accountability, and 
compliance.
Positive
Strong governance 
improves investor 
confidence, reduces 
risk exposure, and 
enhances Swiggy’s 
attractiveness as 
a public company. 
Effective corporate 
citizenship deepens 
community goodwill, 
enhances employee 
and partner 
engagement, and 
helps future-proof the 
brand in a trust-driven 
economy.

Swiggy’s ability to create 
long-term stakeholder value 
depends on an inclusive and 
future-ready value network — 
spanning its workforce, delivery 
partners, restaurant partners, 
small business owners, and 
other business-linked partners. 
Together, they form the 
operational and reputational 
backbone of the platform.
Empowering this network 
through inclusive policies, 
skilling, and growth-oriented 
interventions presents a 
strategic opportunity to build 
resilience, social capital, and 
competitive differentiation in the 
platform economy.
Swiggy has adopted a multi-stakeholder approach to value 
creation, focussed on empowerment, equity, and long-term 
sustainability across its workforce and partner ecosystem:
For Delivery Partners:
	
Insurance coverage including accident and health 
benefits for over 18 lakh partners during the year
	
Road safety and emergency response trainings
	
SOS button and ambulance services across cities
	
Weather-appropriate safety gear and rest points
	
Flexible work models with fair, transparent earnings paid 
out daily 
	
Mental wellness and financial literacy support
For Restaurant & Small Business Partners:
	
Access to hygiene and food quality certifications
	
Responsible packaging enablement (opt-out, guidance, 
facilitating vendor identification)
	
Tools for digital visibility, performance analytics, and 
business growth
	
Onboarding and advisory support to scale responsibly
For Swiggy’s workforce:
	
Structured career pathways, internal mobility, 
and skilling
	
Inclusive workplace policies and equitable benefits
	
Personalised well-being wallet offering flexible, 
employee-led welfare choices
	
Leadership development and mentorship
	
DE&I and culture-building programmes rooted in trust 
and ownership
Ecosystem-Wide Interventions:
	
Swigstree Brigade: Financial Literacy for Gig Workers 
Swiggy partnered with the National Stock Exchange 
(NSE) to deliver a financial literacy programme for 
delivery partners, with a special focus on women. The 
programme covers budgeting, investments, and capital 
markets. Swiggy has also committed to onboarding 
1 lakh female delivery partners by 2030 and annually 
recognises top performers through the Swigstree 
Brigade.
	
Swiggy Skills:  Under its flagship programme Swiggy 
Skills, Swiggy has partnered with the Ministry of Skill 
Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to offer 
online skilling and certifications via the Skill India 
Digital Hub. The initiative currently supports over 5 
lakh delivery partners, 4 lakh restaurant partners, 
along with individuals trained through Sector Skill 
Councils, providing not just skill development but also 
employment opportunities and internships across 
Swiggy’s value chain. Swiggy aims to empower over one 
million individuals by 2030, fostering stronger and more 
sustainable livelihoods.
	
She The Change: Inaugurated in 2024 by Finance 
Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the first edition of She The 
Change celebrated women entrepreneurs in the F&B 
sector, recognising 50,000+ women-run restaurants 
generating 3,00,000+ jobs. By providing visibility, 
resources, and growth opportunities, the initiative is a 
step towards Swiggy’s goal of empowering 1,00,000 
women across its ecosystem.
	
Entrepreneurship Support: Partnering with 100+ startups 
in climate, logistics, and circularity to unlock innovation 
and job creation. 
Positive
Strategic investment in 
partner and workforce 
empowerment drives 
higher retention, 
platform reliability, 
stakeholder trust, and 
regulatory alignment – 
resulting in sustained 
operational efficiency, 
brand strength, and 
long-term value 
creation.

eight focus areas. This milestone marks FY 2024-25 as our baseline year where intent meets structure, and ambition translates 
into measurable action. These 2030 goals reflect Swiggy’s commitment to building a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable 
ecosystem for all stakeholders. Beginning next year, we will report progress against each goal, enabling transparent and consistent

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.   Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
	
FY 2024-25 marked a foundational year for sustainability at Swiggy. We moved from intent to action with the announcement of 
our 2030 Sustainability Goals spanning climate action, circular packaging, delivery partner welfare, and inclusive growth. Early 
initiatives under these goals are already demonstrating that scale and responsibility can reinforce each other when approached 
with clarity and intent.
	
This year was as much about setting ambition as building the foundation — embedding sustainability into how we think, design, 
and grow, so it becomes integral to the way Swiggy operates. The road ahead will demand deeper visibility across our supply 
chain, stronger collaboration with partners, and constant innovation. What gives me confidence is the shared belief across Swiggy 
that progress comes from making every choice count ensuring growth and responsibility move forward together.
	
That belief will continue to guide us as we build Swiggy into an institution that delivers not just at speed and scale, but with intent 
and conscience - true to our purpose of delivering unparalleled convenience, responsibly.

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE 
Principle 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is 
Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
At Swiggy, integrity is not just a compliance requirement - it 
is the foundation of how we think, act, and grow. We believe 
that doing the right thing consistently, even when no one is 
watching, is essential to earning the trust of our employees, 
partners, customers, and regulators.
Our commitment goes beyond following rules; it is about 
building a culture where ethical behaviour is second nature, 
and every decision reflects transparency and fairness. We 
want our people to feel empowered to raise concerns, 
challenge practices that do not align with our values, and 
take ownership for doing what is right.
A robust suite of policies, including our Code of Conduct 
and allied frameworks on anti-bribery, anti-corruption, 
and conflict of interest, plays an integral role in ensuring 
good governance across the organisation. These policies 
provide clear guidance, set unambiguous expectations, and 
empower our people to make decisions that consistently 
uphold our values.
Strong governance is at the heart of this approach. We hold 
ourselves accountable to the highest standards because 
we understand that trust is earned over time and lost in a 
moment. Whether it is how we engage with our partners, 
manage data, or report to our Board, our intent is to ensure 
that every action strengthens the credibility we have built 
with our stakeholders.
Integrity at Swiggy is therefore not a standalone programme 
- it is part of our identity. By embedding honesty, 
responsibility, and openness into everything we do, we are 
building a business that people can believe in, today and 
for the future.
Integrity is not just about 
avoiding what is wrong; it is 
about inspiring confidence in 
every stakeholder that Swiggy 
will always choose what is 
right for the long run. That 
confidence is our greatest 
asset - and the reason people 
trust us with their business, their 
data, and their livelihoods.

Swiggy contested this assessment before the Appellate Authority, maintaining 
that Delivery Executives operate as independent contractors engaged on a 
principal-to-principal basis. As such, they do not fall within the purview of the 
Profession Tax under the Maharashtra State Tax on Professions, Trades, Callings 
and Employments Act (PTRC Act).
Swiggy maintains that its engagement model is in full compliance with 
applicable legal and regulatory frameworks governing platform work and gig 
economy practices. A stay order on the demand has been successfully secured 
on 30.06.2025, and the matter is currently pending adjudication before the 
Appellate Authority.

provide a web-link to the policy. 
	
Yes. Swiggy is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and ethical conduct in all its 
business dealings. As part of this commitment, Swiggy has instituted a comprehensive Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
(ABAC) Policy, which is embedded within its overarching Code of Conduct.
	
The policy applies to all employees (permanent, contractual, or temporary), directors, consultants, suppliers, and third 
parties across Swiggy’s value chain. It explicitly prohibits any form of bribery, kickbacks, facilitation payments, or corrupt 
practices — whether offered or received — while conducting business on behalf of Swiggy.
	
The ABAC framework is aligned with key domestic and global statutes, including the Prevention of Corruption Act, 
1988, Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, UK Bribery Act, U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003, and the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013, wherever applicable.
	
Swiggy’s policy mandates:
	
	
Zero tolerance towards bribery or corruption in any form
	
	
Annual employee declarations and periodic ABAC training
	
	
Robust controls to detect and deter violations
	
	
Disciplinary action, including termination, in case of breaches
	
The purpose of the policy is to ensure Swiggy is not directly or indirectly involved in any activity that may amount to 
bribery, facilitation payments, or corruption – even inadvertently.

Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
At Swiggy, convenience and responsibility go hand in hand. 
How we deliver is as important as what we deliver, and every 
choice we make must be safe, sustainable, and fair to the 
people and communities we serve.
Our ambition is to shape an ecosystem where sustainability 
is not a trade-off but seamlessly built into every experience. 
We are committed to raising the bar, enabling partners 
to adopt responsible practices, and using technology to 
make the responsible choice simpler and more accessible 
for everyone.
This is not just a business obligation; it is a non-negotiable 
for the future. Every innovation - whether in packaging, 
logistics, or sourcing - reflects our belief that growth must 
be inclusive and mindful of its impact on people and the 
planet. By embedding sustainability and safety into our 
culture and partnerships, we aim to build a platform people 
trust - not just for unparalleled convenience, but for the 
assurance that every order contributes to a better and more 
responsible tomorrow.
Responsible delivery goes 
beyond operational excellence; 
it is about shaping habits 
and expectations. When 
consumers choose Swiggy, 
they choose quality, a reduced 
environmental footprint, and 
an ecosystem that uplifts the 
people we interact with - 
directly and indirectly. Our role 
is to make the right choice the 
easiest one so that, over time, 
doing what’s better for people 
and the planet becomes second 
nature for everyone.

technology partners.
	
	
The policy includes:

Conduct, promoting human rights, ethical labour, and environmental stewardship.

evaluated on labour practices, health and safety, environmental impact, and business ethics — aligned 
with global standards.
	
	
	
Capacity Building: Swiggy is working towards institutionalising regular training and engagement 
programmes to equip value chain partners with knowledge and tools to improve their sustainability 
performance.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Although Swiggy does not manufacture the products sold via its platform, it is committed to driving circularity across 
its operations and partner ecosystem. To safely reclaim, reuse, recycle, or dispose of end-of-life materials, Swiggy has 
implemented the following processes:
	
a.	
Plastics (including packaging)
	
	
Collection & Segregation: All plastic packaging used in Swiggy’s direct operations (e.g., insulated bags, courier 
pouches) is collected and segregated at source.
	
	
Authorised Recycling Partnerships: Segregated plastics are handed over to BBMP- and CPCB-authorised 
recyclers, who process them into certified recycled pellets.
	
	
Offset & Reduction Targets: Swiggy has achieved a 100% reduction or offset of its direct-use plastics in FY 2024-
25 and will continue to scale reuse and recycling initiatives. By 2030, all restaurant partners will be supported to 
transition to responsible, plastic-free packaging alternatives.
	
b.	
E-Waste
	
	
Certified Processors: E-waste is aggregated centrally and transferred to Envirokare Recycling Solutions Pvt. Ltd., 
which operates licensed dismantling and recycling facilities in compliance with the E-Waste (Management & 
Handling) Rules, 2022.
	
	
Full-Chain Traceability: Every disposal batch is tracked via a manifest system to ensure material is processed in 
an environmentally controlled manner.
	
c.	
Other Waste (Organic & Dry)
	
	
Organic Waste Management: Wet waste from cafeterias and pantries in Swiggy HO is processed on-site using 
Organic Waste Converters (OWC), converting food scraps into compost for landscaping. Surplus organic residue 
is sent to partnered piggery farms — supporting a closed-loop model.
	
	
Dry Waste Recycling: Paper, cardboard, and other dry recyclables are handed off to state municipal-authorised 
dry-waste vendors for sorting, baling, and onward recycling.
	
	
Zero-Landfill Aspiration: Through these combined measures, 100% of Swiggy HO’s operational waste streams are 
diverted from landfill, supporting our “zero-waste-to-landfill” principle.
	
	
This reflects Swiggy’s broader 2030 goals - to eliminate or offset all operational plastics by 2025, reduce perishable 
waste by 25% annually, and embed responsible sourcing and circularity across the entire value chain.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the

Principle 3: Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their 
value chains
At Swiggy, the well-being of our people employees, delivery 
partners, and value chain participants is central to how we 
build and grow. We believe that a thriving workforce is one 
where safety, inclusion, and opportunity are not optional 
benefits but fundamental rights.
Our ambition is to create a workplace and ecosystem where 
every individual feels valued, supported, and empowered to 
succeed. This means fostering a culture where mental and 
physical well-being are prioritised, career growth is actively 
enabled, and diversity and inclusion are woven into how we 
hire, develop, and lead.
We see well-being as a shared responsibility. From building 
equitable workplaces to creating safer and more dignified 
conditions for delivery partners, we are committed to raising 
the standards of care and support across our ecosystem. 
Because when our people thrive, they create lasting value – 
not just for Swiggy, but for the communities and customers 
we serve.
Well-being is not a programme; 
it is a mindset we’ve nurtured 
over a decade. At Swiggy, 
this culture has been built 
through countless small but 
meaningful actions — checking 
in on colleagues, celebrating 
milestones, and ensuring every 
part of our value chain feels 
respected and supported. 
When people feel genuinely 
cared for, they don’t just deliver 
better outcomes — they shape 
the culture and trust that make 
Swiggy stronger every day.

Permanent 
Workers
Yes.
Swiggy has instituted a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism for employees and workers through 
its Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal Policy, which outlines structured procedures for raising, 
investigating, and resolving grievances in a timely and confidential manner.
Key features of the mechanism include:
	
Multiple access channels: Grievances may be submitted via a dedicated email ID (grievances@swiggy.in)
	
Time-bound resolution: All grievances are acknowledged within 48 hours and resolved within 14 days, depending 
on complexity.
	
Fair and transparent process: Grievances are reviewed by a designated team, with thorough investigation and 
regular communication of outcomes to the concerned individuals.
	
Confidentiality and non-retaliation: Swiggy maintains strict confidentiality and ensures there is no retaliation 
against any employee or worker raising a concern in good faith.
	
Training and awareness: Regular training is provided to internal teams to sensitise them to the grievance handling 
process and ensure consistent, empathetic resolution.
	
Governance: Oversight by Business Assurance & ERM, Legal, and HR teams.
This mechanism is further reinforced by Swiggy’s Code of Conduct, DE&I Policy, POSH Policy, Whistleblower Policy, and 
Discrimination & Harassment Prevention Policy, which collectively uphold the organisation’s commitment to a safe, 
inclusive, and responsive work environment.
Harassment, including Sexual Harassment:
Concerns relating to sexual harassment at the workplace are addressed through the Internal Complaints Committee 
(ICC), constituted under the POSH Act. Employees can write directly to icc@swiggy.in. The process ensures 
confidentiality, timely redressal, and non-retaliation.
Discrimination or Workplace Bias:
Swiggy’s DE&I and Anti-Discrimination Policies reaffirm the company’s zero-tolerance stance towards any form of 
workplace discrimination or bias. These policies establish clear principles for fostering an inclusive, respectful, and 
equitable work environment, while outlining accessible avenues for redressal. Employees can raise concerns through 
their manager, HR Business Partner, or escalate further as per the defined grievance hierarchy.
Additionally, Swiggy PRISM – a thoughtfully curated, virtual safe space – offers community, conversation, and quiet 
reflection for those who navigate the world differently in identity, lived experience, or perspective. It reflects Swiggy’s 
ongoing commitment to embracing diversity not just in policy, but in culture and practice.
Ethical Misconduct & Policy Violations:
The Whistleblower Policy provides secure, independent, and anonymous channels to report violations of the Code of 
Conduct, ethical misconduct, or reputational risks. Complaints can be made via:
	
Toll-free number: 1800-102-6969
	
Web portal: https://swiggy.integritymatters.in
	
Email: swiggy@integritymatters.in
	
Or by writing to the Chairman of the Audit Committee at chairman.ac@swiggy.in
Grievances Related to Work Conditions or Internal Services:
Concerns related to HR policies, work conditions, or unresolved workplace issues can be escalated through:
	
“Voice of Employees” (voe@swiggy.in) — directly reviewed by the CHRO
	
grievances@swiggy.in — an apex channel, for all grievances
Swiggy continuously reviews these mechanisms to ensure they remain accessible, responsive, and aligned with 
regulatory standards and employee expectations.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/
No). If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, Swiggy has implemented a formal Health and Safety Policy that aligns with ISO 45001:2018 and India’s 
National Policy on Safety, Health, and Environment at the Workplace. The policy is designed to promote a safe, 
healthy, and inclusive work environment for all stakeholders associated with Swiggy. It spans across locations and 
networks, and key features include clearly defined health and safety SOPs across locations, internal safety audits 
and incident reporting mechanisms, mandatory contractual clauses, on-ground health and wellness infrastructure 
(doctor-on-call, ambulance access, etc.).
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
Swiggy has established structured processes to identify work-related hazards and manage risks on both routine 
and non-routine bases, led by the Admin and Human Resources (HR) teams. For routine operations, potential 
risks are identified through regular workplace checks, safety reviews, and ongoing feedback from employees 
and frontline staff. These processes help monitor physical infrastructure, occupational health factors, and general 
workplace safety across corporate offices and partner-facing facilities. In the case of non-routine activities - such 
as office relocations, infrastructure upgrades, or event-based operations - risks are identified in advance through 
collaborative planning between Admin, HR, and relevant teams to ensure necessary safeguards are in place. 
Employee inputs, incident reports, and internal grievance mechanisms also support continuous identification and 
resolution of safety-related concerns, helping Swiggy maintain a safe and responsive work environment.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, Swiggy has instituted a robust safety incident reporting and redressal mechanism accessible to employees, 
workers, and value network. Concerns can be raised confidentially through designated internal channels, with 
a structured escalation matrix to relevant teams and governance bodies for timely resolution. Furthermore, our 
Statutory Reports

commitment to health and safety extends beyond the workplace to our broader value chain - at the heart of 
which are our delivery partners. They are encouraged to self-assess risks and are fully supported in withdrawing 
from any unsafe situations without fear of reprisal. While dedicated, stakeholder-specific channels are in place, 
Swiggy’s Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal Policy also provides an overarching grievance 
mechanism accessible to all stakeholders through the designated email address: grievances@swiggy.in
	
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, Swiggy’s workforce has access to a range of non-occupational medical and healthcare services designed 
to support their overall well-being. Swiggy places high importance on the health of its employees and has 
implemented comprehensive facilities and programmes, including:
	
	
	
A fully staffed, on-site medical room operational 24*7
	
	
	
A dedicated ambulance available round the clock
	
	
	
Access to hospitals for emergency and extended care services 
	
	
	
A dedicated Mothers’ Room to support nursing and maternal health needs, available in most of our high 
footfall offices  
	
	
Beyond immediate medical care, employees and workers are covered under medical and accident insurance 
policies, which may also be extended to eligible family members. Routine health check-ups are facilitated to 
monitor wellness, alongside preventive care initiatives such as yoga sessions, mental health consultations, and 
wellness workshops. 24*7 telehealth services are also available to employees, ensuring accessible medical support 
across all locations.
	
	
This integrated approach reflects Swiggy’s commitment to creating a safe, healthy, and inclusive work environment 
that proactively supports the physical and mental well-being of its people.

Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
At Swiggy, listening to and acting on stakeholder feedback 
is central to how we build trust and create long-term value. 
We believe that meaningful engagement is not a one-time 
exercise but a continuous dialogue – one that shapes how 
we grow, innovate, and respond to the needs of those who 
are part of our ecosystem.
Over the years, we have built this culture of responsiveness 
by making engagement transparent, inclusive, and insight-
led. Whether it is co-creating solutions with partners, 
improving experiences for customers, or enabling greater 
opportunities for communities, we strive to ensure that every 
interaction creates value and strengthens relationships.
We recognise that our success is deeply intertwined with 
the success of those we work with. By respecting diverse 
perspectives, staying open to concerns, and translating 
feedback into tangible action, we aim to reinforce trust 
with every decision we make. This is how we continue to 
build a platform where growth is not only shared but shaped 
together with those who are part of our journey.
Some of our best ideas have 
come from simply listening. 
Stakeholders often know what 
works – and what doesn’t – 
long before we do, and 
engaging with them openly has 
consistently led us to better, 
faster solutions. When people 
see their feedback translate 
into real change, trust deepens, 
brand affinity grows, and the 
willingness to innovate together 
becomes far stronger.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Swiggy adopts a structured and principle-driven approach to stakeholder identification, as outlined in its approved 
Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal Policy. The process involves a systematic evaluation of both actual 
and potential stakeholders based on two primary criteria:
	
a.	
the degree of influence the stakeholder group has on Swiggy’s ability to create and sustain value, and
	
b.	
the extent to which Swiggy’s operations, decisions, or business conduct impact the stakeholder group.
	
This dual-lens assessment is applied through an influence-impact matrix, enabling Swiggy to map and prioritise 
stakeholders across its value chain and ecosystem. Based on this assessment, the key stakeholder groups identified 
by the company include employees and workers, and value chain partners including delivery partners, customers (end 
users and restaurant partners), suppliers and vendors, investors and shareholders, communities where Swiggy operates. 
	
This identification process is reviewed periodically, especially during materiality assessments, to ensure it reflects 
evolving stakeholder dynamics, business priorities, and regulatory requirements. It forms the foundation for Swiggy’s 
stakeholder engagement and grievance redressal mechanisms, ensuring that stakeholder voices are considered in 
key decision-making processes.

1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
At Swiggy, the consultation process between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics is anchored in our enterprise-wide Materiality Assessment, which serves as a structured mechanism to identify 
and prioritise the sustainability issues most relevant to our stakeholders and business.
	
This process includes:
	
Stakeholder Engagement: Through surveys, interviews, and focussed group discussions with key stakeholder cohorts 
including employees, delivery partners, restaurant partners, suppliers, investors, and communities we capture diverse 
perspectives on emerging risks, expectations, and priorities.
	
Dual Lens: We apply a dual framework that considers both the impact of Swiggy’s operations on stakeholders and 
the environment (inside-out) and the influence of stakeholder issues on Swiggy’s ability to generate value (outside-in).
	
Functional Inputs and Sustainability & CSR Steering Team: Stakeholder insights are further supplemented by inputs 
from internal subject matter experts and business leaders. The synthesised materiality matrix is reviewed and validated 
by Swiggy’s Sustainability & CSR Steering Team which includes senior leaders across key functions.
	
Board-Level Oversight: The validated materiality outcomes and stakeholder concerns are then formally presented 
to the Board and/or designated Board committees (as relevant), enabling them to exercise oversight and integrate 
stakeholder-aligned sustainability priorities into the company’s strategy, risk management, and disclosures.
	
By embedding this consultation feedback loop within our governance structure, Swiggy ensures that the voices of 
stakeholders meaningfully inform leadership decisions on economic, environmental, and social matters.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. Swiggy actively engages with key stakeholders including customers, delivery partners, restaurant partners, 
employees, and communities to inform the identification and prioritisation of environmental and social topics. These 
consultations are embedded into our periodic materiality assessments and regular business feedback loops, helping 
shape strategic programmes and on-ground initiatives.
	
Inputs received through these interactions have directly contributed to the development of high-impact initiatives 
including but not limited to:
	
Eco Saver: Co-created with insights from customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners, Eco Saver is an 
intelligent order batching system that reduces single-trip inefficiencies. By optimising multiple deliveries along the 
same route, it enhances delivery partner productivity, reduces emissions, and contributes to our broader climate goals 
while maintaining speed and reliability for customers.
	
Swiggy Seal: Developed in collaboration with restaurant partners, Swiggy has launched the Swiggy Seal – Food 
Integrity Certification to systematically raise quality and hygiene standards across its restaurant ecosystem. Developed 
with FSSAI-recognised audit agencies and informed by over 7 million verified customer reviews, the certification goes 
beyond compliance - embedding a culture of continuous improvement. The Seal is dynamic, merit-based, and can 
be revoked in case of lapses, reinforcing credibility and accountability. This initiative reflects our shared commitment 
to food integrity and was directly informed by rising customer expectations post-COVID, alongside the restaurants’ 
efforts to strengthen consumer trust.
	
Swiggy x Sulabh: Our partnership with Sulabh International emerged from community and partner feedback advocating 
for more dignified and accessible sanitation options for delivery partners. This programme has enabled access to 
hygienic restroom facilities in high-footfall delivery zones, ensuring the well-being and dignity of delivery partners.
	
Swiggy Serves: Swiggy, through its flagship initiative Swiggy Serves, has set an ambitious goal of donating 100 million 
meals by 2030. A significant part of this will be achieved in partnership with the Robin Hood Army (RHA), which is

153
Annual Report 2024-25
expected to contribute 50 million meals. Already active in 171 cities, the partnership leverages technology-driven food 
redistribution to bridge the gap between surplus food and those facing hunger.
	
Swiggy Pawlice: Launched in April 2024, Swiggy Pawlice helps reunite lost pets with their owners through the Swiggy 
app. Users can report missing pets, and Swiggy’s 5.2 lakh+ delivery partners help stay alert while on their routes. When 
a reported pet is spotted, Swiggy facilitates communication between the partner and pet owner, supporting timely 
reunions. The initiative reflects Swiggy’s commitment to community welfare and compassionate engagement.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalised stakeholder groups.
	
Swiggy is committed to inclusive growth by ensuring that vulnerable and marginalised communities meaningfully 
benefit from its platform. Our engagement approach prioritises active listening and responsive action across 
stakeholder groups.
	
For delivery partners, Swiggy has implemented structured grievance redressal mechanisms, including the Voice of DE 
platform, dedicated helplines, and support centres. In collaboration with Sulabh International, we’ve also installed 
accessible sanitation facilities in high-delivery zones to address hygiene and dignity concerns.
	
Swiggy actively fosters workplace inclusion for the LGBTQIA+ community through sensitisation sessions and the PRISM 
ERG, which offers a safe space for peer support. The Swigstree ERG similarly empowers women employees through 
community building and open feedback channels. Further, our flea market platform promotes Pride-led and women-
led businesses, enhancing visibility and economic opportunity.
	
We support small-scale entrepreneurs including local and regional vendors from disadvantaged backgrounds - 
through simplified onboarding, targeted outreach, and capacity-building efforts.
	
All stakeholders, including those from marginalised groups, have access to Swiggy’s Code of Conduct, Whistleblower, 
and Anti-Harassment Policies, which are designed to be accessible, responsive, and non-retaliatory. This structured 
and inclusive approach reflects Swiggy’s commitment to uplifting communities and enabling equitable access to the 
digital economy.

Principle 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights
At Swiggy, respecting human rights begins with a simple 
belief: every individual connected to our platform deserves to 
be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. As a platform 
that touches millions of lives, we view this responsibility as 
fundamental to how we create trust, enable opportunity, and 
build an ecosystem that people can rely on with confidence.
This belief has shaped how we operate over the years. We 
have worked to embed fairness and inclusion into the very 
design of our systems - so that equal access, safe working 
conditions, and respectful engagement are not exceptions, 
but the norm. It also means holding ourselves and those 
we work with to the same high standards, encouraging 
partners and suppliers to adopt responsible practices, and 
creating mechanisms where concerns can be raised freely 
and addressed transparently.
We recognise that this is not a goal with a finish line. 
Respecting and promoting human rights is a continuous 
effort – one where we will keep investing, challenging 
ourselves, and addressing gaps as they emerge. Real 
progress, for us, is measured not by policies alone but by 
how people experience our platform every day by whether 
they feel valued, heard, and assured that their rights are 
protected. Respecting human rights is not only about 
avoiding harm; it is about enabling people to participate 
with dignity, to aspire, and to grow. That is how we believe 
opportunity and respect must go hand in hand.
People instantly recognise when 
they are treated with fairness 
- and they remember just as 
deeply when they are not. In 
a platform as diverse as ours, 
every interaction signals what 
we stand for. When fairness 
and respect are practised 
consistently - whether within 
teams or across our value chain 
- it changes behaviour. People 
speak up more, expect better, 
and hold themselves to higher 
standards. That is the real 
impact we want to create: an 
ecosystem where dignity is not 
just offered, but expected by 
everyone involved.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Swiggy is committed to fostering a workplace where every individual feels safe, respected, and empowered to raise 
concerns without fear of retaliation. To uphold this commitment, the company has instituted robust safeguards through 
approved internal policies that prohibit discrimination and harassment in any form - whether based on gender, sexual 
orientation, caste, religion, disability, age, or other protected characteristics.
	
Clear Policy Frameworks and Definitions
	
Swiggy’s Discrimination & Harassment Prevention Policy covers all forms of non-sexual harassment, including bullying, 
intimidation, exclusion, and caste-, class-, or identity-based microaggressions. The POSH Policy specifically addresses 
sexual harassment at the workplace, in compliance with the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, 2013.
	
Dedicated Redressal Committees
	
	
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC): Handles all sexual harassment complaints and is constituted in accordance 
with the law. It ensures confidentiality and fair hearing.
	
	
Stakeholder Management Committee: Established under the Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal 
Policy, it addresses non-sexual complaints related to harassment, discrimination, or any violation of dignity at work.
	
	
Ethics & Integrity Team/Ombudsperson: Investigates anonymous or escalated complaints, especially those 
involving senior leaders or systemic issues.
	
Confidential Reporting Channels & Whistleblower Mechanism
	
Multiple secure, confidential, and accessible reporting avenues are available:
	
	
icc@swiggy.in for POSH-related concerns (city-specific IDs also exist)
	
	
voe@swiggy.in (Voice of Employees) for workplace culture and HR-related concerns
	
	
Swiggy’s Whistleblower Portal (https://swiggy.integritymatters.in) for anonymous, third-party-enabled reporting
	
While dedicated grievance channels exist for key stakeholder groups, Swiggy’s Stakeholder Management and 
Grievance Redressal Policy also provides an apex grievance mechanism for all stakeholders via the designated email 
ID: grievances@swiggy.in. This central channel is equipped to address and appropriately redirect concerns across 
the value chain, reinforcing Swiggy’s commitment to fairness and accountability. All complaints are treated with strict 
confidentiality and objectivity, and access is restricted to those directly involved in investigation and resolution.
	
Anti-Retaliation Safeguards
	
Swiggy explicitly prohibits retaliation against any individual who raises a concern, files a complaint, or participates in 
an investigation be it formal or informal. Any form of punitive action (transfer, denial of promotion, demotion, verbal 
threats, or subtle exclusion) is considered a policy breach and attracts disciplinary consequences.
	
Secure Documentation & Protection of Identity
	
All complaints are documented and stored separately by the HR or Ethics & Integrity. Details of a complaint are never 
entered into an employee’s personnel file unless a breach is formally substantiated. Records are securely maintained 
with restricted access.
	
Integration with DE&I Goals
	
Swiggy’s approach to grievance redressal is closely aligned with its broader Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) 
mandate. All redressal data is reviewed for systemic patterns, which then inform culture-building and policy 
evolution efforts.
	
Awareness, Training & Culture Building
	
	
Mandatory onboarding sessions on harassment and discrimination policies

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. While Swiggy’s business agreements may not always refer to “human rights” explicitly, all contracts with value 
chain partners contain binding clauses requiring adherence to the law of the land including applicable labour laws, 
equality, non-discrimination, and occupational safety laws that form the backbone of human rights in India.
	
Further, Swiggy’s Code of Conduct, which applies to its employees, and value chain including delivery partners, 
suppliers, vendors, and contractors, reinforces its commitment to fundamental rights such as dignity at work, freedom 
from discrimination or harassment, and the right to a safe workplace.
	
This expectation of ethical and lawful conduct is also extended through our Supplier Code of Conduct and Stakeholder 
Management and Grievance Redressal Policy, ensuring that rights-related concerns can be raised and addressed 
across the value chain.

Is the premise/office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, as per the requirements of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?
	
Swiggy is deeply committed to fostering a workplace that is inclusive, accessible, and respectful of the rights and 
dignity of all employees, including persons with disabilities. In line with this commitment, our headquarters at Embassy 
TechVillage (ETV) — which accounts for over 67% of Swiggy’s total employee base — has been designed and maintained 
in full compliance with the accessibility standards outlined under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
	
The campus reflects thoughtful integration of universal design principles, ensuring seamless and barrier-free access 
to all major functional areas including building entrances, common areas, workspaces, washrooms, cafeterias, and 
emergency exits. Key accessibility features include:
	
	
Step-free entryways and automated doors to enable smooth navigation;
	
	
Ramps equipped with handrails and anti-skid flooring to support mobility aid users;
	
	
Restrooms built to accessibility standards, including grab bars and sufficient turning radius for people with 
wheelchair and locomotive needs;
	
	
Elevators with tactile buttons, Braille signage, and audio assistance, making vertical movement easier for 
individuals with visual impairments; and
	
	
Clear, high-contrast signage throughout the premises to aid navigation for all users, including those with low 
vision or cognitive disabilities.
	
Recognising that accessibility is an ongoing journey rather than a one-time intervention, Swiggy continues to evaluate 
its broader office footprint across India to identify and address infrastructural or procedural gaps. We are progressively 
working towards enhancing accessibility across all office locations, guided by employee feedback, inclusive design 
experts, and evolving best practices.
	
Through these efforts, Swiggy strives to ensure that every workspace across the organisation reflects our values of 
equity, dignity, and opportunity for all.

Principle 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
For Swiggy, sustainability is not a parallel track to growth 
it is central to how we imagine the future of convenience. 
As one of India’s largest platforms, we recognise the 
responsibility and influence we have in shaping how 
commerce flows through cities and we are determined to 
use that scale to drive change that extends well beyond 
our own operations.
Our approach is anchored in redesigning systems, not just 
offsetting outcomes. This means building a logistics network 
that steadily shifts towards low-carbon mobility, expanding 
renewable energy use across facilities, and accelerating 
the adoption of sustainable materials and plastic-free 
packaging. Waste is treated not as an inevitable by-
product but as a resource – recovered, recycled, and 
repurposed to move closer to a truly circular system.
What makes this effort meaningful is its ability to create 
ripple effects. The solutions we invest in whether climate-
friendly packaging, cleaner mobility, or waste recovery 
infrastructure – are designed to be scalable and to inspire 
adoption across the value chain. By making sustainable 
practices easier and more accessible for partners, suppliers, 
and consumers, we aim to raise collective standards for 
environmental responsibility.
Environmental stewardship for us is about constantly testing 
new ideas, improving what already exists, and collaborating 
with innovators who can push the boundaries further. Our 
ambition is clear: to set the benchmark for responsible 
delivery in India and to prove that the convenience economy 
can, and should, be built on principles that respect the 
planet as much as they serve its people.
Sustainability at scale needs the 
same mindset we bring to building 
great products and solutions that 
are simple, intuitive, and designed 
to work seamlessly across millions 
of interactions. The real challenge 
is to reimagine the systems behind 
our platform not by adding green 
layers to existing processes, but 
by redesigning how deliveries 
move, how networks are optimised, 
and how resources flow, so that 
efficiency and sustainability 
reinforce each other. When that 
happens, the impact goes beyond 
reducing our own footprint; it can 
influence how the entire ecosystem 
operates and that’s what excites 
us at Swiggy.

broader sustainability goals and contribute meaningfully to emissions reduction:
	
Reducing Emissions
	
Low Carbon Fleet
	
Swiggy has undertaken an ambitious goal to transition to a 100% electric delivery fleet by 2030. Towards this end, 
Swiggy has partnered with third-party electric vehicle (EV) and allied service providers to accelerate this transition:
	
	
EV Deployment and Infrastructure Support: Improved accessibility and affordability of EVs and charging 
infrastructure across key delivery hubs.
	
	
Impact: These efforts led to a reduction of 710.69 tCO2e in FY 2023-24 and 4,483 tCO2e in FY 2024-25.
	
Last-mile Optimisation
	
	
Responding to stakeholder interest in operational efficiency and climate action, Eco Saver is an intelligent batching 
feature that optimises routing by clubbing multiple orders.
	
	
Impact: In FY 2024-25 alone, Eco Saver has facilitated approximately 30 million deliveries resulting in a reduction 
of over 500 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
	
Clean Energy
	
Swiggy is committed to transitioning to 100% renewable electricity in its direct operations by 2030, by adopting 
sustainable and energy-efficient solutions. Swiggy’s corporate headquarters at Embassy TechVillage (ETV), Bengaluru 
housing over 67% of our permanent workforce and 75% of our operational infrastructure embodies our commitment to 
building a sustainable operational backbone. ETV’s LEED O&M v4.1 Platinum certification by the U.S. Green Building 
Council (USGBC) stands as a benchmark in energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste management. Notably, 
65% of the electricity used at our corporate headquarters is sourced from renewables. Guided by this standard, 
Swiggy is committed to progressively transitioning its infrastructure and operations towards similarly high-performing, 
environmentally responsible facilities.

Swiggy has launched multiple initiatives to address the emissions associated with packaging production and 
waste, that consequently affect emissions positively.
	
	
Cutlery Opt-Out Feature: By empowering users to skip cutlery by default, Swiggy avoids unnecessary manufacturing, 
packaging, and transport of single-use plastic items. Within a week of introducing the feature, approximately 96% 
of orders had cutlery opt-out enabled, significantly reducing waste across our delivery ecosystem.

– is treated on-site using Organic Waste Converters (OWCs). These systems convert waste into compost, which is then 
reused within the campus for landscaping and horticulture, supporting a closed-loop waste-to-resource model. A 
significant portion of the organic waste is also diverted to piggery farms, enabling further reuse through responsible 
animal feed applications.
Dry and Recyclable Waste: Dry waste, such as paper, packaging materials, and plastics, is carefully segregated and 
handed over to BBMP-authorised vendors and recyclers. This ensures maximum material recovery, regulatory compliance, 
and minimal environmental impact.
Zero-Waste-to-Landfill Aspiration: The ETV campus has adopted a zero-waste-to-landfill philosophy, actively working to 
ensure that all waste generated is either reused, recycled, or composted - eliminating the need for landfill disposal entirely.
Responsible E-Waste Disposal: Swiggy has partnered with Envirokare Recycling Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for e-waste collection 
and processing. All e-waste is managed in strict accordance with applicable central, state, and pollution control board 
regulations, including the E-Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 2022 issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & 
Climate Change.
Highlights:
	
100% of Swiggy HO’s waste was either recycled, reused, or composted
	
No hazardous, biomedical, construction, or demolition waste was generated

Initiative
Details
Outcome
Low Carbon Fleet Swiggy has set an ambitious goal to transition to a 100% 
electric delivery fleet by 2030, making zero-emission 
delivery a core part of its operational infrastructure. With 
a network of over 5.2 lakh delivery partners, the company 
is actively shaping the future of sustainable urban logistics 
in India. Its ecosystem-driven strategy focusses on access, 
affordability, and adoption – partnering with 50+ OEMs, 
fleet operators, financiers, and charging infrastructure 
players to make EVs accessible across all Tier-1 and most 
Tier-2 cities. Delivery partners now have access to 70+ 
EV models, flexible rental plans, and battery-swapping 
solutions. Swiggy is also investing in digital infrastructure, 
integrating real-time battery swap locators, rental booking 
APIs, and EV education directly within its app. To drive 
behavioural change, Swiggy runs app-led campaigns, 
vendor incentives, and on-ground activations, making EV 
adoption easier for its delivery partners. Swiggy is also 
piloting models where bulk (XL) orders are fulfilled entirely by 
electric fleets. In July 2024, Swiggy launched Eco Saver – a 
feature within our platform that promotes order batching 
and route optimisation to reduce redundant trips, lower 
last-mile emissions, and improve delivery efficiency.
EV delivery partners have grown 7x in the last year. 
These efforts led to a reduction of 710.69 tCO2e in 
FY 2023-24 and 4,483 tCO2e in FY 2024-25. Eco 
Saver has facilitated approximately 30 million 
deliveries resulting in a reduction of over 500 tonnes 
of CO2 emissions.
Cutlery Opt-out
Swiggy introduced the cutlery opt-out model to minimise 
waste in food deliveries. By default, customers do not 
receive disposable cutlery with their orders unless they 
explicitly request it. This nudge has helped change user 
behaviour and significantly reduce plastic consumption 
across millions of deliveries. Swiggy is committed to 
achieving a 100% transition to responsible and sustainable 
packaging alternatives across its restaurant partner network 
by 2030, reinforcing its long-term vision for waste reduction 
and environmental stewardship.
Within a week of introducing the feature, 
approximately 96% of orders had cutlery opt-out 
enabled, significantly reducing waste across our 
delivery ecosystem.
Operational and 
Environmental 
Excellence
Swiggy is committed to transitioning to 100% renewable 
electricity in its direct operations by 2030, by adopting 
sustainable and energy-efficient solutions.
Swiggy’s corporate headquarters at Embassy 
TechVillage (ETV), Bengaluru – housing over 67% of 
our permanent workforce and 70% of our operational 
infrastructure — embodies our commitment to 
building a sustainable operational backbone. 
ETV’s LEED O&M v4.1 Platinum certification by the 
U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) stands as a 
benchmark in energy efficiency, water conservation, 
and waste management. Notably, 65% of the 
electricity used at our corporate headquarters is 
sourced from renewables. Guided by this standard, 
Swiggy is committed to progressively transitioning its 
infrastructure and operations towards similarly high-
performing, environmentally responsible facilities.
Swiggy Serves
Swiggy, through its flagship initiative Swiggy Serves, has set 
an ambitious goal of donating 100 million meals by 2030. A 
significant part of this will be achieved in partnership with 
the Robin Hood Army (RHA), which is expected to contribute 
50 million meals.
Already active in 171 cities, the partnership leverages 
technology-driven food redistribution to bridge the 
gap between surplus food and those facing hunger.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web  link. 
	
Yes. Swiggy has established a comprehensive Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) framework to ensure 
uninterrupted operations and service reliability. The framework leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure 
within a single region, utilising multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to provide high availability, built-in fault tolerance, and 
rapid recovery from localised disruptions.
Swiggy’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Framework
Multi-AZ Architecture:
Critical workloads are deployed across multiple AWS Availability Zones, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. 
This architecture minimises service disruptions and ensures redundancy in the event of infrastructure failure.
Data Protection & Backup:
Swiggy enables continuous backups and point-in-time recovery for critical systems. Key services such as Amazon RDS and 
Amazon EKS are configured with cross-AZ failover mechanisms to reduce the risk of data loss and ensure business continuity.
Defined Recovery Objectives:
	
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Established to minimise acceptable downtime.
	
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Defined to limit data loss to an acceptable threshold.
Both parameters are aligned with business-critical priorities to ensure operational resilience.
Risk Assessment & Business Impact Analysis:
Swiggy conducts regular risk assessments to identify potential threats — ranging from natural disasters and technical failures 
to human errors. Business Impact Analyses are performed to prioritise recovery efforts and allocate resources effectively 
based on risk exposure.
This BCDR strategy ensures that Swiggy is well-prepared to maintain continuity of essential services, protect customer 
trust, and respond swiftly to disruptions.

Principle 7: Businesses, when engaging in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a 
manner that is responsible and transparent
At Swiggy, we see policy advocacy as an opportunity to 
help shape the future of the platform economy in a way 
that balances innovation with inclusion. The regulations that 
govern our sector influence millions of livelihoods and set the 
framework for how entrepreneurship and responsible growth 
can thrive — and we recognise the responsibility that comes 
with having a voice in that dialogue.
Our approach is collaborative and evidence-led. We 
engage with policymakers, industry associations, and 
peer platforms to share data-backed insights and ground 
realities, contributing to frameworks that balance workforce 
welfare with economic opportunity. Whether it is helping 
design social security systems for gig workers or participating 
in conversations on sustainability and digital innovation, we 
aim to enable progressive regulations that are practical, 
scalable, and future-ready.
Policy advocacy for us is about shaping outcomes, not 
just participating in conversations. Regulations around 
the platform economy are evolving fast, and our role is to 
bring data, real-world perspectives, and workable solutions 
to the table — openly and constructively. By focussing on 
what works in practice, we aim to influence policies that 
protect livelihoods, encourage entrepreneurship, and allow 
the platform economy to grow responsibly and inclusively.
Good policy is built when 
business realities and societal 
priorities meet. Our role is to 
bring ground-level insights, 
backed by data, to help design 
regulations that actually work in 
practice — protecting livelihoods, 
encouraging entrepreneurship, 
and allowing the platform 
economy to grow responsibly. 
When advocacy is transparent 
and solutions-focussed, it 
creates an ecosystem where 
innovation and inclusion can 
move forward together.

Principle 8: Businesses should promote inclusive growth and equitable development
At Swiggy, inclusive growth is not just about expanding 
our business footprint — it is about ensuring that the 
opportunities we create benefit everyone connected to 
our ecosystem. As a platform that supports entrepreneurs, 
partners, and small businesses across the country, we see our 
growth as meaningful only when it translates into economic 
participation, local employment, and community resilience.
Over the years, we have focussed on strengthening local 
value chains and creating pathways for smaller players 
to grow. By sourcing locally, and building long-term 
relationships with MSMEs, cooperatives, regional suppliers, 
and producer networks, we are helping strengthen domestic 
supply chains and expand economic participation beyond 
large urban centres. Our partnerships are designed to be 
enablers — providing access, visibility, and opportunities 
that many small businesses would otherwise struggle to find.
Driving inclusion also means supporting those who have 
historically been underrepresented. Through initiatives that 
encourage women-led, youth-led, and community-based 
businesses, we aim to build capacity, confidence, and 
economic independence for those who are often left out of 
formal growth opportunities.
True impact, for us, is measured by how our growth enables 
shared progress. By creating transparent systems, responding 
to local community needs, and designing programmes 
that support long-term economic participation, we want 
to ensure that the success of our platform translates into 
stronger livelihoods, resilient communities, and a more 
equitable distribution of value across the ecosystem.
The real power of a platform lies 
in how many doors it can open 
for others. Growth becomes 
meaningful when a small 
business can hire more people, 
when a regional supplier can 
reach new markets, or when a 
first-generation entrepreneur 
gains the confidence to scale. 
Those ripple effects matter 
because they outlast individual 
transactions — they create 
stronger local economies and 
communities that grow with 
you. That’s the kind of impact 
we want Swiggy to stand for.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
Swiggy has institutionalised a structured, transparent, and accessible grievance redressal framework to address 
concerns raised by community stakeholders, including customers, restaurant partners, delivery executives, employees, 
and local communities impacted by its operations.
	
The grievance mechanism is governed by Swiggy’s Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal Policy, which 
outlines a tiered resolution process, timelines for redressal, and clear channels for escalation. Community members 
can lodge grievances through multiple formal channels — such as customer service portals, written communication, 
or helpline numbers. For issues involving ethical conduct, safety, or misconduct, Swiggy’s Whistleblower Policy allows 
for confidential or anonymous reporting through a secure platform, with protection against retaliation and oversight 
from an independent committee. The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) further addresses grievances related to 
POSH, while other specialised redressal teams handle operational complaints or partner-related issues.
	
Delivery partners, a key stakeholder group, can raise grievances through an integrated support system within the 
Swiggy app, which offers real-time chat, call-back options, and tracking of grievance status. All complaints are 
monitored for closure within defined service-level timelines and reviewed periodically for trends, escalation, or policy-
level interventions. Swiggy also proactively engages with local communities through its social-impact programmes and 
partnerships, gathering feedback during programme design and implementation. Swiggy ensures that community well-
being remains a priority through responsive grievance redressal and ethical engagement practices. While dedicated, 
stakeholder-specific channels are in place, Swiggy’s Stakeholder Management and Grievance Redressal Policy also 
provides an overarching grievance mechanism accessible to all stakeholders through the designated email address: 
grievances@swiggy.in. These mechanisms ensure fairness, transparency, and continuous improvement, reinforcing 
Swiggy’s commitment to inclusive growth and responsible corporate citizenship.

Principle 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
At Swiggy, every consumer interaction is an opportunity 
to build trust and influence behaviours that are better for 
individuals, communities, and the ecosystem. We believe 
that convenience and responsibility are not opposing 
fores – done right, they strengthen each other by making 
sustainable choices a natural part of the experience.
Our focus has been to integrate responsibility into the 
very design of the consumer journey. Features that 
nudge sustainable behaviour, strengthen food integrity, 
and promote better-for-you and better-for-the-planet 
alternatives are built to make better choices simple and 
intuitive. Transparency in communication, secure digital 
infrastructure, and reliable grievance redressal systems 
ensure that consumer confidence is upheld at every step.
But the real impact goes beyond individual orders. By 
shaping how people choose, what they expect, and the 
standards they hold the ecosystem to, we aim to make 
responsible consumption a defining feature of convenience. 
Every interaction on our platform is a chance to raise the bar 
– not just for Swiggy, but for the industry at large.
The best technology disappears 
into the experience - it makes 
the right things feel effortless. 
What excites us is solving for 
scale in a way that builds better 
habits by design: how choices 
are presented, how information 
is surfaced, how systems nudge 
behaviour without feeling 
intrusive. If we can make 
responsibility feel intuitive, 
millions of individual decisions 
shift automatically - and that’s 
when real change compounds.

To promote informed and sustainable consumption, Swiggy has implemented the following initiatives:
	
Eco Saver: In July 2024, Swiggy launched Eco Saver - a feature within our platform that promotes order batching and 
route optimisation to reduce redundant trips, lower last-mile emissions, and improve delivery efficiency. Eco Saver 
has facilitated approximately 30 million deliveries resulting in a reduction of over 500 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
	
Cutlery Opt-Out: Swiggy introduced the cutlery opt-out model to minimise waste in food deliveries. By default, 
customers do not receive disposable cutlery with their orders unless they explicitly request it. This nudge has helped 
change user behaviour and significantly reduced plastic consumption across millions of deliveries. Within a week of 
introducing the feature, approximately 96% of orders had cutlery opt-out enabled, significantly reducing waste across 
our delivery ecosystem.
	
Swiggy Seal: Aimed at strengthening food integrity and hygiene, Swiggy has launched the Swiggy Seal – Food Integrity 
Certification to systematically raise quality and hygiene standards across its restaurant ecosystem. Developed with 
FSSAI-recognised audit agencies and informed by over 7 million verified customer reviews, the certification goes 
beyond compliance — embedding a culture of continuous improvement. The Seal is dynamic, merit-based, and can 
be revoked in case of lapses, reinforcing credibility and accountability.
	
Guilt-Free Offerings: Through its Guilt-Free category, Swiggy promotes healthier consumption by curating meals that 
are lower in calories, sugar, and fat, or prepared using natural and organic ingredients — supporting customers in 
making informed, mindful dietary choices.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
Swiggy, as a digital platform facilitating hyperlocal deliveries, operates a technology-enabled model that is integral 
to urban convenience but is not currently classified as an ‘essential service’ under the Essential Services Maintenance 
Act, 1981. However, during exceptional circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, food and grocery delivery 
services have been acknowledged by several state and local authorities as essential to maintaining supply continuity.
	
To mitigate disruption-related risks and ensure transparency, Swiggy has institutionalised the following mechanisms 
to proactively inform consumers in the event of any interruption to services:
	
In-app Notifications & Dynamic Filters: Real-time serviceability updates are integrated within the platform to notify 
users of delays, service restrictions, or temporary unavailability based on location-specific conditions (e.g., extreme 
weather, civic unrest, government-imposed restrictions).
	
Automated Communication Channels: Customers receive alerts via push notifications, SMS, and email for any order-
level disruption or systemic downtime.
	
Customer Support Escalation Pathways: A dedicated customer experience team is available 24*7 to respond to service 
queries and proactively communicate on escalated issues.
	
Public Information Dissemination: In the event of significant disruptions, Swiggy leverages broader outreach tools 
including its corporate website, social media channels, and regional operations teams to communicate service updates 
to consumers and partners.
	
These measures ensure timely, accurate, and accessible communication to safeguard customer experience and trust 
during periods of disruption.
4.	
Does the entity display product information on the product over & above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief? Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to 
consumer satisfaction relating to the major products/services of the entity, significant locations of operation of 
the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
Not applicable. Swiggy functions as a technology-enabled service platform that facilitates food delivery, restaurant 
discovery, and other hyperlocal services. However, to ensure transparency and support informed consumer choices, 
Swiggy enables its restaurant and seller partners to voluntarily disclose relevant product information — including 
ingredients, allergens, and nutritional details — on the platform, wherever applicable.
	
Swiggy also incorporates a continuous customer feedback loop through its digital interface. One such mechanism is the 
in-app chat support rating feature, which captures user satisfaction ratings after each customer service interaction. 
These insights are used internally to drive service improvements and enhance the overall consumer experience.

Assurance report on sustainability disclosures in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting 
(BRSR) Core Format.
Assurance report on the sustainability disclosures in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) Core 
Format1 (called ‘Identified Sustainability Information’ (ISI) of Swiggy Limited (the ‘Company’) for the period from 1 April 2024 
to 31 March 2025. The ISI is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting of the Company for the 
period from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.
Opinion
We have performed an assurance engagement on the Identified Sustainability Information (ISI) as detailed in the table below:
Identified Sustainability 
Information (ISI) subject 
to assurance

Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards)
This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and environmental 
and social professionals.
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe 
that the company’s Identified Sustainability Information of the Annual Report relating to BRSR core attributes for the year 
ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and basis of preparation 
set out in Section A: Question 13 of the BRSR.
Basis for conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants (IESBA).
KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (the Firm) applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 
1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related 
Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system 
of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Other information
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core attributes and assurance report 
thereon).
Our limited assurance opinion on the BRSR Core attributes does not cover the other information, and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our assurance report of the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core attributes or our knowledge 
obtained in the assurance or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Other matter
The BRSR for the period from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 was not subject to limited/reasonable assurance and we do 
not express an opinion/conclusion or provide any assurance on such information.
Our opinion/conclusion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR attributes, the 
reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the 
ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Management’s responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the company are responsible for:
	
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
	
selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately 
referring to or describing the criteria; and
	
preparing/fairly stating/properly calculating the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
reporting criteria.
	
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
	
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, goals 
and performance measures;
	
responsible for providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
	
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
	
making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances;
	
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information covered by 
assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria;
	
preventing and detecting fraud;
	
selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their 
information needs;
	
informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
	
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI.

Swiggy Limited
Inherent limitations
The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, 
make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, and energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
	
planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
	
forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained; and
	
reporting our conclusion to the Board of Directors of the Company.
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed 
and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited 
assurance conclusion.
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the ISI covered by limited assurance and other engagement 
circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise.
In carrying out our engagement, we:
	
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the information covered by limited assurance;
	
interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for 
occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
	
through enquiries, obtained an understanding of Swiggy Limited’s control environment, processes and information 
systems relevant to the preparation of the information covered by limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design 
of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
	
made enquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the Information 
covered by limited assurance;
	
undertook one physical site visit to Head office, Bengaluru. We selected this site based on the relative size of the 
workforce of this location to the total workforce and area of the office;
	
inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
	
applied analytical procedures, as appropriate;
	
recalculated the information covered by limited assurance based on the criteria; and
	
evaluated the overall presentation of the information covered by limited assurance to determine whether it is consistent 
with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the company’s occupational health 
and safety.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, 
a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement 
been performed.
