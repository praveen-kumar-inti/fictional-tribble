(Indicate positive or

1.
GHG emissions 
and energy 
management
Risk
As a wagon manufacturing 
company, JWL operates 
e n e r g y - i n t e n s i v e 
processes such as metal 
cutting, welding, casting, 
and 
surface 
treatment, 
which 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
GHG 
emissions. The reliance 
on grid electricity and 
fossil fuels exposes the 
Company 
to 
transition 
risks from evolving climate 
regulations. Additionally, 
physical climate risks—
such as extreme rainfall or 
heatwaves—pose threats 
to operational continuity 
and supply chain stability. 
Increasing 
stakeholder 
scrutiny 
and 
customer 
preference 
for 
low-
carbon products further 
heighten the urgency to 
decarbonize 
operations, 
making 
energy 
and 
emissions management a 
material business risk.
JWL continues to strengthen 
its 
strategy 
to 
mitigate 
climate-related 
risks 
and 
improve energy efficiency. In 
FY 2024–25, the Company 
has undertaken the following 
initiatives:
1. Initiated sourcing of energy 
from renewable sources in 
three of its manufacturing 
plants.
2. Commenced transition from 
LSHS 
to 
cleaner 
energy 
alternatives, 
targeting 
emission reduction at the 
source.
3. Continued 
installation 
of 
energy-efficient LED lighting 
systems across operational 
areas to lower electricity 
consumption.
4. Implemented power factor 
correction 
measures 
to 
improve energy efficiency 
and 
reduce 
transmission 
losses.
Negative:
This 
includes 
compliance 
costs, 
reputational 
damage, 
increased 
operating 
expenses, 
supply 
chain disruptions, and 
impacting 
profitability 
and shareholder value.
2.
Waste 
management 
& circular 
economy
Risk
Wagon 
manufacturing 
generates 
substantial 
volumes of metal scrap, 
used 
sand, 
chemicals, 
and 
other 
waste. 
Inefficient waste handling 
or 
non-compliance 
with 
hazardous 
and 
non-hazardous 
waste 
regulations can lead to 
environmental liabilities, 
fines, 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
As 
circular 
economy principles gain 
traction, 
the 
pressure 
to 
recover 
materials, 
minimize landfill disposal, 
and 
improve 
resource 
efficiency 
is 
rising. 
Inadequate 
systems 
for 
waste 
segregation, 
reuse, 
and 
recycling 
may 
result 
in 
higher 
operational 
costs 
and 
missed opportunities for 
material recovery, making 
waste 
management 
a 
critical operational and 
compliance risk
The Company has adapted 
following 
measures 
for 
effective waste management 
practices:
1. Reusing mild steel (MS) 
scrap and used sand within 
the 
production 
process 
to 
reduce 
raw 
material 
dependency.
2. Disposal of hazardous waste 
through authorized recyclers, 
ensuring compliance with 
environmental regulations.
3. Dedicated 
scrap 
yards 
established 
for 
proper 
storage and segregation of 
waste, with clear labelling 
and SOPs to ensure safe 
handling and traceability.
Negative:
Failure 
in 
meeting 
the 
compliance 
requirements 
may 
impose 
fines 
and 
penalties.
Improper handling of 
hazardous waste may 
increase the chances of 
health hazards and fire 
incidents.

3.
Employee 
wellbeing
Opportunity
Investing 
in 
employee 
wellbeing 
enhances 
workforce 
morale, 
productivity, and retention. 
In 
a 
labour-intensive 
industry 
like 
wagon 
manufacturing, proactive 
health, safety, and mental 
wellness programs reduce 
absenteeism, 
improve 
operational efficiency, and 
build a resilient workforce. 
A strong wellbeing culture 
also 
strengthens 
the 
Company’s reputation as 
an employer of choice, 
aiding talent acquisition 
and long-term business 
sustainability.
Not applicable
Positive:
Improved 
employee 
wellbeing 
leads 
to 
higher 
productivity, 
lower 
absenteeism, 
and reduced healthcare 
costs, 
resulting 
in 
operational savings and 
enhanced 
profitability 
over time.
4.
Human rights
Risk
Operating 
in 
a 
labour-intensive 
and 
subcontractor-driven 
environment, 
JWL 
is 
exposed to human rights 
risks 
related 
to 
fair 
wages, 
working 
hours, 
occupational 
safety, 
and 
ethical 
treatment 
of workers. Any lapses 
or non-compliance with 
labour laws and human 
rights standards across 
operations 
or 
third-
party engagements can 
result 
in 
legal 
action, 
reputational damage, and 
loss of stakeholder trust. 
Growing 
expectations 
from regulators, investors, 
and 
customers 
further 
elevate the materiality of 
this issue.
1. The company prohibits child 
and force labour at plant and 
corporate level.
2. The Company has established 
Internal 
Complaints 
Committee to address sexual 
harassment 
and 
human 
rights related grievances.
3. The Company ensures that 
all employees are treated 
fairly and with dignity, and 
that there is zero tolerance 
for discrimination.
Negative:
N o n - c o m p l i a n c e 
with 
human 
rights 
or 
statutory 
labour 
norms may result in 
regulatory 
penalties, 
legal liabilities, and loss 
of business contracts, 
while 
also 
eroding 
customer 
trust 
and 
brand 
value, 
leading 
to long-term revenue 
impact.
5.
Community 
welfare
Opportunity
Proactive investment in 
community 
welfare—
through 
education, 
healthcare, 
Sports 
promotion 
and 
allied 
activities etc, JWL build 
strong local relationships, 
social license to operate, 
and long-term goodwill. 
Such 
engagement 
enhances the Company’s 
reputation, 
reduces 
operational 
disruptions 
from social unrest, and 
creates 
shared 
value, 
supporting inclusive and 
sustainable growth.
Not applicable
Positive:
Strategic 
investments 
in community welfare 
strengthen stakeholder 
trust 
and 
create 
a 
supportive 
local 
ecosystem, 
enabling 
resilient 
operations 
and 
inclusive, 
long-
term 
growth 
for 
both 
the 
Company 
and 
surrounding 
communities.

6.
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Given 
the 
nature 
of 
manufacturing 
activities 
involving heavy machinery, 
welding, and fabrication, 
JWL faces inherent risks 
related 
to 
workplace 
accidents, 
injuries, 
and 
occupational 
illnesses. 
Any 
lapse 
in 
health 
and 
safety 
standards 
can lead to workforce 
downtime, legal penalties, 
reputational 
damage, 
and increased insurance 
and compensation costs. 
Ensuring a safe working 
environment is critical to 
maintaining 
operational 
efficiency, compliance, and 
employee morale.
JWL 
remains 
committed 
to 
providing 
a 
safe 
and 
healthy 
work 
environment 
by 
proactively 
identifying 
and mitigating occupational 
hazards. During FY 2024–25, 
the following measures were 
undertaken to strengthen OHS 
management:
1. Conducted routine safety 
risk 
assessments 
across 
all 
operational 
sites 
to 
identify potential hazards 
and implement preventive 
controls.
2. Organized 
regular 
safety 
training 
programs 
for 
employees 
and 
workers 
to 
build 
awareness 
and 
strengthen safety practices.
3. Enhanced 
hazard 
identification 
mechanisms 
through 
structured 
inspections and employee 
participation.
4. Strengthened the incident 
reporting process to ensure 
timely 
investigation, 
root cause analysis, and 
corrective actions.
5. Improved 
emergency 
preparedness 
through 
periodic mock drills, review 
of 
emergency 
response 
plans, and capacity building 
of response teams.
Negative:
Higher healthcare and 
compensation costs due 
to workplace injuries or 
illnesses.
Productivity 
losses 
and 
operational 
disruptions 
from 
employee absenteeism 
or downtime, leading 
to increased costs and 
reduced revenue.
7.
Corporate 
governance & 
business ethics
Opportunities
Strong 
corporate 
governance and ethical 
business 
practices 
enhance 
stakeholder 
confidence, 
attract 
responsible investors, and 
improve risk management. 
For JWL, this translates 
into improved compliance, 
reduced 
regulatory 
exposure, and a robust 
foundation for sustainable 
growth 
and 
long-term 
value creation.
Not applicable
Positive:
Corporate 
Governance 
& 
Business 
Ethics 
Robust governance and 
ethical practices drive

confidence, 
improve

enhanced 
financial 
stability and long-term

Risk 
management
Risk
Inadequate 
risk 
management frameworks 
expose the Company to 
unforeseen 
financial, 
operational, 
and 
reputational risks. This 
includes 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, 
financial 
market 
volatility, 
and 
emerging 
regulatory 
compliance 
challenges. 
Without 
a 
proactive, 
integrated 
approach 
to 
identifying and mitigating 
these risks, the Company 
could 
face 
severe 
disruptions, 
unexpected 
costs, and potential loss of 
stakeholder confidence.
1. Climate Risk Assessment: In 
the process of conducting a 
comprehensive climate risk 
assessment to understand 
and 
mitigate 
potential 
risks arising from climate 
change, ensuring business 
continuity.
2. Integrated Risk Framework: 
Developed a robust risk 
management 
framework 
that 
identifies, 
evaluates, 
and mitigates operational, 
financial, 
and 
regulatory 
risks across the supply chain 
and business operations.
3. Regular 
Monitoring 
& 
Reporting: 
Ongoing 
monitoring 
of 
key 
risk 
indicators, 
with 
regular 
reporting 
to 
senior 
management 
and 
stakeholders 
to 
ensure 
proactive risk mitigation and 
timely responses.
4. Crisis 
Management 
Plans: 
Established 
crisis 
management and business 
continuity plans to address 
potential 
disruptions, 
including natural disasters, 
supply chain failures, and 
cybersecurity threats.
Negative:
1. Unforeseen 
Costs: 
Failure to proactively 
address risks could 
lead 
to 
significant 
financial 
losses 
from 
operational 
disruptions, litigation, 
or 
regulatory 
penalties.
2. Increased Operational 
Expenses: 
Without 
a 
robust 
risk 
framework, 
the 
Company may face 
higher costs related 
to crisis management,

3. Reputation Damage: 
Poor risk management 
could

confidence, 
leading 
to loss of market 
share, 
reduced 
investor interest, and 
diminished 
brand 
value.
9.
IT & Cyber 
Security
Risk
As 
the 
Company 
increases its reliance on 
digital technologies and 
interconnected 
systems, 
the risk of cyberattacks, 
data breaches, and system 
failures intensifies. These 
incidents 
can 
lead 
to 
significant 
operational 
disruptions, 
loss 
of 
sensitive 
customer 
and 
business 
data, 
reputational 
damage, 
and legal consequences. 
Ensuring 
robust 
cybersecurity measures is 
essential to protect both 
business operations and 
stakeholder trust.
1. Cybersecurity 
Policy: 
JWL has implemented a 
comprehensive 
IT 
and 
cybersecurity 
policy 
outlining 
the 
Company's 
commitment 
to 
reducing 
data breaches and mitigating

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements.
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
The global rail transportation sector is undergoing a profound transformation, shaped by the imperatives of climate action, 
digitalization, and infrastructure modernization. As nations reimagine the future of mobility, the demand for safe, efficient, 
and sustainable logistics solutions is driving accelerated investment across the industry.
	
India, in particular, is making bold strides to position railways at the heart of its infrastructure-led growth model. The 
Government of India has committed approximately USD 750 billion in capital expenditure between 2018 and 2030, aimed 
at strengthening railway infrastructure and increasing the modal share of rail in freight transport from ~26% in FY 2022 
to 45% by FY 2030, as outlined in the National Rail Plan. This unprecedented focus on rail modernization opens vast 
opportunities for Jupiter Wagons Limited (JWL) to lead with engineering excellence and purpose-driven innovation.
	
At JWL, sustainability is not an adjunct to our business—it is central to our long-term strategy. We recognize that our 
role as an industry leader carries with it a responsibility to act decisively on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
imperatives.
	
On the environmental front, we have initiated renewable energy sourcing at three of our key manufacturing plants, marking 
a significant step towards low-carbon operations. In alignment with circular economy principles, we have also enabled the 
reuse of mild steel waste at our Bandel facility. We continue to adopt energy-efficient systems and invest in low-emission 
technologies, underscoring our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and advancing operational sustainability.

across all levels of the organization. In the communities where we operate, we have expanded our engagement through

Governance forms the foundation of our values and corporate ethos. We are committed to the highest standards of ethics, 
compliance, and transparency. Our governance structures ensure robust oversight, stakeholder trust, and alignment with our 
strategic vision.
	
As we look ahead, we remain focused on building a future-ready organization that not only meets the demands of a changing

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Jupiter Wagons Limited categorizes its procurement into three regulatory segments: items sourced from RDSO (Research 
Designs and Standards Organization) approved vendor lists, items approved by RITES under Indian Standards such 
as G-93, and local purchases including those from MSMEs. To ensure regulatory compliance, the Company adheres to 
procurement procedures established by RDSO and aligns with G-105 certification norms mandated by Indian Railways. 
These frameworks promote continuous improvement in the design, specification, and standardization of products and 
processes—embedding sustainability principles into Jupiter Wagons Limited’s sourcing practices.

If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Jupiter Wagons Limited has initiated internal ESG assessments for its top suppliers and developed a structured 
framework to evaluate them on key environmental, social, and governance parameters, including occupational health 
and safety, renewable energy usage, GHG emissions, and waste management practices. This marks the initial phase of 
the Company’s sustainable sourcing strategy. Going forward, Jupiter Wagons Limited plans to develop a comprehensive 
Supplier Code of Conduct, identify critical suppliers, and implement a systematic assessment mechanism to evaluate 
their performance against defined ESG criteria.
As the assessment process is currently in its initial phase, the percentage of value chain partners evaluated under this 
framework cannot be determined at this stage.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
No). If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes. The Company has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System to uphold the 
highest standards of workplace safety and employee well-being. Three out of the Company’s six plants are certified 
under ISO 45001, demonstrating alignment with globally recognized occupational health and safety standards. The 
system encompasses all employees and workers across operations and includes protocols for hazard identification, 
risk assessment, emergency preparedness, incident reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The Company follows a structured approach to identifying and assessing work-related hazards on both routine and non-
routine bases. Routine safety assessments are carried out by a designated Safety Officer, who conducts inspections to 
proactively detect potential hazards. The Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) policy and SOP provide comprehensive 
guidelines for hazard identification, risk evaluation, emergency response, and adherence to safety standards.
Additionally, monthly Safety Committee meetings are conducted to review incidents and accidents, share key 
learnings, and promote a culture of continuous improvement. As part of this process, root cause analysis and incident 
investigations are undertaken to identify underlying causes and implement corrective actions. These insights are used 
to refine existing safety protocols and strengthen the overall risk management framework. These risk assessment 
practices are fully integrated into the Company’s operational and change management processes.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the Company has established clear and accessible processes for employees and workers to report work-related 
hazards. Hazards can be reported during monthly safety committee meetings, safety training sessions, or directly to 
the Safety Officer during site visits. The Safety Officer also actively identifies and documents near-miss incidents and 
encourages department-wise reporting of such instances to foster a culture of safety awareness. These practices ensure 
early identification and mitigation of potential risks. Employees and workers are empowered to remove themselves 
from unsafe conditions and escalate concerns as necessary to ensure their well-being.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ 
No)
Yes, the Company provides access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services for its employees and workers. 
This includes Mediclaim coverage and ESIC benefits, ensuring financial support for a range of medical needs beyond 
occupational injuries. First-aid facilities have been established at the plant level to offer immediate medical attention in 
case of illness or injury. For critical health issues, employees are promptly referred to the nearest hospital for further 
treatment. Additionally, the Company promotes overall health and wellness through regular health check-ups and 
awareness sessions, contributing to a holistic healthcare environment for its workforce.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
Jupiter Wagons Limited (JWL) has instituted a structured and transparent process for engaging with stakeholders on

sustainability agenda and long-term value creation.
Regular stakeholder consultations are conducted through a variety of mechanisms—including meetings, surveys, grievance 
redressal platforms, and community interactions—to capture feedback, identify concerns, and understand expectations. 
These engagements focus on key sustainability issues such as community development, environmental management, 
employee well-being, and responsible supply chain practices.
Feedback gathered from these engagements is consolidated and communicated to the Board through a formal internal 
reporting structure. This includes periodic sustainability updates, committee reports, or risk and compliance briefings.
The Board actively reviews the feedback and integrates relevant insights into its strategic and operational decision-making 
processes. This approach ensures that stakeholder interests are adequately represented at the highest level of governance, 
reinforcing JWL’s commitment to inclusive, transparent, and accountable corporate conduct.

Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Jupiter Wagons Limited (JWL) adopts a structured and responsible approach to waste management, guided by its Environment 
Policy, which emphasizes the principles of circular economy through reduction, reuse, and recycling of waste materials. The 
Company has implemented detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to manage both hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste in compliance with applicable environmental regulations.
	
Waste is meticulously segregated at the source, and dedicated scrap yards have been established at each plant to store 
different categories of waste in a safe and labelled manner. Hazardous waste is managed through authorized vendors, while 
non-hazardous waste is disposed of via local recycling channels, minimizing the environmental footprint of operations.
	
In line with its commitment to resource efficiency, JWL continues to recycle approximately 70% of the sand used in its casting 
processes and repurposes metal scrap by melting it for use in manufacturing rail components. These practices help reduce 
dependency on virgin materials while promoting sustainable production.
