1
Economic 
Performance
Opportunity & Risk 
The core purpose of a business 
organization 
is 
to 
generate 
long-term economic value for 
all 
stakeholders. 
Sustained 
profitability 
and 
growth 
are 
essential not only for shareholder 
returns but also for positively 
impacting employees, customers, 
partners, 
and 
the 
broader 
community. 
Achieving 
this 
requires 
a 
commitment 
to 
sustainable and resilient financial 
performance, 
underpinned 
by 
the integration of environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) 
principles into business strategy 
and operations.
The company maintains a strong 
focus on cost leadership, unit 
cost 
optimization, 
revenue 
enhancement, 
and 
healthy 
liquidity 
management. 
These 
financial priorities are critical 
in navigating challenges such 
as 
margin 
pressures 
arising 
from 
inflation, 
environmental 
regulations, and supply chain 
disruptions. 
The 
company 
is 
committed to aligning financial 
discipline 
with 
robust 
ESG 
practices, 
ensuring 
long-term 
resilience and value creation.
Positive : Increased investor 
confidence, 
access 
to 
sustainable finance, operational 
efficiency, 
and 
improved 
market valuation.
2
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Opportunity
By 
embedding 
strong 
ESG 
principles 
across 
the 
value 
chain, 
organizations 
unlock 
opportunities to empower local 
businesses, significantly reduce 
their environmental footprint, and 
inspire responsible governance 
among partners. This proactive 
approach creates a future-ready 
supply chain that is not only 
resilient and transparent but also 
a powerful driver of long-term, 
sustainable growth.
Embed 
ESG 
principles 
into 
procurement processes, empower 
suppliers 
through 
capability-
building, 
and 
drive 
greater 
traceability for a more responsible 
and transparent supply chain.
Positive: 
Cost 
efficiencies, 
improved supplier performance, 
enhanced 
trust 
and 
brand 
reputation.
3
Product Safety 
and Quality
Opportunity
Effective resource management 
is 
fundamental 
to 
delivering 
safe, high-quality products that 
meet customer expectations and 
enhance our brand reputation. 
Leveraging our diverse product 
portfolio and innovative solutions 
positions us to address evolving 
market demands and stakeholder 
requirements 
confidently. 
A 
strong commitment to product 
safety 
safeguards 
consumer 
health, fosters enduring trust, 
and drives sustainable business 
growth. Through rigorous quality 
control and transparent practices, 
we create meaningful value for 
customers, 
reinforce 
investor 
confidence, and support long-
term organizational success.
We 
have 
implemented 
comprehensive quality control 
measures 
throughout 
the 
manufacturing, 
assembly, 
and 
maintenance 
processes 
to 
ensure all products consistently 
meet 
stringent 
safety 
and 
quality standards. Each product 
is subject to rigorous testing 
and 
certification 
by 
relevant 
authorities, confirming its safety 
and performance.
This 
dedication 
to 
quality 
enables us to foster customer 
loyalty, differentiate our brand in 
competitive markets, and pursue 
growth opportunities in premium 
segments with high safety and 
quality expectations. Moreover, 
ongoing process enhancements 
contribute to waste reduction and 
operational efficiency.
Positive: Investing in quality 
control 
infrastructure 
and 
training 
delivers 
strong 
financial returns by reducing 
costs 
associated 
with 
product failures and recalls. 
These 
improvements 
lower 
our risk profile, resulting in 
potential 
insurance 
savings. 
Additionally, a strengthened 
brand reputation and increased 
customer 
satisfaction 
drive 
higher revenues and improved 
profit margins. This creates 
opportunities 
for 
premium 
pricing, 
enhances 
market 
positioning, 
and 
reduces 
legal and compliance costs, 
contributing 
to 
sustained 
financial growth.

reputation, 
contributing 
to 
long-term 
competitive 
advantage. It also improves 
access 
to 
green 
financing 
and public R&D grants or 
subsidies. Additionally, process 
innovations lead to operational 
efficiencies and significant cost 
savings, 
further 
supporting 
financial performance.

Regulatory 
Compliance
Opportunity and 
Risk
Maintaining 
alignment 
with 
applicable 
laws, 
regulations, 
and industry standards across 
environmental, 
social, 
and 
governance 
(ESG) 
areas 
is 
fundamental. This commitment 
helps protect the organization 
from legal penalties and supports 
a strong, positive reputation. 
Upholding these standards also 
strengthens 
relationships 
with 
regulators, business partners, and 
other key stakeholders.
The company has implemented 
a robust management system 
to ensure compliance with all 
applicable 
laws, 
regulations, 
standards, and ethical practices. 
This proactive approach enables 
the organization to effectively 
adapt to evolving regulatory 
requirements. 
By 
maintaining 
strong compliance mechanisms, 
the 
company 
mitigates 
risks 
related to financial penalties, 
legal actions, license revocations, 
and reputational damage. This 
commitment 
is 
essential 
for 
sustaining 
stakeholder 
trust, 
securing the license to operate, 
and 
strengthening 
investor 
confidence.
Positive: 
By 
implementing 
a 
robust 
management 
system 
for 
compliance, 
the 
company 
significantly 
reduces 
the 
risk 
of fines, sanctions, or litigation 
arising from regulatory breaches. 
This 
approach 
helps 
prevent 
operational disruptions or delays 
caused by non-compliance with 
environmental permits, labor laws, 
or other regulatory requirements. It 
also minimizes the risk of exclusion 
from public tenders or markets with 
stringent compliance standards, 
while addressing increased scrutiny 
from regulators, investors. Overall, 
this proactive compliance strategy 
strengthens 
the 
company’s 
resilience and supports sustainable 
business growth.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Ethics

Strong 
corporate 
governance 
and 
ethical 
practices 
are

Energy and 
Emission 
Management
Risk
Promoting efficient energy use 
and managing greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions across operations 
and the value chain are essential 
steps 
in 
addressing 
climate 
change. Embracing low-carbon 
technologies not only supports 
the 
organization’s 
efforts 
to 
mitigate environmental impact 
but also positions it to meet 
evolving regulations and potential 
carbon-related 
costs. 
This 
proactive approach strengthens 
sustainability 
and 
operational 
resilience.
The company has implemented 
energy-efficient 
practices 
in 
operations and maintenance to 
reduce energy consumption and 
emissions, alongside integrating 
renewable energy sources into 
its operations. As climate change 
remains a critical global challenge, 
businesses 
face 
growing 
expectations 
from 
regulators, 
investors, 
and 
customers 
to 
minimize their carbon footprint. 
Efficient 
energy 
management 
not 
only 
lowers 
operating 
costs—particularly 
in 
energy-
intensive 
industries—but 
also 
enhances emission performance, 
a vital metric in ESG ratings and 
sustainability reporting.
Positive : 

Reduced operating costs 
through 
energy-efficient 
practices

Enhanced ESG performance 
and improved sustainability 
disclosures

Strengthened brand reputation 
and stakeholder trust

Better preparedness for future 
regulatory requirements

Competitive positioning in 
low-carbon and sustainability-
focused markets
Negative:

Rising carbon costs (e.g., 
carbon taxes, emissions 
trading schemes)

Potential reputational impact 
if emissions are perceived as 
excessive

Regulatory penalties for 
non-compliance 
with 
emissions 
or 
energy 
efficiency standards

Risk 
of 
supply

disruptions due to energy or 
emissions-related constraints

Water Use and 
Recycling
Risk
Water is a vital and finite resource 
essential to sustainable business 
operations. 
In 
the 
face 
of 
climate change and increasingly 
unpredictable weather patterns, 
ensuring a reliable and sufficient 
water supply has become more 
challenging. The 
company 
is 
committed to the responsible 
management of water through 
efficient consumption, effective 
wastewater 
treatment, 
and 
recycling 
practices—reducing 
environmental 
impact 
while 
safeguarding long-term resource 
availability.
Water scarcity is an escalating 
concern, particularly in water-
stressed regions, and presents 
growing challenges for industries 
with high water dependency, such 
as 
manufacturing. 
Companies 
face operational and reputational 
risks due to excessive water use 
or the degradation of local water 
sources. In response, regulators 
and 
stakeholders 
increasingly 
expect transparent water usage 
reporting 
and 
effective 
risk 
mitigation strategies.
The company has adopted a 
structured and forward-looking 
approach to water management, 
consistently 
monitoring 
and 
improving conservation practices. 
Key initiatives are aimed at 
achieving 
a 
positive 
water 
balance, with a strong emphasis 
on 
replenishing 
local 
water 
tables and capturing and reusing 
rainwater. These actions support 
operational

Waste 
Management
Opportunity & Risk 
The company prioritizes effective 
management, reduction, recycling, 
and responsible disposal of waste 
generated throughout operations 
and supply chains to minimize 
environmental impact and ensure 
compliance 
with 
regulatory 
requirements. 
By 
proactively 
aligning with emerging waste 
management 
standards, 
the 
company demonstrates its strong 
commitment to sustainability while 
mitigating potential financial risks 
such as fines and penalties. Robust 
waste management practices also 
enhance operational efficiency and 
support 
uninterrupted 
product 
manufacturing.
In alignment with regulatory 
requirements and industry best 
practices, the company ensures 
responsible waste management 
across its operations. Waste is 
effectively 
segregated, 
with 
certain streams repurposed as raw 
material for the Foundry division, 
supporting resource efficiency 
and circularity. Hazardous waste 
is safely handled and disposed 
of through authorized vendors, 
ensuring full compliance and 
environmental protection.
These initiatives lead to cost 
savings through reduced raw 
material use and optimized waste 
handling. 
The 
company 
also 
benefits from potential revenue 
streams via recycling, resale of by-
products, and upcycling efforts. 
Circular 
economy 
practices 
strengthen brand value, enhance 
customer trust, and contribute 
to improved ESG performance—
further 
attracting 
responsible 
investors and reinforcing the 
company’s 
commitment 
to 
sustainable growth.
Positive 
: 
Continued 
enhancement 
of 
waste 
management 
systems 
and 
recycling 
infrastructure 
can 
lead to meaningful long-term 
benefits. These efforts may 
help lower raw material and 
disposal costs, support revenue 
generation through the reuse 
of secondary materials, and 
foster 
industrial 
symbiosis. 
Additionally, 
maintaining 
compliance with environmental 
regulations can reduce the

and 
remediation 
efforts 
contributing 
to 
operational 
efficiency and overall business 
resilience.

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) is a core component of 
responsible business conduct and 
is essential for ensuring employee 
well-being 
and 
maintaining 
operational 
continuity. 
A 
strong safety culture not only 
supports compliance with labor 
laws 
and 
industry 
standards 
but also enhances workforce 
productivity, 
morale, 
and 
retention. Prioritizing health and 
safety helps prevent workplace 
incidents, reduces the risk of 
legal or regulatory consequences, 
and minimizes disruptions to 
business operations—ultimately 
contributing 
to 
sustained 
performance, 
safety 
of 
the 
workforce 
and 
stakeholder 
confidence.
The 
Company 
is 
committed 
to 
maintaining 
a 
robust 
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) 
framework 
through 
regular 
internal 
audits, 
strict 
enforcement of safety standards, 
and 
adherence 
to 
globally 
recognized certifications such as 
ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, 
and 
ISO 
45001:2018. 
Safety 
awareness 
and 
preparedness 
are reinforced through ongoing 
programs and the provision of 
appropriate protective equipment 
to all employees and workers.
A strong safety culture contributes 
to improved workforce productivity, 
morale, and retention. It also supports 
reduced insurance premiums and 
lowers the incidence of compensation 
claims. These practices enhance the 
company’s brand reputation, foster 
stakeholder trust, and strengthen 
its ability to attract talent in safety-
conscious industries.
Positive : A well-established 
safety culture helps reduce 
accident-related 
downtime, 
legal expenses, and insurance 
claims. 
It 
also 
supports 
regulatory 
compliance, 
minimizing the risk of fines 
or 
business 
disruptions. 
Ultimately, 
this 
contributes 
to 
enhanced 
workforce 
productivity, 
resilience, 
and 
smooth operational continuity.
