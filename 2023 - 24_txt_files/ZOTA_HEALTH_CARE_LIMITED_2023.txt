(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1.
Environmental 
Impact
R
The Company is engaged in the 
activity of manufacturing and 
marketing of pharmaceutical 
product. As far as our own 
manufacturing facility is concerned, 
we have adopted industry best 
manufacturing practices for the 
protection of environment and all 
necessary approvals have been 
taken by us. In case of third party 
manufacturing, we always insist 
to give orders to the suppliers/
manufacturer who have adopted 
all safety measures for protection of 
environment.
In our manufacturing 
facilities we are 
manufacturing only 
tablet and capsules and 
manufacturing of the 
same has not created any 
emissions or waste. Further, 
in case of third party 
manufacturers our efforts 
are to procure the products 
from the vendors which are 
following various standards 
for protecting environment.
Failure to 
protect the 
environment will 
leads to financial 
penalties by 
the regulatory 
authorities and 
hamper to the 
brand image of 
the Company.
2.
Supply Chain 
Management
R
At Zota we have outsourced our 
supply chain to the third party, 
who have fully AI based state-of-
art dispatch facility as Surat. It is 
important for the Company that 
quality and effectiveness of the 
medicines or products remains 
intact.
Being a pharmaceutical 
Company it is important 
aspect for the Company 
that efficacy of the 
medicines/products 
remains in line with the 
whatsoever formulations 
or dosage provided in the 
medicines. To maintain the 
efficacy of the medicines it 
has to be preserved under 
certain weather conditions 
in warehouse as well as 
at the time of transit. Our 
Supply Chain Partner has all 
such facilities in warehouse 
as well as for transport by 
which efficacy and quality 
of the medicines/products 
are not getting hampered.
If our medicines/
products are not 
maintained at 
the appropriate 
weather 
conditions then 
the efficacy of 
the medicines/
products will be 
reduced and 
the end user 
may not get the 
results of the 
products. 
3.
Waste 
Management
R
As the presence of the Company 
in pharmaceutical segment, 
our medicines/products are 
coming with the expiry date, after 
completion of certain period of 
the medicines/products has to 
be destroyed. On the other front, 
sometime regulatory authorities 
are putting a ban on selling of 
some medicines or fixed dosage 
combination, in this scenario the 
medicines has to be destroyed.  
Further, our manufacturing facility is 
situated as Surat Special Economic 
Zone, which is declared as a 
pollution free zone and all the waste 
that is resulted in the production is 
being cleared by the Company as 
per norms of SEZ.
We have adopted eco-
friendly procedures for 
disposal of waste that has 
been created on account of 
expired and/or banned of 
pharmaceutical products. 
All expired products have 
been disposed of by 
approved biological waste 
management agencies
If the expired/
banned 
medicines are 
not disposed 
in the standard 
manner then it 
might have crate 
water, soil and 
air pollution and 
on identification 
of such events 
will leads to get 
penalized from 
the regulatory 
authorities.
