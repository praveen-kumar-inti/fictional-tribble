Risk
	
 Extreme 
weather 
events 
such as enhanced intensity 
and frequency of Hurricanes, 
wind, floods and Rainfall 
caused by Climate Change 
may adversely impact our 
physical infrastructure.
	
 Increasing 
ambient 
temperature 
is 
likely 
to 
reduce the current carrying 
capacity of conductors.
	
 Climate Change leading to 
dryer weather and increased 
ambient 
temperature 
causes increased incidents 
of forest fires, which, in turn, 
poses 
additional 
risk 
to 
transmission lines passing 
through Forest area. 
	
 This phenomena will also 
have 
direct 
or 
indirect 
impact on the health of the 
workforce such as working in 
extreme climatic conditions 
would be detrimental to the 
health and could lead to loss 
in productivity

 Identify 
and 
map 
areas/ 
locations 
vulnerable to climate 
risks. 
	
 Safeguard 
our 
workforce 
from 
impacts 
of 
extreme 
climatic 
change 
by 
taking 
reasonable 
measures. 
Mitigation: 
	
 Strengthening 
of 
existing 
infrastructure 
in 
vulnerable 
areas, 
in line with present 
climate 
scenario 
as 
well as future climate 
predictions.

 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
It is with immense pride and a deep sense of responsibility that I present our 3rd Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report. This document underscores our unwavering commitment to integrating environmental 
stewardship and social responsibility into the very core of POWERGRID's operations. As a leader in the energy 
sector, we recognize our critical role in powering progress sustainably, ensuring our growth benefits both the 
planet and communities.
Our environmental strategy is built on meticulous planning and continuous improvement. Environmental and 
Social Assessments are paramount for all transmission projects. 
We target fulfilling 50% of our power needs from renewables by 2025 and achieving Net Zero by 2047. We aim for 
Net Water Positive status by 2030, having replenished 42.41% of our water usage through rainwater harvesting in 
FY 2024-25. We treat all domestic sewage on-site and generate no industrial effluents. Our goal is Zero Waste to 
Landfill by 2030, with over 90% of waste currently diverted through recycling and reuse. We are actively replacing 
diesel vehicles with electric/hybrid ones in phased manner. 
Key Environmental Achievements (FY 2024-25):
	
●
32.25% reduction in Scope-1 emissions
	
●
7.82% reduction in Total (Scope 1 and Scope-2) emissions
	
●
41.59% increase in emission offset
	
●
41.87% reduction in SF6 leakage
	
●
90% waste diverted from disposal/landfills
Our responsibility extends to the communities we serve through impactful CSR initiatives, based on thorough 
Need Analysis. These focus on rural livelihood, education, health, environment, and skill development, with 
rigorous Impact Evaluation. In FY 2024-25, we spent ₹360.19 crore on various CSR themes, making a meaningful 
difference.
Technological advancements are key to our sustainability. We're shifting to GIS over AIS in urban areas, initiated 
using eco-friendly Ester oil in transformers / reactors, developing digital substations contributing to our material 
conservation initiatives and innovating with tower designs (multi-circuit, pole-type, narrow-base, insulated cross 
arm) to minimize land use. We're also evaluating eco-friendly alternatives to SF6 gas.
Pioneering Value Chain Transparency: A significant and pioneering step in our sustainability journey is the 
voluntary publishing of BRSR Core data from our upstream value chain partners. We are proud to be among 
the first organizations to proactively reach out to our partners for this crucial information, demonstrating our 
commitment to comprehensive transparency and shared responsibility across our entire value chain. This 
initiative allows us to gain deeper insights into the ESG performance of our suppliers, fostering a more sustainable 
ecosystem.
This 3rd Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report reflects our progress and reinforces our resolve to 
operate responsibly and ethically. By integrating these principles into our core strategy, we are building a resilient 
business, contributing to a healthier planet, and fostering a more equitable society.
Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Some of the major initiatives include:
1.	
765 kV /400/220 kV GIS Navsari(N) Digital S/S
	
This world’s largest digital substation replaces copper cables with 
optical fibre wires leading to material conservation of copper.
2.	
Indigenous ERS for transmission line 
	
POWERGRID relies on Emergency Restoration Systems (ERS) 
to swiftly repair damaged power lines. Previously, these ERS 
components, like mast sections and insulated crossarms, were 
entirely imported. To promote Indian manufacturing, POWERGRID 
launched a program to develop domestic suppliers for high-
voltage ERS (up to 400 kV), aiming to create a self-sufficient 
supply chain for future repairs.
3.	
Dynamic Line Loading
	
Dynamic Line Loading technology allows real-time adjustment of 
a transmission line's current-carrying capacity based on actual 
environmental conditions such as ambient temperature, wind 
speed, and solar radiation, as opposed to conservative static 
ratings. This enhances the utilization of existing infrastructure, 
particularly during peak demand or high renewable energy 
injection periods, without compromising safety or reliability.
CAPEX

POWERGRID is involved in building the infrastructure to evacuate 
renewable energy. These projects involve building new substations 
and transmission lines, particularly in areas where there is   high 
concentration of solar and wind farms. This will strengthen the grid 
and allow for the smooth integration of more renewable energy into 
the national grid.
2.	
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
POWERGRID follows a set of pre-defined processes and procedures towards sustainable sourcing for its 
various procurement needs. These processes and procedures are designed to ensure that POWERGRID's 
procurement activities are environmentally and socially responsible and that they comply with all relevant 
statutory requirements.
	
Some of the key elements of POWERGRID's sustainable procurement practices include:
	
●
Compliance with statutory requirements: POWERGRID requires all contractors to comply with all relevant 
laws and regulations related to pollution prevention, labor standards and occupational health and safety 
like The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, The 
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Contract Labor (Regulation & Abolition) Act 1970, 
Employee’s Compensation Act 1923, Equal Remuneration Act 1979, Minimum Wages Act 1948, Child Labor 
(Prohibition & Regulation) Act 1986 etc.
	
●
Development of an environmental management plan: Contractors awarded supply-and-installation 
contracts must prepare and implement an environmental management plan. This plan should evaluate 
the project's environmental impacts and detail the measures to mitigate those effects.
256
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (FY 24-25)
	
●
Adoption of Code of Integrity for Public Procurement and Integrity Pact Program: POWERGRID has adopted 
Code of Integrity for Public Procurement, as per which POWERGRID officials and bidders/ suppliers have 
to submit a declaration about abiding by Code of Integrity for Public Procurement. Besides, POWERGRID 
has also adopted an Integrity Pact Program, as per which an Integrity Pact which is a legally binding 
agreement is signed between POWERGRID and its contractors. The Integrity Pact commits the contractor 
to observe the highest standards of business ethics, and it prohibits the contractor from engaging in 
corrupt or fraudulent practices.
	
●
Adherence to strict safety norms: POWERGRID places a great emphasis on adoption of a safe work culture 
to prioritize occupational health & safety of the personnel involved and to prevent/mitigate any loss of 
life/property. To this effect, Fatal accident(s) in any ongoing contract(s) results in non-responsiveness of 
bids based on pre-defined criteria specified in the bidding documents.
	
●
Compliance to Social Accountability norms: The Contractor is also required to comply with all the relevant 
requirements of Social Accountability Standards SA 8000 which inter-alia measures the performance of 
companies in eight areas important to social accountability in the workplace: child labour, forced labour, 
health and safety, free association and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, 
working hours and compensation.
	
Besides above, considering the nature of procurement for large & complex technical transmission projects 
required for enhancing and maintaining seamless power transmission, each procurement under the 
respective project in POWERGRID is critical in nature. Therefore, each supplier undergoes various levels of 
scrutiny for capacity & capability analysis such as package-wise qualifying requirement, pre-defined events 
etc.
	
The procurement process of POWERGRID follows sound business principles and complies to various 
environmental, social, and governance norms thus ensuring sustainability in its entire procurement chain. 
	
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
The above information outlines a defined procedure for sustainable sourcing, including supplier codes of 
conduct for environmental standards, child labor and fundamental human rights. All contractors are required 
to comply with these codes, as well as with specific standards such as SA8000 and the Integrity Pact.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The company derives its guidance from Waste Management Policy. The Company’s waste management 
practices are centered towards Inventorization of the waste generated, segregation of waste generated 
in different categories; reduction of waste, calculation of the intensity of waste generation, recycling of the 
waste materials and reuse of the waste, wherever possible, for economic and environmental benefits; and at 
last disposal of the residual waste in the most environment-friendly manner.
Waste type
Waste management procedure in place
Plastic (including packaging)
POWERGRID, categorized as an Institutional Waste Generator, 
is responsible for sorting and returning packaging materials 
and multi-layered plastics to producers, importers, or brand 
owners as needed. 
E-waste
POWERGRID 
has 
defined 
procedure 
for 
E-waste 
management, which includes the waste to be directed to 
authorized collection centers, registered dismantlers, or 
recyclers and the e-waste is also returned through pick-up 
or take-back services facilitated by the producer, ensuring 
responsible handling and recycling of electronic products.
Hazardous waste
Used transformer oil along with drums containing it are 
classified as hazardous according to the Hazardous and 
Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016, is seldom replaced and in exceptional cases, 
where it turns out to be unsuitable for further use, the used 
oil is collected separately, labeled according to Form-8, 
and stored without commingling with other waste streams. 
Within 90 days of generation, it is either sold or sent to 
registered recyclers, with an annual return filed per Form-4 
to the relevant State Pollution Control Board (SPCB).
Directors' Report
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (FY 24-25)

Waste type
Waste management procedure in place
Empty drums previously containing fresh Transformer oil are 
disposed of through online auctions hosted on the website 
of Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd (MSTCL). 
POWERGRID manages its battery waste by transferring it to 
either the battery producers or their authorized agents for 
proper disposal.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not,

Health and safety management system: 
	
a.	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
Yes. POWERGRID has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems 
(OHSMS), certified under ISO 45001:2018, which covers all direct employees and contract workers engaged 
in construction, operation, and maintenance activities. The OHSMS integrates hazard identification, incident 
investigation, emergency response, and continual improvement practices. Applicable compliance with 
national and international standards is ensured through regular audits and a structured three-tier safety 
governance model.
	
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity? 
	
POWERGRID conducts comprehensive Hazard Identification and Risk Assessments (HIRA) for both routine 
and non-routine activities across all phases—design, construction, and O&M. High-risk activities are planned 
in advance using approved SOPs, Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and workers receive pre-job safety briefings. 
The hierarchy of controls is applied—from elimination to PPE—and execution is monitored by competent 
safety personnel and virtual supervision centers (RTAMC/PMC). Findings from audits and site visits feed into 
continuous improvement of the OHSMS.
	
c.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes. POWERGRID has formal processes for workers to report hazards through toolbox talks, site meetings, and 
direct communication with representatives. Workers are actively encouraged to report unsafe conditions 
without fear of retaliation. Moreover, POWERGRID’s safety policy formally grants workers the right to refuse or 
withdraw from unsafe work, and this is communicated through induction and regular training/awareness 
sessions. Any concerns raised are escalated to safety officers for prompt resolution.
	
d.	 Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. All employees and workers of POWERGRID are covered under the Group Insurance and Mediclaim Policies 
that provide access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

ISO 45001:2018 – Occupational Health and Safety Management System
	
●
ISO 14001 : 2015 – Environmental Management System
	
●
ISO 9001:2015 – Quality Management System

As part of the annual assessment cycle:
	
●
OHS assessments are carried out under ISO 45001 through internal audits, third-party surveillance audits, 
and structured reviews at the site, regional, and corporate levels. These assess hazard identification, risk

Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and 
on significant risks/concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
POWERGRID adheres strictly to all health and safety practices as outlined in its corporate policies and in 
accordance with statutory regulations. In the event of any safety-related incidents or dangerous occurrences, 
a structured investigation process is initiated:
	
●
A dedicated Accident Enquiry Committee is constituted to analyze the root causes of the incident and 
recommend preventive and corrective measures using the hierarchy of controls.
	
●
The findings and recommendations of the committee are widely circulated across all concern / sites to 
ensure cross-learning and consistent implementation of safety improvements.
	
●
All major incidents are further reviewed by the Standing Safety Management Committee and the Apex 
Safety Board, comprising board-level representatives, regional executives, and construction agency 
heads.
	
●
These high-level bodies evaluate the safety performance, identify systemic risks, and recommend 
safety augmentations and structural improvements as needed.
	
●
Additionally, recommendations from these reviews are integrated into the Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System (OHSMS) for continual improvement.
	
These actions ensure that safety lapses are not only addressed but also serve as learning opportunities to 
prevent recurrence across the organization.
Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders.

and success of the business, POWERGRID aims to achieve the following objectives:
a.	 Upholding the Social and Economic Dignity: Ensuring that all employees are treated with respect, fairness 
and equality, regardless of gender, race, status or religion.

Blower & Fraud Prevention Policy, and the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) handles sexual harassment 
complaints. These specialized avenues ensure individuals can voice concerns and seek resolution.

substations is operation of Diesel Generators, which are used only as a 
backup arrangement and occasionally run mainly for testing purpose 
for very short duration (4-5 minutes), as our substations have two very 
stable source of auxiliary power i.e. Dedicated feeder from Discoms and a

Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions? If Yes, then provide 
details.
	
●
Management of SF6: SF6 gas, which is a highly potent Green House gas (GWP; 24300) forms the bulk of 
our Scope-1 emissions. Though, due to a tight inventory management and leakage management system 
being practiced in POWERGRID, we have been able to substantially reduce the leakage rate of SF6 from 
0.14-0.15% to 0.04%, which is well below the acceptable limits (1% for AIS and 0.5% for GIS). 
	
●
Apart from improved Inventory Management, leakage control, improved maintenance practices and 
digitization of data, POWERGRID is also considering replacing it with technically feasible and economically 
viable alternatives. We have started the trial for replacing SF6 filled 132 KV circuit breakers with SF6 free 
breakers in one of our substations on a pilot basis. Depending upon the results of these trails as well as 
274
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT (FY 24-25)
availability of suitable technology in the form of viable alternatives, we will plan SF6 phase out at higher 
voltage level substations in future.             
	
●
POWERGRID has also taken the initiative of regeneration of spoiled SF6 gas, which otherwise goes waste. 
This initiative will help to reduce inventory requirement of this highly potent Greenhouse gas.
	
●
Reducing dependence on Grid Electricity by adopting Renewable sources of Energy: Our Scpe-2 
emissions, which results from purchase of Grid electricity forms around 78.66 % of our total emissions. 
POWERGRID is committed to derive 50% of its power requirements from renewable sources by 2025, which 
would reduce our Scope-2 emission by 50% and total emission by 40%. Accordingly, we are taking several 
efforts in this direction;
	
 Enhancing our Solar PV capacity; Currently, total solar PV installed in our establishments is around 
12.63 MW, which is fulfilling around 3.15 % of our total electricity requirements. It is expected that by the 
end of December 2025 and by March 2026, total installed solar PV will be around 20 MW and 36 MW 
respectively and will account for 6% and 10% of our total power requirement. Further, POWERGRID has 
installed 85 MW of solar plant at Nagda (MP), which is expected to significantly enhance the percentage 
of renewables in our power consumption mix, thus greatly reducing our Scope-2 emissions also. 
	
 Sourcing Power through Green Tariff Mechanism; Green Tariff Mechanism is a progressive policy 
instrument introduced by Govt of India to ensure easy availability of green power to bulk consumers 
and enhance green power capacity in the country. POWERGRID has already started utilizing this 
provision for sourcing of green power for its HVAC substations and offices. In FY 2024-25, 7.94% of 
our auxiliary power consumption needs were fulfilled by the electricity sourced through Green Tariff 
provision, thus further enhancing the share of Green energy in our energy mix. The share of green tariff 
is expected to increase to 40% by the end of FY 2025-26. 
	
●
Focus on developing Green Cover: POWERGRID is aware that trees/Forests play an important role in fighting 
climate change by absorbing atmospheric Carbon Dioxide apart from providing several other benefits 
such as preventing soil erosion, flooding and urban heat island phenomena. Our current green cover 
consists of 10.79 Lakh trees, which consists of plantation within our campuses and additional plantations 
done under various CSR & other schemes. This green cover accounts for offset of around 7.40% of total 
emission. Furthermore, POWERGRID is actively participating in the Green Credit Program of Government of 
India, which focuses on rejuvenation of degraded forest land of the country and has already contributed 
Rs 19.72 crore for the rejuvenation of 278.76 Ha of degraded forest land in the state of Gujarat.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
POWERGRID’s waste management practices are guided by the principles of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, as 
defined in its “Waste Management Policy”, which in turn is duly approved by its Board. Accordingly, POWERGRID 
ensures proper recycling and reuse of the waste material generated in its establishment either in house or 
through M/s MSTCL, A Mini Ratna Public Sector Enterprise or by returning the waste material to producer 
in line with the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), while fully complying with all applicable 
regulations. A small quantity of Hazardous waste consisting of STP Sludge is handed over to Authorized 
Agencies for Environmentally sound disposal. Another, important feature of our approach towards waste 
management is responsible consumption of resources, which not only results in preservation of precious 
natural resources but also helps in reducing the quantity of waste materials generated.

Provide information on the project(s) for which ongoing Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) is being 
undertaken by your entity:   
	
During the reporting period, POWERGRID reiterated its commitment to responsible land acquisition practices. 
Whether it be securing government-owned land for its substations or voluntarily engaging in direct land 
purchases on a "Willing Buyer Willing Seller" basis at fair market or negotiated rates, the company ensures 
that all land acquisitions are carried out with utmost transparency and mutual consent. It is important to note 
that there have been no instances of involuntary land acquisition, thereby eliminating the presence of Project 
Affected Persons (PAP) or Project Displaced Persons (PDP). Consequently, the need for extensive Resettlement 
and Rehabilitation (R&R) activities has not arisen.
	
However, POWERGRID's dedication to social progress extends beyond land acquisition. Through its robust 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, the company proactively supports the broader community. 
These initiatives focus on uplifting the well-being and prosperity of the local communities, promoting 
sustainable development and  fostering positive social impact. By engaging in meaningful and impactful 
CSR endeavors, POWERGRID contributes to the holistic growth and welfare of the communities it operates in, 
establishing itself as a catalyst for positive change.
	
In summary, POWERGRID's land acquisition practices demonstrate its unwavering commitment to ethical 
and voluntary approaches. While ensuring the absence of involuntary displacement, the company extends 
its support to the community at large through impactful CSR initiatives, solidifying their role as a responsible 
corporate citizen dedicated to creating a sustainable and inclusive future.

and precise manner. This also includes the company's principles, commitments, expectations from citizens, 
integrated management policy, services offered, values and standards of services, access to information 
and  grievance redressal.
	
To further smoothen the relationship with community, we have developed an effective Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM) to resolve any grievance of community/public. The GRM has two tiers, the first being 
Project/Substation level Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) and the second being the Corporate Level GRC 
chaired by the Director (Projects) of the company. All written and verbal complaints received by Project level 
GRC are to be resolved within 20 days of receipt of complaint. If the complainant is not satisfied with the 
outcome of the project level GRC, he/she can approach the Corporate Level GRC, which in turn, has to resolve 
the complaint/grievance within 45 days. Notice regarding Corporate Level GRC is publicly available and can 
be accessed at:
