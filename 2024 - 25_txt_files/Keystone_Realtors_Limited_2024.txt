Environmental 
norms/
legislations
Risk
New laws related to 
environment (specifically 
climate related), CSR 
activities are being created 
and enforced. Adherence 
to these new laws poses 
challenge.
Our EHS team understands the regulatory 
requirements to be complied with for the 
different legal requirements. They also seek 
help from the Compliance team to understand 
any specific compliance requirements that may 
be applicable. These areas are covered under 
the internal audit program from a compliance 
point of view as well. As part of sustainability 
reporting, independent assessments conducted 
(by external consultants/experts) also help in 
addressing gaps if any in this area.
Negative 
Implications
2.
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with 
regulatory requirements 
can manifest in financial and 
reputational consequences 
for an organisation and erode 
stakeholder trust.
The Company has a robust set of environmental, 
social and governance-related policies to foster 
a culture of compliance within the organisation.
Disciplinary measures and reinforcement 
mechanisms have been defined as well. 
The ESG organogram further highlights the 
importance of overall compliance by positioning 
the CS in a key role, ensuring overall corporate 
governance in all three verticals (ESG). In 
addition, Legal and functional teams also 
monitor the regulatory compliances across 
businesses at defined frequencies.

Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community development 
activities helps a company 
to create a positive impact 
on society by undertaking 
meaningful interventions to 
bring significant benefits to 
large sections of the society. 
The CSR efforts also help 
foster a more productive and 
positive work environment for 
employees. 
The Rustomjee Foundation has been striving 
to create sustainable opportunities for the 
marginalized communities by facilitating 
quality education, sustainable livelihood 
development, promoting a healthy society and 
supporting rural infrastructure development. 
The  outreach as of now has been to 741 
Students, villages in Maharashtra. With an 
aim to contribute to the holistic development 
of communities, Rustomjee Foundation is 
contributing to the global agenda of meeting 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related 
to eradicating poverty and providing education 
to the underprivileged strata of society.
4.
Modernization, 
Innovation 
and Resource 
Optimization 
Opportunity
The world is changing 
constantly and to remain 
relevant and profitable, 
it is an essential need to 
adapt and develop new 
advancements for meeting 
new realities. The same 
applies to construction 
industry during and post 
construction
Innovation advancements are at centre 
stage, which supports enhancing operational 
efficiency, and reducing overall environmental 
impacts. The company has invested in 
technologies and made changes to its 
processes to reduce resource consumption not 
only during the construction phase but also as 
a sustainable impact to its customers.  Energy 
efficiency through passive and active measures, 
reduced water consumption, effective waste 
management, use of sustainable and green 
products in the buildings are some of the 
initiatives taken and being enhanced for future 
projects. As a result two of our larger projects 
have achieved a silver rating from IGBC's 
new building rating systems and most of our 
upcoming and ongoing  projects are slated to 
be certified under IGBC's new building rating 
systems.   We are also in the process of initiating 
one of our key projects as a net zero energy, 
waste and water project.
5.
Scarcity of Water
Risk
Water is a shared resource, 
making it important for 
businesses to use it 
responsibly. Ensuring 
responsible consumption is 
key to the business’ social 
license to operate and a 
sustainable planet for all. 
Water being an important 
resource in construction 
industry its scarcity may lead 
to disruptions in operations 
and delay timelines of project 
completion.
Mumbai and its suburban areas/adjoining 
districts receive good rainfall every year and 
ground water table is recharged. The turbidity 
of water and the sulphate and iron content 
in water used for construction may pose a 
threat to quality of construction (corrosion 
etc). The cost of treatment of GW, procuring 
water and non-supply of municipal water will 
become a high-risk event in the future. KRL 
and its subsidiaries continues to adopt water 
conservation strategies across all of the existing 
project sites and also supplement internal water 
generation by procuring water from outside 
agencies. Rainwater harvesting system has been 
implemented at few facilities which helps in 
increasing the ground level water. This results 
in release of sub soil water from recharge pits, 
and this reduces the dependency on external 
agencies. The Company has instituted an 
EHS Policy that highlights the importance of 
Resource Conservation, this serves as a guiding 
principle to reduce consumption of water and 
other resources. The EHS team runs awareness 
campaigns to ensure that all personnel are 
aware of the risk related to water shortage.

Human Rights 
such as child

discrimination 
and freedom

and collective 
bargaining 
including anti-

Risk
Upholding human rights 
is essential to protecting 
organization’s communities, 
employees and other 
stakeholders.
The Company has constituted a standing 
forum, both at the Group Level as well as at 
individual entity level, that aids and advises 
the management in its approach towards 
building sustainable Human Rights. Group 
HR is responsible to ensure that any issue or 
impact related to human rights are addressed 
in the defined manner within the stipulated 
timeline. The Company has a robust contractor 
management system which ensures human 
rights practices are adhered to (as per ILO) by 
the contractors supplying man-power to the 
Company. We have very stringent norms for 
child labor, anti-discrimination, forced labor or 
bonded labor, anti- harassment, workers health 
and safety and other human rights issues at all 
project sites.
Negative

Economic 
Performance
Opportunity
Ensuring business profitability 
and strong economic 
performance helps deliver 
value to investors and 
reinvest in the growth of 
the business, employees, 
communities and other 
stakeholders.
The Company thrives to deliver strong economic 
performance through our operational practices 
and risk mitigation strategies that supports the 
nation building and create a value for all the 
stakeholders.
Positive 
Implications
8.
Climate change 
resulting in 
acute and 
chronic physical 
conditions
Risk
Severe weather events 
are a risk to our operations 
and asset management 
along with internal as well 
as external stakeholders. 
Climate risk is material to 
customers, investors, and 
employees too.
Responding to these 
concerns has become central 
to stakeholder understanding 
of climate-related risk to the 
company. Climate change 
can impact our operations 
due to extreme weather 
conditions like cyclones, 
floods, droughts and heat 
waves, to name a few events 
that have the potential to 
create severe disruptions.
The Company is in the process of implementing 
various initiatives across projects sites/facilities 
to control our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
mainly due to energy consumption & Waste 
generation. The company is in the process of 
also calculating our scope 3 emissions in 3 
major categories applicable to our business in 
FY24-25. We also plan to work closely with our 
critical suppliers to understand their strategies 
to comply with and move beyond on their 
material ESG issues.
Hazard Identification and Risk assessment 
with regards to severe weather conditions

Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper disposal of waste 
will lead to non-adherence 
of compliance and result 
in GHG emission.   Waste 
Management is critical to 
ensure judicious use of 
resources and disposal 
under controlled conditions. 
We would like to follow 
the 3R principle of waste 
management at all our 
project sites and are in the 
process of setting goals to 
achieve the same.

Occupational 
health and safety
Risk
Failure to ensure the health, 
safety and well-being of 
the company employees 
and  contractor workforce 
can impact productivity. This 
can consequently affect 
our business operations, 
customer satisfaction and 
profitability.
The Company strives to foster a safe working 
environment and ensure Zero Harm. Hazards 
and risks are periodically identified, with 
mitigation plans devised for each. Additionally, 
safety trainings are provided to employees and 
workers (labour force) on regular basis to ensure 
their holistic well-being. Safety and Health of 
labour workers is critical and our Contractor 
management system ensures the requirements 
are adhered to.
11.
Occupational 
health and safety
Opportunity
The world is changing 
constantly and to remain 
relevant and profitable, 
it is an essential need to 
adapt and develop new 
advancements for meeting 
new realities. The same 
applies to construction 
industry during and post 
construction
12.
Cybersecurity 
and data privacy.
Risk
Protecting customer 
(personal) and company 
information is of utmost 
concern to us.  This ensure 
trust in the company and 
misappropriation of data. 
We have an information security and incident 
management policy in place. Awareness on 
the policy was cascaded to all employees 
within the company for compliance in FY23-24 
and will be continued in the coming Financial 
years. Presently we have access control 
review mechanisms that are also enabled by 
segregation of duties.  This ensures protection 
of all information systems.  Moving forward 
we are working on masking personal sensitive 
information as would be outlined in the data 
protection bill in the future.

rights principles and legal frameworks, while also fostering 
an inclusive and respectful work environment.
At Keystone Realtors Limited (KRL) and its subsidiaries 
(Rustomjee), we firmly believe in the inherent dignity 
and rights of every individual. This belief is embedded in 
our business ethos and extends across all levels of our 
operations. We are committed to cultivating workplaces 
free from discrimination, harassment, or any form of 
human rights violation. Our responsibility also extends 
to the communities we engage with, where we strive to 
uphold these values.
In line with this commitment, we have undertaken Human 
Rights Due Diligence across all operational assets. This 
includes robust assessments to monitor and prevent 
violations such as child labour, forced or bonded labour, 
and to ensure the health, safety, and overall well-being 
of both employees and contract workers across all our 
projects.
To support the dignity and welfare of contract workers, 
we have developed labour camps at select project sites 
that provide safe and hygienic living conditions. These 
camps offer access to potable drinking water, sanitised 
washrooms, clean rest areas, and regular pest control 
measures to prevent infestations. These facilities not 
only contribute to a healthier workforce but also enhance 
productivity and reduce absenteeism.
A key highlight is our new labour camp at Rustomjee 
Urbania, Thane—a first-of-its-kind initiative in the Indian 
real estate sector. Inaugurated on 13th April 2025, the 
facility spans 35,000 sq. ft., built at a cost of ` 6.25 crore, 
and is designed to accommodate 500 workers in 84 
well-ventilated rooms (each 10 ft x 10 ft, housing up to six 
individuals). The camp includes upgraded infrastructure 
such as a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) to enable water 
reuse and recreational areas to support worker well-being. 
Looking ahead, we plan to introduce a crèche facility to 
support workers with families and young children.

10. Briefly describe the waste management 
practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
At KRL, we are dedicated to minimizing our environmental 
footprint throughout the construction lifecycle. Our waste 
management philosophy is centered on the "Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle" principles, with the ultimate goal of 
achieving zero waste to landfill. We have documented a 
waste management policy aligned to ISO 14001 standards.
Minimizing Construction Waste: 
Active Minimization: We actively seek ways to reduce 
waste generation through careful planning, material 
selection, and optimized processes.
Investment in Technology: We invest in innovative 
recycling technologies and streamlined systems to 
maximize resource recovery.
Circular Economy Approach: We strive to create a circular 
economy by converting construction waste into valuable 
resources whenever possible.
Waste Management at KRL Facilities: 
Reduced Hazardous Waste: As a construction company, 
we primarily handle construction debris and materials. Our 
office and facility operations generate minimal hazardous 
waste.
Strict Regulations: We adhere to stringent regulations 
regarding potentially hazardous waste generated by our 
contractors, ensuring proper disposal through SPCB-
approved recyclers.
Organic Waste Management: KRL utilizes in-house 
composting systems to convert organic waste generated 
at our sites and labor camps into fertilizer for landscaping. 
This reduces waste volume and creates a valuable 
resource.
Single-Use Plastics Phase-Out: Committed to aligning 
with government directives, KRL has eliminated single-use 
plastics at all our sites which was one of our commitments 
for FY 2023-24.
Construction & Demolition Waste: As a result of out 
circularity initiatives, we were able to divert 66% of the 
C&D waste away from landfill in FY 2024-25
Moving Forward: 
Reinforcing 3R Principles: In the coming year, we are 
dedicated to further strengthening our commitment to 
the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" philosophy. This includes 
the following steps: 
1. 	
Segrigation of waste at source.
2. 	
Categorization of waste into recyclable and reusable.
3. 	
Reuse and Recycling of waste either in-house or 
through external vendors.
4. 	
Maximizing the sustainable utilization of raw materials 
and products to minimize waste generation at the 
source.
Responsible Contractor Management: KRL ensures 
that all hazardous waste generated by our contractors 
is disposed of according to the Hazardous Waste 
Management and Handling Rules.
