Supply Chain 
Management
R
Supply 
Chain 
Management 
involves 
mitigating risks associated with supplier 
sustainability and adherence to the Supplier 
Code of Conduct. Failure to effectively 
evaluate suppliers for ESG risks can lead 
to regulatory non-compliance, reputational 
damage, 
and 
operational 
disruptions. 
Additionally, neglecting local suppliers may 
result in missed opportunities for community 
engagement and increased supply chain 
resilience.
AWHCL needs to diversify their 
supplier 
network 
to 
reduce 
reliance on any single source. 
Implementing stringent supplier 
assessments 
and 
conducting 
regular 
performance 
reviews 
ensure quality and compliance. 
Additionally, 
developing 
and 
maintaining contingency plans for 
potential disruptions and fostering 
clear, proactive communication 
with suppliers are critical for risk 
mitigation and business continuity.

Regulatory 
Compliance
R
Regulatory 
compliance 
is 
critical 
for 
maintaining organizational integrity and 
avoiding legal repercussions. Failure to 
adhere to relevant regulations can result in 
significant financial penalties, legal liabilities, 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
Additionally, 
non-compliance may lead to operational 
disruptions and increased scrutiny from 
regulatory bodies.
Implementing 
comprehensive 
internal 
and 
external 
audits 
and monitoring systems helps 
ensure adherence and identify 
potential issues early. Additionally, 
providing ongoing training for 
employees and maintaining clear 
documentation supports effective 
compliance and reduces the risk 
of violations.

ESG 
Governance
R
ESG governance is integral to maintaining 
stakeholder trust and achieving sustainable 
growth. 
Inadequate 
governance 
in 
environmental, 
social, 
and 
governance 
(ESG) practices can expose the organization 
to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, 
and operational inefficiencies. Moreover, 
failure to effectively manage ESG risks may 
lead to decreased investor confidence and 
hinder long-term strategic objectives.
Regular audits and assessments 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
ESG 
standards 
and 
identify 
areas 
for 
improvement. 
Additionally, 
engaging 
stakeholders 
and 
integrating their feedback into 
ESG strategies help enhance 
transparency and effectiveness.

Risk 
Management
R
Inadequate risk management practices can 
lead to unforeseen operational disruptions, 
financial losses, and reputational damage. 
Moreover, failure to proactively identify and 
mitigate risks may result in regulatory non-
compliance and diminished stakeholder’s 
expectations.
Regular risk assessments and 
scenario planning help identify 
potential threats and evaluate 
their 
impact. 
Implementing 
robust monitoring and control 
mechanisms 
ensures 
timely 
detection 
and 
response 
to 
emerging risks, while ongoing

6.	 Performance 
of 
the 
entity 
against 
the 
specific 
commitments, goals and targets along-with reasons in 
case the same are not met.
AWHCL is committed to advancing a sustainable and circular 
business model by efficiently sorting Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) 
and converting it into compact Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and 
recyclable materials. Our share of renewable energy consumption 
has increased from 1.89% in FY2022-23 to 5.03% in FY2023-24. 
We maintain the highest health and safety standards, with ZERO 
fatalities reported within our premises. Our infrastructure is designed 
to ensure that women feel comfortable and supported in all our work 
environments.
Our governance framework is structured to promote transparency 
and build trust with both internal and external stakeholders. To 
support this, we have set up several committees, led by Independent 
Directors, including the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration, and 
Stakeholder Relationship Committees. These Committees are 
instrumental in overseeing the Vigil Mechanism, which enables the 
reporting of legitimate concerns and grievances.
Additionally, we prioritize the continuous development of our 
employees through regular training sessions, ensuring their 
expertise in responsible waste management practices. Every 
employee participates in comprehensive Code of Conduct training, 
demonstrating our unwavering commitment to ethical standards 
and professional integrity.
Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.	 Statement by the Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
As the Director responsible for the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report at AWHCL, I am committed to integrating 
the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) challenges and opportunities. Over the last four years, our journey in these 
critical areas has been marked by significant milestones, valuable learning experiences and rigorous reporting.
We are dedicated to enhancing waste management practices to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainability. 
Our efforts focus on reducing our carbon footprint, increasing recycling rates, and adopting innovative technologies to optimize 
resource utilization. Our waste-to-energy initiative is a testament to this commitment, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and 
championing the principles of a circular economy.
Our Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant processes ~1,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day, generating 14 MW of clean 
energy. This project utilizes recycled water from the Chikali Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), eliminating the need for freshwater 
dependency. Notably, our PCMC WtE plant is the first of its kind to sell power under the Green Energy Open Access Rules, in 
the state of Maharashtra.
We prioritize creating safe, inclusive working environments for all our employees and actively engage with local communities to 
enhance their well-being. Our open and communicative approach ensures that stakeholder feedback plays a crucial role in our 
strategic planning and execution.
Our commitment to strong governance principles is demonstrated through our focus on ethical business conduct, regulatory 
compliance, and effective risk management. By maintaining a robust governance framework, we ensure that our operations 
align seamlessly with our broader ESG objectives.
These achievements reflect our dedication to sustainable growth and responsible business practices.

AWHCL's comprehensive Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy underscores our commitment to ethical business conduct 
in compliance with Indian anti-corruption laws. We adopt a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, ensuring all 
dealings are conducted with professionalism, fairness, and utmost integrity. This policy applies to all stakeholders associated 
with AWHCL, including directors, employees, consultants, interns, volunteers, agents, and third parties. It strictly prohibits any 
form of bribery, including payments, gifts, entertainment, hospitality, recruitment opportunities, or other benefits intended for 
business advantage, while allowing reasonable, low-value gifts in the normal course of business.
	
We mandate thorough due diligence and adherence to our policy by third parties to mitigate liability for acts of bribery. Regular 
anti-corruption compliance training is required for all covered individuals, with disciplinary action for non-compliance. Any 
suspected bribery or corruption must be reported to the Compliance Officer, ensuring no retaliation for good faith reports. 
Violations of the policy will result in severe disciplinary measures, including potential termination and criminal proceedings. The 
policy is regularly monitored and reviewed to maintain its effectiveness and relevance.

Leadership Indicators:
1.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes; the Company recognizes the importance of avoiding and managing conflicts of interest that may arise in the course of its 
business activities, especially involving its board members. To this end, it has established a conflict-of-interest management 
protocol that aligns with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The protocol entails 
that Directors disclose any material, financial, or personal interest they may have in any transaction or contract involving the 
Company, using the MBP-1 form as prescribed by the law. These disclosures enable the Company to assess and mitigate any 
potential risks or biases that may affect its decision-making process. Furthermore, the protocol requires that directors who 
have a conflict of interest abstain from participating in the discussions and voting on the relevant matter, ensuring fairness and 
transparency in the Board's functioning. The Company also has a policy on Vigil Mechanism and Whistle Blower and a Code 
of Conduct that encourage ethical behaviour and reporting of any violations, including undisclosed conflicts of interest, among 
its directors and senior management. By implementing these measures, the Company strives to uphold the highest standards 
of corporate governance and accountability.

Responsible Procurement from marginalized community across AWHCL’s value chain: We are dedicated to sustainable 
sourcing and social responsibility within our value chain, recognizing the challenges and opportunities faced by marginalized 
communities, especially women entrepreneurs. Through various initiatives, we support these partners, creating a positive 
impact on their lives and businesses. These initiatives allow us to evaluate our approach's effectiveness and scale up our 
efforts accordingly.
	
Our Initiatives: We have identified marginalized communities based on criteria such as income level, gender, location, and 
sector. We allocate up to 10% of our total procurement in each category to these partners, ensuring stable and fair market 
access. Additionally, our preferential payment policy prioritizes fund distribution to these valued partners, maintaining their 
cash flow stability and supporting their growth.
	
Our Impact: Supporting marginalized communities within our value chain reinforces our commitment to circularity and 
sustainability. This inclusive approach enhances our social impact and underscores our dedication to environmental stewardship. 
By fostering entrepreneurial stewardship, we empower these communities, enhancing their economic opportunities and 
contributing to their overall well-being.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
The Company provides a comprehensive range of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) services, focusing on minimizing waste 
generation and promoting reuse and recycling, despite not engaging in manufacturing operations. In collaboration with local 
communities, we strive to reduce plastic waste through source segregation and partnerships with local recycling facilities. 
One of the key aspects of our environmental responsibility is ensuring that our electronic products do not end up in landfills 
or incinerators, where they can cause pollution and health hazards. Our e-waste management system ensures that used 
products are channelled to authorized recyclers, who follow the best practices for dismantling, recycling, and recovering 
valuable materials. We also ensure that these recyclers adhere to the stringent environmental regulations and standards set by 
the government and other agencies, and provide us with certificates of safe disposal. This way, we reduce our environmental 
footprint, conserve natural resources, and support the circular economy.
Hazardous waste is managed with rigorous segregation and disposal protocols, utilising certified agencies for compliance and 
safety. Our holistic waste management strategies encompass various waste types, fostering local partnerships to enhance 
sustainability and minimize environmental impact.

Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and workers, as per the requirements of 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are being taken by the entity in this regard.
	
AWHCL prioritizes accessibility across all its offices to ensure inclusivity for differently-abled individuals. All our offices are 
equipped with lifts, facilitating easy movement for our differently-abled employees. We are committed to further enhancing 
accessibility by designing specially equipped washrooms with accessible doors, grab rails, and raised toilet seats to meet the 
needs of future physically disabled employees.
	
In line with our equal opportunity policy, we have upgraded our infrastructure at the places where differently-abled employees 
are working to suit their needs. These enhancements have been implemented ensuring that every employee, regardless of 
their physical abilities, can perform their duties effectively and comfortably. We recognize the potential and contribution of our 
differently abled employees and aim to provide them with the best facilities and support.
	
As part of our commitment to enhance accessibility, we are also in the process of installing ramps, rails, and other physical 
accommodations at all our other sites and locations. These measures will enable our future differently-abled employees and 
workers to access the work premises with ease and comfort. We believe that these steps will not only ensure compliance 
with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, but also reflect our dedication to creating a supportive and inclusive 
environment for all individuals. We value the diversity of our workforce and strive to provide equal opportunities for everyone.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
worker? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
Yes/No 
(If yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes; the Company has established a comprehensive grievance redressal system across all its sites to 
address grievances of employees and workers. 
This system includes dedicated channels such as email addresses, contact numbers, and complaint 
boxes, facilitating the submission of grievances. 
There may be some cases where the employee faces some difficulty in accessing or updating their PF or 
ESIC accounts, even after providing the correct KYC details. For such cases/instances, the Company has 
established a grievance redressal mechanism, which aims to resolve the complaints of the employees in 
a timely and efficient manner. The employees need to contact the HR department with their complaints 
and supporting documents. The HR department will then liaise with the PF or ESIC authorities and ensure 
that the issues are resolved at the earliest. The employees can also escalate their complaints to senior 
management if they are not satisfied with the resolution. The Company aims to provide a smooth and 
hassle-free experience to its employees regarding their PF and ESIC matters.
A specialized team conducts weekly reviews of received complaints, ensuring thorough investigations into 
each issue. Their findings and insights are compiled into a detailed report presented to the management 
team for necessary follow-up actions.
Furthermore, AWHCL has implemented a Whistle-Blower Policy accessible at https://www.antony-waste.

protection against any form of retaliation for individuals utilizing the policy.

What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity? 
	
AWHCL employs a proactive approach to identify and assess work-related hazards and risks, supported by its robust Risk 
Management Policy. Through established protocols, we systematically categorize risks into operational, financial, ESG-related, 
and health & safety categories. Regular risk assessments quantify the severity and likelihood of identified risks, ensuring prompt 
mitigation of high-priority risks. A comprehensive Risk Register documents all identified risks and their mitigation strategies, 
enhancing our risk management practices. In alignment with safety standards and regulatory requirements, AWHCL integrates 
feedback from its workforce, incident reports, and near-miss occurrences to continuously improve risk management. 
	
Cross-functional teams actively identify emerging risks, enabling swift implementation of mitigation strategies. Comprehensive 
employee training programmes further empower staff to recognize and address potential hazards effectively, reinforcing 
our commitment to a safe working environment. This proactive approach enhances operational resilience and contributes 
to the overall safety and well-being of our workforce, underscoring AWHCL’s dedication to sustainable business practices.

5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
	
Yes, at one of our facilities, we collect leachate from bioreactor landfills (BLF) and windrow composting through a high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline network, directing it to a raw leachate collection pond for subsequent treatment. Our treatment 
process integrates a unique microbe-based biological system to degrade organic matter effectively. Following this, tertiary 
treatments including sand and activated carbon filtration further purify the effluent, ensuring it meets disposal standards. The 
treated water is then repurposed for dust suppression and irrigation of green spaces within the facility.
	
To maintain optimal moisture levels crucial for the decomposition of MSW, especially as BLFs age and moisture content 
declines, we implement a leachate recirculation system. Excess leachate is reintroduced into the BLF through a network of 
infiltration galleries. This process accelerates the decomposition of remaining waste, thereby enhancing the efficiency of our 
waste management operations.
	
At our PCMC WtE plant, we source treated water from the sewage treatment plant and further purify it through our in-house 
water treatment system. This water is then utilised as boiler feed water for steam generation, which powers the turbine and 
generates electricity. The wastewater from the in-house treatment system is collected and recycled for irrigation purposes 
within the plant premises, thereby promoting a green environment. In doing so, we not only conserve freshwater resources but 
also prevent water pollution, achieving zero wastewater discharge.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Yes, AWHCL has implemented several projects aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. During FY2023-24, 
the total GHG emissions avoided through initiatives like renewable energy at Kanjurmarg and WtE and aerobic composting 
amounted to 8,132 tCO2e.
One of the key initiatives is the PCMC Waste to Energy plant, which started operations in October 2023. This facility processes 
~1,000 tonnes of waste per day using advanced technologies such as anaerobic digestion and biomass gasification. It 
generates approximately 14 MW of green energy by incinerating municipal solid waste (MSW), with about 11.9 MW of net 
power exported to the grid. The plant also captures and utilizes methane generated from Bioreactor Landfill (BLF) cells and 
the leachate treatment plant to produce electricity, thereby preventing methane emissions. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal 
Corporation (PCMC) has become the first municipality to purchase power under the Green Energy Open Access Rules, in the 
state of Maharashtra, with over 37 million green units generated from the Waste to Energy Plant in FY2023-24. 
Additionally, the Kanjurmarg site generated 1,225.92 MWh of electricity from renewable sources, further contributing to GHG 
emissions reduction. At this site, AWHCL can manage ~7,500 metric tonnes of waste per day through an integrated solid 
waste management system. The MRF technology segregates waste, while the bioreactor landfill captures methane for power 
generation, currently producing approximately 960 KW. 
The leachate recirculation process accelerates waste degradation and reduces emissions, significantly lowering GHG 
emissions and generating renewable energy. Also, the emissions were avoided by exporting RDF from the Kanjurmarg site to 
cement factories.

AWHCL believes that waste management is not only a technical issue, but also a social and behavioural one. Therefore, we 
conduct targeted campaigns to educate and empower citizens on waste management, emphasising the importance of source 
segregation. Source segregation refers to the practice of separating and segregating waste at the point of generation into 
different categories, such as wet, dry, and domestic hazardous waste. This helps to reduce the quantity of waste that ends 
up in the landfills, increase the efficiency of waste collection and transportation, and facilitate the recycling and recovery of 
valuable resources.
	
To facilitate the adoption of source segregation and other waste management practices in their daily lives, we organise 
practical hands-on training sessions for various groups, including residential societies, schools, colleges, offices, and hotels. 
These sessions, supported by local NGOs, cover essential topics such as the benefits of source segregation, the different 
types and categories of waste, proper methods for storing and disposing of waste, and available options for waste reduction, 
reuse, and recycling.
	
Additionally, the Company leverages social media and its website to run continuous digital campaigns, promoting best 
practices in waste management and encouraging responsible behaviour. The social media and website campaigns feature 
success stories, testimonials, feedback, and suggestions from the citizens, as well as updates, news, and announcements 
from the Company. The campaigns also invite the citizens to participate in quizzes, surveys, contests, and challenges related 
to waste management. The social media and website campaigns aim to create awareness, engagement, and action among the 
citizens, and to foster a sense of ownership and pride in the waste management system.
