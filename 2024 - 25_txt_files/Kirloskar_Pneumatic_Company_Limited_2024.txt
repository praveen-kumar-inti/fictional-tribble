suggestion gave birth to ‘Project Foresight’ providing opportunities to employee teams to propose new business ideas, 
Customers’ expectations for buyback scheme gave birth to Project Renovare resulting in end of life product management 
promoting circular economy (the details of which are given in Principle 3 disclosures – essential indicator no. 3 and leadership 
indicator nos. 4,5), Suppliers’ need resulted in Supplier Quality Improvement Program with 35 key suppliers resulting in 
reduction in rejection PPM by almost 83%, Secondary education promotion was enhanced after receiving feedback through 
KPCL’s Society Perception Survey by providing life skills training through its CSR initiative (Bharari), a new school health

Independent Assurance Statement
To,
Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Limited 
One Avante, 3rd Floor, Karve Road,
Kothrud, Pune, 411038
Independent Assurance Statement to Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Limited on select non-financial disclosures in the Business 
Responsibility & Sustainability Report for the financial year 2024-25.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Limited (the 'Company') has developed its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
(the ‘Report’) based on the BRSR reporting guidelines prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The reporting criteria have been derived 
from the Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2018 (NGRBC), and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The BRSR will be part of the Company’s Annual Report 2024-25.
BDO India LLP (BDO) was engaged by the Company to provide independent limited assurance on select non-financial information 
in the Report for the financial year 2024-25.
The Company’s responsibilities
The Report content and its presentation are the sole responsibilities of the management of the Company. The Company management 
is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report, 
so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
BDO’s responsibilities
BDO India LLP responsibility, as agreed with the management of the Company, is to provide assurance on the Report content as 
described in the ‘Scope & boundary of Assurance’ section below. We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance a third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.
Assurance standard
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, “Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board. We applied the criteria of 
‘Limited’ assurance.
Scope & boundary of assurance 
We have assured a select set of sample indicators in the Report pertaining to the Company’s non-financial performance covering 
its operations for the period 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025.
Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entails conducting procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered in the 
assurance scope. We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, and a general 
review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review process included:
 
 
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the select BRSR indicators in the Report;
 
 
Review of consistency of data/information within the Report as well as between the Report and source;
 
 
Engagement through discussions with personnel at the corporate level who are accountable for the data and information 
presented in the Report;

Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Limited 
A Kirloskar Group Company
Annual Report 2024-25
 
 
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, 
and aggregation;
 
 
Review of data collection and management procedures, and related internal controls.
We used our professional judgement as Assurance Provider and applied appropriate risk-based approach, for determining sample 
for review of non-financial information for verification. The reviews were conducted through physical mode, where information and 
evidence were made available to us.
Limitations and exclusions
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, including, for example, the use of judgement and selective testing of 
data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material misstatements in the Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope excludes:
 
 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2024 to 31st March 2025)
 
 
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting is based; we 
have been informed by the Company that these are derived from the Company’s audited financial records; 
 
 
The Company’s statements and claims related to any topic other than those listed in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance;
 
 
The Company's statements that describe qualitative/quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, inference, 
aspiration/targets, expectation, aim or future intention.
Our observations 
We have reviewed the disclosures in the “Report” for the reporting period from 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. The 
disclosures of the Company, covered under the ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly reliable. 
Our Conclusions
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained as defined under the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the disclosures of the Company are presented fairly in accordance with the 
relevant reporting guidelines/standards.
