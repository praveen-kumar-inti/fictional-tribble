MD & CEO’s Message
Dear Stakeholders, 
In an era marked by rapid change and increasing global challenges, ICICI Lombard’s (The Company) role as a general insurer extends beyond 
providing financial security. With its 5th year of ESG-related disclosures, the Company has remained committed to its organisational ESG 
strategy which focuses on key material issues such as promoting health and well-being, sustainable underwriting, responsible investment, 
environmental stewardship, climate change mitigation, technological innovation and socio‑economic development. 
As one of India’s leading private general insurers, the Company is well-positioned to grow its business profitably, while supporting customers and 
local communities in times of need. While the Company’s business model is intertwined with the sustainability objectives, the newly formulated 
ESG policy defines its approach towards material ESG issues. 
Sustainable insurance solutions
The Company aims to reduce risk, develop innovative solutions and improve business performance, and contribute to environmental, social 
and economic sustainability. Towards this during the fiscal 2024, the Company continued to create capacities and develop insurance products 
that enable transition into a low-carbon economy, and ensure inclusiveness across a large spectrum of the society, i.e., SMEs, MSMEs, rural 
communities, and retail customers, amongst others. 
Consequently, the Company’s Gross Direct Premium Income (GDPI) for the year ended March 31, 2024, grew by 17.8% to ` 247.76 billion, 
compared with ` 210.25 billion in FY2023. During the fiscal, the Company issued over 36.2 million policies covering 24.7 million lives and 
honoured 2.9 million claims. Of the total lives covered 12.1 million lives were covered in the rural sector and 6.0 million lives, were covered under 
the social sector encompassing marginalised communities. 
The Company’s sustainable product suite includes holistic covers for solar/ wind insurance, electric vehicle insurance, insurance for age-fit 
vehicles, engineering, liability insurance and crop insurance, amongst others. - To illustrate better, the Company’s growth momentum in EV 
insurance has been positive, with a market share of ~17.0% in private cars and ~28.0% in the two-wheeler segment for fiscal 2024. For fiscal 
2024 EV insurance policy count grew 2x over last year.
The Company also promotes products that reward the insured based on sustainable practices such as Pay as You Use (where the premium is 
decided on vehicle usage) and Pay How You Drive (where the premium is decided on safe driving behaviour), Sustainable agriculture and organic 
farming with incentivising climate-friendly cropping techniques and technology.

As a part of its holistic risk management, the Company provides value-added services. During the fiscal 2024, the Company advised 898 
corporates towards adopting sustainable and greener practices, thus reducing their environmental and other risks.
Climate Risk Mitigation
While globally natural disasters have become more frequent, the insurance industry faces the challenge of accurately predicting and pricing 
the risk.  Compared to developed economies like United States with an insurance penetration of 9% in developing economies like India the 
penetration stands at 1%. That being said there is a significant opportunity in India to work at speed to increase insurance penetration by 
enhancing the insurance coverage. (Source for insurance penetration: Sigma 3/2023 Swiss Re) 
Domestically during the fiscal, the industry witnessed three CAT events. However, The Company’s climate risk management strategy enabled it 
to restrict the share of insured losses where the insured losses were lower than the overall market share of the Company.
As a part of climate risk management, the Company undertakes due diligence while underwriting the risk of the insured who are particularly 
susceptible to events such as floods, cyclones, storms and similar events. By analysing the risk, the Company identifies and advises ways to 
mitigate risks, while still providing essential coverage to policyholders. Further, the Company engages with clients to undertake preventive 
measures to reduce the potential adverse impact of such events. 
Furthermore, the CAT XOL treaties procured enhance the Company’s risk transfer capabilities. These treaties provide an additional layer of 
financial security, enabling it to effectively manage catastrophic losses.
As part of the Company’s risk management practice, the Company endeavours to continuously track and monitor any adverse climatic conditions 
developed across the country and proactively engage with identified customers to support in managing the potential risk to avoid severe losses.
Promoting Health and Well-being
The Company foresees significant opportunity in health insurance through pragmatic solutions, aimed at improving access to health 
insurance. It continues to make significant investments in the health segment. Resultantly for fiscal 2024, health insurance was 29.0% of 
the Company’s total portfolio mix.
Further, the Company remains steadfast on its path towards promoting healthy behaviour and lifestyles and reducing health-related risks 
through its IL TakeCare App. This App has garnered over 9.3+ million user downloads to date, enabling customers to gain access to Tele/ Video 
Consultation, Chat with Experts, Mental wellbeing consultation, Health Quotient, Face Scan, and Diet & Exercise Tracker, among other benefits. 
The Company continues on its journey of creating a social impact, leading to positive change in the communities. Further, to improve healthcare 
in rural areas, wellness camps were conducted during the fiscal 2024 under the Healthy Villages initiatives impacting over 60,000 lives. 
Facilitating Responsible Investment
The Company integrates ESG considerations in its investment decisions and analyses any new investment from an ESG lens to promote 
sustainability-related themes for delivering competitive returns and finance a more sustainable economy. 
The Company has adopted a responsible investing framework that is built on its three pillars, Integration of ESG consideration across the equity 
and the debt portfolio of the Company; having an exclusion/negative list, active engagement with issuers; and evaluating shareholder proposals 
on various kind of climate and social issues. 
Further, during the fiscal, the Company also made incremental investments in green bonds earmarked for environmentally sustainable projects, 
thus supporting the nation’s demand for green infrastructure projects. 
Environmental Stewardship
The Company is well aligned with India’s target for Net Zero emissions by 2070. The Company’s efforts in decarbonising its operational footprint 
are focused mainly on two areas; i.e., sourcing renewable energy, and enhancing operational efficiencies.
During the fiscal 2024, 27.0% of the energy requirements of the Company were sourced from green energy exceeding the target taken of 
sourcing 25.0% of energy requirements through green energy by 2025. 
Towards increasing operational efficiency, the Company also undertakes regular energy audits at its key offices. The Company is also moving 
towards LEDfying the branches to further reduce emissions, resulting in close to 99.0% of the total office premises LEDfied. Generally, the data 
centres cause high Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Company was able to enhance its operational efficiency by migrating its operations 
to cloud-native that uses AWS data centres, which run on energy-efficient technologies and operate on green energy.

Resultantly, the Company has been able to bring down its emissions (MTCO2e)  per headcount reduced to 0.87 in fiscal 2024 from 1.17 MTCO2e 
in fiscal 2020. 
Towards reducing its GHG impact the Company has also undertaken CSR initiatives such as the installation of solar panels in underprivileged 
schools. Under its project Niranjali, the Company has installed water purifiers in government/ municipal schools, replacing the conventional fuel 
methods of water purification, thereby avoiding associated emissions.
Towards Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
The Company prioritises the promotion of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) at the workplace by acknowledging and celebrating employee 
differences and fostering diversity and inclusion. The Company is a gender-neutral, equal-opportunity employer with zero tolerance for any 
discrimination based on gender, religion, caste or class. The Company takes a holistic approach towards the all-round growth and development 
of its employees, especially women, and is focused on significantly increasing their representation in the total workforce. The Company considers 
the inclusion of women as a key priority, and inches closer to its target of ensuring at least 25.0% women by FY2025, with women representation 
increased to 24.0% in FY2024, up from 17.5% in FY2020.
Driving efficiency through Digitalisation and Innovation
Digitalisation is another key priority for the Company. Deploying end-to-end digital solutions has reduced paperwork and environmental

Grievance Redressal Mechanisms at ICICI Lombard:
The organisation has a Whistle Blower policy in place which provides all employees an opportunity to 
raise any issues/grievances anonymously, where the identity of the whistle-blower is kept confidential. A 
dedicated email ID has been created at an organisational level, to which the employees can write their 
concerns. A dedicated single point contact (SPOC) is assigned to look into all matters independently and 
fairly.
ICICI Lombard has established a well-placed process for addressing employee grievances. An employee 
with a grievance can reach out to his/her immediate or skip manager as the first point of contact. In case 
of no resolution, the respective business HR is the next point of contact, responsible for investigation and 
resolution in a fair & transparent manner. In case no satisfactory results are achieved, the employee can 
reach out to the regional HR, followed by the all-India HR. In case of continuing discontent, the Company 
appoints a Grievance Redressal Committee, consisting of three neutral members to understand the 
concern, investigate the matter, and provide an appropriate resolution. As a next level, the employee can 
reach out to the Appellate authority for appealing against the investigation outcome.
For POSH-related matters, the employees are expected to raise it with the local HR team or to the 
dedicated email ID of the Internal Committee. This can be escalated to the Chairperson of the Internal 
Committee. The final level of escalation is to the HR Head of the organisation.
ICICI Lombard has also established other platforms to address employees’ concerns and complaints. 
The employees can file their complaints/grievances on Reach MeBOT*, or report directly to HR through 
their representatives. The Company ensures prompt and effective resolution of grievances to create a 
workplace of equitable hiring and eliminated discrimination against employees. In addition, ICICI Lombard 
provides a Fair Appeal process - a unique platform for all employees to raise their grievances related to 
the fairness of the performance management process. This platform provides every employee to appeal 
for any unfair or unjust evaluation of year-end appraisals with relevant facts and evidence. All such 
grievances are reviewed and assessed to provide fair and transparent findings and resolutions to such 
employees.
For further appeal on any decision from a grievance redressal body, appellate authorities are available 
who are empowered to deliberate and decide on such matters.
The Company also has robust mechanisms in place to safeguard the complainant against any adverse 
consequences. In the first place, Company maintains the utmost confidentiality of the Complainant. All 
related parties against whom the Complaint has been reported are sensitised of any retaliatory action 
against the complainant. In case any incident of retaliation is observed or brought to the notice of the 
management, the Company takes appropriate action on the reported matter and ensures that the 
complainant does not have to go through adverse consequences.
