demand for lighting, air-conditioning and other loads. However, the intensity normalized over the office carpet area has decreased due to energy

7.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, the bank has many initiatives for reducing GHG emissions within its operations. A few notable initiatives and their potential 
impacts are summarized below.
	
Green buildings: Two of our largest offices by carpet area –Airoli and NOC (both in Mumbai) are situated in certified green 
buildings. This is about 45% of the carpet area among our all the regional offices (barring branches) and 14% of all carpet area, 
inclusive of all India branches.
	
For about 50 other large branches, we are working with an Energy Service Company (ESCO) partner, who has installed air 
conditioning energy optimisation with sensors and it is also estimated to save about 50 MWh/ month. This initiative is expected 
to avoid emissions of 486 tCO2 per year.
	
The 8th floor of NOC, Goregaon office is using 100% renewable energy from 29 September 2022. With a monthly consumption of 
1.11 lakh units, this initiative will help avoid emissions of 1,079 tCO2 annually. This also reduces RBL’s annual operational (Scope 
1 and 2) GHG emissions by 11%, compared to 2021-21 contribution.
	
Solar roof top in branches: The bank has installed about 96 kWp renewable energy in its 21 rural branches, Sangli Office and 
Bank’s Head Office in Kolhapur, generating about 150 MWh of solar power in last FY, and avoiding GHG emissions of 141 tCO2. 
In addition, the bank finances various renewable energy, other emission reduction projects and electric vehicles etc. These in 
turn also help reduce the total GHG emissions.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of RBL Bank Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements of RBL Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise the 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Profit and Loss Account 
and the Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes 
to the Standalone Financial Statements including a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “Standalone Financial Statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial 
Statements give the information required by the Section 29 of 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and as well as the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and circulars and guidelines issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India, in the manner so required for the banking 
companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, 
read with rules made thereunder, of the state of affairs of the 
Bank as at March 31, 2023, its profit and its cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the 
Act and Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Sr. No.
Key audit matter(s) (KAM)
How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
1.
Information Technology (IT) Systems, Migration of Data, and controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s financial accounting and reporting systems are 
highly dependent on data from various IT applications and 
Core Banking Solution (CBS) which are interfaced and / or are 
working independently (the IT applications, CBS, general and 
related application controls together referred to as “IT Controls 
Framework”). Extensive volume, variety and complexity of 
transactions are processed daily and there is a risk that 
automated accounting procedures and related internal 
controls may not be accurately designed and operating 
effectively. There exists a risk that gaps in the IT control 
environment could result in the financial accounting and 
reporting records being materially misstated. Appropriate IT 
controls are required to ensure that the IT applications operate 
as planned and the changes made are properly authorized, 
tested and controlled. Our audit outcome is also dependent 
on the effective operations of these IT systems and controls 
throughout the year.   
During the year, the bank has migrated to a new Loan Operating 
System (LOS) for Micro Finance loan portfolio. The migration 
of loan data from the old system to the new system is a critical 
aspect of the migration process. The completeness and 
accuracy of the migrated data will affect the reliability of the 
loan operating system. 
 
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit 
procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration the 
IT systems of the Bank. The procedures adopted by us are, in 
our opinion, adequate to provide reasonable assurance on the 
adequacy of IT controls in place and includes:
 
Gaining understanding of IT controls framework through 
Walkthrough of processes. We also discussed and referred to 
reports of internal auditors, Internal Financial Control and other 
assurance functions in carrying out our audit procedures.
 
The IT audit specialists (who are integral part of audit team) have 
carried out testing of effectiveness of general and application 
controls.  
 
We also tested key automated and manual business cycle 
controls and logic for system generated reports relevant to the 
audit; including testing of compensating controls or performed 
alternate procedures to assess whether there were any 
unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the Financial 
Statements.  
 
We have performed testing by selecting a sample of data and 
tracing the movement of data from the old system to new system 
to ensure that the migrated data is complete and accurate.
