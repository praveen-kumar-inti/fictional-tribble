implications)
1
Risk arising from inability 
to ensure adequate 
management of safety 
hazards within operations.
Risk
This risk is an intrinsic part 
of our business because 
it involves the storage, 
transportation, and 
handling of hazardous 
materials.
Safety is our top priority across all 
operations.
•	
Safety is prioritized in all operations, 
through 
implementation 
of 
KAVACH (governance, training, 
best practices).
•	
We drive safety consciousness via 
communication, strict protocol 
monitoring, 
and 
near-miss 
reporting/learning.
•	
Safety 
leadership 
has 
been 
integrated 
into 
management 
roles (job descriptions/targets) 
and factor safety performance 
into all performance assessments 
and personnel decisions.
Negative - Safety 
hazards can 
lead to adverse 
consequences, 
including loss of life, 
property damage, 
financial loss, and 
harm to reputation.

2
Risk of noncompliance 
to environmental / 
health/ safety regulations 
leading to loss of license 
to operate/ reputational 
damage
Risk
Due to the inherent 
nature of our operations, 
the company is 
required to comply with 
environmental, health, and 
safety regulations.
Syngene mitigates the risk of 
regulatory noncompliance (specifically 
regarding environment, health, 
and safety) through a strategy 
of identification, resolution, and 
escalation, which includes:
•	
Monitoring relevant regulations 
through a dedicated governance 
process.
•	
Assuring 
compliance 
using 
Synpliance 
(Compliance 
Management 
Tool) 
and 
a 
specialized legal/regulatory help 
desk.
Negative - 
Noncompliance can 
result in negative 
consequences, 
including legal, 
regulatory, financial, 
and reputational 
damage.
3
Risk arising from 
Inadequate cybersecurity 
controls leading to loss 
of data
Risk
Risk is an integral part of 
Syngene’s business, as we 
rely on IT infrastructure to 
store critical information.
Cybersecurity is addressed through a 
multi-layered approach encompassing 
technology, process, and people:
•	
Technology: 
Best-in-class 
cybersecurity 
solutions 
are 
deployed within a framework 
that is constantly reviewed and 
upgraded to address emerging 
threats.
•	
Process: 
Cybersecurity 
management is governed by 
international standards like ISO 
27001, with regular vulnerability 
assessments conducted to stress 
test the system. A program also 
monitors potential confidential 
data leakage.
•	
People: 
Employees 
receive 
continuous 
education 
and 
awareness training on cyber 
threats and phishing risks.
Negative - 
Noncompliance 
can result in legal, 
financial, reputational, 
and regulatory 
consequences.
4
Risk arising from failure 
to uphold high standards 
of business integrity and 
ethics
Risk
For Syngene, upholding 
business integrity and 
ethics is not just a 
regulatory necessity 
but a strategic business 
imperative. Ethical lapses 
can result in severe 
financial, operational, and 
reputational damage, 
making this risk one of the 
most critical to manage 
effectively.
The approach to risk mitigation has the 
following elements:
•	
An 
Anti-Bribery 
and 
Anti-
Corruption (ABAC) policy has 
been 
implemented 
for 
all 
employees and partners.
•	
A 
structured 
communication 
program and annual refresher 
training 
ensure 
widespread 
awareness of the policy.
Negative - 
Noncompliance 
can result in legal, 
financial, reputational, 
and regulatory 
repercussions.

5
Delay or disruption in 
sourcing raw materials, 
equipment and spares 
in a timely manner 
due to disruption in 
local or global supply 
chain thereby leading 
to delayed delivery 
of services to clients. 
Not able to source 
cost effectively will 
reduce Syngene’s 
competitiveness.
Risk
Syngene manages a 
complex supply chain 
requiring advanced 
sourcing expertise, timely 
deliveries, and strict 
adherence to precise 
specifications by its 
suppliers.
The risk associated with sourcing 
resilience is managed by the following 
programs:
•	
Build a local ecosystem of raw 
material supply.
•	
Aggregate demand to incentivize 
global suppliers to establish local 
warehouses.
•	
Develop category management 
capabilities.
•	
Build resilience in logistics.
•	
Strengthen capabilities for de-
risking reliance on China.
•	
Improve sourcing speed.
Negative - This risk 
may lead to negative 
outcomes, including 
business loss, financial 
setbacks, and 
reputational damage.
6
Risk arising from 
disruption in operations 
caused by shortage of 
water. (Primary location of 
concern is Bangalore.)
Risk
Given Bangalore’s water 
challenges and Syngene’s 
high dependency 
on water for critical 
operations, this risk is a 
major operational and 
strategic concern. Proactive 
water conservation, 
alternative sourcing, and 
contingency planning 
are essential to mitigate 
potential disruptions and 
ensure long-term business 
continuity.
The following measures have been 
taken to ensure that Syngene never 
runs out of water for its operations:
•	
Establish and secure both primary 
and backup water sources.
•	
Implement measures to optimize 
and reduce water consumption.
•	
Consider water availability as a key 
factor when selecting new facility 
locations.
•	
Enhance water resilience through 
recycling, rainwater harvesting, 
and 
on-site 
water 
storage 
solutions to mitigate potential 
disruptions in external supply.
Negative – This risk 
may lead to disruption 
in Syngene’s day to 
day operations during 
peak summer season.
7
Promotion of inclusion 
and diversity
Opportunity
A diverse and inclusive 
workforce brings fresh 
perspectives and a wide 
range of experiences, 
driving innovation and 
enabling sustained 
value creation. We are 
dedicated to fostering a 
workplace that celebrates 
the individuality of our 
employees and prioritizes 
their well-being.
Not applicable
Positive - A 
diverse workforce, 
representing 
various genders, 
ages, ethnicities, 
and abilities, 
fosters innovation, 
encourages fresh 
perspectives, and 
contributes to a more 
productive overall 
environment.

b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
The Company has an established process for identifying work-related hazards from routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessments such as lab 
hazard analysis and process risk assessment are undertaken for routine activities in both laboratory applications and manufacturing operations. 
This ensures that hazards are identified, and adequate controls are put in place. For non-routine activities, job safety analyses are carried out to 
assess the risk before undertaking any activities. The hazard analysis tool for both routine and non-routine risks works on the systematic approach 
of identifying, evaluating and controlling hazards:
	
	
•	
Physical (e.g. slips, trips and falls, entanglement, noise, vibration, harmful energy sources);
	
	
•	
Chemical (e.g. inhalation, contact with or ingestion of chemicals);
	
	
•	
Biological (e.g. contact with allergens or pathogens such as bacteria or viruses);
	
	
The following processes are used to identify the hazards in the workplace:
	
	
•	
Safety interactions and safety walks in the workplace to identify potential hazards.
	
	
•	
Employee participation during weekly safety hours
	
	
•	
Comparison of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with current practice.
	
	
•	
Reviews of incident management reports
	
	
•	
Reviews of safety data sheets
	
	
•	
Reviews of first aid/injury records
	
	
•	
After identifying a hazard, controls are put in place to bring the Hazard to ALARP (As low as reasonably practical) state.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, Syngene has a well-established system to report any incident, unsafe condition, unsafe acts or work-related hazards. All employees must 
report any incident, near miss or unsafe act through a company-wide portal, ‘SynZero’. All incidents reported in the portal are investigated, root 
cause analysis is undertaken, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are put in place. Workers may also raise their concerns at the periodic 
departmental-level safety meetings or during Gemba walks.
	
d. 	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)

A third-party impact assessment of the eLAJ Smart Clinics, an initiative of the Biocon Foundation, confirmed the program’s strong alignment with its 
mission to deliver affordable, accessible healthcare to underserved communities. Using the M-HEALTH framework, the evaluation highlighted that 
over 65% of patients are below the poverty line, with high unemployment and low education levels, reinforcing eLAJ’s targeted outreach. The clinics 
demonstrated high care quality, with standardized protocols, regular follow-ups (93.1%), strong medication adherence, and free diagnostics for 91.2% 
of patients. Partnerships with NGOs, panchayats, and medical colleges have enhanced service delivery and community trust. Robust outreach efforts 
screened over 8,000 individuals, identifying significant NCD and cancer risks. Clinical outcomes are encouraging, with most patients maintaining 
control over chronic conditions and only 2.6% reporting NCD-related hospitalizations. Key recommendations include extending clinic hours, improving 
medicine availability, and implementing an integrated, ABDM-compliant health data system to improve continuity of care and data-driven decision-
making.

Observations and Findings
In addition to providing reasonable assurance, we noted the following 
observations during our engagement:
•	
Stakeholder Inclusivity:
	
We found no evidence to suggest that any key stakeholder groups 
were excluded from the stakeholder engagement processes related 
to the BRSR Core indicators. SIL has demonstrated a proactive and 
inclusive approach, ensuring that diverse stakeholder perspectives 
are considered throughout its sustainability-related performance and 
disclosures.
•	
Materiality:
	
We are not aware of any significant material sustainability topics 
related to the BRSR Core indicators that have been omitted. SIL has 
identified and reported on the relevant topics, ensuring alignment 
with stakeholder expectations and sector-specific material issues, 
particularly those covered under the BRSR Core framework.
•	
Responsiveness:
	
SIL has established robust processes to effectively respond to 
stakeholder concerns and manage its material sustainability issues 
covered under the BRSR Core disclosures. While our assurance was 
limited to the verification of the reported Core indicators, we observed 
that the company demonstrates adequate responsiveness to relevant 
stakeholder concerns within this scope.
•	
Impact:
	
SIL has implemented effective processes to measure, evaluate, and 
manage the environmental and social impacts associated with the 
BRSR Core metrics. These processes are aligned with key performance 
indicators (KPIs) relevant to the nature of its business and identified 
material sustainability issues.
•	
Reliability:
	
Data management processes and internal controls related to the 
BRSR Core indicators are in place and provide a reasonable level of 
reliability for the reported information. While some data, particularly at 
the operational level, are based on site-specific measurement systems, 
the overall approach supports the accuracy and completeness of Core 
disclosures.
Limitations and Exclusions
Excluded from the scope of our work is assurance of information relating to:
•	
Company’s financial disclosures, forward-looking statements, or other 
parts of the BRSR beyond the Core.
The following limitations should be noted:
•	
This limited assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected 
sample of sustainability data and the associated limitations that this 
entails.
•	
The reliability of the reported data and information are dependent 
on the accuracy of metering and other production measurement 
arrangements employed at site level, which were not addressed as 
part of this assurance.
