Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
PDS remains deeply committed to embedding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles across its business. The strategy 
continues to be guided by four sustainability pillars—Reduce Emissions, Respect Water, Think Circular, and Build Community—which serve as 
the foundation for the Company’s decision-making and progress. FY 2024–25 marked an important step in advancing commitments under 
these pillars through science-aligned targets, innovation-led interventions, and deeper ecosystem engagement.
During the year, PDS formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), reinforcing the Company’s decarbonisation pathway 
in alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement with the ultimate goal to achieve Net Zero by 2050. The Company’s operational facilities 
made tangible gains—Good Earth Apparels generated over 10,00,000 kWh of renewable energy, while Norlanka produced an average of 
51,440 kWh per month, avoiding 987.46 metric tonnes of CO₂e in FY 2024–25.
PDS’s environmental stewardship also extended to nature-based solutions. In collaboration with the University of Kelaniya, Norlanka continued its 
mangrove restoration programme in Sri Lanka, with over 700 mangrove plants restored. This initiative resulted in an estimated 215,600 kg of CO₂e 
sequestration, reinforcing commitment to ecosystem resilience. The Company piloted Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for five products through 
our partnership with Carbon Trail, generating actionable insights across product development stages including spinning, knitting, packaging, 
and transport. These insights are shaping material choices and process optimisation in the design and sourcing functions. Complementing this, 
several of the Company’s suppliers improved their emissions and impact data submissions under Higg FEM 4.0, supporting the broader value 
chain transparency goals.On the water management front, PDS recognizes the growing stress on freshwater resources and has implemented 
focused initiatives across subsidiaries like Good Earth Apparels, Progress Apparels, Zamira, Norlanka, and CCP Malwana. These include rainwater 
harvesting, wastewater treatment, and water-efficient machinery, supported by employee training to reduce consumption and minimise wastage. 
For managing waste generated, fabric optimisation, traceable recycling, and energy recovery from textile by-products is prioritized. Progress 
Apparels operates a Waste-to-Energy boiler using fabric waste, while Norlanka partners with recyclers to close the loop on material use. Chemical 
management is governed by a ZDHC-aligned policy, with strict protocols for safe use, testing, and digital inventory tracking.
PDS is actively reducing its carbon footprint by scaling clean energy solutions across key facilities. Solar power systems at units in Sri Lanka 
and Bangladesh, along with on-site renewable generation at Good Earth Apparels and Norlanka, now meet a significant share of operational 
energy needs. At Progress Apparels, a fabric waste boiler converts production waste into thermal energy, further cutting emissions.
Innovation continues to drive the Company’s sustainability agenda. Through PDS Ventures, the Company advances commitment to invest USD 50 
million in transformative fashion-tech and circularity solutions. The portfolio now includes over 60 companies, spanning cutting-edge technologies 
like Colorifix’s low-impact dyeing, Smartex’s AI-led defect detection, and Evrnu’s regenerative fibre platforms. Traceability at scale was also enabled 
through partnerships with Oritain, which authenticates fiber origin, and Fabacus, whose Digital Product Passport pilot with Tesco enhances product-
level transparency. Positive Materials vertical, based in Portugal, continues to play a pivotal role in commercialising next-generation materials by 
bridging lab innovation with industrial application. The successful launch of the Everloop capsule collection, developed in partnership with six 
material innovators, demonstrated the strength of co-creation in sustainable design.
PDS remained equally focused on social equity and community impact. The Company’s flagship education programme in conjunction with 
the SOHAM foundation, expanded its reach by offering academic and vocational training to children and families in underserved communities 
in India and Bangladesh. Other group-led initiatives included life-saving infant wear by Poeticgem, women’s upskilling through fabric waste 
reuse at Spring Near East, and employee well-being support through the Apon Fair Shop at Good Earth Apparels, which offers discounted 
essentials, including hygiene products for women.
As legislation and stakeholder expectations evolve, PDS intensified engagement with platforms such as the UN Global Compact and the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) to align internal practices with global frameworks. These efforts have enhanced capacity-building 
programmes, particularly within the Company’s social compliance and sourcing teams. This year, PDS also partnered with leading financial 
institutions to activate sustainability-linked financing, embedding ESG metrics into the Company’s funding frameworks
Looking ahead, PDS remains steadfast in its resolve to lead with purpose, partner for progress, and deliver measurable impact across its value chain. 
Journey toward a more sustainable and equitable future is not just a responsibility—it’s a shared commitment to the generations to come

sustainability risks. The Company conducts regular 
internal audits to ensure adherence to the SSC RS 
Policy and the Suppliers Code of Conduct. PDS 
prioritizes materials certified by standards such 
as Oeko-Tex® STeP and Made in Green, and has 
transitioned its man-made cellulosic fiber (MMCF) 
sourcing to Canopy Hot Button “Green Shirt” 
suppliers, reinforcing its commitment to verified, 
environmentally 
responsible, 
and 
transparent 
sourcing practices.
 
 
Several subsidiaries within the Group have set 
sourcing targets aimed at increasing the use of 
sustainable and recycled materials, including Better 
Cotton, recycled polyester, and sustainable man-
made cellulosic fibers. These targets are being 
pursued by entities such as Poeticgem, CSS, Good 
Earth Apparels, Grupo Sourcing, Krayons, Norlanka,

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) 
(b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
PDS operates as a global supply chain solutions partner, 
providing tailored solutions across the entire value chain 
to brands and retailers worldwide. Since the Company is a 
B2B business, manufacturing and sourcing for brands and 
retailers, reclaiming the end products is not feasible as they 
will be sold under the respective customer’s name.
However, PDS has implemented specific initiatives across 
subsidiaries to reduce plastic waste at source and promote 
circular recovery. At Sourcing Solutions, a complete ban 
on single-use polythene bags has eliminated associated 
plastic waste annually, reducing environmental footprint 
and marine pollution risks. Subsidiaries such as Krayons 
incorporate Repreve® polyester, made from recycled 
ocean-bound plastic bottles, into fabric blends—diverting 
waste from landfills and water bodies. In parallel, PDS 
Ventures supports Bloom Labs, which develops bioplastics 
from fibrous protein waste, enabling a scalable, bio-based 
alternative to traditional plastic inputs.
PDS is committed to enabling a circular economy across 
both production and product end-of-life. At Good Earth 
Apparels, cutting waste is collected, recycled into fibre, 
and woven into new fabrics—showcasing a closed-
loop model. Norlanka’s Centralised Cutting Plant, in 
partnership with Neptune Recyclers, improves material 
efficiency and ensures traceability of recycled output. 
Through PDS Ventures, the Group also invests in forward-
looking platforms that extend product life.

Currently, PDS does not conduct complete Product Life Cycle assessments. However, PDS’s partnership with Carbon Trail, 
an AI-powered sustainability platform, automates carbon accounting and enhances accuracy through API integrations. The 
platform uses primary data and metrics like the Higg Index for detailed accounting, covering Scope 1, 2, and product-related 
emissions, as well as water and energy consumption. It supports life cycle assessments for five key SKUs, covering stages 
such as raw materials acquisition and pre-processing, main fabric manufacturing, fabric manufacturing waste end-of-life, 
main fabric transport, assembly, and product manufacturing waste end-of-life.
Additionally, since over 600 of its supply chain partners are members of the Higg Index under the Wordly platform, this 
partnership will help scale up the Carbon Trail initiative to more products. As Cascale members, these partners are required 
to submit data for their facilities, enabling the tracking of their impact on energy, waste, water, and chemical management.

Action Taken
In the apparel and textile industry, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are pervasive across the value chain, particularly during 
raw material production, fabric processing, and logistics. At PDS, early-stage assessments using the Carbon Trail platform 
have provided greater visibility into the environmental impact of select products across key lifecycle phases—including raw 
material extraction, pre-processing, transport, and manufacturing waste. While not a full ISO-based Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA), the Carbon Trail pilot has enabled more accurate product-level emissions mapping using primary data, Higg Index 
benchmarks, and automated API integration. These insights are strengthening the Company’s decarbonisation roadmap 
and support it’s long-term ambition of achieving Net Zero by 2050, aligned with UNFCCC targets.
Additionally, textile waste from cutting and post-consumer disposal has been identified as a material concern, given its 
environmental implications. PDS is mitigating this through circular initiatives such as fibre-to-fabric recycling at GoodEarth 
Apparels Limited, upcycling unsold inventory at Upcycle Labs, and supporting second-life distribution platforms through 
investments in Yellow Octopus and Loop. These actions are aimed at reducing end-of-life impact and extending product 
lifespan.
PDS also continues to build governance mechanisms around responsible sourcing and social compliance, reinforced 
through its Supplier Code of Conduct and capacity-building engagements such as its FY 2024–25 collaboration with the 
International Labour Organization (ILO). These efforts are intended to align value chain partners with evolving expectations 
around labour practices and environmental responsibility.

management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system? 
b.
What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
 
 
PDS employs a systematic approach to identify work-
related hazards, which includes the following steps:
 
 
Hazard Identification: The first step involves 
identifying workplace hazards through methods 
such as workplace inspections, job hazard analysis, 
and review of incident reports.
 
 
Risk Assessment: After identifying hazards, the 
next step is to assess the risks associated with each 
hazard by evaluating the likelihood and severity of 
potential harm or injury.
Controls: Following risk assessment, PDS develops 
and implements controls to eliminate or minimize 
the risks. This includes reviewing existing controls 
for efficiency and devising new controls such as 
engineering controls, administrative controls, or the 
use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
 
 
Monitoring and Review: Regular monitoring and 
review of hazard controls are conducted to ensure 
their effectiveness and to identify any new hazards. 
This is achieved through workplace inspections, 
audits, or incident investigations.
 
 
Additionally, 
PDS 
has 
established 
multiple 
communication channels to enable employees 
and workers to report work-related hazards. These 
include direct reporting to designated safety officers, 
supervisors, or line managers at manufacturing sites. 
Workers may also escalate concerns to the human 
resources or production teams. Furthermore, the 
Company provides access to a confidential Ethics 
Hotline, ensuring that all stakeholders can report 
potential hazards or unsafe conditions without fear 
of retaliation.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
 
 
Yes, PDS has trained its employees and workers 
to use various communication channels to report 
work-related hazards:
Reporting to Designated Person: Each of PDS's 
manufacturing 
facilities 
has 
a 
safety 
officer, 
supervisor, or manager assigned to identify and 
resolve potential hazards. Workers can report 
hazards directly to these designated individuals.
 
 
Reporting to HR or Production Team: Workers also 
have the option to report hazards to the human 
resources department or the production team, 
who then coordinate with the designated person to 
address the hazard.
 
 
Whistleblowing Hotline: PDS 
has 
an 
Ethics 
Global Hotline Platform - https://pdsltd.com/
ethics-hotline/ where anonymous complaints can 
be lodged. Additionally, some partner factories 
have an industry hotline number for workers to 
report hazards. 
 
 
Grievance Box: Workers can submit a grievance to 
their employer if they believe a work-related hazard 
has not been properly addressed. This can be done 
by submitting a written grievance or utilizing a 
grievance box for submitting the same.
d.
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
 
 
PDS's manufacturing facilities are equipped with on-site medical officers and medical centers, ensuring that employees 
and workers have convenient access to comprehensive non-occupational medical and healthcare services. These 
facilities offer routine checkups, preventive care, and treatment for illnesses or injuries unrelated to work. The majority of 
employees are covered by a group medical insurance policy managed by the respective entities within the PDS Group.

Leadership Indicators
1.
Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders 
and 
the 
Board 
on 
economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
PDS's interaction with stakeholders is managed by 
department heads and business vertical heads. The 
Company has a dedicated Stakeholders' Relationship 
Committee tasked with overseeing all stakeholder 
communications. In addition to board committees, PDS 
has a team of industry experts who engage directly with 
the board on compliance, environmental, and social 
matters. Feedback and discussions from stakeholders 
undergo internal review by the respective Committees 
before being communicated to the Board.
2.
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support 
the identification and management of environmental 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details 
of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
Stakeholder consultation is integral to PDS for identifying 
and 
managing 
environmental 
and 
social 
issues. 
Through these engagements, PDS identifies areas 
with significant environmental and social impacts. The 
outcomes are deliberated with senior leadership and 
the board, informing PDS's ESG strategy. Sustainability 
and community initiatives at PDS are shaped by these 
stakeholder interactions, with comprehensive details 
accessible on the Company's website.
3.
Provide details of instances of engagement 
with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups.
PDS Limited recognises the unique challenges faced 
by marginalised communities, particularly underserved 
children, low-income women, and factory workers in 
developing regions. To address these concerns, the 
Company has implemented targeted initiatives across 
its global value chain, combining education, livelihood 
generation, and community wellbeing.
In India, the Soham for Kids Education Society in Mallapur, 
Hyderabad, supports over 200 children from low-
income families with free primary education, nutritious 
meals, health check-ups, and learning resources. The 
initiative also provides skills training in tailoring and 
IT to parents, promoting income diversification and 
intergenerational upliftment.
In Bangladesh, Soham for All—backed by Design Arc, 
Hope Foundation, and Matalan—extends this model by 
offering Bengali-medium education, English literacy, and 
computer skills to children of garment factory workers in 
Dhaka’s Savar region. The programme includes vocational 
training in industrial sewing for young adults and women, 
thereby enhancing employability and self-sufficiency.
In Sri Lanka, Norlanka supports educational inclusion 
through the SIP Arunella scholarship programme, which 
trained over 50 students for the Grade 5 examination. 
Additionally, 
Norlanka 
donated 
$6,000 
worth 
of 
school stationery to primary and secondary schools 
in Trincomalee, improving learning environments for

underprivileged students. The unit also distributed 
45 thermal jackets for infants lacking access to 
conventional healthcare.
In Hong Kong, PDS’s subsidiary Simple Approach 
collaborated with CSF to establish a multi-purpose 
community clubhouse in Sham Shui Po, benefitting 72 
families with access to therapy, educational support, and 
daily care services in a safe environment.
On the women empowerment front, Spring Near East in 
Turkey partnered with the Women’s Solidarity Foundation 
(KADAV) to transform 300 kg of surplus factory fabric 
into 1,000 upcycled tote bags, empowering local 
women artisans through training and dignified work. In 
Bangladesh, Poeticgem partnered with the Abinta Kabir 
Foundation to improve educational access and holistic 
development for girls.
Furthering workplace wellbeing, Good Earth Apparels 
operates the Apon Fair Shop within its Bangladesh factory 
premises. The initiative provides discounted access to 
essential goods and hygiene products—particularly 
benefiting women employees—thus easing household 
financial pressure and improving quality of life.
Together, these initiatives exemplify PDS’s commitment to 
inclusive development by responding to the distinct needs 
of vulnerable groups across its operating geographies, 
using education, economic opportunity, and healthcare 
access as key levers for empowerment.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
Yes. PDS has advanced its decarbonisation agenda through a blend of on-ground initiatives and innovation-led interventions. 
Guided by its sustainability pillar “Reduce Emissions,” the Company monitors Scope 1 and 2 emissions from owned factories 
and offices. In FY 2024-25, solar PV systems at Good Earth Apparels and Norlanka Manufacturing generated over 1.6 million 
kWh and avoiding 987.46 tCO₂e. In parallel, PDS restored 700+ mangrove plants in Sri Lanka, sequestering over 215,600 kg 
CO₂e to date as part of its nature-based mitigation strategy. 
At Progress Apparels (Bangladesh) Limited, the installation of an in-house wash plant has significantly reduced emissions 
associated with external transport. In parallel, the Company has piloted the Carbon Trail platform across five SKUs, enabling 
life cycle assessments by automating product-level emissions tracking and identifying high-impact processes such as 
spinning, knitting, and transport. Additionally, PDS promotes the adoption of Higg Facility Environmental Module (Higg 
FEM) among its manufacturing partners, facilitating structured assessments of environmental impacts including emissions 
enhancing transparency and accountability within the supply chain.
The Company has formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and is currently developing science-
aligned emissions targets through cross-functional stakeholder engagement and internal reviews. To address emissions from 
logistics and business travel, Poeticgem has adopted Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and partnered with Coco Travel and DHL 
for VCS-certified carbon offsetting. Emissions data is SGS-verified, with training integrated for relevant teams.

5 joint ventures and 5 associates located in India and overseas.
5.
Our assurance engagement is with respect to the Identified Sustainability Information for the reporting 
boundary as mentioned above for financial year ended 31 March 2025 only unless otherwise stated 
and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements 
included in the BRSR and therefore, do not express any opinion/conclusion thereon.
Criteria
6.
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is summarised 
below (hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’):
a.
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 
(‘LODR 
Regulations’) 
as 
amended, 
read 
with 
SEBI 
Master 
circular 
SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated 11 November 2024 and SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-
PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated 28 March 2025; and
b.
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 20 December 2024 read with 
BRSR Core Reporting Standard formulated by Industry Standards Forum.
Management’s Responsibilities
7.
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, 
related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of 
Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
Inherent limitations
8.
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities. 
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control
9.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
(‘IESBA’), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
10. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality 
management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
11. Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on BRSR Core 
Information and express a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on other selected indicators of 
BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, based on the procedures we have performed and evidence 
we have obtained. 
12. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Annual Report 2024-25 
183
Financial Statements
Corporate Overview
Statutory Report
Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the BRSR Core Information is prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria and limited assurance about whether the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information is free from material misstatement.
13. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the BRSR Core Information, assessing 
the risks of material misstatement of the BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the BRSR Core Information. 
14. A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of 
the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, identifying areas where 
material misstatement is likely to arise in the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core 
Information whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing procedures to address identified 
risk areas as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than Core Information. 
15. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal 
control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.
16. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records.
17. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
x
Conducted virtual site visits at the manufacturing facility of Norlanka Progress (Private) Limited, 
for data and document verification. 
x
Carried out discussions at the corporate office and manufacturing facilities for data and document 
verification; 
x
Interviewed senior executives to understand the reporting process, governance, systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period. 
x
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by the Company to support relevant performance 
disclosures within our scope.
x
Evaluated the suitability and application of Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied 
appropriately to the Identified Sustainability Information.
x
Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables 
and agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as 
source data, meter data, etc.
x
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims, 
x
Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available, 
x
Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the 
report.

x
Reviewed and verified information/ data as per the Criteria;
x
Reviewed accuracy, transparency and completeness of the information/ data provided;
18. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion on BRSR Core Information.
19. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are 
less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have 
been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express 
a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR 
Core Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Exclusions:
20. Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion 
or conclusion on the same: 
x
Aspects of the BRSR and data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information.
x
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in paragraph 2 to 4 above on Scope of 
Assurance
x
Data and information outside the defined reporting period
x
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages expressed in 
Identified Sustainability Information.
x
The Company’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, 
forward looking statements provided by the Company and assertions related to Intellectual Property 
Rights and other competitive issues.
x
Mapping of Identified Sustainability Information with reporting frameworks other than those 
mentioned in Criteria above.
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature 
and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on 
internal controls.
The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.
Opinion
21. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core 
Information included in the BRSR report for the financial year ended 31 March 2025 is prepared in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. 
Conclusion
22. Based on the procedures performed and evidences obtained and the information and explanations 
given to us along with the representation provided by the management, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core 
Information included in the BRSR report for the year ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in all 
material respects in accordance with the Criteria.
