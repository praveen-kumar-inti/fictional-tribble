Technological 
Advancements 
and Innovation
Opportunity
Identifying and capitalizing on 
technological advancements 
and fostering innovation 
can give Zen Technologies 
Limited a competitive edge, 
leading to the development 
of cutting-edge products and 
services, increased market 
share, and improved customer 
satisfaction.
NA
Potential revenue 
growth, cost savings 
through improved 
efficiency, and 
increased profitability.
2
Government 
Regulations 
and Policies
Risk and  
Opportunity
Adherence to government 
regulations is critical to 
avoid penalties and maintain 
a favourable business 
environment. On the other 
hand, favourable policies can 
present opportunities for 
Zen Technologies Limited to 
secure government contracts 
and incentives.
Stay informed about 
changing regulations, 
maintain compliance, 
and actively engage with 
policymakers for favourable 
policies.
Non-compliance 
may lead to fines and 
reputational damage, 
while compliance 
can lead to increased 
business opportunities 
and potential cost 
savings.
3
Geopolitical  
and Economic   
Stability
Risk and  
Opportunity
Zen Technologies Limited's 
operations may be affected 
by geopolitical tensions and 
economic fluctuations in 
different regions where it 
operates or sells its products.
Diversify markets, assess 
geopolitical risks, and 
implement risk management 
strategies.
Instability can lead to 
market volatility and 
impact revenue, while 
stability can provide 
growth opportunities in 
stable markets.
4
Customer 
Satisfaction 
and Retention
Opportunity
Satisfied customers are 
more likely to be loyal and 
recommend Zen Technologies 
Limited's products and 
services to others, leading to 
increased sales and a positive 
brand image.
NA

retention can lead 
to higher recurring 
revenue and reduced 
marketing costs 
for acquiring new 
customers.
5
Cybersecurity  
and Data Privacy
Risk
As a technology company 
dealing with sensitive data, the 
risk of cybersecurity breaches 
and data privacy violations 
can lead to legal liabilities, 
reputational damage, and 
financial losses.
Implement robust 
cybersecurity measures, 
conduct regular security 
audits, and comply with data 
protection regulations.
Data breaches can 
result in financial 
losses, legal penalties, 
and damage to the 
company's reputation.
6
Talent Acquisition 
and Retention
Opportunity 
and Risk
Attracting and retaining skilled 
and talented employees is 
crucial for the company's 
growth and success. On the 
other hand, high employee 
turnover can lead to increased 
recruitment costs and loss of 
valuable expertise
Offer competitive 
compensation packages, 
career development 
opportunities, and foster a 
positive work culture.
Effective talent 
management can 
result in increased 
productivity and 
reduced recruitment 
costs, while high 
turnover can lead to 
higher expenses and 
lower productivity.

7
Supply 
Chain Disruption
Risk
Identifying the risk of supply 
chain disruption is crucial as it 
can lead to production delays, 
increased costs, and customer 
dissatisfaction.
The company maintains 
a diversified supplier 
base, conducts regular 
risk assessments, and 
establishes contingency 
plans to mitigate supply chain 
disruptions. Collaborative 
relationships with suppliers 
and real-time monitoring 
also contribute to timely 
responses to potential 
disruptions.
Proper risk 
management helps 
minimize financial 
losses associated 
with supply chain 
disruptions, such as 
production downtime 
and increased 
operational expenses.
8
Capacity or  
Infrastructure  
Constraint
Opportunity 
and Risk
Recognizing capacity or 
infrastructure constraints 
is essential to ensure 
optimal resource allocation 
and prevent operational 
bottlenecks that may impede 
growth.
The company continuously 
invests in capacity 
expansion and infrastructure 
development based on 
demand forecasts. This 
proactive approach enables 
seamless operations and 
supports business growth. 
Additionally, partnerships 
and collaborations can help 
address temporary capacity 
constraints.
Adequate capacity 
and infrastructure 
planning enhance 
operational efficiency, 
reduce disruptions, 
and support revenue 
growth by meeting 
customer demands 
effectively.
9
Dependence on 
Outsourcing to 
External Vendors 
for Manufacturing 
Sub-systems
Opportunity 
and Risk
Recognizing the dependence 
on external vendors for 
manufacturing sub-systems 
helps assess potential 
risks to quality control, 
delivery timelines, and cost 
fluctuations, as well as 
opportunities for collaboration 
and innovation.
The company employs 
stringent vendor selection 
criteria, quality control 
processes, and regular 
performance assessments to 
ensure consistent and reliable 
supply. Exploring strategic 
partnerships and joint 
development initiatives can 
also enhance collaboration 
with vendors.
Effective vendor 
management 
contributes to 
stable costs, high-
quality products, and 
innovation, positively 
impacting the 
company's financial 
performance.
10
Financial Risk - 
Timely Availability 
of Fund Based 
and Non-fund 
Based Finance
Risk
Recognizing financial risks 
associated with the timely 
availability of fund-based and 
non-fund-based finance is 
crucial to ensure uninterrupted 
business operations and 
growth plans.
The company maintains 
strong banking relationships, 
diversifies funding sources, 
and regularly assesses 
financial requirements. 
Developing contingency 
plans and optimizing working 
capital management help 
mitigate the risk of financial 
constraints.
Effective financial 
risk management 
safeguards against 
potential cash flow 
disruptions, penalties, 
and missed growth 
opportunities, ensuring 
the company's financial 
stability, and supporting 
strategic initiatives.

2. a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
No, the entity does not currently have formal procedures specifically dedicated to sustainable sourcing. However, sustainability is 
an important value for Zen Technologies, and we are actively integrating sustainable practices into our operations. We are committed 
to adopting responsible sourcing practices in the future to minimize environmental impacts, uphold ethical standards, and contribute 
positively to the communities and regions from which we source our materials.
While formal procedures are not yet in place, we are taking steps towards sustainability. For instance, a study by The Energy and Resources 
Institute (TERI), supported by Zen Technologies, highlighted significant environmental and economic benefits of using simulators for 
military training. According to TERI’s analysis, the use of simulators can result in substantial cost savings and a significant reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions over time.
We are dedicated to improving our practices to align with sustainable sourcing principles and industry best practices, and we are working 
towards developing formal procedures to meet the expectations of our stakeholders.

As part of our commitment to environmental responsibility, Zen Technologies acknowledges the importance of Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) for electronic waste and plastic waste generated by our products. We understand that once the simulators are sold, 
they do not come back to the company, making it challenging to reclaim the products.
At present, we do not have a dedicated mechanism to recycle the products and waste.
