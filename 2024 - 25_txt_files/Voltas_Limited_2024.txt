Business 
Ethics
Risk
Failure to adhere to business 
ethics can result in significant risks 
for a Company. If a Company is 
found to be engaging in unethical 
behaviour, it can damage the 
Company’s reputation and erode 
public trust creating a loss of 
customers, investors, and other 
stakeholders.
The Company adheres to the 
Tata Code of Conduct, which 
serves as a guide to each 
employee and the entire value 
chain, on the standards of 
values, ethics, and business 
principles. The Whistle Blower 
Policy of the Company provides

to approach the Chairman 
of Board Audit Committee/ 
Ethics Counsellor and disclose 
information that may evidence 
unethical or improper activity 
concerning the Company.

11
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Strong corporate governance 
enables the Company to 
build stakeholder trust, ensure 
regulatory compliance, and

confidence, and supports long-
term value creation.
NA
Positive
12
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Inadequate corporate governance 
can lead to non-compliance 
with legal requirements, 
mismanagement, and loss of 
stakeholder trust. This could result 
in reputational damage, financial 
penalties, and decreased access to 
investment.
•   Strengthening board 
independence and diversity
•   Implementation of 
transparent audit practices
•   Regular training on 
governance and ethical 
practices
Negative
13
Environmental 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Rising global demand for energy-
efficient appliances, stricter 
regulatory norms (like BEE star 
ratings, SEER standards), and 
increasing electricity prices have 
made energy-efficient AC systems 
a market differentiator. Designing 
high-efficiency products aligns 
with both environmental 
responsibility and consumer 
demand.

reporting on ESG metrics for our value chain; adapting to new technologies as well technology availability at a competitive

products and processes that are energy efficient; initiating life cycle assessments of some of our products; promoting products 
and services that help in lowering environmental impact; ensuring health and safety of our workforce; partnering with waste

redundancy built into the HVAC System, in the form of standby units. Through periodic Preventive Maintenance Services 
as well as by Remote Monitoring of Chillers (under AMC, wherever permitted by customer) all the AC equipment, including 
standby units, it is insured that all these are always functional. Therefore, enables zero disruption even in cases of breakdown 
due to unforeseen circumstances.
	
•

and marked Centres.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION 
IN VOLTAS LIMITED’S BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
To the Board of Directors of Voltas Limited
1.	
We have undertaken to perform a reasonable assurance engagement, for Voltas Limited (“the Company”) vide our engagement 
agreement dated May 24, 2025, in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed in the “Identified Sustainability Information” 
paragraph below in accordance with the criteria stated in the “Criteria” paragraph below. The identified Sustainability Information 
is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”). This engagement was conducted by a 
multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and specialists.
Identified Sustainability Information
2.	
The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended March 31, 2025 is BRSR Core (sub-set of BRSR), the attributes of which 
are summarised in Appendix 1 to this report. The Reporting Boundary for BRSR is on Standalone basis as disclosed under Question 
No. 13 of the BRSR.
3.	
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information only and we have 
not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR (i.e. non- BRSR Core 
attributes) and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
Criteria
4.	
The Criteria used by the company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
	
i.	
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 
Regulations, 2015 as amended;
	
ii.	
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/
PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, and Industry Standard on Reporting BRSR Core per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/
CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated December 20, 2024.
Management’s Responsibility
5.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability 
Information including the reporting boundary of BRSR, disclosing environmental information basis operational control approach, taking 
into account applicable laws and regulations including the SEBI circular, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s compliance with the requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the BRSR Core.
Inherent limitations
6.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.
7.	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to inherent measurement 
uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint, embracing circularity (waste management). Obtaining 
sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and attributes.
Our Independence and Quality Control
8.	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, 
and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
Annual Report 2024-25
46
9.	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of

11.	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000,

Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the Identified Sustainability Information are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting 
Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances.

by performing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal controls.
	
•	
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures. Performed substantive testing on a sample basis of the 
Identified Sustainability Information to verify that the data had been appropriately measured with the underlying documents

records and recalculation on a sample basis.

standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025 and the underlying trial balance.

the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information.
