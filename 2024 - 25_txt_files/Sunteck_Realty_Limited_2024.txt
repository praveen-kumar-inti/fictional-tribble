Green 
Buildings
Risk & 
Opportunity
Green building certification 
offers 
both 
risks 
and 
opportunities.
Risk: 
Achieving 
green 
building 
certification 
involves 
complying 
with 
defined 
guidelines, 
technical 
standards, 
and 
documentation 
protocols. 
This 
process 
can 
be 
challenging 
and 
resource-intensive. 
The 
complexity 
of 
aligning 
project specifications with 
certification 
criteria 
often 
requires 
additional 
time 
and expertise, underscoring 
the importance of capacity-
building 
and 
training 
to 
support 
successful 
implementation. 
Opportunity: 
Green 
buildings 
offer 
significant 
long-term 
benefits 
by 
reducing 
energy 
consumption, 
optimizing 
water usage, and lowering 
maintenance costs, resulting 
in substantial savings that 
offset initial investments over 
time. In addition to financial 
advantages, these buildings 
prioritize occupant health 
and 
well-being 
through 
features such as enhanced 
indoor air quality, abundant 
natural lighting, and access 
to green spaces. Collectively, 
these elements contribute 
to 
improved 
productivity, 
greater occupant satisfaction, 
and a higher overall quality 
of life. 
The Company’s head office 
is LEED certified (achieved 
Gold Certification).
Four of the current projects 
are EDGE pre-certified while 
the EDGE pre-certification 
is in-progress for two of its 
ongoing projects.

Carbon 
Footprint
Risk
Monitoring and managing 
carbon emissions is crucial 
for regulatory compliance, 
operational efficiency, and 
stakeholder alignment. By

standards, 
lowers 
energy-
related 
expenses, 
and 
demonstrates its commitment 
to sustainable development 
and climate responsibility.

Employee 
wellbeing and 
development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Real estate companies often 
experience high employee 
turnover, making employee 
well-being and development 
critical 
metrics 
for 
our 
organization. Striking the right 
balance in prioritizing these 
key performance indicators 
is essential to fostering a 
stable, motivated, and high-
performing workforce
Providing 
resources 
and 
support 
systems—such 
as 
stress

workshops, 
wellness 
programs, and Employee 
Assistance 
Programs—is 
essential to help employees 
effectively 
manage 
stress 
and maintain their overall 
well-being

Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk and 
Opportunity
Assessing 
supply 
chain 
sustainability 
is 
vital 
to 
ensure responsible sourcing, 
verify that materials meet 
environmental 
and 
social 
standards, 
and 
minimize 
risks related to disruptions. 
It also enables to monitor 
and track Scope 3 emissions 
associated with our supply 
chain activities.
Based on the supply chain 
assessment 
conducted,

and 
mitigate 
potential 
risks,

enables 
the Company to prevent 
reputational damage, avoid

10 Climate 
Change
Risk
Given 
the 
emission-
intensive 
nature 
of 
the 
sector, failing to address 
emissions poses significant 
risks 
for 
our 
company. 
These 
include 
potential 
reputational 
damage, 
regulatory 
penalties, 
and 
increased 
operational 
costs. Proactively managing 
emissions 
is 
therefore 
essential 
to

7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
At Sunteck Realty Limited, we believe that ‘purpose’ fuels ‘progress’. Guided by our core purpose to Building for 
a Better Tomorrow, we strive to create long-term, meaningful positive impacts across the communities we serve 
and the environment we inhabit.
At the heart of this purpose lies our dedication to eco-conscious living – a philosophy that seamlessly integrates 
urban development with environmental stewardship. Sustainability is not an ancillary effort; it is central to 
our strategic vision. As we shape the future of real estate, we remain focussed to ensuring that every project 
contributes not just to economic value, but also ecological and social well-being.
The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the current 
consequences of 1.1°C of global warming, emphasizing the continuous rise in global greenhouse gas emissions. 
The report cautions us that warming is likely to surpass 1.5°C during the 21st century, underscoring the urgency 
for immediate and collaborative action from governments, businesses, and civil society. In response, governments 
around the world are enacting legislation to hasten the transition to net-zero emissions. This includes India’s 
ambitious focus made at COP26 and the Green Deal Industrial Plan (GDIP) in the European Union, all signalling 
a rapid escalation in climate change initiatives.
However, the scale and urgency of the climate crisis demand more than intent; they require deeper collaboration 
— across industries, governments, and communities, across borders and sectors. Only through collective and 
coordinated action we can achieve lasting impact. 
At Sunteck, sustainability is defining lens through which we view value creation. As we present our fourth 
Sustainability Report, I am proud to reflect on our continued efforts to integrating environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) principles into every facet of our operations. Our efforts align closely with India’s national 
sustainability goals, which emphasize the importance of eco-friendly practices, resource efficiency, social 
inclusivity, and governance.
We have integrated these objectives into our operational strategies. In recognition of the critical importance 
of eco-conscious real estate, we have ensured that all our development projects achieve Green Building 
certification, supporting India’s goal of reducing carbon emissions. Our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint 
are evident through the adoption of renewable energy, utilization of recycled materials, water management 
initiatives, and structured waste recycling partnerships. 
This year, to deepen our focus on climate resilience we also conducted climate risk assessment across our 
portfolio. The insights are now shaping out adaptive strategies – from resilient construction design to energy 
efficient operations – ensuring that developments remain sustainable in rapidly changing environment. Equally 
important is our dedication towards responsible business practices. As part of our Human Rights Assessment, 
we evaluated potential risks across our value chain, including labour conditions, community displacement, and 
health and safety standards.
Due to our remarkable strides in our sustainability initiatives, we have been recognized through a fabulous 
GRESB score of 96 and a score of 60 in the CSA DJSI.
Throughout our journey, Sunteck Realty has consistently upheld a strong focus on governance. Trust is the 
bedrock of our achievements, and we are dedicated to earning and preserving the trust of all our stakeholders. 
Our emphasis on governance, financial discipline, and effective communication has propelled us to excel one of 
the well-known face in Mumbai’s real estate market.

As we navigate the intersection of urban transformation and climate action, we intend not only to adapt, but to

powered by partnerships and propelled by purpose. The future we're building shines brighter because it's 
sustainable by design, inclusive by intention, and transformative by action. This is our pledge: To build with 
such purpose and passion that future generations will look back at this moment as the pivotal point – when 
sustainability stopped being an initiative and became a share legacy.

dimensions such as personnel safety, environmental protection, process integrity, chemical handling, 
transportation safety, and asset reliability. With a skilled workforce and responsible contractors, the 
Company implements proactive measures to eliminate hazards, mitigate risks, and prevent incidents.
	
To institutionalize this approach, Sunteck establishes a dedicated Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA) team at each project site. These teams are tasked with developing comprehensive, site-specific plans 
for identifying hazards, assessing risks and opportunities, and implementing control measures. Routine 
inspections are conducted to monitor deviations in operations and evaluate safety across multiple domains, 
including facility safety, occupational health, chemical management, fire prevention, and equipment 
integrity.

process that encourages workers to proactively report any safety-related concerns or inconveniences 
to the site team and designated safety managers. Each project site is equipped with safety officers who 
maintain a formal incident reporting system, while safety managers ensure that all reported observations 
are addressed through appropriate corrective and preventive actions.
	
To further promote open communication, suggestion boxes have been installed at all sites, allowing workers 
to submit feedback, complaints, or suggestions in their local language. These inputs are reviewed weekly 
by the site safety team to ensure timely resolution and continuous improvement in workplace safety. 
d. 	 Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? 
	
Sunteck Realty Limited recognizes that employee well-being extends beyond physical health, embracing 
a holistic work culture that prioritizes mental and emotional wellness. All employees have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services through a range of initiatives, including stress management 
sessions, ergonomics workshops, health check-up camps, and women’s wellness programs. The Company 
also offers comprehensive parental and maternity leave benefits to both male and female employees, along 
with health insurance and coverage under the Group Accidental Policy (GAP).

Sunteck Realty Limited recognizes that the overall physical and mental well-being of its employees is fundamental

corporate offices and development sites have access to comprehensive health and safety services.

spaces to strengthen employees’ connection to nature and encourage social interaction, ultimately enhancing 
emotional well-being. A dedicated health and safety training program was also conducted at the Head Office 
and site locations to reinforce safe practices and promote a culture of care among all employees.

1. 	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
	
The management maintains consistent engagement with key stakeholder groups through structured interaction 
channels. A range of mechanisms are employed to analyze, plan, and execute stakeholder-related initiatives, 
ensuring their interests are effectively integrated into organizational objectives. This stakeholder-centric approach 
forms the foundation for strategic development and decision-making. Additionally, designated departments 
within the Company act as intermediaries between stakeholders and the Board, facilitating the communication 
of any material concerns or inputs.
2. 	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from 
stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.

and social topics for FY2024-25.
	
The Company conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment in FY2023-24 involving its key stakeholders, 
including customers, employees, suppliers, contractors, investors, banks, and NGOs. This process enabled the 
identification of material topics central to Sunteck’s sustainability strategy.
	
Building upon those insights, Sunteck has actively incorporated stakeholder inputs into ongoing initiatives 
throughout FY2024-25. The identified issues continue to guide operational planning, ensuring alignment with 
evolving stakeholder expectations. Regular consultations are held with these groups to gather feedback and 
new perspectives, which are integrated into the Company’s management approach.

3. 	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
	
Our in-house CSR and ESG team actively engage with local communities to gain a deep understanding of their 
challenges. Under Sunteck Saathi program, we have conducted various initiatives as follows:
	
Initiative I: Shelter with Care
	
As part of our measure towards community welfare, we extended our support to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI), a pioneering facility founded under Dr. Aabaji Thatte Sewa Aur Anusandhan Sanstha (Trust). This 
contribution aids in the establishment of a residential complex designed to offer affordable accommodation 
to families and caregivers of patients receiving cancer treatment at NCI. The initiative aligns with our belief in 
compassionate infrastructure and its dedication to sustainable, health-focused philanthropy.
	
Initiative II: Bridges to Recovery
	
At the heart of our community efforts lies a belief in equal access to quality healthcare. We extended support to 
Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children (BJWHC)—a trusted institution offering advanced neonatal and pediatric 
care to families across socio-economic backgrounds. Recognizing the increasing need for pediatric bone 
marrow transplants, we contributed to help establish a new step-down Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit. Our 
contribution enabled vital infrastructure expansion, enhancing post-transplant care and reinforcing BJWHC’s 
life-saving work. Through this initiative, we continue to nurture healthier futures for children in need.
	
Initiative III: Classrooms of Change
	
Education is more than a steppingstone—it’s a catalyst for transformation. Our CSR efforts reflect this belief, 
driving us to support Bhattarak Yashkirti Shikshan Sansthan and Sanskruti Yuva Pratishthan Trust in their mission 
to build inclusive learning environments. From establishing state-of-the-art classrooms and skill development 
spaces, to upgrading campus infrastructure and recreational facilities, our contribution to their corpus funds 
helps bridge educational gaps in underserved communities.
	
Our aim is to foster a culture of opportunity—one where every child has the tools to learn, thrive, and imagine a 
better future.
