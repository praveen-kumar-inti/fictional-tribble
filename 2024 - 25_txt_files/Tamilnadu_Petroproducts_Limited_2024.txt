and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying

Financial implications 
of the risk or

positive or negative 
implications)
 1
Carbon 
Emission - Risk 
& Opportunity
CO2 emissions contribute 
to climate change. The 
carbon 
footprint 
of 
a 
product directly influences 
the emissions associated 
with 
customers. 
Failing 
to meet decarbonisation 
commitments 
can 
lead 
to 
reputational 
risks.
Organisations 
across 
industries are transitioning 
to cleaner energy sources, 
and 
consumers 
are 
increasingly 
choosing 
low-carbon 
alternatives.
-	
Adoption 
and 
continuous 
monitoring of decarbonisation 
initiatives.
-	
Create 
a 
roadmap 
for 
achieving net zero and begin 
implementing the committed 
actions.
Some 
activities 
are 
cost-effective, offering a 
positive financial return 
on investment. However, 
certain investments have 
prohibitively high costs, 
resulting in a negative 
financial impact.
2
Toxic 
Emissions - 
Risk
Toxic emissions can cause 
significant harm to the 
Company by resulting in 
financial losses, increased 
operational 
costs, 
legal 
challenges, 
reputational 
damage, 
regulatory 
complications etc.
Various steps are taken to handle 
Toxic Emissions proactively and 
effectively to ensure zero emission 
to environment.
1.	
Draining is only through closed 
piping systems to a Recovery 
drum, with fluids recycled back 
into the process.
2.	
Venting is directed solely to a 
closed header for safe disposal 
via a flare system.
3.	
Hydrocarbon & Gas detectors 
are installed at vulnerable areas 
within the unit, to promptly 
deduct any leakage and enable 
immediate corrective actions.
4.	
Leak Detection and Repair 
(LDAR) surveys are performed 
at periodic intervals to detect 
and rectify fugitive emissions.
5.	
Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) are established, and 
appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) is provided to 
all employees and Workmen.
6.	
Regular safety training sessions 
are conducted to enhance 
employee 
awareness 
and 
preparedness.
The financial impact is 
negative due to the high 
costs associated with 
investments in pollution 
control and monitoring 
equipment.

Hazardous 
Waste and 
Wastewater 
management 
- Risk
Inadequate management of 
hazardous waste can lead 
to several consequences, 
including:
-	
Contamination of soil 
and water resources
-	
Fines and penalties 
for 
regulatory 
non-
compliance
-	
Increased liability risk 
due to improper waste 
disposal
-	
Increased operational 
costs associated with 
the 
mitigation 
and 
remediation efforts
-	
Closure of facility in 
the event of gross violations
Hazardous 
waste 
generated 
is 
securely stored in designated areas.
Valid documentation for authorising 
generation and storage and disposal 
is maintained.
Disposal is carried out exclusively 
through authorized reclaimers.
Annual 
reports 
are 
submitted 
in 
compliance 
with 
regulatory 
requirements.
Two manufacturing units (LAB and 
Caustic) are equipped with Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities.
M/s NEERI is conducting a feasibility 
study for the implementation of ZLD 
at the third unit (PO).
The financial impact is 
negative due to the high 
operating costs associated 
with 
hazardous 
waste 
management 
and 
the 
significant 
investments 
required for waste recycling.
However, there is a positive 
environmental impact, as 
wastewater treatment and 
recycling contribute to the 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources.
4
Opportunities 
in Clean 
Technology – 
Opportunity
Adopting clean technology 
is 
an 
opportunity 
for 
environmental 
protection 
and to remain sustainable. 
Optimum 
usage 
of 
renewable 
power 
and 
alternatives 
for 
liquid 
fuels like LPG, LNG can 
contribute significantly to 
a 
cleaner 
environment, 
enhanced energy efficiency 
and the conservation of 
natural resources.
Not applicable
Positive Embracing clean 
technology 
provides 
the 
company 
with 
opportunities 
for, 
cost savings, regulatory 
compliance, 
reputation 
enhancement, 
resilience 
to market shifts and long-
term sustainability. These 
benefits can contribute to 
the Company’s success 
and 
competitiveness 
in 
a 
changing 
business 
landscape.

Labour 
Management 
- Risk
In today’s changing times 
workforce expectations 
are constantly changing 
and Inability to meet 
with 
the 
workforce 
expectations may impact 
the Company’s retention 
rate 
and 
eventually 
affect 
the 
business 
continuity hence causing 
reputational risk as well 
as productivity issues. 
It is also vital to ensure 
safe working conditions 
for the workforce and 
compliance to all safety 
measure 
mandated 
by 
the 
regulators. 
Considering 
the 
manufacturing 
industry 
with the huge number of 
workforce it’s important 
to 
have 
a 
welfare 
monitoring and tracking 
system.
Ineffective 
labour 
management can result 
in reduced productivity 
due to disputes and 
strikes, increased legal 
expenses, 
inefficient 
utilisation 
of 
labour 
higher operational costs, 
elevated labour turnover 
rates, and damage to the 
company’s reputation.
Failure to adapt to the 
evolving 
expectations 
of workforce can lead to 
challenges in employee 
retention, 
productivity 
issues and workplace 
safety.
Implement 
robust 
welfare 
programs with mechanisms to 
regularly monitor and enhance 
job satisfaction.
Establish an effective and timely 
grievance redressal system.
Foster a work environment that 
supports 
a 
healthy 
work-life 
balance for employees.
Communicate the Company’s 
vision 
clearly 
and 
create 
opportunities 
that 
highlight 
each 
employee’s 
value 
and 
contribution.
Ensure 
Compliance 
with 
regulatory requirements while 
striving to exceed standards 
related to employee safety and 
welfare.
Negative 
due 
to 
increased 
operating 
costs.

Chemical 
Safety - Risk
The lack of adequate 
chemical safety measures 
can result in potential 
costs related to accidents, 
causing damage to men 
and 
materials, 
legal 
liabilities, 
regulatory 
penalties, and reputational 
damage to the Company.
Given 
the 
nature 
of 
chemicals 
handled 
such 
as 
flammables, 
toxic 
substance, 
and 
carcinogens, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
maintain 
strict vigilance along with 
regular maintenance and 
adherence to established 
systems and procedures. 
Any 
lapse 
in 
these 
precautions can result in 
serious incidents.
Multi-level safety features are 
incorporated in plant design.
Plant operations are managed 
through 
a 
highly 
automated 
Distributed 
Digital 
Control 
System (DDCS) with sufficient 
warning 
signals 
and 
auto-
shutdown facility to address any 
abnormality.
Mechanical protection devices 
and final control elements like 
Safety 
valves, 
relief 
valves, 
rupture disks are installed as 
required to safely vent to Flare 
system.
Comprehensive safety protocols 
such as Hazard Identification and 
Operability Studies (HAZOP), 
risk 
assessments, 
mitigation 
plans, and change management 
processes are firmly established.
All employees handling chemicals 
are given sufficient training / 
ongoing training with regard 
to the properties of chemicals, 
handling procedure, spill control, 
proper usage of PPEs etc.
Chemical 
transport 
vehicles 
undergo 
rigorous 
inspections 
using checklists to ensure the 
availability of essential tools, 
trem cards, and that drivers are 
properly trained.
Negative 
as 
investments to deploy 
latest tools and system 
to ensure chemical 
safety is high.
Positive 
as 
safe 
chemical plant always 
puts the Organisation 
in a better position 
among 
industrial 
peers.
