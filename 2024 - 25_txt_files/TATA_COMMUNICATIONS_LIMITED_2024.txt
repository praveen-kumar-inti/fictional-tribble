a.	
Employees and workers (including differently abled):5
	
b.	
Differently abled Employees and workers:
	
	
Note: 
	
	
1)	
Boundary: Tata Communications' global headcount includes employees of its wholly owned subsidiaries reflecting the 
Company’s consolidated approach to workforce reporting.
	
	
2)	
Workforce Classification: Tata Communications classifies its entire workforce under the category of 'Employees.' This includes:
 
 
Permanent Employees: Individuals on the payroll of Tata Communications Limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 
including non-executive employees who transitioned from VSNL to Tata Communications’ payroll.
 
 
Other than Permanent Employees: Contractual personnel engaged through third-party agencies.
	
	
3)	
Worker category disclosure: Tata Communications does not report separately on the ‘Workers’ category as defined under the 
BRSR framework, primarily because the nature of its operations is service-oriented and technology-driven. The organization 
predominantly employs a white-collar workforce under professional roles, either directly or through third-party arrangements. 
Given this context, the conventional classification of 'Workers' (typically associated with manufacturing or industrial setups) 
has limited applicability. Consequently, data is maintained and disclosed under the broader 'Employee' category, in line with 
how workforce management and HR systems are structured within the Company.
	
	
4)	
Gender Identity Disclosure: Two permanent employees chose not to disclose their gender identity during the reporting year. 
These employees have been included under the Others “Permanent (E)” category in the relevant disclosures.
	
	
5)	
Historical data: Tata Communications has initiated the process of capturing data related to differently abled employees from 
FY 2024-25. New fields have been added to include both existing and future employees. This disclosure remains optional and 
is based on voluntary self-declaration by employees.

Data Privacy 
and IP 
infringement 
Risk 
This material issue poses a risk to 
the business and must be effectively 
addressed as Tata Communications 
relies on networks to handle data and 
information for its solutions, including 
cloud, IoT, mobility, collaboration, 
security, and network services. 
Therefore, preserving data integrity 
and avoiding breaches will enhance our 
brand value and reputation among our 
stakeholders in addition to shielding us 
from possible financial repercussions. 
Strong framework, 
procedures, guidelines, 
and controls for 
data privacy ensures 
mitigation of data 
privacy issues. 
Furthermore, multi-
layered governance 
framework that is 
overseen by the Board 
and the executives 
ensures effective 
readiness to address 
and mitigate them. 
Frequent trainings and 
awareness campaigns 
combined with a strict 
methodology for 
managing consequences 
is imparted to employees 
to identify, manage and 
mitigate any further risks.

Yes. Tata Communications has implemented a Sustainable Supply Chain Framework (‘SSCF’) that integrates

This question is not applicable to Tata Communications as the Company is a digital solutions provider and does not 
manufacture, sell, or handle physical products that require end-of-life management processes such as reuse, recycling, 
or disposal. Consequently, Tata Communications does not generate plastics (including packaging), e-waste, hazardous 
waste, or other product-related waste that would necessitate reclamation processes. Our environmental focus is on 
minimizing operational impacts through energy efficiency, resource conservation, and sustainable practices within our 
service delivery.
4.

If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
As per the latest regulations, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for plastics and e-waste is not applicable to Tata 
Communications, as the Company does not manufacture, import, or sell products covered under these categories. However, 
EPR for batteries is applicable, and Tata Communications complies fully with all related regulatory requirements, including 
the submission and implementation of the battery waste collection plan as mandated by the Pollution Control Boards.

Based on the different types of stakeholders the Company engages with, Tata Communications has established systems 
to gather feedback from each of the identified groups and inform the Board and Committees during their meetings. As per 
the nature, frequency and mode of communication with the set of stakeholders, the Company collects and consolidates

received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Tata Communications emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement in shaping its strategic direction, 
particularly through the Materiality Assessment process. This approach enables the Company to identify and prioritize 
key environmental and social issues, leading to the development of targeted initiatives and measurable goals aligned with 
stakeholder expectations.
	
The Company’s sustainability objectives are continuously refined based on ongoing stakeholder feedback and are

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (‘BRSR’)
	
Following are some projects at Tata Communications related to GHG emission reduction: 
	
1)	
Supply Chain Climate Action Framework: We rolled out Supply Chain Climate Action Framework with the aim to support 
Tata Communications in its ambition to work with responsible suppliers and contribute positively to its climate action 
goal of Net Zero by 2035. The intended result of this framework is for the suppliers of the Company to complete their 
GHG inventory, respond to CDP and formulate Science-based emission reduction targets. Engagement scope includes 
361 suppliers contributing to ~70% of SCM Managed Procurement spend with categorization in three GHG maturity levels. 
	
2)	
Enhancing Energy Efficiency: Tata Communications prioritises energy efficiency by streamlining operations, 
exploring IoT usage, and switching to LED lighting. The Indian operations team enhances HVAC, SMPS, and UPS 
effectiveness, reducing costs and energy consumption. Best practices include setting the air conditioner to 24 
degrees and installing grill tiles in front of the Active Equipment Rack. These efforts reflect our sustained commitment 
to optimizing energy efficiency and raising sustainability awareness across all our global operations. In FY 2024-25, 
169 energy efficiency projects were implemented. This led to total cumulative energy savings of 9.8 million kwh with 
cost savings of C 10.1 crore. Link 
	
3)	
Making a Switch to Renewable Energy: A significant portion of our global electricity requirement is derived 
from renewable energy sources. This is in line with our commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting 
sustainable practices. In the years ahead, we will continue to focus on exploring new avenues to increase the share 
of renewable energy in our energy mix. In FY 2024-25, the RE contribution in the overall operations has increased to 
34% from 27% in FY 2024 with the addition of 20.69 MU of new projects. These projects include VSB Chennai: 4.2 
MU, LVSB Mumbai :11.6 MU, VSB Mumbai: 3 MU, Dighi Pune : 1.8 MU and VSB Cochin: 0.09 MU. Link
	
4)	
Decarbonization of Operations: Recognising the detrimental effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, we are committed to adopting operational enhancements that lower our GHG intensity. We have 
laid the foundation for targeted efforts to reduce our carbon footprint by meticulously tracking our GHG emissions, 
which include both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard. The analysis and mitigation of Scope 3 emissions, involving emissions from employee 
commuting, business travel and other indirect activities, are also integral components of our strategy.
	
5)	
Developing Green Solutions: To ensure a robust tracking mechanism, we undertook a comprehensive reassessment 
of our Low Carbon Products Methodology to estimate the GHG emissions avoided at customer end. The 
methodology has been prepared in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (‘GHG Protocol’) as established by World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Avoided Emissions Framework by Net-Zero Climate Innovation 
Initiative (NZCII) and with references from the GeSI (Global enabling Sustainability Initiatives) resources. Through 
our portfolio—spanning IoT, MES, MOVE, GlobalRapide, Cloud, Incubation, and CPaaS/CCaaS —demonstrates an 
estimated avoided emissions of 34,57,749 MTCO2 at the customer level in FY 2024, equivalent to 14x our operational 
footprint (x- times). Link
	
6)	
Community Carbon Offset Programmes: We remain steadfast in our commitment to mitigating the risks of climate 
change and kindling a positive change within the communities in which we operate. We have undertaken an extensive 
baseline and community needs assessment to identify viable carbon offset projects. Through this approach, we 
have identified projects that have been evaluated on a financial and operational level and are aimed at improving 
cook stoves and plantations. Our unwavering focus on these initiatives underscores our role as a socially conscious 
corporate entity. Link

Being a service-oriented organisation, Tata Communications does not typically generate waste as a by-product of 
its processes. The waste generated can be divided into two categories: non-hazardous waste generated by domestic 
activities such as housekeeping and cafeteria operations, and hazardous waste generated by equipment which provide 
services to customers. Such equipment is purchased based on business requirements, and Tata Communications relies on 
its suppliers for delivery of such products and services. Tata Communications aims to reduce the environmental impact 
of waste by focusing on the efficient and sustainable disposal of all types of waste. Non-hazardous garbage is collected 
by municipalities and authorized third party agencies to ensure safe disposal. Hazardous waste is appropriately disposed 
off through authorized recyclers. Tata Communications ensures adequate storage with secondary containments during 
collection and handling of such hazardous waste and ensures proper training of the waste handlers. The scrap waste is
