within 5 working days, and a final report is issued within 7 working days. Employees 
can appeal decisions, prompting further review. The policy guarantees no retaliation

10. Health and Safety Management System.
a) Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by 
the entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such system? 
Yes, LatentView has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management 
System in alignment with our Health and Safety Policy, ensuring the well-being of all employees by 
systematically identifying, assessing, and mitigating workplace risks. Our OHS framework includes proactive 
hazard identification and risk mitigation, alongside initiatives promoting both physical and mental well-being, 
such as wellness programs and mental health resources. Clear protocols define employee and management 
responsibilities during emergencies, ensuring swift and effective responses. Regular training sessions reinforce 
safety awareness, while accessible incident reporting mechanisms facilitate prompt resolution and preventive 
action. We adhere to regulatory requirements and continuously enhance our OHS practices through audits, 
stakeholder feedback, and the adoption of industry best practices, fostering a safe and healthy work environment.
b) What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
LatentView maintains a robust hazard identification and mitigation process through our dedicated Facility team, 
which includes technical, security, and housekeeping personnel overseen by an Executive and Supervisor. The 
team conducts routine checks throughout the day to proactively identify and address potential risks.
For routine hazard identification, scheduled inspections are performed to detect issues such as poor ergonomics, 
fire hazards, electrical risks, or slip-and-trip dangers. These assessments ensure ongoing workplace safety and 
compliance with our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) standards.
For non-routine activities—such as office relocations, renovations, or temporary workspace setups—specific 
risk assessments are conducted before and during the task to address unique hazards. This structured approach 
ensures that both daily operations and exceptional circumstances are managed safely, minimizing risks to 
employee health and well-being.

Our Annual Health Checks encourage proactive care, while daily guided chair stretches combat sedentary 
fatigue. For fitness enthusiasts, we offer specialized training, including sessions for employees preparing for 
events like the Chennai Marathon 2025. The new office has a fully equipped Gym for employees workouts.
Mental & Emotional Well-being
We foster psychological resilience through innovative programs like Drumming for Wellness, which uses rhythm 
to reduce stress, and expert-led discussions on sustainable weight management. Observances like World 
Mental Health Day deepen awareness around emotional health, time management, and inclusion.
Financial Wellness & Work-Life Harmony
Practical guidance is key—our Smart Investment Strategies webinar equipped employees with actionable 
financial planning tips. Seasonal initiatives, such as Diwali wellness tips, helped teams navigate holiday stress 
with mindfulness and self-care.
Community & Connection
From our Kindness Challenge 2024 (promoting empathy through daily acts of goodwill) to festive celebrations 
(like Diwali and Christmas Jingle), we cultivate belonging through shared experiences. Even our Friday Flicks 
movie tradition strengthens bonds while offering a relaxed way to unwind.
Every program reflects our commitment to creating a workplace where employees feel supported, valued, and 
inspired. By integrating well-being into the fabric of our culture, we ensure that LatentView isn’t just a place to 
work—but a place to grow and flourish.

Essential Indicators
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
At LatentView, we follow a structured and inclusive approach to materiality assessment in line with the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. This process enables us to identify, prioritize, and address the Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) issues that are most relevant to our business and stakeholders.
As part of this process, we actively engage with a broad spectrum of stakeholders to deepen our understanding 
of their evolving needs, expectations, and concerns. This engagement is essential to shaping sustainable 
strategies that support our business objectives in the short, medium, and long term. It also plays a critical role in 
identifying potential risks and opportunities that could influence our operations and value creation.
Our key stakeholders, identified in consultation with senior management, include Employees, Customers, and 
Shareholders/Investors. These groups were selected based on their level of influence on and interest in our 
business activities. Through targeted engagement methods such as surveys, interviews, meetings, and feedback 
sessions, we gather valuable insights to inform our materiality assessment.

•	 Creating and nurturing a collaborative work environment: We 
make LatentView a safe place to brainstorm and support team unity and 
encourage good manager/employee relationships. This supportive culture 
not only leads to increased productivity and innovation but also higher 
levels of engagement and retention. “Knowledge roundtable,” the Service 
Delivery Excellence team in partnership with the Learning and development 
team, joined hands to create a forum where teams can showcase their work 
experience from their projects and clients. This has been a great opportunity 
to explore and understand the diverse work that is being done across the 
organization. LatentView has also successfully completed 13 knowledge 
roundtable sessions.
Leadership Indicators 
1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on 
economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is 
feedback from such consultations provided to the Board?
We have adopted a structured, data-driven, and consultative approach to identify and prioritize our most 
material economic, environmental, and social issues. This process includes stakeholder engagement through 
surveys, interviews, and focused group discussions with key internal and external stakeholders, including 
employees, customers, investors, suppliers and community representatives.
The materiality assessment outcomes are reviewed and validated in consultation with senior management and 
are periodically presented to relevant sub-committees of the Board. These sub-committees ensure that material 
stakeholder concerns and sustainability-related risks and opportunities are integrated into strategic decision-
making.
In addition, during our Annual General Meeting, the Board engages with shareholders directly to provide 
them with an overview of our strategies and to address any queries or concerns that they may have. This 
communication helps to promote transparency and build trust among shareholders.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and 
management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details 
of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into the policies and activities of the entity.
Yes, To help define the most important ESG issues, we have conducted a materiality assessment to remain 
successful in the long term. All the identified stakeholders were allowed access to forums to highlight their 
concerns. It allowed us to capture our non-financial impacts, helped us prioritize issues to focus on, and 
improved our strategic thinking.
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the 
concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups. 
LatentView’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives are strategically crafted to address key societal 
challenges, with a strong emphasis on supporting vulnerable communities—particularly students, youth, and 
marginalized groups. The company embraces a holistic approach to sustainability, integrating economic, 
social, and environmental considerations, while consistently aligning its initiatives with the needs and aspirations 
of its stakeholders. These programs are further strengthened by the active involvement of employees and a 
robust feedback mechanism involving beneficiaries, implementation partners, and local communities, ensuring 
continuous improvement and meaningful impact.
Across Chennai, LatentView continues to make notable strides through its flagship programs aimed at upskilling 
and creating sustainable growth opportunities for students in government schools. The Chennai Kaalpandhu 
League, a flagship sports development initiative, has positively impacted 4,169 students. The program begins 
by identifying promising football talent in government schools and providing professional coaching, along with 
nutritional support during training. Students participate in structured home-and-away matches, culminating in 
a league format tournament. This year, the program expanded to include six lateral entry teams, giving more 
students a platform to showcase their skills. Top-performing players are selected for advanced training with 
professional clubs such as Chennaiyin FC, opening doors to long-term opportunities in sports.
Meanwhile, Project Apoorva has reached 4,079 students, offering critical 21st-century skills through training 
in data analytics, digital literacy, spoken English, and other skill-building sessions. Through initiatives such as 
Data Analytics Clubs and Capstone Projects, students engage in real-world problem-solving, strengthening their 
analytical thinking and preparing them for future careers in the digital economy.
In collaboration with Sevalaya, LatentView also supports higher education for students from financially 
challenged backgrounds by offering scholarships to those who score 75% and above in their 12th-grade public 
examinations. During implementation, it became evident that many students lacked awareness and guidance 
about career paths aligned with their interests and capabilities. To address this, LatentView introduced career 
counseling sessions, helping students make informed decisions about their futures and enabling them to pursue 
their aspirations with clarity and confidence.

In Ramanathapuram, an aspirational district recognized by NITI Aayog, LatentView works closely with rural 
communities where students often face limited access to quality education and skill development. To bridge this 
gap, the company has established after-school learning centers that support over 540 children. These centers 
focus on foundational learning—such as mathematics and English vocabulary—and encourage participation in 
sports and holistic development activities to empower students beyond the classroom.
In FY 2024–25, LatentView, in collaboration with BITS, supported the implementation of constructed wetlands 
to enhance flood resilience, water storage, and local biodiversity. These nature-based interventions have 
helped reduce waterlogging and improve preparedness for floods and heavy rains. Additionally, the increase 
in biodiversity around these wetlands has contributed to a healthier ecosystem and an improved quality of life 
for the surrounding communities.

4. Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee) responsible for addressing 
human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
Yes, LatentView has established an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) that serves as the focal point for 
addressing human rights issues within the organization. The ICC provides an efficient and confidential platform 
for employees to report any human rights concerns or violations they may encounter while working with the 
Company. The committee is responsible for ensuring that all such issues are investigated thoroughly and resolved 
promptly and fairly while working with the Company.
5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human 
rights issues.
Yes, LatentView has well-defined internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights 
issues, in alignment with our commitment to creating a respectful, inclusive, and safe workplace for all employees.
Our Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy serves as a cornerstone of our human rights protection 
framework. It is designed to educate employees on the prevention of sexual harassment, foster awareness, 
and ensure a workplace that upholds dignity and respect. The policy outlines clear procedures for reporting 
incidents, establishes a formal Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), and ensures that all allegations are 
handled in a prompt, confidential, and unbiased manner.
In addition, our Whistle-Blower Policy provides employees and stakeholders with a secure channel to report 
unethical behavior, illegal activities, or any violations of the LatentView Code of Conduct. The policy guarantees 
protection against retaliation and promotes a culture of integrity and accountability.
We also have a structured Grievance Redressal Policy, which allows employees to raise workplace concerns, 
including those related to discrimination, harassment, or any breach of ethical standards. All grievances are 
addressed through a transparent, tiered process ensuring timely resolution while maintaining confidentiality 
and fairness.
The LatentView Code of Conduct sets clear expectations regarding ethical behavior, mutual respect, and 
compliance with legal and regulatory standards. All employees are required to adhere to the Code, and any 
deviation is subject to disciplinary action.
These internal mechanisms collectively reinforce our commitment to upholding human rights and fostering a safe, 
equitable, and compliant work environment.
Any grievances to the employees and the solution provided to the aggrieved, will also be reviewed by 
Stakeholders relationship committee at regular intervals.

Essential Indicators 
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints 
and feedback.
The Service Delivery Excellence (SDE) team plays a crucial role in driving operational efficiency, ensuring 
high-quality client deliverables, and enhancing overall service standards. We work across multiple touchpoints 
such as business reviews, issue resolution, cross pollination, process innovation and training to ensure consistent 
delivery excellence.
The principal objectives of setting up a SDE enablement function within Latentview are as follows:
•	 To ensure standardization and efficiency through structured process and review mechanisms.
•	 To ensure effective cross pollination by acting as a centralized team articulating the success methodologies 
from specific projects to any other project facing similar challenges.
•	 To ensure efficient tracking of performance metrics through quality audits and facilitate unbiased review 
mechanisms which will positively boost the productivity of individual team members and in turn the entire 
project as well.
SDE conducts the Voice of Customer Survey every half year (calendar year) and captures the customer 
feedback and metrics around the same. The survey will be open for about a month & half and the results are 
consolidated and published in a dashboard. SDE team will work with the teams where the clients suggest areas 
of improvement.
