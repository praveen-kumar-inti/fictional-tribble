Hydrogen is a clean source of energy for the future. Hydrogen 
has better combustion characteristics and non-polluting 
nature has vast advantages over the conventional fuels.. 
Biohydrogen that is H2 (hydrogen) produced biologically is 
one option for obtaining Green Hydrogen in addition to the 
electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen through an 
electrolyser. Greener methods of hydrogen production are 
actively being explored in India and R&D efforts are on to 
bring down the cost of production of Green Hydrogen. So far, 
the current biohydrogen production systems are appropriate 
for decentralised small-scale systems, integrated with waste 
from agriculture and industries or from waste-processing 
facilities, using reactors operating with mixed microflora or 
pure cultures enriched from natural sources. Use of industrial 
wastes in biohydrogen production routes could be a cost-
effective way of meeting a portion of hydrogen demand. 
With many social, economic and environmental benefits, 
biohydrogen energy is considered as a future sustainable 
energy source. The collaborative research project with UPES-
Dehradun is a first step towards gaining further insights into 
Biohydrogen producing microbes and in utilizing them for 
Biohydrogen production in the near future.

Hydrogen addition mitigates emissions and enhances the 
combustion characteristics such as laminar burning velocity, 
flammability, adiabatic flame temperature, heating value, 
etc. CNG blended with Hydrogen (HCNG) is found to be an 
alternate and intermediate solution in the approach toward 
clean combustion. HCNG combustion further reduces the 
NOx emissions by lowering the flame temperature through 
widening the lean burning characteristics. HC and CO levels 
are further brought down due to the presence of H2.
This study is initiated with the objective to understand the 
effect of hydrogen on natural gas properties, pipeline and 
end usage applications (power generation, heat requirements 
for OCS/GCS and tea factories, IC engines of automobiles). 
The scope of the collaborative study is formulated 
comprehensively to address vital and critical aspects of 
injection/blending of hydrogen gas in the existing natural 
gas pipeline. This study also cover end usage applications of 
the blended gas by evaluating the feasibility of utilizing the 
combined heat & power from Solid Oxide Fuel Cells for OIL’s 
OCS in addition to other end use applicability for customers 
viz. at Tea Gardens and also for transportation purpose e.g. 
in retrofitted IC Engines of small motor vehicle. The impact of 
hydrogen on internal corrosion of natural gas pipeline is also 
being studied and investigated.

Oil India Limited has long ago initiated efforts towards providing 
a clean environment. Ambient Air Quality monitoring is one 
such effort to determine the existing quality of air, evaluation 
of the effectiveness of control program and to identify areas in 
need of restoration and their prioritization. The objectives of 
the Air quality monitoring are to determine status and trends 
of ambient air quality, to ascertain whether the prescribed 
ambient air quality standards are followed and to obtain the 
knowledge and understanding necessary for developing 
preventive and corrective measures, if needed. Ambient air 
quality monitoring has led to significant improvements in 
environmental and social impacts. By providing data on air 
pollutants, it enables the identification of pollution sources 
and the implementation of targeted measures to reduce 
emissions. This, in turn, leads to better air quality, mitigates 
the environmental impact of air pollution and protects public 
health.

The conventional OSD products that are in use at OIL’s various 
field installations (OCS / EPS / QPS) for separating water from 
water-in-crude emulsions are designed to work optimally at a 
curing temperature of 60°C. Therefore, an effort to develop low 
temperature demulsifier (LT-OSD) products has been initiated 
with the objective to develop suitable OSD formulations that 
would give adequate water separation even if the curing 
temperature inside the Emulsion Treater (ET) vessels falls 
to 45°C due to various operational exigencies. Apart from 
the operational convenience for oil – water demulsification, 
introduction of LT-OSD in various field installations results 
in saving of energy in terms of reduction in consumption of 
natural gas and carbon footprint.

a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)  If yes, what percentage of 
inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
At OIL, we are dedicated to upholding responsible and sustainable practices in all our operations, including our 
vendor selection process. Our commitment extends to considering social, ethical, and environmental factors in our 
decision-making. We have implemented a strong and transparent tendering process that adheres to the relevant 
laws and regulations. Our tender process are online and paperless to give equal opportunities to eligible bidders to 
maintain transparency. Our tender invitations include clauses that address critical issues, such as the prohibition 
of child labor, welfare of contractual labor, etc. to ensure a fair and ethical execution of process. Additionally, 
we have incorporated environment-related screening parameters that require compliance with Global/National 
standards as establishment of performance criteria. These considerations are evaluated meticulously on a 
tender-to-tender basis to promote sustainability and minimize our ecological impact. Furthermore, we actively 
support local vendors and contribute to the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat by implementing purchase preference 
conditions that prioritize engaging with local suppliers and small or medium scale industries.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.  
	
Due to the nature of its operations, the concept of reclaiming products does not apply in the oil and gas sector. 
However at OIL, we prioritize responsible waste management and have established a robust processes for 
reclaiming products for reusing, recycling, and disposing of waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous. Let's 
delve into our approach for managing hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste:
	
A.	
Hazardous Waste:
	
Oily Sludge: Oily sludge, a hazardous waste generated from storage tank bottoms, is treated at our Sludge 
Processing Plant. Through a systematic process in our in-house sludge recovery plant, we recover valuable 
crude oil from the sludge, which is then reused, contributing to sustainable resource utilization. The 
remaining sludge undergoes bioremediation through contracts with reputable organizations. This eco-
friendly bioremediation process effectively breaks down and degrades harmful components, ensuring 
proper disposal of the sludge.
Business Responsibility &
Sustainability Report FY- 2022-23 
	
B.	
Non-Hazardous Waste:
	
Treatment of Formation/Produced Water: Produced water, a byproduct of oil and gas production, undergoes 
responsible waste management at Oil India Limited. In our pursuit of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in our 
operations, we have installed and commissioned the Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI) facilities in a 
project  mode with strategic capital investments. Over recent few years, we have proactively installed new 
high-capacity centralized ETPs, including modular ones for remote locations. These ETPs are equipped with 
advanced technologies, effectively treating produced water to meet acceptable standards for underground 
disposal in designated water disposal wells. Our treatment process adheres strictly to the stringent quality 
standards outlined by the Minimum National Standards (MINAS), ensuring that the treated effluent remains 
well within permissible limits. This approach safeguards the environment and minimizes our ecological 
footprint, contributing to responsible water management and conservation efforts.
	
To further enhance responsible water management, OIL has established a desalination pilot plant in STF-
Madhuban. This plant treats highly saline (Total Dissolved Solid) water, making it suitable for reuse in our 
operations. This initiative aligns with our zero liquid discharge philosophy, and we plan to upscale the unit 
and replicate the same in other locations to optimize water usage and reduce environmental footprint. Our 
commitment to sustainable water management and actions towards ZLD exemplifies our dedication to 
environmental stewardship and resource conservation. Drilling/Workover Fluid: Drilling and workover fluid, 
another non-hazardous waste generated during oil well operations, is a mixture of water, oil, and chemicals 
used to lubricate and cool the drill bit. At OIL, we are committed to recycling a major portion of the drilling/
workover fluid that we generate. By recycling this fluid, we minimize waste generation and contribute to 
sustainable practices. 
	
Our processes for managing both hazardous and non-hazardous waste align with the highest environmental 
standards and regulatory requirements. At Oil India Limited, we are committed to minimize the impact of 
waste on the environment, promote recycling, and uphold responsible waste disposal practices. These 
initiatives reflect our dedication to environmental stewardship and contribute to a greener and more 
sustainable future for all.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. 
	
No, the oil and gas industry being a complex and diverse sector, with a wide range of products and services. 
This makes it difficult to develop a single EPR system that would be effective for all segments of the industry. 
It is heavily regulated, with a number of existing laws and regulations governing the management of waste. 
These regulations often include requirements for producers to collect and recycle waste, which can make EPR 
redundant.
	
The oil and gas industry being a global industry, with producers operating in a variety of countries with different 
environmental regulations. This makes it difficult to implement a single EPR system that would be effective 
across all countries.

Ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees, workers, and the environment is of utmost importance at 
OIL. Our ultimate vision is to become a "zero accident and no harm to Man, Machine, and Material" organization. To 
achieve this, we have implemented a robust HSE Management System that complies with all relevant statutory 
norms, rules, and regulations.

world-class HSE standards. Regular monitoring, Audits and system updates, guided by manuals, ensure strict 
compliance. We believe in continual improvement, and any identified gaps are promptly addressed through 
awareness programs, technological intervention, Industry academia interactions, training initiatives, and regular 
interactions with regulators.

Maintaining our infrastructure is a critical aspect of ensuring the smooth and efficient operations of Oil India 
Limited. Over the years, our Company has built a significant infrastructure that supports various exploration and 
production activities. However, due to the passage of time and continuous usage, some of these installations have 
aged and requires refurbishment. Recognizing the importance of our infrastructure and its impact on operational 
efficiency and safety, the Company has allocated a substantial five-year Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) budget 
of Rs 3183 Cr dedicated to the refurbishment of these assets. This allocation reflects Company’s commitment 
towards maintaining the Asset Integrity  to highest standards  so as to achieve operational excellence and safety, 
ensuring that  workforce perform their tasks in a secure and conducive environment.
	
In pursuit of elevating our HSE practices further, we launched Project KAVACH (Key to Awareness, Value Creation, 
and Change). This comprehensive endeavor comprises ten strategic goals aimed at transforming our HSE 
management system into HSE+. These goals include strengthening of (i)Strengthening the HSE Management 
System, (ii) Establish Integrated Organization for HSE Management, (iii)  Building a generative safety culture (iv) 
Benchmarking HSE parameters against national and international best practices, (v)  Integrating technology to 
enhance the HSE Management System, (vi) Asset integrity management, (vii)  Establishing a comprehensive HSE 
audit universe, (viii) Establishing an Emergency Response Centre (ix)  Net Zero and (x) Conducting an Occupational 
Health Survey.
	
Project KAVACH serves as a catalyst for positive change within OIL, reinforcing a robust HSE framework, and 
fostering responsible business practices in line with global standards. We are committed to maintaining a safe 
and healthy workplace and continuously improving our HSE practices to safeguard our people, assets, and the 
environment.

focused engagement process and communication strategy. This understanding is used to develop and implement 
outcome-based and impact-oriented projects in the selected areas.
	
OIL's areas of operation are in remote and backward areas, so engaging with external stakeholders, including the 
communities around its areas of operation, gives significant input relating to the needs of the disadvantaged and 
vulnerable marginal stakeholders. In addition, over the past few years, OIL has carried out baseline surveys and need 
assessments in a few of its areas of operation to have a better understanding of the needs of the community through 
structured interactions and feedback.
	
Before granting environmental clearance for a new exploration and production (E&P) activity, a public hearing is 
organized by the State Pollution Control Board with the community surrounding the new project activity. An action 
plan is made against the inputs received from the public during the consultation and submitted to the Ministry of 
Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). The said plan is implemented during the project activity.
	
OIL also follows the Presidential Directives and guidelines issued by the Government of India on reservation in services 
for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC), Persons with Disabilities (PWD), and 
Ex-servicemen to promote inclusive growth.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
OIL has taken various initiatives as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility for vulnerable and marginalized 
stakeholder groups. The details of CSR activities are mentioned in the CSR section of the Annual Report. These 
initiatives include various projects on Healthcare, Education, Sustainable Livelihood, Skill Development, Capacity 
Building and Empowerment of Women and Persons with Disabilities, Drinking Water & Sanitation under Swachh 
Bharat Abhiyan, Promotion of Rural Sports, Development of Social Assets, Sustainable Environment, Development of 
Aspirational districts, etc. OIL has also purchased goods and services from vendors belonging to the Scheduled Caste 
(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories, as well as women entrepreneurs in accordance with the Public Procurement 
Policy of the Government of India. OIL also encourages employment to SC/ST/OBC/EWS classes along with vulnerable 
groups of stakeholders like ex-servicemen and people with disabilities.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
	
Yes.
	
We are proud to inform you that OIL has taken significant strides in implementing a robust ZLD mechanism 
as part of our commitment to sustainable water management. Our ZLD initiative ensures that no liquid waste 
is discharged from our operations into the environment, thereby minimizing the impact on water bodies and 
promoting responsible waste management.
	
In our pursuit of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in our operations, we have installed and commissioned the Produced 
Water Re-Injection (PWRI) facilities in a project  mode with strategic capital investments. Over recent few years, 
we have proactively installed new high-capacity centralized ETPs, including modular ones for remote locations. 
These ETPs are equipped with advanced technologies, effectively treating produced water to meet acceptable 
standards for underground disposal in designated water disposal wells. Our treatment process adheres strictly 
to the stringent quality standards outlined by the Minimum National Standards (MINAS), ensuring that the treated 
effluent remains well within permissible limits. This approach safeguards the environment and minimizes our 
ecological footprint, contributing to responsible water management and conservation efforts.
	
To further enhance responsible water management, OIL has established a desalination pilot plant in STF-Madhuban. 
This plant treats highly saline (Total Dissolved Solid) water, making it suitable for reuse in our operations. This 
initiative aligns with our zero liquid discharge philosophy, and we plan to upscale the unit and replicate the same 
in other locations to optimize water usage and reduce environmental footprint. Our commitment to sustainable 
water management and actions towards ZLD exemplifies our dedication to environmental stewardship and 
resource conservation.
	
At OIL, our commitment to environmental stewardship drives us to continuously enhance our practices for the 
sustainable management of precious natural resources. The implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge is an 
integral part of our efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future.

Oil India Limited (OIL) has taken significant measures to align its operations with these objectives and establish 
its own Net Zero commitments and sets its ambitious target to be a Net Zero Company by 2040.
	
Accordingly, OIL has made a low carbon transition pathway to reduce its operational (scope1 and Scope2) 
emissions to the extent possible and for the remaining emissions, it will go for an offset mechanism. Our approach 
encompasses the following initiatives:
a.	
Emphasis on Natural Gas: OIL recognizes the significance of natural gas as a cleaner energy source. As 
part of our strategy, we are expanding our natural gas operations to facilitate the transition towards a 
low-carbon economy. By exploring new gas fields and enhancing our infrastructure, we aim to tap into the 
growing demand for cleaner fuels.
b.	
Research and Development: OIL is actively investing in research and development to develop energy-
efficient technologies and carbon capture and utilization solutions. For example, we are conducting pilot 
studies and feasibility assessments for Carbon Capture, Utilization (CCU), and Storage (CCUS), Carbonated 
Water Injection (CWI) technology. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to reducing carbon emissions 
and mitigating associated risks. 
c.	
Exploration of New Energy Markets: OIL is actively exploring emerging energy markets and technologies 
to identify alternative business opportunities. We have commissioned India's first pilot plant for Green 
Hydrogen Production in Jorhat, Assam, with plans for scaling up production capacity. Additionally, we are 
exploring opportunities in geothermal energy, compressed biogas, and other sustainable energy sectors to 
diversify our revenue streams and align with the changing energy landscape.
d.	
Diversification of Energy Portfolio: OIL is actively diversifying its energy portfolio by venturing into 
renewable energy sources. For instance, we have successfully commissioned wind energy projects with 
a total capacity of 174.1 MW and solar energy projects with a capacity of 14 MW across different regions 
in India. These investments in renewable energy help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and minimize carbon 
transition risks.
e.	
Collaboration and Partnerships: OIL believes in the power of collaboration to drive sustainable growth. We 
actively seek partnerships with industry stakeholders, research institutions, and government agencies 
to leverage collective expertise. For instance, we have formed joint ventures for green energy projects, 
such Assam State Cabinet has given In-principle approval for the implementation of green power projects 
cumulative capacity 620 MW under JV between Assam Power Generation Corporation Limited (APGCL) 
and OIL in addition to 25 MW at Namrup. Additionally, in partnership with the Himachal Pradesh state 
government, OIL is engaged in developing alternate energy projects, encompassing solar energy, green 
hydrogen, geothermal, and compressed biogas. These partnerships enable us to access resources, share 
knowledge, and identify new business opportunities in the clean and green energy landscape.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes
	
Oil India Limited has a comprehensive waste management system in place to ensure that all waste generated 
by its operations is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The following approach is adopted for 
management of Hazardous and non-hazardous waste:
	
A.	
HAZARDOUS WASTE
1.	
OILY SLUDGE: Oily Sludge from storage tank bottom generated at various installations at FHQ, Duliajan are 
collected, transferred and processed at OIL’s Sludge Processing Plant. The Crude Oil recovered from the 
process is pumped to nearest Oil Collecting station as Recovered Crude Oil. Post recovery, the remaining 
sludge is Bioremediated via contracts with registered and reputed organisations. Additionally, In-situ and 
Ex-situ Bioremediation are carried out at affected sites for handling the emergency situations (if any), 
because of spillage of oil on land and water bodies. 
2.	
SPENT OIL: Used lubricant oil generated at various installations are collected and disposed to registered 
recycler for recycling/co-processing.

FORMATION WATER: In our pursuit of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in our operations, we have installed and 
commissioned the Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI) facilities in a project  mode with strategic capital 
investments. Over recent few years, we have proactively installed new high-capacity centralized ETPs, 
including modular ones for remote locations. These ETPs are equipped with advanced technologies,

and replicate the same in other locations to optimize water usage and reduce environmental footprint. Our 
commitment to sustainable water management and actions towards ZLD exemplifies our dedication to 
environmental stewardship and resource conservation.
2.	
DRILLING/WORKOVER FLUID: Drilling/workover fluid is a waste material that is generated from the drilling 
and workover of oil wells. It is a mixture of water, oil, and chemicals that is used to lubricate and cool the drill 
bit. OIL recycles a major portion of the drilling/workover fluid that it generates. The leftover fluid is stored in 
HDPE lined pits after being processed through an effluent treatment plant.
3.	
DRILL CUTTINGS: Drill cuttings are a waste material that is generated from the drilling of oil wells. They 
are the solid materials that are removed from the wellbore during drilling. OIL washes drill cuttings and 
store them in HDPE-lined pits at drill sites. Additionally, under project Bhuvan Mitra- OIL has introduced a 
Vertical Cutting Dryer (VCD) system for the treatment of drill cuttings. This system utilizes centrifugal force 
to separate the drill cuttings from the drill fluid, eliminating the generation of wastewater and allowing for 
the recovery and recycling of the drill fluid back into the drilling operations.
4.	
E-WASTE: E-waste is a waste material that is generated from electronic and electrical equipment. It includes 
items such as computers, televisions, and cell phones. OIL disposes of e-waste through an approved recycler 
agency.
5.	
BIO-MEDICAL WASTE: Bio-medical waste is a waste material that is generated from healthcare facilities. It 
includes items such as needles, swabs, and bandages. OIL disposes of bio-medical waste through a double-
chamber incinerator.
6.	
OTHER SCRAP: Other scrap is a waste material that is generated from a variety of sources. It includes items 
40
such as metal, plastic, and wood. OIL has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with M/s MSTC for 
the disposal of its scrap.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, provide 
details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention 
and remediation activities.
	
Oil India Limited has taken a number of steps to minimize the environmental impacts of its operations on 
biodiversity. These include conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study to identify potential 
impacts and develop mitigation measures. OIL has also developed an Environment Management Plan (EMP) 
that outlines the specific measures that will be taken to minimize impacts. Additionally, OIL adheres to all the 
conditions stipulated under Environmental Clearance. As a result of these efforts, OIL's operations have a minimal 
impact on biodiversity.
	
OIL is committed to minimizing the environmental impacts of its operations and to continuously improving its 
environmental performance.
6.	
If the entity has undertaken any specific initiatives or used innovative technology or solutions to improve 
resource efficiency, or reduce impact due to emissions / effluent discharge / waste generated, please provide 
details of the same as well as outcome of such initiatives, as per the following format:
a.	
Under the project Bhuvan Mitra, Oil India Limited (OIL) has taken a pioneering step towards waste management 
and reduction through the installation of a drilling cutting treatment unit. This innovative initiative aims to 
address the challenges associated with the generation and disposal of drilling waste, while demonstrating 
a proactive approach to environmental protection. One of the primary problems faced was the generation 
of a significant amount of wastewater and the wastage of drilling fluid, which posed handling and disposal 
issues. Additionally, the requirement of land for waste collection pits further compounded the challenges. 
To mitigate these issues, OIL has introduced a Vertical Cutting Dryer (VCD) system for the treatment of drill 
44
cuttings. This system utilizes centrifugal force to separate the drill cuttings from the drill fluid, eliminating 
the generation of wastewater and allowing for the recovery and recycling of the drill fluid back into the 
drilling operations. 
b.	
Oil India Limited has introduced a set up a treatment plant to recover valuable hydrocarbon from oily waste 
such as tank bottom sludge and spilled crude oil. This initiative eliminates the need to dispose of oily waste 
in landfills or incinerators, which can be harmful to the environment. The overall recovery from the plant is 
40% to 45%, and in 2022, the plant recovered 1400 KL of crude oil. This represents a significant reduction in 
the environmental impact of oily waste, and it also provides a valuable source of revenue for the plant.
c.	
In our pursuit of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in our operations, we have installed and commissioned the 
Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI) facilities in a project  mode with strategic capital investments. Over 
recent few years, we have proactively installed new high-capacity centralized ETPs, including modular 
ones for remote locations. These ETPs are equipped with advanced technologies, effectively treating 
produced water to meet acceptable standards for underground disposal in designated water disposal 
wells. Our treatment process adheres strictly to the stringent quality standards outlined by the Minimum 
National Standards (MINAS), ensuring that the treated effluent remains well within permissible limits. This 
approach safeguards the environment and minimizes our ecological footprint, contributing to responsible 
water management and conservation efforts.To further enhance responsible water management, OIL has 
established a desalination pilot plant in STF-Madhuban. This plant treats highly saline (Total Dissolved Solid) 
water, making it suitable for reuse in our operations. This initiative aligns with our zero liquid discharge 
philosophy, and we plan to upscale the unit and replicate the same in other locations to optimize water 
usage and reduce environmental footprint. Our commitment to sustainable water management and actions 
towards ZLD exemplifies our dedication to environmental stewardship and resource conservation.
