Director’s Message
Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to share with you our first Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) report, which outlines our ongoing 
commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. At 
AstraZeneca, we recognise the importance of balancing economic, 
social, and environmental considerations in all that we do. As such, 
we remain committed to drive positive change through our business 
practices and operations.
Over the past year, we have made significant strides in advancing 
our sustainability initiatives and data management. As we navigate 
current socio-economic and environmental challenges, we must 
prioritise building sustainable, resilient, and equitable health systems 
that protect current and future generations.
In addition, we have prioritised social responsibility by investing in 
our employees, supporting our local communities, and fostering 
diversity and inclusion throughout our organisation. We believe that 
a strong commitment to social responsibility is essential to building a 
sustainable business that creates value for all stakeholders.
While we are proud of our progress, we recognise that there is 
still much work to be done. We remain committed to continuous 
improvement and will continue to push ourselves to raise the bar on 
sustainability performance. We believe that by working together with 
our stakeholders, we can create a brighter, more sustainable future 
for all.
Thank you for your ongoing support and partnership as we continue 
our sustainability journey.

24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Our materiality assessment is guided by the materiality assessment undertaken by the AstraZeneca Group. The materiality assessment 
identified the issues that matter most to AstraZeneca’s Group companies and stakeholders and showed where AstraZeneca can have a 
positive impact.

Financial implications of the risk or opportunity 
(positive or negative implications)
1.
Access to 
healthcare
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for the Company to 
provide and working towards:
1.	 Equitable Access: health 
should not be determined 
by who you are, where you 
live or where you were born. 
Therefore, we see this as an 
opportunity to work towards 
removing barriers to healthcare 
and give everyone the chance 
to be as healthy as possible.
2.	 Affordability and pricing: We 
are committed to addressing 
barriers to access and 
affordability. Therefore, 
we see an opportunity for 
industry, policymakers, and 
payers to work together to 
identify solutions. Through 
collaborations, partnerships, 
and stakeholder coalitions we 
are working to ensure essential 
and innovative medicines 
become more widely available.
3.	 Health system resilience: 
During the COVID-19 
pandemic, we saw the need 
for health systems to adapt 
to ever-changing societal and 
economic circumstances to 
cope with shocks and crisis 
situations.
Health is a key for 
people and our 
planet to thrive. 
Therefore, our 
ambition is to 
promote prevention, 
increase access 
to life saving 
treatment, and 
strengthen global 
healthcare resilience 
and sustainability
Not 
Applicable
Positive: Access to healthcare, motivate the 
Company to innovate sustainable healthcare 
solutions which are essential to improving 
global health outcomes.
Further, the positive impacts towards specific 
opportunities are delineated below:
1.	 Equitable Access: We have embedded 
practices into the product portfolio to drive 
equitable access to healthcare – including 
digital health, clinical trial diversity, patient 
centricity, investing in rare diseases, open 
innovation, and Intellectual Property (IP) 
sharing arrangements.
2.	 Affordability and pricing: We are committed 
to drive accessibility of medicines for 
diverse, equitable, and inclusive patient 
groups, through company policy and 
programming, including core pricing 
principles and access programmes
3.	 Health system resilience: We are 
committed to strengthen health systems 
by advocating for health system reform 
and policy; building capabilities to 
address unmet medical need, improve 
access to quality healthcare and provide 
solutions along a continuum of care – from 
prevention, awareness, diagnosis, and 
treatment to post-treatment and wellness; 
and committing to disaster relief, grants, 
and donations.

2.
Environmental 
Protection
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for our Company to 
meet our ambition – Accelerating 
the delivery of net-zero healthcare, 
proactively managing our 
environmental impact across all 
activities, and investing in nature 
and biodiversity.
Further, our focus areas as part of 
the identified material issue are:
1.	 Ambition Zero Carbon
2.	 Product Sustainability
3.	 Natural resources
Supporting a 
healthy environment 
improves health 
outcomes and helps 
prevent the onset 
of certain diseases 
likely to become 
more prevalent in a 
changing climate
Not 
Applicable
Positive: Beyond the benefits of our medicines 
to patients, our contribution to society must 
respect our environment and ensure the 
sustainable use of the planet’s finite natural 
resources. We know that a healthy environment 
is critical for human health.
Further, the positive impacts towards specific 
opportunities are delineated below:
1.	 Ambition Zero Carbon: (i) Achieve net-zero 
by avoiding GHG (Green House Gas) 
emissions through our facility and product 
design, maximising our energy efficiency, 
shifting to renewable energy sources, 
transitioning to an electric vehicle (EV) fleet, 
and investing in nature-based removals to 
compensate for any residual GHG footprint; 
and (ii) build resilience by managing 
the physical (sites, supply chain) and 
transitional (regulatory, market and product) 
risks and opportunities arising from climate 
change in the value chain through adaption 
and business continuity planning.
2.	 Product Sustainability: People and the 
planet benefit from those medicines which 
have the smallest possible environmental 
impact yet maintain the highest medical 
efficacy and safety standards. Therefore, 
we are following processes through the 
life cycle of our products with the aim 
of understanding and addressing their 
environmental impact; from discovery 
through development and production, to 
launching a new product and to the end of 
product life.
3.	 Natural Resource: The conservation and 
sustainable use of natural resources 
and the protection and restoration 
of ecosystems is vital to shape a 
healthy future with resilient people and 
communities, building harmony between 
society and the natural environment. 
Therefore, we see this as an opportunity 
to meet our commitment towards – (i) 
Reducing our impact on the planet through 
the efficient, circular use of water and other 
natural resources across the value chain to 
ensure responsible sourcing, consumption 
production, and disposal; (ii) protecting and 
restoring ecosystems to improve health 
outcome and tackle environmental drivers 
of disease such as water and air quality, 
through our focus on water stewardship 
and biodiversity.
3.
Ethics and 
Transparency
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for our Company to 
ensure ethical, open, and inclusive 
behaviour across our organisation 
and value chain.
It guides the 
Company in 
fostering a culture of 
doing the right thing 
across our value 
chain and promotes 
health and well-
being.
Not 
Applicable
Positive: It is important for us to create value 
beyond the impact our medicines have on 
patients. We need to ensure that we retain 
and increase trust across all our stakeholders’ 
groups in order to continue to deliver life-
changing medicines to patients. The positive 
impact of the material issues, includes:

Rationale for 
identifying the risk/

Financial implications of the risk or opportunity 
(positive or negative implications)
Further, we seek 
to create positive

and embed ethical 
behaviour in all our 
business activities, 
markets, and 
value chain. We 
promote ethical, 
transparent, and 
inclusive policies 
internally and with 
our partners and 
suppliers.
1.	 Ethical Business Culture: An ethical 
business culture is essential to successful 
risk management, and we are committed 
to increasing public trust in our industry. 
Further, it drives the highest standards 
of conduct and accountability beyond 
compliance including, but not limited to, 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption, product 
safety, use of human tissues and animal 
for research, human rights and building 
supplier capabilities to uphold high social 
standards.
2.	 Inclusion and Diversity: We believe 
that inclusion is a right and diversity is 
a strength. Both make a fundamental 
contribution to the success of our 
Company because innovation requires 
breakthrough ideas that only come from a 
diverse workforce empowered to challenge 
conventional thinking. Furthermore, it 
creates a working environment where 
every employee has a sense of belonging, 
regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, 
origin, religion, age, disability status or 
sexual orientation. This includes equitable 
compensation, benefits and opportunities 
for development and advancement.
3.	 Workforce safety and health: To continue 
to deliver medicines to patients, we must 
foster an environment where people 
feel safe, energised, and inspired. The 
resources we put into supporting the 
physical and mental health and safety 
of our workforce are an investment in 
society at large, the communities where 
we operate, and the long-term health of 
economies. Contributing to a safe and 
healthy environment is the right thing to 
do and can also have positive business 
impact.
