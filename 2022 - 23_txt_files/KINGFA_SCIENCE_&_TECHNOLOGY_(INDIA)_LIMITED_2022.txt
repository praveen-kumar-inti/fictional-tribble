Community development drives economic growth 
by supporting  local businesses and creating jobs.
 It also addresses social issues, promotes social
justice,  and improves the wellbeing of  marginalized 
 communities through increased access to essential
 services. Supporting CSR activities creates a 
positive  impact on the communities we engage 
with,  addressing needs, promoting sustainability, 
 and enhancing stakeholder relationships.
Water and waste management is a signiﬁcant  
priority in our daily lives, and we perceive it as an
opportunity to effectively address these concerns 
within our premises. It allows us to save money,
showcase our environmental commitment, comply
 with regulations, drive innovation, engage employees, 
 and attract  sustainability-focused customers.
Potential threats such as natural disasters or 
disruption in operation due to technical failure exist 
in spite of all-round preparedness.
Management of supply chain is crucial in 
manufacturing the products and thereby meeting the
Company’s business objectives.
