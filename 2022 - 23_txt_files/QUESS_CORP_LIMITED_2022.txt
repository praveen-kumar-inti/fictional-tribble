Internal Control Systems and their adequacy
The Company has a strong Internal 
Control System (ICS), aligned to 
the Companies Act, 2013 and to 
commensurate with the size, scale and 
complexity of its business operations. 
The Board of Directors has laid down 
internal financial controls through 
policies and procedures which are 
adopted by thecompany, for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of 
its business, compliance with all 
applicable laws, rulesand directives 
from any statutory or regulatory 
authority, safeguarding of its assets, 
transactions are carried out with proper 
authorisation, prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, 
and timely preparation of reliable 
financial information.
Ernst & Young LLP conducts internal 
audit reviews, with scope and authority 
defined by the Board's Audit Committee. 
To ensure independence, the Internal 
Auditor reports to the Audit Committee 
Chairman. The Internal Auditor monitors 
and evaluates the company's ICS's 
efficacy, compliance with laws, and 
accounting policies. Management 
reviews the reports and takes corrective 
action to enhance controls. Audit 
findings summaries are presented to the 
Board's Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee comprises of six 
company Directors, four of whom are 
independent, in compliance with Section 
177 of the Act. They meet quarterly to 
review Internal Audit reports submitted 
by the Internal Auditor. The Committee 
scrutinizes and evaluates key audit 
findings to ensure robust financial and 
internal controls, risk management 
systems, and processes. Regular 
audits and reviews reinforce these 
systems. The internal auditor provides 
the Committee with key audit finding 
status updates quarterly to ensure 
resolutions are implemented. Deloitte 
Haskins and Sells LLP audited our 
financial statements, issuing a report 
on our internal controls over financial 
reporting, as defined under Section 143 
of the Companies Act, 2013, which is 
included in our annual report.

implementation of an internal control 
framework, as defined under Section

Regulations, 2015, the Statutory 
Auditors, along with Audit Committee 
have opined that the company has, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such controls operated 
effectively during the year.
The management believes that 
strengthening ICS is a continuous 
process and therefore will continue 
its efforts in making controls smarter 
with focus on preventive and automated 
controls as opposed to manual controls. 
The company has robust ERP and 
other supplementary IT systems which 
are an integral part of internal control 
framework. The company continues 
to constantly leverage technology in 
enhancing its internal controls.
