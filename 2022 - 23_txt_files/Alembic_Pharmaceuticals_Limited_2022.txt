nity

patient safety.
Portal for reporting side effects of products 
has been set up for keeping a record

administration. The Company has provided a 
customer care number on the site to contact 
in case of Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR). Also, 
Corrective Action Preventive Actions (CAPA)

environmental stewardship, and 
social well-being. By integrating 
sustainability into supply chain 
strategies, companies gain 
numerous benefits, from cost 
savings and risk mitigation to 
enhanced brand value and 
competitive advantage. However, 
any ESG violation within the supply 
chain can lead to loss of business 
from reputed customers and can 
negatively company’s reputation.
The Company has implemented ‘sustainability 
assurance across value chain’ procedures, 
wherein its critical suppliers are assessed on 
ESG parameters. Evaluation of its suppliers is 
done based on two methods, as mentioned 
below:
• 
 Audit Method: Under this method, the 
Company assesses its major suppliers on 
sustainability parameters by conducting an 
on-site audit and providing ratings to them, 
which is used during the procurement 
activities such as contract renewal
• 
 Checklist Method: The Company collects 
sustainability data from its suppliers 
through a checklist and collate it to rate 
them accordingly
Negative cost 
implication due to 
additional measures 
being taken to 
ensure sustainability 
across supply chain.

14. Waste Man-
agement
Risk
Due to their nature of industry, 
waste generation is unavoidable 
in operations. Irresponsible waste 
management including improper 
disposal, incineration of hazardous 
waste, poor management of 
biomedical waste, battery waste 
will lead to harmful effect on 
environment.
The Company is taking several steps to ensure 
its responsible waste management: 
• 
 The Company has developed a robust 
mechanism to divert high calorific waste to 
cement industry for co-processing. 
•   The Company has mechanism for 
recycling of product as well as waste. It 
has taken a special drive for collection of 
plastic waste in neighbouring village and 
use the same for recycled plastic material. 
•   The Company adopts sustainable practices

packaging materials.
Negative implication 
due to cost incurred 
in handling and safe 
disposal of waste.
15. Climate 
Change 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Due to rapidly evolving stress on 
climate change and responsible 
operations, it is imperative to 
recognize the significance of GHG 
emissions and its impact towards 
climate change. The management 
of GHG emissions is a scattered 
and complex process, which can 
lead to critical risk.
The Company has extensive plans to 
reduce its GHG emissions. This includes 
use of solar power internally, installation of 
windmill, purchasing renewable power for its 
operations, and increase in efficiency for its 
manufacturing sites.
Identification of the risk and control measures 
regarding climate related risks and Global 
Climate issues are addressed through its 
corporate policies.
Positive implication 
due to process 
improvement, 
energy efficiency, 
and improved 
stakeholder output.

substances which may have health 
impacts.
The Company has its EHS policy which gives 
a broad framework for various environmental 
related systems and processes being followed. 
There is a structure of EHS personnel in 
all sites to ensure that safety policies and

17. Energy 
Management
Risk
The effective use of energy 
sources is mandatory to manage 
cost to company and reduce 
environmental burden. With 
evolving focus on climate, the use 
of conventional fuels including 
fossil fuels is going to diminish.
Alembic has generously invested in renewable 
energy that includes:
1.  Increasing its solar energy capacity 
by installing roof solar panels and the 
Company is in process of setting up a solar 
plant of 12 MW.
2.  Installation of windmills to increase the 
share of renewable energy. 
The Company is working extensively in 
development of flow chemistry as well for its 
production process, which is likely to result in 
improvement of yield, energy consumption 
reduction.
Negative impact 
due to increased 
cost of fuel 
and capex in 
energy efficiency 
appliances. 
However, positive 
financial impact is 
expected in long-
run due to lower 
cost of energy.
18. Water 
Management
Risk
Excessive consumption and toxic 
discharge are implications of faulty 
water management which poses 
risks of regulatory restrictions, 
stakeholder activism, and 
operational shutdown. Continual 
supply is necessary to support 
multiple activities like heating, 
cooling, washing, distillation and 
other manufacturing activities 
throughout the production 
process.
Alembic is working in multiple avenues for 
responsible water management. 
• 
 The Company has converted all its API 
site to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and 
all its formulation units uses their treated 
effluents in gardening and as process 
inputs. 
•   In its efforts to restore ground water, the 
Company has made numerous charging 
wells and is adding more every year. 
•   The Company effectively uses its waste 
water by using domestic treated water in 
gardening and industrial treated water in 
boilers and chillers. 
The Company has constructed artificial ponds 
at some sites for effective rainwater harvesting.
Negative implication 
due to cost incurred 
in handling and safe 
disposal.
