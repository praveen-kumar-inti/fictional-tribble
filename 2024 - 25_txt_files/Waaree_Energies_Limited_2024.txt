CHAIRMAN & MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT – DR. HITESH CHIMANLAL DOSHI
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report – FY 2024–25
At Waaree Energies Limited, we view sustainability not as a responsibility alone, but as a strategic advantage 
that drives long-term growth and resilience. FY 2024–25 has been a year of strong progress—both in business 
performance and in our commitment to the principles of responsible corporate conduct. This BRSR reflects our 
unwavering focus on building a future-ready, purpose-driven organisation that creates shared value for all 
stakeholders. We continue to lead India’s solar manufacturing landscape with an installed module capacity of 15 GW 
and a rapidly expanding solar cell manufacturing capacity of 5.4 GW. This integrated infrastructure enables Waaree 
to ensure better control over quality, reduce supply chain dependency, and improve cost efficiency. Our solar 
cell facility incorporates advanced technologies, positioning us as one of the few Indian players with end-to-end 
capabilities spanning wafer to module.
Our national presence across 25 Indian states and exports to 24 countries has taken our cumulative global footprint 
to approximately 15 GW—making Waaree one of the most recognised Indian solar brands internationally.
Beyond modules and cells, Waaree Energies Limited has evolved into a diversified clean energy solutions provider.
Waaree Energies Limited has a diverse portfolio across several key business verticals. Our Project Development & EPC 
segment has successfully commissioned over 1.1 GW of solar projects in utility-scale and commercial & industrial 
(C&I) sectors, delivering turnkey solutions with reliable performance. As an Independent Power Producer (IPP), 
we are actively expanding our green power generation footprint. Our Rooftop & Distributed Solar initiatives have 
facilitated widespread solar adoption, with thousands of installations catering to MSMEs, institutions, and residential 
customers. Waaree Energies Limited is also expanding into Energy Storage & Hybrid Solutions, working on solar-
plus-storage and hybrid renewable energy projects to enable 24x7 clean energy availability. We are also focusing 
on Emerging Areas, such as Green Hydrogen & Smart Solutions, where ongoing R&D initiatives and pilot projects are 
helping us build foundational capabilities for future energy innovations.
Our business has grown in scale and impact, supported by 100% sustainable sourcing, best-in-class ESG integration 
across operations, and a clear roadmap towards net-zero emissions by 2040. Our approach to energy, water, 
emissions, and waste is guided by industry-leading standards and a deep commitment to environmental 
stewardship. Notably, our operations maintained zero regulatory penalties and ensured full compliance across all 
nine National Guidelines On Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles—an affirmation of our governance 
and ethical rigour. We are proud of the progress made in people-centric initiatives. With 100% performance reviews, 
strong safety frameworks covering all employees and workers, and proactive engagement with our value chain 
on human rights and working conditions, we are fostering a culture of responsibility and inclusion. Our structured 
stakeholder engagement—from employees and communities to global investors—continues to strengthen trust 
and transparency.
Looking ahead, we remain firmly optimistic. Our readiness to serve global markets, including the United States, 
is strengthened by our compliance with IRA, ULFP, and FEOC norms. These strategic alignments, combined with 
manufacturing from our Brookshire, Texas facility in USA, position us to accelerate global growth, backed by 
operational excellence, technological innovation, and a sustainability-first mindset.
At Waaree Energies Limited, we are not just responding to the future—we are shaping it. With clarity in purpose and 
strength in execution, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable impact and long-term value. I extend my 
sincere appreciation to our stakeholders and invite you to continue partnering with us on this journey towards a 
brighter, cleaner, and more responsible world.
