local communities.
Implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) process to treat, 
recycle, and reuse water, minimizing pollution and conserving 
resources. Health & Safety Management Plan and Onsite/
Offsite Emergency Management Plans are in place, along with 
continuous risk assessment and mitigation. Use of biofuels in 
captive power plant and installation of Continuous Air Quality 
Monitoring System (CAQMS) further reduce environmental 
footprint. Regular training ensures safe working conditions. 
Additionally, the company actively engages in plantation drives 
and community upliftment programs to address social concerns. 
Waste management complies with environmental regulations 
through authorized disposal and recycling channels. These
