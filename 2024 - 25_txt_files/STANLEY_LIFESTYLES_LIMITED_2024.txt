Risk
Risk

losses resulting from failure 
to comply with the industry 
laws and regulations. Failure 
to adhere to the laws would 
directly affect the Company's 
revenue, valuations and could 
lead to loss of reputation 
and business opportunities.

and provides a broader insight 
to the investors.
The company has a code 
of conduct and an insider 
trading 
policy 
in 
place.

The 
Company strives to ensure 
compliance with the various 
Corporate 
Governance 
Requirements

the 
Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Board of India.
Non-compliance 
would 
lead to loss of reputation 
and 
consequently 
affect 
the 
business 
activities.

are 
compliant with the regulatory 
laws have a better ability to 
manage risks and builds a 
better sense of fairness and 
loyalty 
among 
employees 
and other stakeholders.

At Stanley Lifestyles Limited, we uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethical business practices. To reinforce this 
commitment, we have adopted a comprehensive Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy that applies to all employees, 
directors, associates, and third parties acting on behalf of the company.
	
The policy is designed to prevent and prohibit bribery, corruption, and related unethical practices across all levels of the 
organization. Employees are strictly prohibited from offering, promising, or providing anything of value to government officials, 
individuals, or entities to unduly influence their actions or secure business advantages. Similarly, accepting gifts, favours, or 
entertainment that may compromise business judgment is strictly prohibited.
	
All stakeholders share the responsibility of ensuring compliance with this policy. Violations may lead to severe consequences, 
including civil or criminal liability, fines, and legal prosecution. To facilitate transparency, the company provides a designated 
reporting channel for individuals to report any suspected violations without fear of retaliation.
	
The policy is periodically reviewed and updated to align with evolving legal and regulatory requirements. The web link to the 
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy is provided below:

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
We actively involve stakeholders in our discussions on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters across our 
different departments, promoting continuous collaboration. We consistently gather feedback and integrate it into our 
strategic framework to guarantee that our actions are in line with our mission and vision. Key issues are thoroughly evaluated, 
prioritized, and communicated with relevant stakeholders for discussion, taking into account their potential impact on our 
operations and the interests of those involved.
	
During the quarterly meetings, our top-level executives and board members discuss stakeholder feedback and potential 
initiatives, ensuring they are taken into account when making strategic decisions.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No)
	
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
	
We proactively interact with both internal and external stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of their 
requirements and obstacles across all business areas associated with environmental, social, and governance (ESG). The 
feedback we receive is thoroughly analysed and incorporated into our decision-making process. As an example, we engage 
in open dialogues with stakeholders to pinpoint material topics that have a substantial influence on our operations. These 
significant issues influence our focus areas when creating environmental, social, and governance policies, formulating 
strategic plans, and developing actionable strategies for consideration.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
We are dedicated to enhancing the well-being of disadvantaged communities residing near our production sites. As part of 
our corporate social responsibility (CSRs) efforts, we concentrate on community development projects in various sectors, 
including health, education, job skills, sanitation, and livelihood opportunities. For example, our primary school building that 
is currently under construction in a rural area of Karnataka. Furthermore, we actively promote sustainable livelihoods and 
capacity building by directly collaborating with small and marginal suppliers, placing a significant emphasis on sourcing from 
local micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

6.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Our organization's human rights policy, which is a part of our broader business responsibility policy, provides a framework 
for guiding our actions and establishing ethical standards. When a human rights complaint is brought forward, a systematic 
resolution process is implemented. The human resources (HR) team at the specific facility conducts a comprehensive 
investigation to guarantee a successful resolution. When the situation demands additional intervention, the matter is 
escalated to senior management for immediate action and resolution.
	
Furthermore, we have a specific policy in place that addresses the prevention of sexual harassment (posh). In order to 
maintain a secure and respectful workplace, we have set up an internal complaints committee (IC) to address sexual 
harassment cases, ensuring confidentiality and impartiality in the process. The ICC functions with efficiency, guaranteeing 
that investigations are finished within a seven-day timeframe. Both sides are provided with an equal chance to present their 
arguments, and all pertinent evidence is thoroughly examined. After carefully evaluating the complaint, the IC determines 
its validity. If a complaint is determined to be false, the appropriate action is taken against the complainant. In the event that 
sexual harassment is proven, we promptly and firmly address the issue, implementing disciplinary measures against the 
offender to safeguard the complainant's welfare.
