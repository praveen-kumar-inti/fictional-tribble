VII.	 Transparency and Disclosures Compliances 
25.	 Complaints/Grievances on any of the principles (Principles 1 to 9) under the National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct:
	
Tata Consumer Products Ltd strictly follows the Tata Code of Conduct, ensuring that all stakeholders including employees, 
vendors, consultants, suppliers, and directors uphold the highest ethical business standards. Any violations of this Code of 
Conduct, company policies, or corporate laws must be reported by those associated with the organization.
	
To facilitate this, we have established an Ethics & Compliance Hotline for reporting concerns. Additionally, an independent, 
third party managed whistle-blower mechanism allows stakeholders to raise issues confidentially, without fear of 
victimization, retaliation, or reprisal. All complaints are thoroughly reviewed by designated ethics and compliance personnel, 
who ensure appropriate action is taken in each case.
5
	
The Ethics & Compliance Helpline ensures that all grievances are directed to the appropriate ethics and compliance 
personnel for thorough evaluation and investigation. When necessary, independent external entities are engaged to conduct 
investigations of the complaints. To maintain confidentiality, complainants are not required to disclose their identity when 
filing a complaint. Upon submission, each complainant receives a unique case reference number, which allows them to track 
the progress of their complaint after 45 days. In cases where a complainant faces retaliation or victimization for reporting 
an issue, they can seek further assistance from the Ethics Committee.
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues –
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach

We take a consultative approach to identify issues that are material to our business. Through comprehensive engagement 
with internal and external stakeholders, we assess ESG-related challenges and opportunities, prioritizing key areas based 
on stakeholder feedback, sectoral and peer analysis, and alignment with both Indian and global ESG standards.
	
The Materiality section of this report provides an in-depth overview of our materiality assessment process, methodologies, 
and key findings. Additionally, this report has enhanced its coverage of risk management, integrating ESG-related topics

1
Product 
Stewardship
R/O
Risk: Poor product quality 
entails risk of product 
recalls and customer 
complaints. Counterfeit 
products, if left unchecked, 
could compromise 
consumer health and 
wellbeing. Both these 
risks could result in 
erosion of consumer trust 
and loyalty.
Opportunity: With 
consumers increasingly 
prioritizing sustainability, 
there is a rising demand 
for transparency 
regarding the 
environmental impact 
of products across 
their lifecycle, including 
packaging materials and 
waste management.
TCPL has established a 
comprehensive quality 
assurance program, 
enforcing strict supplier 
standards for raw material 
safety and conducting 
residue testing across 
all regions. We have set 
clear, measurable ‘healthy 
nutrition’ benchmarks for 
our product innovations 
while actively advancing 
sustainable packaging 
solutions.
Our extensive network of 
distributors and retailers 
enables us to cater to 
millions of consumers daily. 
This has strengthened 
our market presence in 
semi-urban and rural areas 
while also serving as an 
effective safeguard against 
counterfeit products.
Positive: Investing in 
technology enhances 
product safety and quality, 
reducing risks associated 
with counterfeit products 
and strengthening product 
stewardship. This proactive 
approach minimizes potential 
financial losses from recalls 
and legal liabilities while 
reinforcing consumer trust 
and brand value.
Additionally, the rising 
demand for healthy and 
nutritious products presents 
a significant revenue growth 
opportunity. By aligning 
with this trend, the company 
can expand its market 
share, drive higher sales, 
and enhance long-term 
profitability.

Access to 
nutrition
O
Opportunity: Providing 
access to nutritious and 
health-focused products 
is essential in combating 
malnutrition, promoting 
proper nutrition and 
fostering overall well-
being.
Not Applicable
Positive: Our products 
are part of the everyday 
consumption habits of 
a broad customer base, 
offering us the opportunity 
to deliver healthy nutrition 
and the potential to positively 
influence the lives of millions. 
As consumer demand for 
healthy and nutritious 
products increases, it signals 
a prospect for our top-line 
growth. We are proactively 
seeking both organic and 
inorganic methods to 
support the nutritional needs 
and preferences of our 
consumers.
3
Consumer  
Connect
R/O
Risk: The success of our 
products depends on our 
ability to swiftly adapt 
to changing consumer 
preferences and market 
trends.
Opportunity: With a 
notable shift in global 
consumer behaviour 
towards health-
focused products and 
trusted brands, TCPL is 
strategically positioning 
itself to leverage these 
emerging trends and 
capitalize on the growing 
demand.
We closely monitor 
consumer trends, driving 
innovation through a 
dedicated funnel and 
launching multiple brand 
extensions. Technology 
supports efficient project 
tracking, backed by a well-
defined NPD stage gate 
process.
TCPL has established 
comprehensive ‘For Better’ 
Claims Guidelines designed 
to address consumer needs, 
covering a broad spectrum 
of claims—from sensory 
appeal to ingredient-specific 
assertions.
Positive: Prioritizing 
consumer satisfaction and 
well-being enhances brand 
loyalty, leading to higher 
repeat purchases and long-
term customer retention. This 
drives sustained revenue 
growth, strengthens market 
position, and contributes to 
overall financial stability and 
profitability.
4
Water 
security
R/O
Opportunity: Improving 
water efficiency can 
translate into lowering of 
freshwater withdrawal. 
Conservation methods 
beyond the fence also 
contributes positively to 
the surrounding water 
ecosystem.
Risk: Water security 
poses a potential 
challenge, with increasing 
water shortages 
potentially impacting 
business continuity and 
long-term operational 
sustainability.
Our water risk mitigation 
strategy encompasses 
prudent use of withdrawn 
water, runoff and rainwater 
harvesting, Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) at plants, 
the use of eco-pulpers to 
reduce water consumption, 
and drive improved Water 
Use Efficiency. To ensure 
operational resilience, we 
conduct comprehensive 
water risk assessments, 
including detailed source 
water vulnerability studies 
for specific business 
segments. For further 
details, refer to the ‘For 
Better Planet’ section of this 
report.
Positive: Improve water 
usage efficiency and 
utilisation of conservation 
techniques like RWH 
can lead to lowering the 
dependencies on freshwater 
withdrawal.
Negative: Lack of water 
water risk mitigation 
strategies may result 
in overdependence on 
freshwater sources which 
can present a business 
continuity challenge including 
financial implications.

Statement by

for the business 
responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG 
related challenges, 
targets, and 
achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility 
regarding the  
placement of this 
disclosure)
Embedding Sustainability continues to be one of the 6 strategic pillars that are central to Tata Consumer Products journey of 
growth & transformation. Our ‘For Better Living’ ESG roadmap is inspired by ‘Project Aalingana’ at the Tata Group level, as also 
the expectations that our Stakeholders have from us in every market that we operate in. 
Specifically, we are designing and implementing initiatives along the four pillars of : For better sourcing, For better planet, For 
better communities, and For better nutrition. While having set out FY2040 and FY20230 targets, we have also set medium term 
milestones that we are on track to meet by FY26. These include our commitments of becoming Scope 1 and 2 neutral, raising 
our renewables share to 35% in our total power demand across geographies, Zero waste to landfill across all geographies and 
ensure 70% of all our packaging material is recyclable, compostable, or reusable across all geographies.  
On a proactive basis, we have sought to assess a range of risks and implement relevant steps for mitigation. In alignment with 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have adopted a robust climate risk assessment framework 
that effectively identifies and mitigates both physical and transition risks. As a part of the For Better Planet theme, Tata 
Consumer Products is aligning its GHG emissions targets with the Aalingana project of the Tata Group. Our Eaglescliffe factory 
in the UK uses offsite solar power for its operations and has also installed a biomass boiler for reducing its GHG emissions, 
resulting in 97% of renewable energy usage. The site was also one of the first in the UK to achieve ISO 50001 demonstrating 
strong energy management. Our different factories in India have also commissioned solar PV modules using the latest multi-
crystalline technology. 
We have now undertaken a comprehensive Biodiversity risk assessment as per the global framework of Taskforce on Nature-
related Financial Disclosure [TNFD]. Aligned to this, we adopted the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare) approach to 
systematically map our dependencies, risks, and intervention areas, enabling a proactive response to nature-related challenges.
With our continued focus on Value chain sustainability, we released our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy to further strengthen 
our governance on this crucial subject. To substantiate this, we also conducted an internal assessment on the ESG risks in Supply 
chain to better our understanding of the issues of relevance from a Sustainability perspective.
In our quest For Better Communities, we aspire to positively impact 1.75 million beneficiaries by 2026. As per our latest third party 
conducted impact assessment, we have already reached out to almost 1.5 million beneficiaries as of March 2024.Our initiatives 
are focused around sustainable livelihoods, rural development, education and skilling, public health, and water conservation. 
Am pleased to share that as recognition of our efforts, Tata Consumer Products has been included in the Sustainability Yearbook 
2024 by S&P Global Sustainable 1. We have also been recognized as the ‘Most Sustainable Consumer Goods Company (India)’ 
and No.2 in the ‘Top 50 Most Sustainable Companies across sectors (India)’ in Business World’s IMSC rankings, 2024. 
Our ESG Risk Rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics has improved by 15%, transitioning to a ‘Medium’ risk status. Our MSCI 
rating remains unchanged at ‘A’, indicating continued strong performance. Additionally, our CDP Climate Change Rating and 
CDP Water Rating both stand at ‘B’, reflecting our substantial efforts towards managing environmental challenges.
We remain focused on ESG excellence with a commitment to create lasting value for all stakeholders as we continue our journey 
#forbetter.

increasing the use of renewable energy with additional solar 
capacity, transitioning from furnace oil to solid fuel for boilers, 
optimizing water consumption, and reducing coal handling 
losses. Additionally, the implementation of energy-efficient 
vacuum pumps and the repair of compressed air leaks contribute 
to significant power savings, further enhancing sustainability 
and reducing operational costs across various factories.

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
	
	
Yes, we are dedicated to building a sustainable supply chain framework. To achieve this, we have instituted policies 
including the Supplier Code of Conduct and the Green Procurement Policy. By fostering a collaborative approach, we 
encourage the adoption of sustainable practices across our value chain. Sustainability is at the core of our sourcing 
strategy for tea, coffee, water, and food products, ensuring a balance between economic, environmental, and social 
equity in production. As a founding member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP), a non-profit coalition of tea companies 
committed to improving the livelihoods of tea workers and their environments, we strive to create a socially and 
environmentally responsible tea industry. Our goal is to drive sustainable growth across the entire tea supply chain, 
from cultivation to consumption, and we have made significant progress toward this vision.
	
	
As part of our international business strategy, we have partnered with the Rainforest Alliance, a global non-profit 
dedicated to biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. This partnership helps us address key sustainability 
challenges in the tea and coffee industry. Additionally, we are proud to be a founding member of the Trustea 
sustainability code and verification system for the Indian tea sector. TCPL actively procures trustea certified tea in India, 
with 60% of our tea in FY 2024-25 being trustea certified. Our commitment to responsible sourcing is further reflected 
in our Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices certification, which ensure ethical sourcing standards in coffee procurement. 100% 
of our coffee plantations are Rainforest Alliance (RA) certified, and majority of our tea estates hold both Rainforest 
Alliance (RA) and Trustea certifications. As a Sedex member, our commitment to responsible sourcing and maintaining 
an ethical, sustainable supply chain is paramount. By utilizing Sedex's tools and services, we collaborate with our 
suppliers as a medium for congruency on principles of Sustainable operations. 
	
	
Furthermore, as we enrich our food products, we remain committed to adhering strictly to established guidelines for 
food fortification such as Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Recommended Dietary Intake 
(RDI) and expect our suppliers to follow the same. We are committed to preserving the natural integrity and nutritional 
value of our unpolished pulses and spices, ensuring they retain their essential oils and health benefits. Our organic 
pulses are sourced from farms certified by the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) in India and the 
National Organic Program (NOP USDA) in the United States, guaranteeing adherence to organic farming practices 
without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.
	
	
For a comprehensive understanding of our ethical sourcing practices, please refer ‘For Better Sourcing’ section 
of this report.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
We have implemented structured procedures to uphold sustainable sourcing across our operations. All our packaging 
vendors comply with sourcing standards, as outlined in our purchase order terms and contracts, which clearly define 
our social, ethical, and environmental expectations. In FY 25, we sourced 60% of our tea from Trustea-certified sources 
in India, further reinforcing our commitment to sustainable sourcing practices. Additionally, our Tetley tea, Good Earth 
in UK are 100% Rainforest Alliance (RA) certified. In India, majority of our tea plantations are certified to Trustea 
and Rainforest Alliance (RA) while all our coffee plantations are certified to Rainforest Alliance (RA). Apart from 
this, 4000+ small coffee growers that are part of our supply chain are Starbucks Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E) 
practices certified.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of

We emphasize the safe and responsible disposal of waste, covering both hazardous and non-hazardous materials, in all 
our manufacturing facilities. Our waste disposal procedures are meticulously designed to comply with state regulations, 
ensuring compliance at every stage. To manage hazardous waste effectively, we collaborate with authorized recyclers 
recognized by the State Pollution Control Boards.
	
As a founder member of the India Plastics Pact, we place strong emphasis on reclaiming packaging materials after consumer 
use. Through partnerships with designated waste recyclers, we facilitate the collection, reprocessing, and responsible 
disposal of waste materials. Additionally, we have fully complied with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandate, 
achieving 100% compliance requirements during the fiscal year.

the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide. steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to our operations. We are diligent in ensuring that all waste is 
responsibly managed by working with authorized vendors who recycle or repurpose the materials, effectively keeping them 
out of landfills. In a significant environmental accomplishment, all of our beverage production facilities in India continue 
to retain the status of zero waste to landfill. In compliance with India's Plastic Waste Management Rules, our EPR Plan 
commits to the collection and recycling of 100% of our plastic packaging waste, adhering to the standards mandated by 
the Central Pollution Control Board.

Permanent Employees
We have implemented a strong system to address any concerns promptly and effectively. All 
employees, whether permanent or non-permanent, have clear channels to raise their grievances 
either directly with their line manager or through our dedicated HR SPOC (Single Point of 
Contact). When a grievance is brought to our attention, we engage directly with the employee 
to fully grasp the nature of the concern and identify potential resolutions. Our aim is to address 
each issue thoroughly and promptly, with the intent of nurturing a work environment that is both 
supportive and favorable for everyone.
Other than Permanent 
Employees
Permanent Workers
For our permanent workers, our grievance redressal mechanism includes a process through 
which workers can voice their concerns or grievances via their Workmen Representatives/
Unions. We actively participate in joint meetings with these representatives to address the 
grievances raised, ensuring timely and transparent feedback on the status of each issue. This 
collaborative approach highlights our commitment to maintaining open communication and 
resolving concerns effectively, contributing to a harmonious and productive work environment.
Other than Permanent 
Workers
For non-permanent workers, we have established a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism 
to ensure that the concerns of workers employed through contractors are heard and addressed. 
Through this system, contractors are empowered to raise grievances on behalf of their 
employees. We facilitate joint meetings with contractors to thoroughly assess and resolve 
any issues that arise. Additionally, we mandate contractors to provide regular updates on the 
status of grievances, ensuring transparency and keeping all parties informed about the progress 
in resolving concerns. This approach reinforces our commitment to maintaining a fair and 
supportive work environment for everyone involved in our operations.

6.	
Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief. 
	
We implement an open-door policy to foster clear communication and effectively address employee concern in facilities 
where unions are not operational. Employees are encouraged to reach out to designated points of contact, such as the floor 
supervisor, welfare officer, or directly to the unit head, all of whom are clearly identified and communicated.
	
We ensure an environment that is both supportive and responsive, where employees are encouraged to express their 
concerns and play a role in enhancing the workplace's overall wellbeing. We have ICC (internal complaints committee) as 
per the provisions of the POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) Act at each region/ unit level, the committee members 
are well-trained and easily approachable to all employees and workers. Thus, all complaints are handled by dedicated 
ethics and compliance personnel, with clearly established channels for reporting grievances, as outlined in Section A, Q25.

10.	 Health and safety management system: 
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, what is the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes, the company has implemented a health and safety management system across all TCP entities globally 
except plantations.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity? 
	
	
TCP employs several processes to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-routine 
bases. Here's a breakdown of the processes involved:
	
	
Unified Risk Assessment Process: This process is deployed across all work locations. It involves systematically 
identifying potential work-related hazards involved in activities. These hazards are then mapped to each routine 
activity, and the associated risks are evaluated and categorized as High, Medium, Low, or Significant. This information 
is digitized for easy access and reference.
	
	
Assessment of Non-Routine Activities: Hazards associated with non-routine activities are assessed during the activity 
planning stage. This assessment is a collaborative effort between the operations team and the Health & Safety team. 
Weekly reviews are conducted to ensure that potential hazards are identified and addressed effectively.
	
	
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Permit to Work System: For all non-routine activities, a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is 
conducted, and a permit-to-work system is adhered to before commencement of work. These processes ensure that 
potential risks are identified, and necessary precautions are taken to mitigate them.
	
	
Hierarchy of Risk Control Measures: TCP adopts a hierarchy of risk control measures to determine the most effective 
ways to mitigate identified risks. This includes conducting Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) to 
identify and mitigate potential risks.
	
	
Implementation of Control Measures: Once the risk control measures are determined, the Operation Control Procedures 
are developed and they are implemented to mitigate identified risks effectively. Regular safety talks and Health & 
Safety (H&S) time-outs are provided to workers to communicate available control measures and ensure that all safety 
protocols are being followed.
	
	
By employing these processes, TCP ensures a comprehensive approach to identifying work-related hazards, assessing 
risks, and implementing control measures to promote a safe working environment for its employees.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
	
	
In our organization, we have established comprehensive processes to facilitate the reporting of work-related hazards 
by workers and to enable them to remove themselves from such risks. Proactive reporting is a fundamental component 
of our health and safety management system, and we maintain entry records that meticulously document Unsafe Acts, 
Unsafe Conditions, Safe Acts, and Near Miss cases, which are promptly addressed to prevent incidents. To encourage 
workers to report hazards, we have implemented various reporting channels, including reporting slips, QR code 
reporting, documentation during toolbox talks, and informal interactions. Additionally, we conduct regular rewards 
and recognition programs across all operation sites to incentivize proactive safety actions. Furthermore, workers 
are empowered to remove themselves from situations where they perceive imminent risk to their health and safety, 
supported by clear protocols outlining the steps to take in such scenarios, such as notifying supervisors or safety 
21
personnel and relocating to a safe area. Through these measures, we aim to foster a culture of safety and maintain a 
secure work environment for all employees.
	
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
	
	
Yes. TCP employees have access to health and wellbeing services through a comprehensive medical coverage. 
In addition to a dedicated hospital in Munnar, employees at other locations are covered by medical insurance and/ESI 
for themselves and their families.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
	
We have instituted a comprehensive suite of protocols designed to secure a workplace that prioritizes the safety and health 
of every employee. These protocols are detailed in our Safety, Health & Wellbeing Policy, which has been signed by the 
CEO, underscoring the organization's dedication to these essential standards. The meticulous execution of these health 
and safety measures is the responsibility of our country heads, who are tasked with overseeing their implementation within 
their specific areas of operation. Additionally, we are actively working towards obtaining 100% ISO 45001 Health & Safety 
Management System certification by the FY 2026, with 70% of our global operational sites already certified to this standard.
	
To monitor and enhance health and safety performance, we set key performance indicators (KPIs) annually, which include 
both lagging indicators (such as zero fatalities and reduction in Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR)) and proactive 
measures (such as safety reporting, training, and safety compliance audit scores). Senior management conducts monthly 
reviews of health and safety performance through in-depth discussions, ensuring continuous oversight. Additionally, safety 
committee meetings take place every month at all operational sites to strengthen adherence to safety protocols.
	
The organization has implemented a comprehensive safety program that includes regular workplace inspections, monthly/
quarterly safety walk audits by cross function teams, employee training on safety protocols, hazard identification and risk 
assessments, Management of change controls and the provision of personal protective equipment to minimize workplace 
hazards. Additionally, we have established a dedicated safety committee to continuously monitor and improve safety 
practices, fostering a culture of health and safety among employees. Safety Alerts are shared with all operational units 
as part of horizontal deployment and cross-site learning. Monthly Safety Snippets and H&S timeouts as a objective of 
dissemination of information and improving the knowledge relating to Safety and improve the culture. These initiatives 
highlight the organization's dedication to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment, reflecting our proactive 
approach to safeguarding employee well-being. Please refer the ‘Cultivating a Strong Culture of Safety’ section of this 
report for further details.

Throughout the year all major and minor safety-related incidents have been thoroughly investigated, and appropriate 
corrective actions have been implemented. Through assessments of health and safety practices and working conditions, 
several concerns were identified and promptly addressed through corrective actions, which were tracked using a Corrective 
and Preventive Action (CAPA) tracker for timely closure and horizontal deployment across all locations.
	
Recognizing the significant risk of hand injuries, particularly within our operational sites due to the crucial role of packing 
machines, we have implemented measures to enhance our processes and mitigate these risks. This includes establishing 
machine guarding compliance assurance protocols during the design phase and conducting regular compliance inspections. 
To ensure full compliance, we have integrated engineering control interlocks, conducted operator briefings, provided 
personnel training, and promoted awareness through safety initiatives, toolbox talks, and health and safety timeouts.

At Tata Consumer Products, our commitment to human rights is integral to our business ethos. We actively engage in addressing 
and mitigating human rights issues, guided by a policy that is aligned with the Tata Code of Conduct and guided by the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. In line with our policy, we have instituted an Apex Human Rights Committee and a 
Business & Human Rights Working Committee for effective management of human rights. The Apex Committee is chaired by 
the MD & CEO, and ensures policy compliance, integration of Human Rights into the company's overall strategy. This committee 
operates with clear responsibilities, key metrics, and a governance structure that extends throughout the organization.
	
Whereas the Business & Human Rights Working Committee is chaired by the Global Legal Counsel and supervises the 
execution of our sustainability plan. It ensures that our Business and Human Rights (BHR) policy is consistently applied 
across the organization, coordinating the efforts of various working groups. This comprehensive structure reflects our 
commitment to upholding human rights principles in every aspect of our operations.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
Our Tata Code of Conduct serves as a guiding framework for ethical business practices, setting the standard for integrity 
and responsibility across our operations. In line with this commitment, all stakeholders, including employees and partners, 
are obligated to report any suspected or actual violations of the Code, company policies, or legal regulations, ensuring 
transparency and accountability within our corporate ecosystem. We have set up an Ethics & Compliance Helpline, 
providing a confidential channel for raising concerns. Every complaint is thoroughly investigated by designated ethics and 
compliance personnel, with appropriate actions taken against those found responsible. This commitment to transparency, 
confidentiality, and fairness highlights TCPL’s dedication to upholding ethical standards and accountability.
	
All complaints are handled by dedicated ethics and compliance personnel, with well-defined channels for reporting 
grievances, as detailed in Section A, Q25.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
To safeguard complainants from negative repercussions in cases of discrimination and harassment, we place utmost 
importance on the comprehensive training of our POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment), with a particular focus on the 
criticality of confidentiality. We enforce a rigorous policy that strictly prohibits any form of retaliation against individuals who 
report genuine concerns. Violators of this policy will be held accountable and subjected to disciplinary actions. To create 
a safe environment for complainants and prevent any retribution, we conduct regular training and sensitization sessions 
for our POSH and Ethics Committee members. Additionally, we offer complainants the option to request team or location 
changes, or even extended leave, if necessary. All complaints are handled by dedicated ethics and compliance personnel, 
with clearly defined channels for reporting grievances, as outlined in Section A, Q25.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
We have incorporated a Human Rights clause into all our supplier agreements to address critical issues such as forced labour, 
child labour, discrimination, working hours, wages, and disciplinary actions. Our vendors are obligated to establish and 
enforce ethical and human rights policies, with effective procedures in place for addressing any violations to these policies.
	
The Supplier Code of Conduct is also an integral part of all our supplier contracts. This code comprehensively covers Human 
Rights, labour Standards, and Workplace Standards, ensuring that our commitment to ethical business practices is upheld 
across our entire supply chain.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
	
Yes, TCP has projects related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions, particularly through the utilization of alternate 
sources of energy.
	
Our direct emissions come from various fuel sources, including biomass, diesel, petrol, furnace oil, coal, LPG, kerosene etc. 
used in operational processes. The indirect energy requirements are met through grid electricity, with a strong emphasis on 
leveraging solar power for off-grid configurations, which contributes to greening the energy portfolio. This year, 24% of the 
power demand was met through renewable sources, including wind and solar energy, further supporting the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions.
	
The ICD Theni facility has successfully commissioned an additional 500 KWp solar power plant, complementing the existing 
1000 KWp plant. This enhancement brings the total solar capacity to 1.5 MWp, marking a significant step in the commitment 
to sustainable energy practices. Also, In FY 2024-25, we met 62% of its direct energy needs through bio-based fuels such as 
firewood, biomass pellets, spent tea waste, briquettes, and husk. This reflects a commitment to adopting energy solutions 
that are efficient and environmentally friendly.
7.	
Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) & its intensity, in the following

the complaint is documented into our system (Salesforce). Within 48 hours of documentation of the complaint, our CC team 
arranges for a replacement product to be dispatched via an authorized courier service. A sample related to the complaint is 
collected from the customer and sent to our Bangalore office through a TCP-authorized courier for further examination. If the
