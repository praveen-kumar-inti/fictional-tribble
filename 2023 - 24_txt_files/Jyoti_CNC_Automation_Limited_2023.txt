contribute to reduced 
carbon emissions.
We have installed Air 
Pollution Control Measures

includes dust collectors and 
cyclones, which are highly 
effective in capturing and 
reducing particulate matter 
and other pollutants.

discharge through certified 
vendors. 
Nonhazardous waste are 
being reused in production 
or being sold out.
Negative:

Opportunity
Company operates in 
highly technical sensitive 
market where innovation

process. 
Failure to offer innovative 
products, technology will 
lead to loss of customer

operations across various 
end user industries.
In the absence of 
personal development, 
self-motivation and team 
spirit amongst employees, 
Company could not grow 
and sustain its business 
operation in long run.   
On other hand, self-
motivated team having a 
team spirit not only make 
growth & development but 
bring satisfaction amongst 
stakeholders in their 
relationship with company.
A company treats its 
employee as its assets and 
so successful in building
