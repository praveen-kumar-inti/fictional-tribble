action by the authorities

which may lead to loss of 
business in case of coercive 
action by the authorities
3.
Health & Safety
Risk
Workplace hazards directly 
hamper 
the 
company’s 
productivity, 
finances 
and 
reputation. The repercussions 
and efforts to develop a safe/ 
hazard 
free 
environment 
would 
take 
time 
and 
resources to recover from. 
Effective health & safety 
practices 
boost 
employee 
morale, increase productivity 
and 
promote 
corporate 
responsibility.
The Company has taken 
initiatives to ensure the
well-being of its employees/
workers. 
Besides 
the 
mandatory 
coverage 
of 
eligible 
employees 
under 
ESI scheme, Group Health 
Insurance Cover is provided 
to all the employees and 
their families to cover their 
hospitalization 
bills.

The company is increasingly 
investing 
in 
preventive 
measures.

understanding, controlling
and eliminating the risks 
associated with
hazards at workplace are 
done on a regular basis.

mishaps and reduce costs 
associated with accidents and 
incidents, 
thereby 
leading 
to improved confidence and 
lower employee turnover rates 
in the company
4.
Regulatory 
& Legal 
Compliances
Risk
Risk 
of 
non-compliance 
exposes the organization to 
legal penalties and financial 
losses resulting from failure to 
comply with the industry laws 
and regulations. Failure to
adhere to the laws would 
directly affect the company’s 
revenue, valuations and could 
lead to loss of reputation and 
business opportunities. More 
compliant companies tend to 
have improved performances 
and better process efficiency. 
Compliance gives assurance 
and provides a broader insight 
to the investors.
The Company has a proper 
and adequate system of 
Internal Controls for fair 
reporting and compliance 
with all applicable regulatory 
laws and company policies. 
The company has code of 
conduct, 
whistle-blower 
and insider trading policies 
to safeguard the interests 
of the investors and other 
stakeholders.
Negative- 
Non-compliance 
would lead to loss of reputation 
and consequently affect the 
business activities. Companies 
who are compliant with the 
regulatory laws have a better 
ability to manage risks and 
build a better sense of fairness 
and loyalty among employees

The main sources of effluent generation from plant are from process, blow downs from boiler and cooling tower and domestic effluents, 
The effluents generated in the process are both Organic and inorganic in nature. For efficient treatment the effluents are segregated 
as process effluents and Non process effluents. Process effluents are sent to stripper for separation of VOC’s. After stripping, the 
stripped liquid (VOC) is sent to TSDF / authorized cement plants for co-incineration. After stripper, the process effluents are sent to 
MEE. The condensate is collected and further treated in Biological treatment plant. The residue from the MEE is dried in Agitated thin 
film drier (ATFD). The condensate from ATFD is collected and treated in Biological treatment plant. The dried mass from ATFD is packed 
in 1ton HDPE bags and sent to CWMP, for safe disposal in to secured land fill. Blow downs from cooling tower and boiler are sent to 
biological treatment plant. The treated water from Biological treatment plant is sent to REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANT (RO). RO Permeate is 
used for cooling tower makeup and reject is sent to MEE.
	
Domestic effluents are treated in Sewage treatment plant. The treated wastewater in STP is sent to RO, the RO Permeate is used for
