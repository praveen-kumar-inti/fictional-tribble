Hitachi Energy India strives to have a life-cycle perspective when managing environmental aspects and impact. This means 
looking beyond the environmental impact from its own operations to include its supply chain, the use of its products, and the 
end of their lives. Environmental considerations are constantly made to reduce environmental impact and risks over the lifespan 
of its solutions. Life-cycle Assessments (LCAs) and risks as well as collaboration with and feedback from customers are used as 
input for improving the environmental performance of its products, systems, and services.
For decades, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has been the norm in the electrification industry due to its excellent insultation and 
switching capabilities. However, it has high Global Warming Potential (GWP), and its life-cycle management requires careful 
handling. As part of its commitment to reduce emissions and enable a sustainable energy future, Hitachi Energy has invested in 
eco-efficient alternative solutions like EconiQ™ and enhanced SF6 life-cycle management striving for zero leaks. The Company 
will improve SF6 management through the implementation of a new SF6 management standard. 
The Company has implemented Environment Management System at all manufacturing & project sites as per ISO 14001:2015 
and certified by accredited third party. Environmental impacts are assessed for all processes and mitigation measures are in place.

stability thus making transformers more environmentally friendly. 
The Company has invested in Capex for upgrading and modernizing its production facilities to meet the customer and market 
needs and support the Company’s carbon neutrality program. During the year under review, the Company has completed 
major capex on upgrading thermic fluid heaters from Diesel to piped natural gas. A project was completed to bring the canal 
surface water for production facilities to stop extracting the ground water. One of its facilities, Halol switched over to surface 
water from ground water. This has decreased the water consumption by 15% as surface water is found to be of good quality 
and has reduced RO plant operations. R&D teams are working on Digitalization of product’s use and monitoring.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect 
and restore the environment  
Hitachi Energy is a global technology leader that is advancing a sustainable energy future for all. The Company serves customers in 
the utility, industry and infrastructure sectors with innovative solutions and services across the value chain. Together with customers 
and partners, the Company pioneers technologies and enable the digital transformation required to accelerate the energy transition 
towards a carbon-neutral future. Hitachi Energy is advancing the world’s energy system to become more sustainable, flexible and 
secure whilst balancing social, environmental and economic values.
To meet the changing needs of a growing population and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, large-scale volumes of variable energy 
generated from renewable sources need to be efficiently integrated into the world’s energy system. To facilitate the deployment of 
technology at the scale and speed required, the Company believes that it must adapt and adopt new business models and collaborate 
with all stakeholders to support sustainable, flexible and secure energy systems such as power grids. As more renewable power sources 
join to gradually replace carbon-based energy, the Company needs to ensure that its grids remain resilient, and become more flexible as 
they adapt to fast-changing demands and increasing decentralization. Only through effective digitalization of all elements of the energy 
value chain can this be delivered. While making energy more accessible, affordable, and sustainable, the Company also needs better 
energy efficiency at all stages of distribution and a reduced environmental footprint throughout the life cycle of all components.
Sustainability 2030 is a strategic plan for sustainability where Hitachi Energy summarizes the main commitments to act and drive 
business in a sustainable way. Based around four pillars: Planet, People, Peace and Partnerships. 
Looking ahead, Hitachi Energy is continuing to invest in its journey towards carbon-neutrality by further increasing energy 
efficiency, as well as electrifying its own operations.
Together with customers, partners, and key stakeholders, Hitachi Energy is contributing to accelerating the energy transition to 
ensure a sustainable energy future for all.

The Company continues to maintain 100% fossil free electricity consumption in its own operations. By achieving 100% 
fossil-free electricity in its own operations, the Company have reduced its CO2 equivalent emissions by more than 42% 
compared to previous year. 
The Company did this through projects generating own fossil-free electricity, such as installing solar roof panels, switching 
electricity contracts to green tariffs, buying International Renewable Energy Certificates (IRECs), and signing Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPA). 
To increase its share of renewable energy, 938KW of solar panel installations at Maneja is in progress and out of which 292 
KW is commissioned & operational. The Company introduced rooftop solar for the electrification of a project site office 
previous year and installed roof top solar at 4 more project sites in this financial year. 
The Company continued to maintain focus on remaining parts of the operations – where fossil fuel is directly used. To 
substitute HSD fuel with environment friendly PNG, projects were implemented in Thermic fluid heaters/Thermo-Pac 
boilers and completed in PT F2, IT & Traction factory. 
The Company is continuing to invest in its journey towards carbon-neutrality by further increasing energy efficiency, as 
well as electrifying its own operations.
The Company’s ambition extends beyond carbon-neutrality. The Company is working to reduce waste – along with its 
consumption of precious resources, like freshwater. The Company will support SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and 
Production) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). The Company will minimize the use of water, materials, pollution, and 
waste in its operations and throughout the life cycle of its solutions through a circular mindset.

Integration of sustainability considerations in Research & Development (R&D) gate models to ensure that Health, Safety, 
and Environment are considered and understood when assessing R&D projects. 
Reducing generations of waste and waste that are sent for final disposal remains the Company’s focal area. Waste 
reduction is incorporated in the product design stage to ensure waste minimization in manufacturing process. Source 
segregation of waste, in-house recycling of packaging materials and reuse continues to add more value to waste and 
reduces the quantum of non-recyclable wastes that are sent to landfills. All wastes are sent to relevant Pollution Control 
Board (PCB) authorized recyclers. Waste disposal is increased due to one-time waste of a power capacitor factory which 
is relocated from Peenya to Doddaballapur in Bangalore.

Does the entity have a Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
Yes, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is a part of Hitachi Energy’s organizational resilience program. It is designed to 
reduce the impact of a business interruption which could occur due to a range of events ranging from financial, natural 
causes or man-made events. It helps business unit/function to respond effectively to the disruption and restore its essential 
services and mission critical processes as quickly as possible to ensure timely recovery. It provides a reference tool for 
the actions required during or immediately following an emergency or incident that threatens to disrupt business unit/ 
functions normal business activities.
28
| HITACHI ENERGY INDIA LIMITED	
ANNUAL REPORT 2022–23
The key objectives of this business continuity plan are to:
•	
Identify advanced preparations and procedures that will enable Business Unit/Function to respond quickly to 
disruptive incidents and ensure continuity of critical business functions.
•	
Reduce employee injury or loss of life, and minimize damage and losses
•	
Have documented plans and procedures to ensure effective execution of recovery strategies for critical business 
functions.
•	
Reduce and mitigate disruptions to business operations.
•	
Identify teams which would need to respond to incidents and define specific responsibilities.
•	
Quantify the impact of incidents in terms of monetary, time, operations, and work force.
•	
Recover quickly from an emergency and resume full operations.
Steps
Key Business Processes & Recovery Priorities
List all the key processes and sub processes that must be maintained or quickly restored in the event of a disruptive incident. It 
provides a high-level description for each of the process and assigns a priority (criticality) ranking to each of them. 
Risk assessment
Risk Assessment (RA) is one of the main parts of the BCP system. The RA process involves identification, analysis, and 
evaluation of all possible risks, hazards, and threats to the operating environment, and defines likelihood / impact of disruptive 
events caused by such threats.
Once the risks have been identified, their impact on different aspects of operations are gauged. Those risks which affect 
mission-critical operations should be handled first. The following strategy is used to handle risks:
•	
Prevent – Risks which are of high probability with high impact. These risks must be attended first by using mitigation, 
prevention or any other strategy to lessen or avoid its impact.
•	
Accept – Risks which have low probability and low impact. Nothing specific needs to be done for such risks, but the 
organization should be vigilant. If a back-up strategy is put in place for such a risk, all the better.
•	
Contain – Risks which have a high probability of occurring but having low impact on operations. Use mitigation strategies 
to minimize impact of the risk on business operations.
•	
Plan – Low probability but high impact events. Though this may be once in a lifetime event, its impact could be disastrous. 
The business should plan the steps to be taken if such a risk occurs. Once the steps to be taken are in place, production 
can be resumed in the shortest possible time with the least loss.
Business Impact Analysis
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies and prioritizes the mission-critical business processes and key functions, disruption 
related operational impacts, and the resources (internal and external) required to recover critical operations.
A properly executed BIA will guide in reducing the overall operational and financial impacts, reduce potential losses, and enhance 
the business operations.
Business Continuity Strategy
Business Continuity Plan describes the strategy devised to maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption to operations. 
This strategy will be invoked when the primary facility(ies) are somehow be damaged or inaccessible, and business critical 
operations are interrupted.
Recovery Priorities
The strategy is to recover critical business functions at an alternate site location (if an off-site strategy has been put into effect 
to provide recovery service). Critical business functions are the most critical for immediate recovery at the secondary location.
