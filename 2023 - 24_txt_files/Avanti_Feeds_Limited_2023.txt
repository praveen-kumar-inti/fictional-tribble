Selling 
Practices
Opportu-
nity
•	 The shrimp feed industry 
is highly competitive, with 
many companies offering

entiate its products and 
stand out from the competi-
tion, which can attract more 
customers 
and 
increase 
sales.
•	 With the global demand 
for shrimp increasing, par-
ticularly in countries like the 
United States, Japan, and 
Europe, there is a grow-
ing market for high-quality 
shrimp feed and as such 
selling practices like engag-
ing with international buy-
ers, participating in trade 
shows, and complying with 
international 
regulations, 
Avanti taps into this market

ment
Opportu-
nity
•	 Effective energy man-
agement 
helps 
Avanti 
reduce its energy con-
sumption and lower the 
energy bills, leading to 
cost savings as produc-
tion of feed requires 
energy-intensive 
pro-
cesses such as grinding, 
mixing, and extrusion.
•	 Implementing 
energy 
practices 
is 
reducing 
company's carbon foot-
print and is contributing 
to environmental sus-
tainability as energy con-
sumption is a significant 
contributor 
to 
green-
house gas emissions.
•	 By setting up solar and 
wind

plants 
Avanti aims to reduce 
emissions and mitigate

systems.

report, 
highlighting ESG 
related challeng-
es, targets and 
achievements
As part of our commitment to transparency and sustainable practices, I am 
pleased to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for 
the fiscal year. At Avanti Feeds we recognize the importance of Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in our operations, especially in the 
aquaculture industry where responsible practices are paramount. Navigating 
the complex landscape of the industry presents several ESG challenges. 
Key among these are ensuring minimal environmental impact, maintaining 
high social standards across our supply chain, and adhering to stringent 
governance principles amidst evolving regulatory frameworks.
I am pleased to report significant progress towards our ESG goals:
•	 Environmental: Implemented water recirculation systems & Solar panels 
there by reducing water withdrawal and dependency on grid electricity.
•	 Social: Conducted 350+ training programs benefiting over 10,000+ 
farmers and community members on responsible practices.
•	 Governance: Secured certifications from various bodies and agencies for 
sustainable practices.
Moving forward, we remain committed to fostering a culture of transparency, 
accountability, and continuous improvement in our ESG performance. By 
integrating ESG considerations into our core business strategy, we aim to 
create long-term value for our stakeholders while contributing positively to 
the environment and communities in which we operate.

Krill Meal, Fish meal and Fish Oil Organization (IFFO 
RS), Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), Fishery 
Improvement Project (FIP), Round Table on Responsible 
Soy Association (RTRS), and ProTerra.
These suppliers adhere to rigorous standards, ensuring 
that the fish meal is free from antibiotics, pesticides, and 
pollutants, while the procured Soya is non-GMO and free 
from toxins, pesticides, and herbicides.
Furthermore, Avanti is committed in integrating social, 
ethical, and environmental considerations into its

our packaging material, we work closely with designated

In addition to our efforts around packaging waste, we 
also work to minimize production waste by reusing

We believe that sustainable production practices are 
critical to our long-term success, and we will continue

Moreover, we actively engage with our field staff to gather 
feedback and evaluate any risks they have encountered or 
envisaged. This feedback is carefully analysed to identify 
potential risks and formulate strategies to mitigate them 
effectively.
Additionally, we conduct quarterly risk assessments to 
proactively identify and address any potential risks facing our 
company. This process involves identifying potential safety 
hazards and implementing appropriate safety measures and 
protocols to mitigate or eliminate them.
c)
Whether 
you 
have 
processes for workers 
to report the work-
related hazards and 
to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the Company has dedicated process for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks.
At our Company, we believe that the best way to ensure a safe 
working environment is by encouraging feedback from our 
workers. One of the measures we have put in place is to actively 
encourage reporting of near misses, unsafe acts, and unsafe 
conditions. This dual benefit approach not only increases Health 
& Safety engagement but also helps to reduce risks through 
prompt rectification of the issues raised.
To facilitate this reporting process, each facility has a safety 
representative meeting on a quarterly basis, where safety 
representatives from the workforce can provide formal feedback 
on all safety matters. This provides a structured platform for 
workers to voice their concerns, make suggestions and receive 
feedback from management.
d)
Do 
the 
employees/ 
worker of the entity 
have access to non-
occupational medical 
and healthcare servic-
es? (Yes/ No)
Each site has pursued diverse certifications and adheres to 
the Group's policy concerning employee safety and well-being. 
Upholding these standards underscores our commitment 
to ensuring a secure and supportive environment for all our 
employees.
Furthermore, we continuously evaluate and update our safety 
protocols to align with evolving industry standards and best 
practices. Our dedication to employee safety extends beyond 
mere compliance; it reflects our unwavering commitment to 
fostering a culture of care and accountability across all locations. 
Through ongoing training, communication, and collaboration, 
we strive to empower every individual within our organization 
to prioritize their well-being and contribute to a safer workplace 
environment.

Avanti is deeply committed to upholding human rights, placing paramount importance on this 
fundamental principle. To ensure the safeguarding of these rights within our operations, we

only possesses the necessary expertise but also harbours a profound passion for ensuring that 
our business practices consistently align with our unwavering commitment to human rights.
Moreover, our commitment extends beyond mere rhetoric; we actively engage in frequent 
assessments and maintain an open dialogue with stakeholders. Through collaborative efforts 
with relevant organizations and stakeholders, we diligently identify and confront any potential 
adverse impacts on human rights. Our aim is not only to rectify any shortcomings but also

related to human rights issues. Foremost among these is the establishment of a confidential and 
easily accessible complaint system, allowing individuals to report any concerns they may have 
regarding human rights violations. These reports are meticulously investigated by a designated 
focal point, working in collaboration with the HR & Admin Manager, to ensure thorough scrutiny. 
Subsequently, appropriate remedial measures are swiftly implemented to address the issues 
raised, reaffirming our commitment to upholding human rights within our operations.
Furthermore, Avanti prioritizes transparency and open communication with all stakeholders, 
including local communities, civil society organizations, and relevant government agencies. 
Through these transparent channels, we actively solicit feedback and engage in constructive 
dialogue, ensuring that any grievances brought forward are promptly acknowledged and 
addressed in a timely and efficient manner. By fostering an environment of trust and 
accountability, we endeavour to uphold the principles of human rights and social responsibility 
across all facets of our organization.
