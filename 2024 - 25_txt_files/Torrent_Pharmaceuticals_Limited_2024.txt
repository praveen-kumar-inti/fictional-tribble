BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
FOREWORD
At Torrent Pharma, we believe that sustainable and responsible practices have become essential to long term value creation. By 
embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its strategic framework, the Company seeks to build a 
responsible, profitable, and enduring business that contributes meaningfully to sustainable development.
We continue to integrate principles of sustainability into decision making process through well defined goals and initiatives 
coupled with clear road map to achieve these objectives. Guided by the Core Value of “Concern for Society & Environment”, the 
Company has made notable progress across its sustainability focus areas: Carbon Emission and Energy Management, Water 
Stewardship and Waste Management. Through continuous investments in new equipment, process improvements and adoption 
of sustainable practices, the Company strives to build a cleaner and better future.
The Company recognises that integrating sustainability into its core operations is imperative for addressing critical global 
challenges, including climate change, resource scarcity, social inequality, and biodiversity loss. At the same time, this commitment 
to sustainability fosters innovation, enhances organisational resilience, and creates pathways for long-term value creation.
As a responsible Corporate Citizen, we are dedicated to creating a robust business that operates responsibly, aligning with 
national priorities such as zero-carbon objectives and adhering to recognised global frameworks like GRI, SASB and UN SDGs. 
In our ongoing sustainability journey and commitment to the National Voluntary Guidelines, we are delighted to present our 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) which outlines our efforts to uphold ethical governance, promote 
inclusive growth, and ensure environmental stewardship, in alignment with the principles laid out in the National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC).
The BRSR framework is based on the NGRBC principles comprising of three sections:
Section A presents a comprehensive overview of the Company’s business, encompassing the market it serves, financial 
performance, key employee statistics, engagement with related parties, Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives and transparency.
Section B outlines management and process disclosures related to the businesses highlighting the governance structures, 
policies and operational framework established to align with the NGRBC Principles and Core Elements.
Section C encompasses a comprehensive set of measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each of the nine principles which 
include ethical business practices, product stewardship, employee wellbeing, safety & development, stakeholder engagement, 
human rights, environmental stewardship, public policy advocacy, inclusive growth and responsible customer relationship.

Product 
quality and 
safety 
Risk
The use of high-quality and safe 
goods ensures that improved 
health outcomes are attained. 
Compromise on pharmaceutical 
product quality would imply a 
compromise on patients’ overall 
health and wellbeing. This will 
also entail failure to comply with 
GxP (Good Laboratory Practices, 
Good Manufacturing Practices 
and Good Clinical Practices).
Any lapse can lead to product 
withdrawals, recalls, regulatory 
action, 
decreased 
sales, 
reputational risk, increased 
litigation followed by increase in 
litigation expense.
•	
Drug product quality and patient 
safety are the fundamental 
principles for Torrent Pharma. The 
Company being in the healthcare 
sector, the nature of its business 
requires the utmost attention 
to the quality of its product. We 
have taken following measures to 
ensure resilience against the risk.
•	
We have in place a strong 
Pharmacovigilance 
system 
through which all the stakeholders 
can access the adverse event / 
product complaint reporting form 
on the website of the Company 
or dedicated phone line and a 
dedicated mailbox.
•	
The Pharmacovigilance department 
of the Company oversees 
monitoring and managing the safety 
of all our products throughout 
their lifespan, employing rigorous 
systems and procedures to 
ensure that manufacturing quality 
standards, GMP compliance, and 
other regulatory criteria are met.
•	
Audits are conducted by the 
Quality Assurance department 
to ensure that our high-quality 
requirements are met.
•	
Risks are sought to be managed 
by appropriate laboratory and 
clinical studies for each new 
product, compliance with 
Good Manufacturing Practices 
and 
independent 
quality 
assurance systems.

Innovation: 
Strengthening 
R&D pipeline 
Opportunity
Innovation and R&D play an 
important role in determining 
the long-term success of our 
Company. The cutting-edge 
research includes developing 
new processes for known APIs 
and developing value-added 
and differentiated formulations 
including complex generics. These 
developments come out as the 
differentiators for the Company, 
and thus, leads to an increase 
in revenues as well. We have 
committed to invest dedicatedly 
to tap opportunities and introduce 
new therapies, medical benefits, 
and formulations across the globe.

Water and 
wastewater 
management 
Risk
There is a great degree of 
dependency on uninterrupted 
supply of water for continued 
operations. Therefore, water 
management becomes crucial for 
the Company’s operations. With 
changing climate and drought 
like conditions, water availability 
is increasingly becoming a risk 
across different geographies.
Secondly, wastewater management 
is highly crucial for pharmaceutical 
industry. The presence of 
pharmaceutical compounds in 
the environment is recognised 
as emerging micro pollutants 
in aquatic environment, which 
can indirectly impact human and 
animal health. If not managed 
properly, it can lead to a high level 
of ecological risk.
The Company is not only adhering to 
the statutory criteria set forth by the 
Central Ground Water Authority, but it 
is also taking responsibility for reducing 
use through effective recycling.
Water recycling systems are in place 
in water-stressed locations such as 
Pithampur manufacturing facility and 
R&D centre. The water efficient designs 
limit the amount of water that can be 
utilised in different operations. Water 
usage monitoring across units enables 
us to strategise the reduction efforts.
We also make certain that our effluents 
are treated properly before being reused 
or discharged. At our manufacturing 
facilities, we have a high-tech ETP and 
a three-stage effluent recycling RO 
system.
For more information, please refer to 
Natural Capital section of the Integrated 
Report.

Energy 
efficiency and 
renewable 
energy 
Opportunity
Renewable energy is expanding at 
a quicker rate than it has ever been 
before. The cost of renewable 
energy has dropped dramatically 
because of increased government 
support and continued research 
and development.
Energy efficiency also serves as 
a major opportunity to reduce 
operational costs in the long 
term and is also one of the 
decarbonisation levers for our 
Company.
For more information, please refer 
to Natural Capital section of the 
Integrated Report.
Positive
Employee 
engagement, 
safety and 
well-being 
Opportunity
Employees are our biggest assets. 
Robust employee engagement, 
safety, and well-being drives 
enhanced productivity for the 
Company.
This material aspect is therefore 
an opportunity to integrate 
employees’ views in the core 
functioning of the Company, while 
ensuring employee satisfaction 
and safety in each process.

Investing in equality and diversity

employee’s rights, promoting 
innovation and diverse views,

Company’s 
reputation, and promoting new 
talent. We believe in giving 
equal opportunities to everyone

religion or any other bias.

Ethics and 
business 
integrity 
Risk
Torrent Pharma is a global 
Company with millions of 
stakeholders. Any ethical and 
business integrity breach can 
hamper the Company’s credibility, 
employee morale and may result in 
significant fines and financial loss. 
We have zero tolerance for any ethical 
and business integrity breach within the 
Company. The principles enshrined in 
the Company’s Code of Business 
Conduct guide the work culture in 
terms of ethics and law. The Code in 
a real sense promotes honesty, trust, 
accountability and transparency.
It establishes key corporate and 
organisational ideals that influence the 
value system and business operations.
Every new employee receives a Code 
of Business Conduct orientation at the 
time of joining, ensuring that they fully 
comprehend, embrace, and adapt to 
the Code.
Its implementation and adherence are 
aided by a powerful vigil mechanism 
that monitors deviations or disrespect 
in any form.
Negative
Adherence to 
laws
Risk
Torrent Pharma operates in 
various territories and markets, 
each having its own regulatory 
landscape, which continuously 
evolves changes, and undergoes 
increased scrutiny from the 
regulators. Any non-compliance 
with regulations or scrutiny 
process can result in dilution of 
financial position or jeopardize the 
Company’s reputation.
Regulatory risks are managed through 
a strong governance mechanism based 
on the philosophy of ‘zero tolerance to 
non-compliance’. This is implemented 
through:
•	
Assessment of regulatory and 
compliance requirements on 
regular basis
•	
Robust internal controls
•	
Compliance management systems 
and continuous monitoring
•	
Internal communication and 
training on the ethics standards 
and compliance systems
•	
Independent assessments and 
audits
•	
Monitoring 
of

and

management and the Board

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
PRINCIPLE 1: Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in 
a manner that is Ethical, Transparent and Accountable.
Our Corporate Governance philosophy is built on three inviolable principles of TRANSPARENCY, 
INTEGRITY, and ACCOUNTABILITY. These principles guide our actions and helps us to build trust and 
long term relationship with our stakeholders and create long term sustainable value for them. Corporate 
Governance at the Company is driven by a robust framework of policies, procedures and Code of 
Business Conduct that guides its decision making and operational conduct. We ensure that both the 
Company and its employees conduct themselves in a manner that is efficient, ethical, accountable, 
and transparent at all levels. By embedding ethical conduct, sustainability and responsible leadership 
into its governance framework, the Company reaffirms its commitment to creating a resilient, inclusive 
and future ready Organization.
Our Core Values, which we believe in and constantly strive to build are Integrity, Passion for Excellence, Participative Decision 
Making, Concern for Society & Environment, Fairness with Care and Transparency.
Each of these Timeless Values, a Pillar of Strength, ENSURES OUR LONGEVITY.
INTEGRITY: When Truth is Paramount
Thoughts and actions entail doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances; whether or not anyone is watching. This 
requires inner courage and conviction, no matter what the consequences are. It is honouring one’s commitments and being 
accountable for one’s actions, end-to-end.
PASSION FOR EXCELLENCE: When best is not enough
Passion for excellence means not doing extra-ordinary things, but doing ordinary things in all pursuits exceedingly well. Passion 
and excellence are forces that fuel each other on the exclusive path to leadership. As we are what we repeatedly do, excellence 
then is not an act, but a habit.
PARTICIPATIVE DECISION MAKING: Involvement that engenders effectiveness
An ideal organisation facilitates participation and involvement of each of its members in various decision making processes, thus 
ensuring their commitment to such decisions as well as its outcome. It provides a platform for seeking and nurturing constructive 
ideas from individuals, teams and units which eventually yields exceptional results.
CONCERN FOR SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT: When every smile matters
Concern for Society & Environment is a sense of responsibility and contribution to society that defines our existence. It entails 
making a difference in the quality of lives and environment surrounding us. It is important to encourage fellow-members on 
collective as well as individual basis to fulfil the responsibility of leaving behind a world rich in flora and fauna and rich in time 
tested values and ideals and above all rich in social fervour for our future generations.
FAIRNESS WITH CARE: Harnessing equality
Fairness and Care towards all fellow members are inextricably linked. Weaving the threads of equality, irrespective of caste, 
creed, religion and gender, into the day-to-day fabric, ensures fairness for each and every individual. Empathic care recognises 
needs and aspirations of all. Only such fairness and care eventually lead fellow members to the dawn of eternal success.
TRANSPARENCY: Openness that builds enduring trust
Transparency implies openness. It is the opposite of secrecy. It encourages more informed decision making and aids in creating 
enduring trust among all stakeholders.
Our Core values are aligned with the nine Principles of NGRBC.
At Torrent Pharma, we uphold the belief that robust governance practices are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, 
fairness, and responsibility in decision-making, thus contributing to the long-term sustainability of the Company and fostering 
trust among stakeholders. Inspired by the values of “INTEGRITY” and “TRANSPARENCY,” we consistently maintain a high level 
of fairness in all our interactions with stakeholders.
152
The Board of Directors has established a Code of Business Conduct (“the Code”), which applies to all employees and Board 
Members of the Company. This Code outlines essential corporate ethical standards that shape our business practices and 
embody our cherished values. It offers guidance to employees in recognising and addressing significant ethical and legal issues, 
fostering a culture of honesty and accountability.
Furthermore, the Company has implemented a ‘Whistle-blower Policy,’ demonstrating our commitment to ethical standards, 
transparency, and accountability. This policy encourages stakeholders to report any instances of unethical behaviour, suspected 
fraud, or violations of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct that could potentially harm the Company’s operations, 
performance, or reputation
In order to protect investors’ interest, we have adopted Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor and Report Trading by 
Designated Persons.
The Related Party Transactions Policy of the Company provides the process for the approval of various types of Related Party 
Transactions (RPTs) and general principles governing RPTs. This brings necessary transparency in the RPTs and ensures that 
the transactions are fair and in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.
The Policy on Materiality of Events or Information brings consistency in the disclosure of various events or information to the 
Stock Exchanges in accordance with the thresholds determined.

procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR and therefore, do not express any 
opinion / conclusion thereon.
Criteria
6.	
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is summarised below (hereinafter 
referred to as ‘Criteria’):
	
a.	
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘LODR Regulations’) 
as amended, read with SEBI Master circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated 11th November, 2024 and SEBI 
Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated 28th March, 2025; and
	
b.	
SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated 20th December, 2024 read with BRSR Core Reporting 
Standard formulated by Industry Standards Forum.
Management’s Responsibilities
7.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation 
of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability 
Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
8.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.
192
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control
9.	
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ (‘IESBA’), which is founded on fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour
10.	 Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms that Perform 
Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” which requires the firm 
to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
11.	 Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on BRSR Core Information and express 
a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information, 
based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
12.	 We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (‘ISAE 
3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires 
that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the BRSR Core Information is 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria and limited assurance about whether the other selected 
indicators of BSRS other than BRSR Core Information is free from material misstatement.
13.	 A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the 
Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the BRSR Core Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances 
and evaluating the overall presentation of the BRSR Core Information.
14.	 A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with ISAE 3000 involves assessing the suitability in the 
circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the other selected indicators of BRSR 
other than BRSR Core Information, identifying areas where material misstatement is likely to arise in the other selected 
indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing procedures 
to address identified risk areas as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the other 
selected indicators of BRSR other than Core Information.
15.	 A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response 
to the assessed risks.
16.	 The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.

•	 Selected key parameters and representative sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables and agreeing claims 
to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims such as source data, meter data, etc.
•	 Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of claims,
•	 Reviewed data from independent sources, wherever available,
•	 Reviewed data, information about sustainability performance indicators and statements in the report.

18.	 We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance 
opinion on BRSR Core Information.
19.	 The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 
for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the other selected indicators 
of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Exclusions:
20.	 Our assurance engagement scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion or conclusion on 
the same:
•	 Aspects of the BRSR and data / information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	 Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in paragraph 2 and 3 above on Scope of Assurance.
•	 Data and information outside the defined reporting period
•	 Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy and other related linkages expressed in Identified 
Sustainability Information.
•	 The Company’s statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking statements 
provided by the Company and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
•	 Mapping of Identified Sustainability Information with reporting frameworks other than those mentioned in Criteria above.
•	 While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our 
procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
•	 The procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation 
of data within IT systems.
Opinion
21.	 Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core Information included 
in the BRSR report for the financial year ended 31st March, 2025 is prepared in all material respects, in accordance with 
the Criteria.
Conclusion
22.	 Based on the procedures performed and evidences obtained and the information and explanations given to us along 
with the representation provided by the management, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the other selected indicators of BRSR other than BRSR Core Information included in the BRSR report for the year ended 
31st March, 2025, is not prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the Criteria.
