Risk - The substantial upfront cost of 
replacing outdated systems, equipment, 
or facilities with more energy-efficient 
models is one of the main dangers 
connected with energy conservation 
initiatives. The requirements or 
sustainability of current efficiency 
measures may change as a result of 
changes in energy efficiency laws and 
policies. Water infrastructure that is 
getting older may have leaks, inefficient 
distribution, and higher operating 
expenses. Regulation violations may 
lead to penalties, legal ramifications, or 
operational limitations.
The Company has adopted energy 
conservation system and Variable 
frequency drives (VFDs) are installed 
to reduce energy consumption. The 
company also makes use of 
renewable energy resources, as it 
uses by product of sugarcane 
bagasse as a fuel for co-generation 
boiler, which recycles waste into 
electrical energy. Also, plant effluent 
water is treated by aerobic digester 
to maintain zero liquid discharge. 
There has been no ground water and 
Positive - Energy savings provide 
for a speedy repayment of the 
original investment in many energy 
efficiency initiatives, which have a 
short payback period. Businesses 
and people benefit from improved 
cash flow and increased financial 
stability as a result. Avoiding fines 
and penalties related to non-
compliance with regulations can be 
achieved by proactive management 
of water resources.

(R/O)
Opportunity - By consuming less 
energy and paying less for utilities, 
increasing energy efficiency can 
eventually result in significant cost 
savings. Through these savings, 
energy-efficient technology 
investments frequently pay for 
themselves. Effective water 
management is essential for the 
preservation of limited freshwater 
resources, especially in areas where 
regulations are tight or water 
shortage is a concern.  Water-saving 
strategies and technology can result 
in lower water bills, cheaper 
wastewater treatment, and lower 
related operating costs.
surface water pollution made by the 
company.
Negative : Making a sizable 
upfront expenditure is frequently 
necessary to upgrade to energy-
efficient technologies or increase 
energy efficiency in buildings and 
activities. Initiatives related to water 
management might, in some areas, 
receive less financial incentives or 
regulatory support than those 
related to energy efficiency.
Risk - A number of variables, 
including supply and demand 
d y n a m i c s ,  g e o p o l i t i c a l  
developments, weather that affects 
agriculture, and changes in currency 
exchange rates, can cause raw 
material costs to fluctuate 
significantly.  Disruptions to the 
supply chain are more likely when a 
supplier or geographic area is 
restricted in the raw material 
sources.
The sugar unit is sourcing sugarcane 
from farmers (100%). The distillery is 
sourcing entire raw material 
(molasses) from sugar mills (100%).
Negative - Weather patterns, 
s u p p l y - d e m a n d  d y n a m i c s ,  
geopolitical events, and global 
economic conditions can all cause 
large fluctuations in raw material 
costs. Unexpected price rises may 
have an impact on competitiveness 
since they may result in increased 
production costs, smaller profit 
margins, or the need to pass costs on 
to customers.

Risk
Risk- The quality of products can be 
harmed by subpar manufacturing 
procedures, broken machinery, or 
mistakes made by humans. Defects, 
non-compliance with specifications, 
or safety accidents can be caused by 
inadequate maintenance, inadequate 
process controls, or a lack of training. 
Product failures, safety risks, or recalls 
may result from subpar product 
design or insufficient testing of new 
products.
Opportunities - Customers are more 
likely to trust and stay loyal when 
products are delivered that constantly 
fulfill safety regulations and high-
quality standards. Customers that are 
happy with a product are more likely 
to promote it to others and make more 
purchases, which supports long-term 
business success. It turns into a major 
selling feature that draws clients who 
value dependability and safety above 
everything else when making 
judgments.
The Company displays as well as 
reviews the displayed information of 
all its products for correctness of 
information and safety guidance on 
the product label a per as applicable 
regulations.
Positive - Enhancing the quality and 
safety of products reduces the 
expenses related to flaws, rework, 
returns, and warranty claims. 
Businesses can increase overall 
profitability and more effectively 
manage resources by cutting these 
costs.
Negative - Adopting strict quality 
control and safety procedures 
necessitates a large investment in 
infrastructure, skilled labor, and 
testing tools. Budgets may be 
strained by these initial expenses, 
particularly for startups or 
companies with narrow profit 
margins.
The company conducts trainings for 
Health, Safety & Personality 
Development, Health and Safety 
Awareness Training Programme, 
and training for sugarcane 
development. Also, the company is 
O H S A S  - 1 8 0 0 1 : 2 0 0 7  -  
Occupational Health and Safety 
Assessment Series (OHSAS) certified 
a n d  h a v e  g e n e r a l  s a f e t y  
management systems in the work 
place. It also has On-Site Emergency 
plan and major emergency control 
plant approved by regulatory 
authorities. 
Risk - Workplace accidents and 
injuries may arise from inadequate 
training and the implementation of 
safety regulations. Long-term health 
effects, respiratory ailments, 
musculoskeletal diseases, and other 
occupational health problems can be 
caused by exposure to dangerous 
substances, poor ergonomics, or 
repeated jobs. 
Negative - Workers' compensation 
claims, which can include medical 
expenditures, rehabilitation costs, 
and pay replacement benefits, are 
the result of diseases or injuries 
sustained on the job. Regulations 
pertaining to occupational health 
and safety may carry fines, 
penalties, and legal costs for 
noncompliance. Infractions may 
result in fines from regulatory bodies, 
and if injured workers or their 
families file lawsuits, legal costs may 
increase.

(R/O)
Risk - Fraud, corruption, and 
environmental infractions are 
examples of ethical wrongdoing that 
can seriously harm a company's 
reputation. There may be fines, 
p e n a l t i e s ,  a n d  r e g u l a t o r y  
repercussions for breaking ethical 
standards. Breaking laws pertaining 
to consumer rights, environmental 
protection, bribery, or discrimination 
can result in expensive legal 
proceedings and harm to a company's 
reputation.
Risk - Businesses that rely on suppliers 
for components, completed items, or 
raw materials run the risk of supplier 
bankruptcy, poor quality, late 
deliveries, or unforeseen price 
adjustments. Production schedules can 
be affected by subpar supplier 
performance, which can result in 
inventory shortages and disgruntled 
customers.  Global or regional supply 
chains can be disrupted by external 
reasons like trade disputes, natural 
disasters, geopolitical events, or 
public health crises like pandemics. 
Risk - Employee burnout may result 
from high levels of engagement and 
development activities that are not 
balanced with enough downtime and 
recuperation. Employee retention, 
morale, and productivity are all badly 
impacted by burnout. Employees may 
be resistant to new projects or 
organizational changes, especially if 
they believe the changes would 
jeopardize their job security or 
interfere with their daily routines.
Opportunity - Workers that are 
engaged, feel important, and have 
room to grow are more likely to stick 
with the company. Lower attrition 
results in savings on hiring, 
onboarding, and training new 
employees. Employee engagement 
results in increased productivity and 
better job performance because 
motivated and dedicated workers are 
more successful.
Effective policies and mechanisms 
need to be in place to promote a 
culture of integrity and conduct as 
well as address the evolving risks and 
challenges. The organization is still 
dedicated to operating all of its 
operations with the utmost honesty, 
integrity, governance, ethics, and 
transparency while strictly adhering 
to all applicable laws and 
regulations.
100% of the supplies have been 
assessed by the audit for
health & safety conditions.
Bannari Amman Sugars is QMS, 
EMS AND FSSC certified.
Negative - Legal and regulatory 
infractions frequently coexist with 
ethical standards violations. 
Businesses that are involved in 
investigations, litigation, or 
settlements may be subject to fines, 
penalties, and legal costs. These 
expenses may add up and have a 
negative impact on profitability.
Negative - Overstocking and 
stockouts are examples of ineffective 
inventory management techniques 
that can tie up operating capital and 
raise storage costs. Stockouts can 
lead to missed sales opportunities 
and lower revenue, while excess 
inventory takes up money that could 
be spent somewhere else.
Positive - Motivated and engaged 
workers typically produce more in 
their jobs. Employee dedication and 
productivity are likely to increase 
when they experience possibilities 
for growth and feel appreciated in 
their work. Increased output per 
worker directly benefits from 
increased productivity, which also 
maximizes operational effectiveness 
and lowers expenses per unit of 
output.
Negative - When given possibilities 
for growth, engaged workers may 
become more desirable to 
employers. Employee turnover 
e x p e n s e s  i n c l u d e  h i r i n g ,  
onboarding, and lost productivity 
during transitions when workers 
depart the company after completing 
training or development.

Describe the processes for identifying

A key stakeholder is any individual, group of individuals, or institution that 
contributes value to the Company's operations. The company identifies 
internal and external stakeholders based on whether they are impacted by the

company has identified employees as internal stakeholder and shareholders, 
customers, value chain partners, regulators & farmers as external

stakeholders according to their degree of influence, potential impact, and 
level of interest in its business. The management also updates and examines

to its activities. When defining each of the major stakeholder groups, the 
company considers the factors such as dependency, urgency, responsibility,

Does the entity have any project 
related to reducing Green House 
Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details. 
> 
The waste generated in the form of Cane trash, and molasses are used as fuel within the
co-generation plant.  
> 
Spent wash is also treated by anaerobic process, in a biogas plant. Biogas is utilised as fuel 
for boilers.
> 
This helps to reduce use of conventional source of energy.
> 
Falling Film Evaporators are an important improvement in our operational efficiency. We 
have significantly reduced the amount of steam required, which has resulted in less bagasse 
being consumed, by utilizing this method. This efficient method helps to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in a noticeable way while also improving our use of resources.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in 
your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes
During the sugar and distillery processes, there are so many residues and 
by-products generated that we productively utilize as fuel and manure. 
Bagasse and spent wash are used as fuel for co-generation plants and 
incinerators. Some amount of bagasse is also used in vacuum filters. The 
industrial trade effluent (spent wash) has been treated by biological 
processes with anaerobic treatment in the bioreactors. The biogas 
generated in the bioreactor is utilized in the boiler as fuel, which replaces 
a major part of fossil fuel (furnace oil) usage in the process of steam 
generation. The waste generated is within the permissible limits given by 
CPCB/SPCB.

PRINCIPLE 9 : Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
Describe the mechanisms 
in place to receive and 
respond to consumer 
complaints and feedback. 
A customer's verbal or written complaint, made by phone, email, or in person if preferred, is 
forwarded to head office (sales department). The unit head, process head, and QA head 
shall be notified by the sales department, the party that received the complaint. A complaint 
that is received is entered into the complaint log. While the complaint was being recorded 
Analysis is done on the complaint criteria (Critical, Major, Minor). The fundamental cause is 
examined and any necessary corrective action is started, depending on the type of 
complaint. Determining if a complaint investigation is necessary and allocating the 
investigation are the QA head's responsibilities. It is the assigned complaint investigator's 
responsibility to promptly finish and record the investigation. The QA Head oversees the 
tracking of complaint investigations and remedial measures.
Analysis of Customer Feedback: We send out customer feedback forms to our clients once a 
year. Within the month, the completed customer feedback forms are gathered. The gathered 
client feedback was examined based on each person's unique attributes. Customer 
feedback forms are examined and rated after receipt. One is assigned a rating of 1 for poor, 
two for fair, three for good, and four for excellence. Determine the area that needs 
improvement if the rating is 3. For the rating of less than two, corrective action will be started. 
The senior management receives the studied data with poor ratings so that appropriate 
adjustment and corrective action can be started.
Additionally, a number of Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) were proactively 
designed, updated, and enhanced to meet the necessary standards for food safety and 
quality across all units. Additionally, these acts were communicated.
