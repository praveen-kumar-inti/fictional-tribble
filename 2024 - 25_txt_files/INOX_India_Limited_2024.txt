environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of a company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as 
environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

and Efficiency 
 O
The Company’s investments in energy management 
and efficiency technologies have a significant 
positive impact. Power factor auto maintainers, 
LED lighting, and auto cut-off relays have 
significantly reduced energy consumption across 
operations, leading to lower operational costs.

Energy 
Management 
and Efficiency 
 O
Moreover, the Company’s 1.65 MW windmill in 
Bhachau district has been instrumental in decreasing 
reliance on conventional energy sources, further 
enhancing 
cost-efficiency 
and 
environmental 
sustainability. This alignment with sustainability 
goals not only strengthens the Company’s market 
position but also mitigates the risks associated with 
long-term energy cost fluctuations. 
 NA
 Positive
2
Waste 
Management 
 O
The Company tracks all the waste through an ERP 
system and ensures proper storage and management 
through a designated scrapyard. This proactive 
approach helps mitigate risks such as environmental 
contamination of soil and water, potential regulatory 
penalties, reputational damage, and the loss of 
valuable materials. Greater focus on recycle and reuse 
of waste material can potentially lead to reduction in 
costs and reduce environmental impacts. 
 NA
 Positive

Climate 
Change and 
GHG Emissions 
 R
The fuel and energy used during operational activities 
of INOX can significantly contribute to climate change 
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The use of 
diesel in the perlite plant and mobile fuel-consuming 
sources like hydra cranes and forklifts results in 
the release of substantial amounts of Carbon 
Dioxide (CO2) and other harmful pollutants into 
the atmosphere. These emissions contribute to the 
greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and 
climate change. Additionally, reliance on conventional 
energy sources exacerbates the depletion of fossil 
fuels, further increasing the carbon footprint of 
the Company. Without effective monitoring and 
reduction strategies, the Company’s activities can lead 
to increased air pollution, negatively impacting air 
quality and public health, environmental degradation 
and adverse effects on ecosystems and communities. 
We have 
commissioned a 
solar rooftop plant 
at our Kalol works 
to help reduce 
GHG emissions.
 Negative
4
Water and 
Effluent 
Discharge 
 R
INOX track the total water consumption and treat 
the effluents through Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP) and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). While 
this process is effectively regulated, Improper 
discharges pose a significant risk of long-term 
environmental damage and regulatory penalties. 
Therefore, 
ensuring 
strict 
compliance 
and 
oversight are crucial to mitigate these risks. 
We have 
commissioned STP 
& ETP at our Savli 
works.  
 Negative
5
 Responsible 
Supply Chain 
 R
INOX operates across diverse value chains, 
from raw material manufacturers, equipment 
manufacturers, gas suppliers to end users etc, 
resulting in an extensive supply chain. Disruptions 
due to non-compliance and unethical practices 
within the supply chain can significantly impact the 
operations and product quality, ultimately affecting 
customer satisfaction. Ensuring responsible supply 
chain practices is therefore crucial to maintaining 
the operational integrity and customer trust. 
We have an 
IMS (integrated 
management 
system), as per 
the manual, 
we followed 
the evaluation 
of the supplier 
accordingly.
