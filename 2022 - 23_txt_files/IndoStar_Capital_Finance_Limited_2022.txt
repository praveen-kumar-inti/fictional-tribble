With clear strategies on our key business segments, healthy liquidity and 
balance sheet, and improved asset quality, we continued to strengthen our 
proficiencies, with future growth driven by an increased offtake in commercial 
vehicles and affordable housing. Our strong capitalisation levels, comfortable 
gearing, low leverage and healthy liquidity grants us this confidence.

As we continue to serve the 
unique needs of our customers, 
our key objectives are aimed at 
deepening our national footprint,

We continue to further build on 
our capabilities, infrastructure and 
processes, engage more with retail 
customers, drive further market 
presence, building momentum on 
all fronts and driving towards a 
promising future.
Going forward, the improvement in macroeconomic 
environment, massive pent-up demand in our key

helping us build a solid book. Today, with a changed 
DNA, we are looking ahead confidently, and are 
ready for IndoStar 2.0.

A Dynamic Stewardship. An Intrinsic Value System. 
Chairman’s Message
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
We are delighted to share our thoughts 
with you on the completion of the 
14th year of our business. Today, we 
have now strengthened our work 
culture and thereby reenergised our 
workforce, with all now waiting to see 
the next phase of growth.
It’s been our endeavour to serve 
the unique financial needs of 
our customers. And this will 
be our foundation to take our 
growth story forward.
YEAR IN RETROSPECT
We began the year in the backdrop 
of the strength of underlying demand 
drivers – improving GDP growth 
despite a strained global geopolitical 
situation, reducing inflationary 
pressures, robust GST collections, and 
an increasing thrust on infrastructure 
development. Your management has 
worked assiduously to strengthen 
operating controls and processes, 
and to expand and deepen the senior 
management team. At the same 
time, the strong backing provided 
by Brookfield and Everstone has 
helped us in enhancing our capital 
base and provided us with added 
financial flexibility. The year was a 
landmark due to a historic milestone of 
having raised incremental funding of 
around ` 3,967 crore on consolidated 
basis, which bolstered our liquidity 
position and reflected in a significant 
improvement in our Asset Liability 
profile. The Company has recovered 
well after a couple of quarters of 
negative growth.
We welcome Karthikeyan Srinivasan 
as our new CEO, and Vinodkumar as 
our CFO. Karthikeyan had joined the 
Company in May 2022 as the Chief 
Risk Officer. We have great faith 
in their abilities and look forward 
to drawing upon their decades of 
industry experience to take the 
Company forward. We also onboarded 
other experienced people in several 
key positions in both the Commercial 
Vehicle Finance and Housing Finance 
business segments.
BUILDING ON OUR CAPABILITIES
To capitalise on the increasing 
potential in our key business verticals, 
we strengthened our capabilities 
and infrastructure and relooked at 
our processes. We also enhanced 
our operational performance by 
optimising efficiency across branches, 
while also maintaining continued 
focus on collections. We strengthened 
our collection mechanism by adding 
people, harnessing technology, and 
strengthening our culture, all of which 
enabled robust collections, resulting 
in all-time high collection efficiency of 
120%+ on a regular basis.
To stabilise our asset quality, we 
strengthened controls, reviewed 
policies and upgraded technology 
systems – right from loan origination, 
credit appraisal disbursal and 
collection process. With this, we 
are becoming future-fit and aiming 
for sustained profitable growth. 
Our investments in technology and 
digitisation will help us improve 
operating turnaround times and 
productivity and drive operating cost 
efficiencies. We also took sustained 
efforts to reduce our stressed book 
through collection, repossession and 
settlement, besides identifying the 
stress pool in our CV portfolio and 
made conservative provisions.
For better serving our customers 
in Tier 3 & 4 cities, we moved our 
branch network into the hinterland, 
besides strengthening the hub-and-
spoke model. We remain focused 
on opening smart branches that 
operate with greater efficiency 
and less manpower. Further, we 
reduced our gross NPA, increased 
our reach and put processes in place 
and incorporated technology to 
grow. Not only this, we also remain 
nimble-footed on the cost front to 
manage profitability.
We have continued to pursue our 
retailisation strategy with a stringent 
focus – by building the retail business 
in a highly scalable manner, continuing 
to surge ahead on retail with our 
diversified bouquet of products – CV, 
Affordable Housing and SME Finance. 
Driven by an increased credit offtake 
in commercial vehicles and affordable 
housing, we are penetrating deeper 
and expanding our retail base, Today, 
85% of our total book size comprises 
of retail loans.
IN CONCLUSION
We would like to offer sincere thanks 
to all our shareholders, lenders, 
partners and employees for their 
support and for being part of our 
journey. We also convey our sincere 
thanks to our dedicated workforce 
for supporting the Company during 
challenging times. Our growth is 
a testimony to the fact that with 
teamwork, motivation and sustained 
efforts, everything is possible.
We remain committed to delivering 
value to our shareholders and provide 
the best possible financial solutions 
to our clients.
Warm Regards,
Bobby Parikh
Chairman
It’s been our 
endeavour to 
serve the unique 
financial needs 
of our customers. 
And this will be our 
foundation to take 
our growth story 
forward.

CEO’s Letter to Shareholders
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, 
I am excited to have joined IndoStar 
Capital Finance in FY2023, and I can 
confidently say that the transition 
has been very easy. Despite the 
tumultuous time on the business front, 
the Company’s core values and its 
open culture led me to feel at home 
soon upon joining. In this regard, I 
am immensely thankful to all those 
contributed to building the culture, 
along-with a strong foundation that 
is making the Company shine even 
through adversity. 
The year was unique as we worked to 
engineer a turnaround in the business. 
Our total Assets Under Management 
(AUM) this year was ` 7,813 crore, 
compared to ` 9,658 crore, while Total 
Disbursements were ` 2,099 crore.
Talking about our financial 
performance, Profit After Tax was 
` 225.2 crore, compared to a loss 
of ` 736.5 crore. Revenue from 
Operations was ` 1,174.3 crore, as 
compared to ` 1,162.7 crore in the 
earlier year. Net Interest Income was 
` 599.4 crore, compared to ` 634.8 
crore. Our capital adequacy at 31.5% 
gives resources and flexibility to 
pursue future growth opportunities.
Net interest margins witnessed 
substantial improvement at 6.1%, as 
we moved focus to Tier 3 & 4 cities. 
Also, our debt-equity ratio indicates 
a healthy balance sheet, leaving 
headroom for us to source external 
funds. Operating expenses were higher 
at ` 401.1 crore due to and certain 
one time costs. Our gross collection 
efficiency reflected commitment to 
maintain high credit standards and 
efficient operations. 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
With economic growth picking 
up, positive macro trends and 
retail inflation easing, demand for 
commercial vehicle financing has 
improved. Higher infrastructure 
spending is driving demand for newer 
vehicles. The uptick is also triggered by 
medium and heavy commercial vehicle, 
and will propel a strong push for the 
used CV segment, and we expect this 
demand to sustain. The scrappage 
policy also provides significant growth 
opportunities. Replacement demand is 
anticipated to be favourable – certain 
replacement sales anticipated for 
FY2021 and FY2022 were deferred due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic,
THE “USED CV” OPPORTUNITY 
At IndoStar, we are capitalising on 
the growing opportunity in Used CV 
market, and are focused on serving 
this market with better yields to be 
able to enhance our disbursement, 
leverage positive trends and expand 
our business. We anticipate the CV 
loan book to grow manifold over the 
next few years. We plan to enhance our 
penetration by increasing our reach in 
smaller geographies and rural markets. 
With this, we are making ourselves 
well-positioned to take advantage of 
future growth opportunities.
CAPITALISING ON HOUSING
FINANCE GROWTH DRIVERS
Despite the pandemic-induced 
disruptions, the real estate industry 
bounced back strongly, primarily 
owing to the government’s focus 
on affordable housing and several 
policy initiatives. The year witnessed 
a surge in demand for affordable 
housing, particularly in Tier 2 & 3 cities, 
putting the sector back on the growth 
trajectory. The affordable housing 
finance segment is growing rapidly, 
driven by multiple factors such as 
urbanisation, industrialisation and an 
increase in per capita income. 
India’s mortgage penetration is low 
with a national average of 10.5%, and 
fresh housing requirement is still the 
dominant demand driver in housing 
finance. At IndoStar, we are committed 
to expanding access to housing 
finance to the under-served population 
in the country. This will remain a strong 
focus area for us to accelerate our 
growth strategy in the near future, as 
we see the sector spanning strong 
growth in the next several decades. 
Besides a better understanding of 
customer needs and our customised 
solutions, we also have an edge over 
our peers on account of higher margin 
of loans and more pricing power.
GROWING SUSTAINABLY AND
SCALING NEW FRONTIERS
Moving ahead, we are committed 
towards maintaining a healthy loan 
portfolio. Our strong capitalisation 
levels, comfortable gearing, low 
leverage and high liquidity position 
grants us the confidence to move 
forward with strength and vigour. 
Our small size also makes it possible to 
look at huge growth, with no liquidity 
and capital constraints. 
With support from shareholders, 
lenders, debenture holders, employees 
and partners, we will move ahead 
strongly. We also remain buoyant 
about our future growth prospects 
and believe that the investments we 
have made in the form of technology, 
human resource, building a ethical 
and compliant culture, will help us 
capitalise on opportunities. 
Amid the continuously changing 
business landscape, we remain 
committed to creating value 
for all our stakeholders, our 
customers, our partners, the society 
and our employees.
We take this opportunity to thank our 
shareholders, lenders, employees and 
everyone involved in the journey of 
revamping IndoStar.
Sincerely, 
Karthikeyan Srinivasan 
Chief Executive Officer
I am immensely 
thankful to all those 
contributed to 
building the culture, 
along with a strong 
foundation that is 
making the company 
shine even through 
adversity.

By further solidifying our capabilities, infrastructure and processes, we

At IndoStar Capital Finance, we 
provide financing for new and used 
commercial vehicles, construction 
equipment, tractors and used cars. 
In FY2023, our disbursement in 
Commercial Vehicles segment 
stands at ` 1,436 crore in FY2023, 
vis-à-vis ` 3,743 crore in FY2022, 
with a disbursement yield of 
~19% in Q4 of FY2023 up from 
~16.4% in Q4 of FY2022. Of the 
total disbursement in Commercial 
Vehicle financing, about 98% of 
the total disbursement was in 
Used CV. With yields significantly 
better in Used CV, it improved the 
overall yield and spread.
With an annual market size of 
` 5.60 lakh crore, the commercial 
vehicle market is scaling higher. 
The sale of commercial vehicles 
is expected to further rise due 
to improved fleet utilisation, 
robust GST collections, strong 
replacement demand and a 
pick-up in road construction 
and highway projects across the 
country, stimulating CV sales 
growth of 28% in FY2023. On the 
back of improving macroeconomic 
fundamentals, focus on 
infrastructure projects and high 
spending on account of elections 
are projected to keep the growth 
trajectory of CV sales higher.

GROWTH IN CV FINANCING
A pick-up in sales volumes in the 
CV industry, commercial vehicle 
financing has bounced back. 
The Used Commercial Vehicle 
market is also witnessing stable 
growth on account of increase 
in prices of new CV vehicles and 
Used CV’s multi-purpose usability, 
and is expected to remain 
positive over the next 2-3 years. 
Post-axle load norms and BS-VI 
transition, commercial vehicle 
tonnage has moved up, making 
small road transport operators 
move to used commercial vehicles. 
Given the scrappage policy with a 
15-year limit, Used CV financing is 
expected to double by FY2025.
REPLACEMENT DEMAND 
UNDER SCRAPPAGE
Replacement demand in the 
preceding two years was 
postponed due to COVID-related 
disruptions and also owing to 
uncertainty with follow-on COVID 
waves. Replacement demand 
under the Vehicle Scrappage 
policy is expected to be a huge 
potential as the policy is seen 
creating rising demand for Used 
Vehicles for the next 2-3 years.
As scrappage norms set in and 
economic growth picks up, the 
new and used CV upcycle is 
seen gaining momentum. As per 
reports, over 1 million vehicles 
are expected to come up for 
scrappage in the next 15 years, 
projected to trigger demand 
for replacement. 
BUILDING OUR CAPABILITIES
At IndoStar Capital, we are aiming 
to be a pan-India company 
catering to pre-owned vehicle 
requirements of customers. 
With old vehicles penetrated 
less than 50% by organised 
players, and with significant 
opportunity in Used CV segment, 
we are leveraging this growth 
opportunity. By solidifying our 
capabilities, infrastructure and 
processes, we plan to grow our 
assets substantially in CV and 
Used CV financing. An uptick in 
demand will help us improve our 
disbursements further.

Management Discussion & Analysis
ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
Global Economy
Global economic activity is 
experiencing a broad-based and 
sharper-than-expected slowdown, 
with inflation higher than seen 
in several decades. The cost-of-
living crisis, tightening financial 
conditions in most regions and the 
continuing war in Ukraine weigh 
heavily on the outlook.  
Global growth slowed in 2022 to 
3.4%, ~1% weaker than expected at 
the end of 2021, mainly weighed 
down by the Russia-Ukraine war 
and elevated inflation levels, 
which continue to shadow the 
world economy. Economic growth 
proved surprisingly resilient during 
the third quarter of 2022, with 
strong labour markets, robust 
household consumption, business 
investment and better-than-
expected adaptation to the energy 
crisis in Europe. Even as headline 
inflation appears to have peaked 
in 2022 and the energy crisis has 
been less severe than initially 
feared, the global economy still 
faces major headwinds. 
The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) trimmed its 2023 global 
growth outlook as higher interest 
rates cool activity. It is forecasting 
global real GDP growth at 2.8% 
for 2023, before rebounding to 
3.0% for 2024, marking a sharp 
slowdown from 3.4% growth in 
2022 due to a tighter monetary 
policy. IMF predicts global 
inflation to cool to 6.6% in 2023 
and 4.3% in 2024, which is still 
above pre-pandemic levels of 
about 3.5%, but significantly 
lower than 8.8% observed in 
2022. Structural reforms can 
further support the fight against 
inflation by improving productivity 
and easing supply constraints, 
while multilateral cooperation is 
necessary for fast-tracking the 
green energy transition.

Annual Report 2022-23
Indian Economy
India’s economy demonstrated 
resilience despite a challenging 
external environment. The World 
Bank’s latest India Development 
Update states that “India was 
one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world with real 
GDP growing 7.7% year-on-year 
during Q1-Q3 fiscal year 2022/23. 
Growth was underpinned by 
robust domestic demand – strong 
investment activity bolstered by 
the government’s capex push and 
buoyant private consumption, 
particularly among higher income 
earners.” The World Bank report 
titled “Navigating the Storm” 
finds that while the deteriorating 
external environment will weigh 
on India’s growth prospects, 
the economy is relatively well 
positioned to weather global 
spill-overs compared to other 
emerging markets.
India’s GDP may grow by 7% 
for the financial year 2022-23, 
according to the second advance 
estimates released by the Ministry 
of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation. The Ministry 
also revised economic growth 
for financial year FY 2021-22 
to 9.1%, against 8.7% estimated 
in the previous year. The fall 
in year-on-year growth rate 
is partly due to a fading of 
pandemic-induced base effects, 
which contributed towards 
higher growth in FY 2021-22. 
Inflation remained high in 
FY 2022-23, averaging around 
6.7%, but the current account 
deficit narrowed in Q3 of 
FY 2022-23 on the back of strong 
growth in service exports and 
easing global commodity prices.

GROWTH OF NBFCs IN INDIA
The Non-Banking Financial 
Companies (NBFC) sector in 
India has undergone a significant 
transformation over the past 
few years and plays a significant 
role in the growth of the Indian 
financial system. NBFCs play a 
critical role in the development 
of core infrastructure, transport, 
employment generation, wealth 
creation, and the economic 
development of weaker sections 
of society. Further, technology has 
enabled NBFCs to expand into 
underserved segments, where 
banks often don’t serve or find it 
difficult to reach and service. 
Growth Drivers
Deep understanding of customer 
segments:
NBFCs have focused on the 
unorganised and under-served 
segments of the economy, 
which has led the companies to 
create a niche for themselves 
through deep understanding 
of their needs. The NBFCs 
ensure last-mile delivery and 
enhanced customer experience of 
products and services.
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
18
Annual Report 2022-23
Customised product offerings by 
NBFCs:
Several NBFCs have focused on 
a limited set of products to serve 
the target customer segment. 
Armed with a deep understanding 
of their target segment, NBFCs 
have customised product offerings 
to address unique characteristics 
of the customer segment and 
focus on meeting the right needs. 
Several NBFCs have adopted 
non-standard pricing models for 
product lines, in-line with the 
customer profile and lending risk 
in this segment.
Leveraging technology for 
improved efficiency and 
enhanced experience:
The use of technology is 
helping NBFCs to customise 
credit assessment models and 
customise business processes, 
thereby reducing the time to 
market and helping improve 
customer experience. NBFCs are 
investing in data analytics and 
artificial intelligence to enhance 
their ability to serve their target 
customer segments.
Wider and effective reach:
NBFCs are reaching out to 
Tier-2, 3 & 4 markets, distributing 
loans across several customer 
touch-points, building a connected 
channel experience, that provides 
an omnichannel seamless 
experience with 24/7 sales and 
service. This enables NBFCs 
to best serve today’s digitally 
native customers.
Co-lending arrangements:
NBFCs have been tying up with 
multiple alternative lenders 
with digital platforms and 
commercial banks as well, which 
has been adding to their targeted 
customer base and increasing the 
avenues for revenue.
Robust risk management:
Given their focus on lending to 
the sub-prime customer segment, 
and regulatory disadvantage 
(SARFAESI, DRT, and capital 
adequacy requirements) in 
comparison to commercial bank 
lenders, NBFCs are ensuring 
enhanced governance through a 
proactive, robust and agile risk 
management model.

Factors-that-led-Growth-
of-NBFCs-In-India
NBFCs – An important 
component in credit delivery 
Playing a key role in supporting 
India’s socio-economic 
construction
Retail-focused NBFCs are 
expected to grow 12-14% 
while the housing finance 
companies may grow by 10-12%, 
according to an ICRA Ratings 
Report. The forecast is based 
on continuing post-COVID 
pent-up demand and an 
improved operating environment 
reflecting in NBFC asset quality 
improvement. Sectoral profitability 
will improve by 40-50 basis 
points (bps) this fiscal, supported 
by stable margins and lower 
credit cost, and will reach 
pre-pandemic levels, as per 
the report. Vehicle financing 
loans (commercial vehicle 
finance, passenger vehicle 
finance), which have remained 
significantly subdued since 
FY2020, are also expected to 
report higher growth numbers, 
following an improvement in the 
operating environment.
The asset quality of non-banks 
has been improving steadily 
since December 2021 as 
borrowers gradually recovered 
from the pandemic-induced 
stress, according to the Report. 
The improvement has been on 
the back of higher collections, 
a lower-than-anticipated 
share of restructured portfolio 
estimated at 2% of total 
assets under management 
as of September 2022 and 
controlled slippages from this 
book. Reported ratios have also 
benefited from the base effect 
of high growth.

Annual Report 2022-23
Stronger balance sheets, better 
asset quality underpin growth
NBFCs are stronger and 
more resilient today, and 
better positioned in almost all 
operationally critical parameters. 
On the capital front, NBFCs have 
raised almost ` 70,000 crore of 
equity in the past 3.5 years, which 
has materially improved gearing. 
The subdued business landscape 
in the past three fiscals also 
contributed to the better gearing. 
Provisioning levels also increased 
in the past couple of years, as 
NBFCs created management 
overlays to provide for uncertainty 
pertaining to the pandemic.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Automobile Industry – A growth 
engine for India’s economy
The Indian automobile industry, 
in the past four decades, has 
catalysed India’s GDP growth. 
The industry is one of India’s 
core sectors, estimating the 
manufacture of transport 
equipment to be worth up to 12% 
of the Gross Value Added (GVA) in 
the manufacturing sector. As one 
of the leading driving forces of 
the economy, the automobile 
industry contributes to about 
49% to India’s manufacturing 
GDP and 7.5% to the GDP at large. 
India’s automobile market overtook 
Germany, Europe’s largest 
economy and export powerhouse, 
to emerge as the world’s fourth 
largest in 2018, valued at nearly 
US$ 100 billion. The industry faced 
disruptions such as COVID-19 
pandemic, fuel price-led inflation, 
steep hike in commodity prices, 
container shortage and surging 
logistics costs, the industry, and 
is estimated to account for 65 
million jobs by 2026. The total 
sale in the automobile industry 
is estimated to cross ` 5.6 lakh 
crore by FY2025.
Commercial Vehicle Finance
Commercial Vehicles (CV) 
comprise ~8% of the total vehicles 
on Indian roads and growth in the 
sector is being driven by improved 
economic activity, revival of 
construction and mining activities 
and better semi-conductor 
supplies. Inflation in fuel prices will 
continue to be a key challenge in 
the year ahead. The government 
is planning to spend over ` 10 lakh 
crore on infrastructure in FY2024, 
to build out roads, airports and 
other critical infrastructure, which 
is expected to boost commercial 
vehicle sales. 
Growth in the industry is backed 
by improved economic activity, 
revival of construction and 
mining activities and better 
semi-conductor supplies. 
Inflation in fuel prices will 
continue to be a key challenge in 
the year ahead.

Annual Report 2022-23
Used Commercial Vehicle 
Financing
Pre-owned commercial vehicles 
are affordable to aspiring 
owner-cum-drivers/ driver turned 
owners, who are Small Road 
Transport Operators (SRTOs) 
with limited banking experience 
and low credit history for 
verification of creditworthiness. 
The market for this segment 
is fragmented and dominated 
by private financiers in the 
unorganised sector. The organised 
financing sub-segment of the 
market is dominated by NBFCs, 
which have built out the ability 
to service loans in tier 2 & 3 
towns. The opportunity to 
expand disbursement in Used 
CV has been on the rise due to 
increased growth in the segment. 
This is owing to the strength of the 
underlying demand drivers such 
as construction and infrastructure 
activity, growing demand for 
e-Commerce and the continued 
thrust of the government on 
infrastructure development, 
which will provide further 
support to demand.
Vehicle Scrappage Policy
Replacing old polluting vehicles 
is an important part of greening 
our economy. Echoing the 
Government’s commitment to 
clean energy vehicles for a cleaner 
and greener future, the Union 
Budget 2023-24 laid emphasis 
on the vehicle scrapping policy. 
It allocated funds required to 
replace government vehicles 
and buses older than 15 years. 
With this move, over 9 lakh 
vehicles and buses owned by 
central and state governments, 
transport corporations and 
public sector undertakings, 
which are more than 15 years 
old, will be taken off road and 
will be scrapped.
Financing for Used Commercial 
Vehicles is set to increase and 
double by FY2025, considering 
the scrappage policy of 15 years 
limit. Currently, around 50% to 
60% financing in the Used CV 
segment is with the unorganised 
sector, which is projected to 
reduce in future due to scrappage 
policy and with the organised 
sector expected to gain share in 
used vehicle financing.
The scrappage policy is a part of 
the national mission to achieve 
net zero carbon emission. 
The Budget assumes that all State 
and Central government-owned 
vehicles including buses owned 
by transport corporations and 
public sector undertakings that 
have been on the road for over 15 
years will be scrapped. The move 
is estimated to help the entire 
ecosystem of the automobile 
industry as this will translate 
into the growing order books of 
original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs), increased output and job 
creation. The scrappage policy 
is expected to give a boost to 
Used CV financing.
Housing Finance
After subdued growth in the 
pandemic years, FY2023 
witnessed a rebound in the 
housing credit market, aided 
by pent-up demand, lower 
interest rates in the first half 
of the year and new project 
launches. As the Indian economy 
recovered strongly post-COVID-19, 
the industry also witnessed a 
robust demand for affordable 
homes to support the work 
from home & hybrid working 
model. Stabilised home loan 
rates boosted the demand for 
housing space, which was further 
fuelled by the policy emphasis 
on low-cost and affordable 
housing. The housing finance 
segment of the industry witnessed 
substantive traction, that provided 
a much-needed impetus to the 
overall industry.
Demand for home loans also 
grew on account of favourable 
government incentives 
and developer discounts. 
Market participants expect 
demand momentum for affordable 
housing to sustain going into 
FY2024, aided by the entry of 
newer players, sustained demand 
in mid-to-luxury segment, 
and an increasing desire for 
home ownership.

Trends in Housing Finance
Increase in 
disposable income
As disposable income rises, 
individuals prefer taking a 
housing loan for their own 
homes rather than stayed in 
rented accommodation.
Lower interest rates
Declining interest rates on 
housing loans increased 
affordability of loans, 
stimulating demand.
Urbanisation
As more and more 
people settle in urban 
areas, demand for homes 
are increasing, further 
increasing the demand 
for home loans.
Affordable Housing
Affordable Housing remains the 
key sub-segment in the Housing 
and real estate sector. With the 
growth of urban development, 
urban housing shortage is 
becoming a growing concern for 
India’s urban planners. This has 
emphasised the Government 
focus on affordable housing. 
Affordable housing sector was 
inferred ‘Infrastructure Status’ 
by the Government in order to 
augment its growth. The sector 
has been supported extensively 
with schemes such as Housing for 
All by 2022, targeting 20 million 
households, and the Smart Cities 
Mission, with a target of creating 
100 Smart Cities. Further, Pradhan 
Mantri Awas Yojana – Credit 
Linked Subsidy Scheme (PMAY 
- CLSS), launched in June 2015 
continues to drive the affordable 
housing sector.

KEY BUSINESS SEGMENTS – AN OVERVIEW
Pre-owned Commercial Vehicle 
financing is a focus area for the 
Company. It is a well-established 
player in the segment and 
has created a sustainable 
competitive advantage through 
its deep understanding of the 
borrower profile and their credit 
behaviour. At IndoStar, we expect 
continued growth in this segment 
driven by underlying economic 
growth and growing demand 
for small, medium and heavy 
commercial vehicles. Growth in 
long distance M&HCV will also 
propel a strong push for light 
commercial vehicles, which will 
aid the hub-and-spoke model of 
transportation. With improving 
road infrastructure, the size of 
the long-distance trucks has been 
increasing. These diesel trucks 
typically pick-up and unload 
their goods at warehouses on 
the outskirts of metropolitan 
cities. Intra-city transport is now 
largely done by CNG powered 
small trucks, which have no travel 
time restrictions. During the 
year, the management team 
has worked on engineering 
a turnaround for IndoStar’s 
CV business, by revisiting our 
strategy, our processes and our 
underwriting policies. 
Used Commercial Vehicle 
Segment
Growth in Used CV financing 
can be attributed to several 
factors such as affordability 
and multi-purpose use. 
Despite the trend of price 
increases in commercial vehicles 
with transition to BS-6 norms and 
higher fee cost, the increase in 
used CV price is relatively lower, 
making this an attractive option 
for customers wanting to purchase 
commercial vehicles. Used CVs 
come with multi-purpose usability, 
such as their ability to handle 
a variety of loads, including 
sand, cement, and grain, which 
continued to drive demand.
Key Initiatives to expand Used CV 
segment:
•	 To leverage our existing reach 
by increasing penetration 
in the market, enhance 
customer connection
•	 Launched a new digital 
process to help increase 
market presence, reach 
smaller geographies and 
increase penetration in rural 
market besides improve 
the productivity of the 
sales employee. 
Business Review in FY2023
The demand for medium & heavy 
commercial vehicles and a strong 
push for light commercial vehicles 
are leading to an increase in used 
vehicle segment. This is primarily 
due to the scrappage policy of the 
government, which puts a 15-year 
limit on the age of the vehicle.
The replacement demand was 
favourable during the year 
as certain replacement sales 
originally anticipated in 
FY 2021-22 were deferred due 
Replacement demand under 
the vehicle scrappage policy 
is expected to be a key driver 
for the industry. 
We are building our capabilities, 
infrastructure and processes in the 
CV finance space. We intend to be 
a pan-India company catering to 
pre-owned vehicle requirements 
of all our customers, and expect 
to grow our AUM manifold, 
considering the potential in the 
used CV space.

IndoStar Home Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indostar Capital Finance, is an affordable housing

size of ~ ` 9 lakh. In the past 6 years, we have built a strong branch infrastructure and employee base. We are 
strategically focused on ramping up disbursements, with a clear line of sight on liquidity and a robust funding 
pipeline, while maintaining strong asset quality. During the year, we onboarded leading industry professionals 
to manage key functions of Finance, Human Resource and Technology. We have a strength of 750 employees, 
with a thrust on “feet on street”. This, we believe, will help us scale our business further.

Business Review in FY2023
C. SME FINANCE
The current aim is to run down 
the SME book over the next 
few years. The management 
team will explore the option of 
launching a new SME product 
focussed on much lower ticket 
size, mainly in the Tier 3 and Tier 
4 markets, towards the end of 
FY2024. Till then the emphasis is 
to run down the book by way of 
collection or other arrangements. 
Corporate Lending
Our endeavour is to reduce 
our share in corporate lending. 
We expect our corporate book 
to be less than 15% of our AUM 
by the end of FY2024. This is 
expected to be run down over the 
next 2-3 years by way of collection 
or other arrangements.  
Key Achievements of FY2023
a. Raised incremental funding
In FY2023, we raised incremental 
funding of ` 3,967 crore, which 
contributed to our healthy liquidity 
position. As on March 31, 2023, 
we had cash or cash equivalents 
of ` 1,069 crore. IndoStar’s Asset 
Liability Management (ALM) 
profile has seen significant 
improvement in the year, 
compared to the previous year.
b. Reduced the size of stressed 
asset book
As part of its retailisation strategy, 
retail loans have gone up from 
78% in FY2021 to 85% in FY2023, 
despite very low disbursement 
of retail loans in the current 
financial year. Net profit is driven 
by lower credit cost provisions 
in the commercial vehicle loan 
segment. Collections in FY2023 
of ` 4,038 crore resulted in gross 
collection efficiency of 145.0%, 
with collections in the Commercial 
Vehicle division being at ` 1,820 
crore FY2023, up 15% from ` 1,583 
crore FY2022. The Company made 
concentrated efforts to reduce the 
stress book by driving customer 
settlements and sale of nearly 50% 
of the stress book. Stress book 
now stands at ~4% of total 
vehicle finance AUM.
c. Achieved greater granularity in 
business
The Company is reorienting its 
underwriting policies and shifting 
focus on the customer side to 
small fleet owners, resulting 
in greater granularity; and on 
the product side to used CVs, 
especially medium CVs and 
small CVs, from heavy CVs. 
This focus will result in greater 
granularity in the business. 
Future growth is expected to be 
driven by these segments and 
performance of affordable housing 
finance business.
d. Gained adequate capitalisation
IndoStar continues to have 
adequate capitalisation, even 
post the impact of the additional 
provisioning taken in the financial 
statements pertaining to FY2022. 
Its Consolidated Networth stood 
at ` 3,111.6 crore as on March 31, 
2023, from ` 3,085.5 crore as on 
March 31, 2022, while its gearing 
level remained at 1.8 times as 
on the same date. The Capital 
Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stood well 
above the regulatory requirement 
at 31.5% as on March 31, 2023, 
compared to 25.8% as on 
March 31, 2022, driven by staging 
improvement. With retailisation 
of the portfolio, the gearing is 
expected to increase from the 
current levels.
Stimulating Profitable and 
Sustainable Growth in FY2023
Acquiring new customers
Our objective is to serve the used 
CV market with higher yields, as 
we believe that Tier 3&4 markets 
are still not served completely by 
the organised players. We want to 
capitalise on the opportunity to 
fill the gap in these markets and 
move our branch network into the 
hinterland, serving customers in 
Tier 3&4 cities.
Strengthening the organisation
During the year, we strengthened 
the organisation further by 
revamping our processes, 
reviewing our policies and 
upgrading technology system 
– right from loan origination to 
credit appraisal disbursal and 
collection processes. We are 
also taking sustained efforts 
to reduce our stressed book. 
Further, we also strengthened 
our collection mechanism by 
adding more people and having a 
separate Collections Call Centre. 
Over the last few quarters, we 
are consistently surpassing 120% 
collection efficiency, indicating 
clearance of earlier delinquencies. 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED

Annual Report 2022-23
Attaining cost efficiencies
We strengthened our hub-and-
spoke model by moving more 
of our branches to Tier 3&4 
cities, with a focus on opening 
smart branches with lower 
fixed costs and manned by 
lean teams. We continued to 
improve efficiencies across our 
branch network and increase 
our reach to achieve profitable 
growth. The emphasis has been 
on automation of all processes 
and to use that to improve 
productivity and thereby attain 
cost efficiencies. We continue to 
be nimble-footed on attaining cost 
efficiencies to manage profitability. 
Our investment in technology and 
digitalisation is helping us improve 
our turnaround time, improve 
productivity and drive operating 
cost efficiencies.
Stabilising asset quality
We continue to closely monitor 
the quality of our portfolio. 
We brought down Stage 3 gross 
level in every quarter of the year, 
in spite of increase driven by the 
implementation of ONAN (Once 
an NPA, Always an NPA) and 
also our conservative approach 
on staging. As on March 31, 
2023, Gross Stage 3 assets stood 
at ` 479 crore improved 
from ` 1,203 crore as on 
March 31, 2022, demonstrating 
our commitment to maintain 
a healthy loan portfolio. 
Consolidated Stage 3 assets 
of 6.8%, compared to 13.6% as 
on March 31, 2022 demonstrate 
the efficacy of our credit risk 
management strategy besides 
our robust collection process.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 
FY2023
IndoStar has marked its presence 
in 22 states across the country 
with 427 branches including Tier 
3 & 4 cities. We remain focused 
on opening smart branches that 
operate with greater efficiency and 
less manpower with the focus on 
Commercial Vehicle Finance, and 
Housing Finance. During the year, 
we strengthened the organisation 
further by revamping our 
processes, reviewing our policies, 
processes and upgrading 
technology system. We are also 
taking sustained efforts to reduce 
our stressed book. Further, we 
also strengthened our collection 
mechanism by adding more people 
and having a separate Collection 
Call centre. Over the last few 
quarters, we are consistently 
surpassing 120% collection 
efficiency, indicating clearance of 
earlier delinquencies. With strong 
support from Brookfield and 
Everstone, on consolidated basis 
IndoStar has raised ` 3,967 crore 
during the year. The year was 
unique as we worked to engineer a 
turnaround in the business.
On a consolidated basis, we 
recorded a revenue of ` 1,179.7 
crore, representing a YoY 
increase of 0.5%. Finance Cost 
at ` 580.3 crore was 7.6% higher, 
based on which the Net Total 
Income stood at ` 599.4 crore, 
showing an decrease of 5.6%. 
Net Interest Margin (NIM) 
improved substantially during 
the year as we shifted focus to 
Tier 3&4 cities.
98% of our total CV disbursement 
was for Used CVs, where yields are 
significantly better, thus improving 
the overall yields and spread, 
and increasing the granularity of 
the book thereby reducing risk. 
Operating expenses stood at 
` 401.1 crore, about 7.6% higher 
compared with the previous year, 
which was mainly on account 
of certain securitisation costs, 
payment of certain one-time 
professional expenses, and 
increase in employee cost. 
The management team has 
initiated a strategic cost control 
initiative to rationalise and control 
costs in the coming quarters.
Pre-Provisioning Operating Profit 
was ` 198.3 crore, representing a 
decline of 24.4% YoY. This can be 
attributed to the drop in Assets 
Under Management (AUM) leading 
to lower revenue, rising interest 
costs and lower disbursements, 
which added a certain amount of 
negative carry cost. Profit After 
Tax (PAT) was 225.2% higher, with 
significantly lower provisioning 
and on account of negative 
impairment costs. AUM was ` 7,813 
crore compared to ` 9,658 crore in 
the previous year.
Our capital adequacy stood 
at 31.5%, which gives us the 
resources and flexibility to 
pursue future growth ambitions. 
Our debt-equity ratio at 1.8 times 
indicates a very healthy balance 
sheet, leaving enough headroom 
for us to source external funds and 
grow the book profitably. 
A gross collection of ` 4,038 
crore was recorded in the year, 
up 10.9% versus ` 3,642 crore in 
the earlier year. Gross collection 
efficiency was 145%, reflecting 
our commitment to maintain high 
credit standards and efficient 
operations. Collection against 
the pool sold to ARC gives us 
the confidence that we will end 
up getting write-backs in the 
next few quarters.
Segmental Performance
In Commercial Vehicle Finance, 
we recorded an AUM of ` 3,672 
crore, compared to ` 4,908 
crore in the previous year, 
mainly on account of lower 
disbursements and a sale to 
an ARC. While the first two 
quarters were challenging as far 
as disbursement is concerned, it 
increased from the third quarter. 
A total disbursement of ` 1,435 
crore was recorded during the 
year. The disbursements in the 
first 2 quarters were lower mainly 
on account of the Company’s 
emphasis on preserving cash and 
also ensuring that disbursements 
start off only after the control 
processes had been thoroughly 
tested and rolled out.  
In Housing Finance, we recorded 
Total Revenue of ` 209.2 crore, 
compared to ` 144.8 crore in the 
earlier year, while PAT was ` 37.8 
crore vis-à-vis ` 34.3 crore in 
FY2022. AUM stood at ` 1,623 
crore compared to ` 1,406 crore in 
the previous year. At ` 487 crore, 
we disbursed ` 579 crore, vis-à-vis 
the last financial year. Gross Stage 
3 trended downwards to 1.3% as 
on March 31, 2023, a significant 
improvement from March 2022 
level of 1.8%. Net Stage 3 was 
0.9% with healthy spreads on the 
portfolio. In spite of adoption of 
ONAN norms, capital adequacy 
ratio was strong at 80.5%, 
indicating that the Company 
has enough capital to support 
business growth.
In SME Finance, our AUM at 
` 1,293 crore was lower vis-à-vis 
` 1,776 crore in the earlier year. 
This is in line with the Company’s 
strategy to run down the current 
SME book. The Gross NPA of the 
SME book rose from ` 150 crore in 
FY2022 to ` 200 crore in FY2023. 
The management team is focused 
on driving recoveries and 
reversals and has augmented the 
SME collections functions with 
additional legal resources to drive 
the SARFAESI recovery process 
and liquidate recovered assets 
through an open-auction process. 
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
At IndoStar, we have a strong 
vision for growth and are 
committed to achieving this in a 
calibrated and customer-centric 
manner. Going forward, we are 
confident of delivering value to 
all our stakeholders, while also 
providing the best, appropriate 
and relevant financial solutions to

and grow profitably over the 
next few quarters.
Given this scenario, the used 
commercial vehicles segment is 
expected to double by FY2025. 
Given the growing demand, we 
expect the share of financing for 
used CVs, by the organised sector 
to increase in the next few years. 
Given our small base, we expect to 
see growth at a much higher pace 
vis-à-vis the industry. In Housing 
Finance, we expect our AUM 
to grow by 2.5 times to about 
` 3,500 crore to ` 4,000 crore by 
the end of FY2025.
HUMAN RESOURCES
At IndoStar Capital, we believe 
that people are the source of 
our competitive advantage. 
Your Company emphasises in 
creating an environment where 
all employees can grow to their 
potential. The Company believes 
in meritocracy and performance is 
rewarded. To support fast-paced 
growth, the Company has been 
actively hiring highly competent 
individuals, who have strong 
domain knowledge. To keep up 
with the changing environment, 
training is provided to all the 
employees on product, processes, 
systems and compliance is tested 
periodically. Your Company 
focusses on providing on-the-
job training to young members 
and supervisors are encouraged 
to dedicate time to coach their 
team. As on March 31, 2023, 
IndoStar has an employee 
strength of 2,800.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Over the last few quarters, 
the Company has completely 
moved to a seamless digital 
lending process by adopting a 
next-generation loan-origination-
system (LOS) which has provided 
a much more transparent 
view to the overall lending 
process. Automated KYCs, 
data-driven underwriting, deep 
API integrations have led to 
improved efficiencies overall. 
Partnerships with fintech 
developers has started showing 
results with a customer app 
live - reducing the need to 
visit a branch and a sales app 
driving increased productivity 
of the sales team. Key feature 
rollouts like bank-ledger auto 
reconciliation and customer 
validation through PAN and 
Aadhaar verification have 
fixed key gaps in regulatory 
compliance. Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA) has yielded 
faster outcomes at much lower 
costs for incentive calculations, 
data entry automation, KYC 
document downloads and daily 
report generation.
Systematic adoption of cloud 
infrastructure and the gradual 
shift from ageing on-premise 
infrastructure has allowed IndoStar 
Capital to keep costs under control 
while leveraging the benefits of 
state-of-the-art cloud infrastructure 
for critical business applications.
Several security measures 
like firewall implementation in 
branches, moving to 16-digit 
complex passwords and 
continuous dark-web monitoring 
have been undertaken to secure 
the IT Infrastructure from cyber 
security threats. Security tools 
have been implemented like mobile 
device management and a secure 
email gateway to assist data 
leak prevention.

Management Discussion & Analysis

Annual Report 2022-23
a. Interest Rate Risk
This is the risk that implies the 
value of an investment will 
suffer as a result of change in 
interest rates. Interest rate risk 
can be reduced by ensuring 
diversification of investment 
maturities or can be hedged by 
using interest rate derivatives.
Mitigation
While deciding on interest rate 
revisions, IndoStar considers 
key factors like customer profile, 
competitive landscape and 
growth objectives. It maintains 
close monitoring on interest 
rate fluctuations and takes 
appropriate measures to 
protect its business.
RISK MANAGEMENT
At IndoStar Capital, the process of risk identification is guided by the Company’s objectives, external 
environment, stakeholders, among others. The process covers strategic, financial, and operational risks. 
Once the risks are identified, it devises plans outlining mitigation actions for the assigned risks.
c. Credit Risk
This is the risk arising on account 
of non-repayment or loan default 
by the borrower due to liquidity 
crisis, economic downturns, 
bankruptcy or other reasons.
Mitigation
IndoStar’s comprehensive 
and well-defined credit policy 
encompasses credit approval 
process and guidelines for 
mitigating the associated risks. 
A robust post-sanction monitoring 
process helps identify the credit 
portfolio trends and early warning 
signals to mitigate such risks.
d. Operational Risk
This risk is about failure of 
processes and controls in 
operations, which can also have 
an adverse impact on business 
continuity, reputation and 
profitability of the Company.
Mitigation
A robust control and audit 
mechanism has been implemented 
to identify and mitigate 
operational risks. The Company 
has a strong operating model 
and well-documented Standard 
Operating Procedures and a 
good reporting framework. 
This ensures that operational 
risks are minimised at any 
given point of time.
b. Asset Liability Management Risk
This is the risk faced due to a 
mismatch between the maturity 
profile of assets and liabilities on 
account of a difference in lending 
tenor between loans given to 
customers and debt raised.
Mitigation
This risk is reviewed by the 
Asset Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO) by monitoring 
market-related trends. In line with 
the Company’s Risk Management 
Framework, the Committee adopts 
various strategies related to assets 
and liabilities. The ALM support 
group also meets frequently 
to review the liquidity position. 
The Company always maintains 
adequate liquidity assets and 
reserves to enable business growth 
and repayment of obligations. 
In addition, it ensures access 
to funds at all times to ensure 
liquidity is always available in case 
of unexpected events.
e. Regulatory Risk
A complex regulatory framework 
exists in the financial sector. 
Any non-compliance with 
regulations could result in 
monetary losses and has the 
capability to damage the 
Company’s reputation.
Mitigation
The Company ensures strict 
adherence to applicable rules 
and regulations owing to a strong 
internal control framework, robust 
IT systems and an expert team. 
It closely monitors actions and 
proactively responds to changes in 
government policies to keep a tab 
on regulatory risk.

f. Fraud Risk
We may face fraud risks such as 
loan fraud, identity theft, internal 
fraud, and cyber fraud. These risks 
pose the threat of financial loss 
and reputation loss, resulting 
from intentional deception or 
misrepresentation by individuals 
or entities, internally or externally.
Mitigation
We have implemented a control 
framework to prevent, detect, 
investigate and deal with fraud. 
A dedicated Risk Control Unit 
(RCU) monitors, investigates, 
detects, and prevents fraud. 
We maintain a zero-tolerance 
policy towards fraud, actively 
raising awareness and 
implementing robust controls 
to prevent any occurrence. 
Our Fraud Risk Management 
reports to the Chief Risk Officer 
and monitors all fraud risks, 
while our Audit Committee and 
Board of Directors monitor frauds 
specified by the regulator.
g. Information Security Risk  
We may face data breaches, 
cyberattacks, and unauthorised 
access, leading to compromised 
sensitive information and potential 
reputational damage.
Mitigation 
We implemented information 
classification and appropriate 
controls, utilising Data Leak 
Prevention (DLP) measures 
to prevent unauthorised data 
disclosures, maintaining a 
Security Operations Centre 
(SOC) to monitor and respond 
to security incidents, conducting 
vulnerability assessments for all 
infrastructure and applications, 
monitoring the brand for potential 
risks and threats, ensuring 
email and network security 
measures are in place, developing 
Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery plans, and establishing 
Risk Appetite Statement 
(RAS) parameters specifically 
related to IT systems.
INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS
The Company has a robust policy 
framework to ensure adequate 
controls on business processes.
To safeguard all its assets and 
ensure operational efficiency, 
the Company has put in place a 
strong internal control mechanism. 
This ensures full compliance with 
laws and regulations, accuracy 
in financial reporting and 
management information.
In view of the control deficiencies/
gaps noted, the Company has 
strengthened controls, reviewed 
policies and upgraded technology 
systems. The Company is 
committed to remain compliant 
with sound corporate governance 
and risk management practices.
Crucial areas based on audit plans 
are reviewed by the internal audit 
function, and then examined and 
approved by the Audit Committee. 
Audit plans are formulated based 
on risk assessment to determine 
the critical areas to be reviewed.
The Management Committee and 
Audit Committee of the Board also 
review the internal audit findings. 
Thereafter, corrective actions are 
suggested and implemented by 
the process owner across relevant 
functional areas, with the aim of 
continuously strengthening the 
internal control framework.

M/s. Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, Statutory Auditors 
of the Company have, in their report(s) on the audited 
standalone and consolidated financial statements of 
your Company for the financial year ended March 31, 
2023 submitted following qualifications:
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone 
financial statements of IndoStar Capital Finance 
Limited (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance 
Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), 
the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, 
except for the possible effects on the corresponding 
figures of the matter described in the Basis for 
Qualified Opinion section of our report, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and its 
profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and 
the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
The Company had recorded a charge on account of 
impairment (net of recoveries) of `115,077 lakh for 
the year ended March 31, 2022 (including `48,075 lakh 
against loans for Commercial Vehicles (“CV”), `782 
lakh against loans to Small and Medium Enterprises 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
40
Annual Report 2022-23
(“SME”), `14,533 lakh against investment in Security 
Receipts, `1,351 lakh against additional liability 
on financial guarantee contracts consequent to 
impairment of the underlying loan assets and a loss 
of `57,764 lakh on write off of loan assets during the 
previous year).
The Company had concluded that it was impracticable 
to determine the prior period-specific effects, if any, 
of the charge to the Statement of Profit and Loss on 
account of impairment allowance, loan assets written 
off and changes in fair value of financial-guarantee 
contracts recorded during the year ended March 31, 
2022 in respect of certain account balances as explained 
by the Company in Note 41.2 of the Statement. As 
a result, we were unable to determine whether any 
adjustments were required for prior period(s) relating 
to the impairment recorded for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 and consequently, adjustments to 
income from interest, fees and commission on the 
corresponding assets and related disclosures.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2022 was modified 
accordingly. Our opinion on the financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023 (“current period”) 
is also modified because of the possible effect of this 
matter on the comparability of the current period’s 
figures and the corresponding figures.
Comments in Report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements section of the Audit Report
1(a)	 We have sought and except for the matter 
described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion 
section above, obtained all the information 
and explanations which to the best of our 
knowledge and belief were necessary for the 
purposes of our audit.
1(d) Except for the possible effects of this matter on 
the comparability of the current year’s figures 
and the corresponding figures of the previous 
year, in our opinion, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements comply with the Ind AS 
specified under Section 133 of the Act.
Comments in Annexure B to the Auditors Report
(xvii) The Company has not incurred cash losses in the 
financial year covered by our audit. Considering 
the standalone financial statements of the 
Company as at and for the year ended March 31, 
2022 (immediately preceding financial year), 
and the matter of audit qualification as reported 
by us in Basis for Qualified Opinion section of 
our Audit Report (dated August 5, 2022) on 
those financial statements, the effect of which 
we are unable to determine, we are unable to 
state if the Company has incurred cash losses 
during the immediately preceding financial year.
Directors’ response to comments of the Statutory 
Auditors in the Audit Report
With respect to the qualification of the Statutory 
Auditors, the qualification pertains to comparability 
of the current year figures with that of previous 
year as explained in note 41.2 of the Standalone 
financial statements. There is no impact of the audit 
qualification on the figures for the current year i.e. 
year ended March 31, 2023.
As explained in note 41.2 of the financial statements, 
for the previous year ended March 31, 2022, the 
Company had made incremental provision for 
expected credit loss (ECL) allowances on account of 
certain deficiencies in the Company’s internal controls 
that were identified during period ended March 31, 
2022. Considering that these control deficiencies have 
since been remediated during the current year and the 
findings of the Conduct Review have been adequately 
evaluated (refer note 41.1 of the Standalone financial 
statements), no incremental provisioning is considered 
necessary during the year ended March 31, 2023.
Although the possibility that the control deficiencies 
that were identified during previous year could 
potentially have had an impact on the financial 
statements for periods ending prior to April 1, 2021, 
the Company had concluded that it was impracticable 
to determine the prior period – specific effects, if any, 
in respect of the charge to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss for the previous year ended March 31, 2022 
when it finalised its financial statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2022 because significant judgements 
had been applied in determining the staging of the 
loan assets and the related impairment allowance for 
events and conditions which existed as on March 31, 
2022. The Company believes it is not practicable to 
apply the same judgement without hindsight for the 
prior period(s).
Consequent to the above, in respect of such account 
balances, related income and the related disclosures, 
the figures for the year ended March 31, 2023 may not 
be strictly comparable with the figures for the year 
ended March 31, 2022.

In terms of Section 204 of the Act and Regulation 24A 
(1) of the Listing Regulations, Secretarial Audit Report

of Corporate Affairs, the Company would like to submit

of MCA and despite the Company’s continuous and 
rigorous efforts, the forms could not be uploaded on

filed all the forms immediately.
The delay in filing of returns with Reserve Bank of

During the year under review, the Statutory Auditors 
have not reported any instances of fraud in the 
Company committed by officers or employees of 
the Company to the Audit Committee under Section 
143(12) of the Act.
The Statutory Auditors have, in their report on Internal 
Financial Control over Financial Reporting under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act, 
have provided an Qualified Opinion as under.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
According to the information and explanations given 
to us and based on our audit, the following material 
weakness has been identified in the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements as at March 31, 2023:
The Company had concluded that it was impracticable 
to determine the prior period-specific effects, if any, 
of the charge to the Statement of Profit and Loss on 
account of impairment allowance, loan assets written 
off and changes in fair value of financial-guarantee 
contracts recorded during the year ended March 31, 
2022 in respect of account balances identified and 
explained by the Company in Note 41.2 of the 
standalone financial statements. As a result, we were 
unable to determine whether any adjustments were 
required for prior period(s) relating to the impairment 
charge recorded for the year ended March 31, 2022 
and consequently, adjustments to income from 
interest, fees and commission on the corresponding 
assets and related disclosures.
Because of the deficiency in financial closing 
and reporting process, in respect of comparative 
information as aforesaid, we were unable to assess 
whether or not the current year’s figures are 
comparable to those of the previous year.
A ‘material weakness’ is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal financial control with 
reference to standalone financial statements, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the company’s annual or interim 
financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
on a timely basis.

Qualified Opinion:
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, except for 
the possible effects of the material weakness described 
in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph above 
on the achievement of the objectives of the control 
criteria, the Company has maintained, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone

financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
We have considered the material weakness identified 
and reported above in determining the nature, 
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit 
of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended March 31, 2023, and 
the material weakness does not affect our opinion 
on the said standalone Ind AS financial statements 
of the Company.
Directors’ response to comments above of the 
Statutory Auditors in the report on Internal Financial 
Control over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act:
With respect to the Qualified Opinion above, the 
qualification pertains to comparability of the current 
year figures with that of previous year as explained in 
note 41.2 of the Standalone financial statements. There 
is no impact of the audit qualification on the figures 
for the current year i.e. year ended March 31, 2023. 
As explained in note 41.2 of the Standalone financial 
statements for the current year the figures for the year 
ended March 31, 2023 may not be strictly comparable

Independent Auditor’s Report
To 
The Members of 
IndoStar Capital Finance Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone 
financial statements of IndoStar Capital Finance 
Limited (the “Company”), which comprise the Balance 
Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), 
the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of 
Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, except for 
the possible effects on the corresponding figures 
of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified 
Opinion section of our report, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by 
the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so 
required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at March 31, 2023, and its profit, total 
comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes 
in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
As explained in Note 41.2 to the standalone financial 
statement, the Company had recorded a charge to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss on account of impairment 
allowance, loan assets written off and changes in 
fair value of financial-guarantee contracts recorded 
during the quarter and year ended March 31, 2022. 
The Company had concluded it was impracticable to 
determine the prior period-specific effects, if any, of 
this charge because significant judgements had been 
applied in determining the staging of the loan assets 
recorded at amortised cost and the related impairment 
allowance for events and conditions which existed as 
on 31 March 2022. The Company believes it is not 
practicable to apply the same judgements without 
hindsight for the prior period(s).
As a result, we were unable to determine whether any 
adjustments were required for prior period(s) relating to 
the impairment recorded for the year ended March 31, 
2022 and consequently, adjustments to income from 
interest, fees and commission on the corresponding 
assets and related disclosures.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statement 
for the year ended March 31, 2022 was modified 
accordingly. Our opinion on the financial statements for 
the year ended March 31, 2023 (“current year”) is also 
modified because of the possible effect of this matter 
on the comparability of the current period’s figures and 
the corresponding figures of the previous year.
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (“SA”s) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility 
for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules made thereunder and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion 
on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. In addition to the matter described in 
the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, 
we have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
1
Allowance for Expected Credit Losses 
(ECL) on Loan Assets:
(Refer Notes 5 and 2.3(f)(i) to the 
standalone financial statements)
As at 31 March, 2023, loan assets 
aggregated ` 519,562 lakhs (net of ECL 
` 54,168 lakhs), which are measured at 
amortised cost, constituting 64% of 
the Company’s total assets.
As part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that significant judgement 
is used in classifying these loan 
assets 
and 
applying 
appropriate 
measurement 
principles. 
The 
allowance for ECL on loan assets has a 
high degree of estimation uncertainty, 
with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes for the financial statements. 
The elements of estimating ECL which 
involved increased level of audit focus 
are the following:
•	 Staging the loan assets i.e. 
classification 
in 
‘significant 
increase in credit risk’ (‘SICR’) and 
‘default’ categories
•	 Basis 
used 
for 
estimating 
Probabilities of Default (“PD”);
•	 Basis used for estimating Loss Given 
Default (“LGD”);
•	 Adjustments to model driven ECL 
results, to address emerging trends.
•	 Impact, if any, arising out of the 
findings of the Conduct Review in 
respect of Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) 
loan assets portfolio and Small and 
Medium Enterprises (“SME”) loan 
portfolio. (Refer note 41.1)
Principal audit procedures performed:
We have read and assessed the accounting policies and the 
governance framework approved by the Board of Directors of 
the Company.
We have verified the methodology adopted for computation of 
ECL (“ECL Model”) on loan assets that complies with policies 
approved by the Board of Directors, procedures and controls for 
assessing and measuring credit risk on the loan assets measured 
at amortised cost.
Our audit procedures related to the allowance for ECL on loan 
assets included the following, among others:
•	 Testing the design and effectiveness of controls over the:
•	 completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default (“EAD”) 
and the classification thereof into stages consistent with the 
definitions applied in accordance with the policy approved by 
the Board of Directors including the appropriateness of the 
qualitative factors (including findings arising from Conduct 
Review) to be applied.
•	 appropriateness of information used in the estimation of the 
PD and LGD for the different stages depending on the nature 
of the portfolio; and
•	 computation of the ECL including methodology used to 
determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments to the 
output of the ECL Model.
•	 Additional controls instituted and modifications to the existing 
controls that were carried out to address the findings of the 
Conduct Review.
•	 Also, for the samples tested included the following, among others:
•	 the appropriateness of the qualitative factors applied by the 
Management for staging of loans as SICR or default categories 
in view of Company’s policy on restructuring and arising from 
the findings of the Conduct Review;
•	 We tested the input data used in estimating the PD;
•	 We evaluated reasonableness of LGD estimates.
•	 mathematical accuracy of the computation of the ECL including 
methodology used to determine macro-economic overlays and 
adjustments to the output of the ECL Model.

Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes 
in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind 
AS and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statement that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the Company.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
standalone financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
standalone financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
110
Annual Report 2022-23
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A”  
to the Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements of 
IndoStar Capital Finance Limited (“the Company”) as 
of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
based on the internal control with reference to 
standalone financial statements criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements of the Company based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and 
the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls over financial reporting with reference to 
standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to standalone 
financial statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to standalone financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
According to the information and explanations given 
to us and based on our audit, the following material 
weakness has been identified in the Company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements as at March 31, 2023:
The Company had concluded that it was impracticable 
to determine the prior period-specific effects, if any, 
of the charge to the Statement of Profit and Loss on 
account of impairment allowance, loan assets written 
off and changes in fair value of financial-guarantee 
contracts recorded during the year ended March 31, 
2022 in respect of account balances identified and 
explained by the Company in Note 41.2 of the 
standalone financial statements. As a result, we were 
unable to determine whether any adjustments were 
required for prior period(s) relating to the impairment 
charge recorded for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 
consequently, adjustments to income from interest, 
fees and commission on the corresponding assets and 
related disclosures.
Because of the deficiency in financial closing and 
reporting process, in respect of comparative information 
as aforesaid, we were unable to assess whether or not 
the current year’s figures are comparable to those of 
the previous year.
A ‘material weakness’ is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal financial control with reference 
to standalone financial statements, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of 
the company’s annual or interim financial statements 
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, except for 
the possible effects of the material weakness described 
in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph above 
on the achievement of the objectives of the control 
criteria, the Company has maintained, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2023, based on the criteria for internal 
financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
We have considered the material weakness identified 
and reported above in determining the nature, timing, 
and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended March 31, 2023, and the material 
weakness does not affect our opinion on the said 
standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company.

“loan assets”), the schedule of repayment of 
principal and payment of interest has been 
stipulated. Note 2.3(f)(i) to the standalone 
financial statements explains the Company’s 
accounting policy relating to impairment of 
financial assets which include loan assets. 
In accordance with that policy, loan assets 
were categorised as credit impaired (“Stage

(“Stage 2”). Disclosures in respect of such 
loans have been provided in Note 31(E) 
to the standalone financial statements.

significantly increased since initial recognition

the repayment of principal and payment of 
interest aggregating ` 41,383 lakhs were also 
identified, albeit of less than 31 days. In all 
other cases, the repayment of principal and 
interest is regular. Having regard to the nature

provide an itemised list of loan assets where 
delinquencies in the repayment of principal 
and interest have been identified.

statements. Reasonable steps are being 
taken by the Company for recovery of the 
principal and interest.
	
(e)	 The Company’s principal business is to give 
loans, and hence reporting under paragraph 
3(iii)(e) of the Order is not applicable.
	
(f)	 The Company has not granted any loans or 
advances in the nature of loans that were 
either repayable on demand or without 
specifying any terms or period of repayment 
during the year. Hence, reporting under 
paragraph 3(iii)(f) is not applicable.

companies. Accordingly, paragraph 3(ix)(f) of 
the Order is not applicable.
(x)	 (a)	 The Company has not issued any of its

3(x)(a) of the Order is not applicable.
	
(b)	 During the year the Company has not made any 
preferential allotment or private placement 
of shares or convertible debentures (fully or

Medium Enterprise (SME) loan assets 
portfolio identified during the audit of the 
financial statements as at and for the year 
ended March 31, 2022, as explained in note 
41.1 to the standalone financial statements, 
during the year, the Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors of the Company, had 
initiated a review of certain transactions 
carried out during the financial years ended 
March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 with the 
objective of identifying the root cause for 
control deficiencies identified during the 
audit (for which it had engaged the services 
of a law firm and a professional services 
firm). The findings of the said law firm and 
professional services firm were evaluated 
and assessed with the assistance of another 
legal expert, as to whether any act, omission 
or conduct on the part of certain employee/
ex-employees was fraudulent as contemplated 
in section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013. 
Based on the opinion of the said legal expert, 
the Company concluded that the actions of 
the identified personnel did not constitute a 
‘fraud’ as contemplated under section 447 of

(xii)	The Company is not a Nidhi Company and hence 
reporting under paragraph 3(xii) of the Order is 
not applicable.
(xiii)	In our opinion, the Company has complied with 
the provisions of Section 177 and 188 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, where applicable, for all

nature of its business.
	
(b)	 We have considered, the internal audit 
reports, issued to the Company during the 
year covering the period up to March 31, 2023.
(xv)	In our opinion, during the year the Company has 
not entered into any non-cash transactions with 
any of its directors or directors of its holding 
company or subsidiary companies or persons 
connected with such director and hence provisions 
of section 192 of the Companies Act, 2013 are not 
applicable to the Company.
(xvi)	(a)	 The Company is required to be registered 
under section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of 
India Act, 1934 (“RBI Act”) and it has obtained

Annual Report 2022-23
Certificate of Registration (‘CoR’) from the 
RBI as per the RBI Act. The Company has 
not conducted any housing finance activities 
and is not required to obtain CoR for such 
activities from the RBI.
	
(c)	 The Company is not a Core Investment 
Company (“CIC”) and hence reporting under 
paragraph 3(xvi)(c) of the Order is not 
applicable to the Company.
	
(d)	 The Group does not have any CIC as part 
of the group and accordingly reporting 
under paragraph 3(xvi)(d) of the Order is 
not applicable.
(xvii)  The Company has not incurred cash losses 
in the financial year covered by our audit. 
Considering the standalone financial statements 
of the Company as at and for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 (immediately preceding financial 
year), and the matter of audit qualification as 
reported by us in Basis for Qualified Opinion 
section of our Audit Report (dated August 5, 
2022) on those financial statements, the effect 
of which we are unable to determine, we are 
unable to state if the Company has incurred 
cash losses during the immediately preceding 
financial year.
(xviii)  There has been no resignation of the statutory 
auditors of the Company during the year.
(xix)  On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and 
expected dates of realization of financial assets 
and payment of financial liabilities, Asset Liability 
Maturity (ALM) pattern, other information 
accompanying the financial statements and 
our knowledge of the Board of Directors and 
Management plans and based on our examination 
of the evidence supporting the assumptions, 
nothing has come to our attention, which causes 
us to believe that any material uncertainty exists 
as on the date of the audit report indicating that 
Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities 
existing at the date of balance sheet as and when 
they fall due within a period of one year from the 
balance sheet date. We, however, state that this 
is not an assurance as to the future viability of 
the Company. We further state that our reporting 
is based on the facts up to the date of the audit 
report and we neither give any guarantee nor any 
assurance that all liabilities falling due within a 
period of one year from the balance sheet date, 
will get discharged by the Company as and 
when they fall due.
(xx)	The Company was not required to spend any 
amount towards Corporate Social Responsibility 
(“CSR”) and accordingly there are no unspent CSR 
amount for the year requiring a transfer to a fund 
specified in Schedule VII to the Companies Act or 
special account in compliance with the provision 
of sub-section (6) of section 135 of the said Act. 
Accordingly, reporting under paragraph 3(xx) of 
the Order is not applicable for the year.

Corporate Information
	
IndoStar Capital Finance Limited (‘the Company’ 
or ‘ICFL’) was incorporated on 21 July 2009 and is 
domiciled in India. The Company is registered with 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Systemically 
Important Non-Deposit taking Non-Banking 
Financial Company (NBFC-ND-SI) vide certificate 
No. N-13.02109. The Company is primarily 
engaged in lending business.
2	
Basis 
of 
Preparation 
and 
Significant 
accounting policies
2.1	 Statement 
of 
compliance 
and 
basis 
of 
preparation
	
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind 
AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
from time to time. The financial statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by the application of fair value 
measurements required or allowed by relevant 
accounting standards. Accounting policies have 
been consistently applied to all periods presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
	
The financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, as the management is satisfied 
that the Company shall be able to continue its 
business for the foreseeable future. In making this 
assessment, the management has considered a 
wide range of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including future projections of 
profitability, cash flows and capital resources.
2.2 Presentation of financial statements
	
The Balance Sheet and the Statement of Profit 
and Loss are prepared and presented in the 
format prescribed in the Division III to Schedule 
III to the Act applicable for Non Banking Financial 
Companies (“NBFC”). The Statement of Cash 
Flows has been prepared and presented as per 
the requirements of Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash 
Flows”. The disclosure requirements with respect 
to items in the Balance Sheet and Statement of 
Profit and Loss, as prescribed in the Division III 
to Schedule III to the Act, are presented by way 
of notes forming part of the financial statements 
along with the other notes required to be 
disclosed under the notified accounting Standards 
and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally 
reported gross in the balance sheet. They are only 
offset and reported net when, in addition to having 
an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts without being contingent 
on a future event, the parties also intend to settle 
on a net basis in all of the following circumstances:
•	 the normal course of business
•	 the event of default
•	 the event of insolvency of bankruptcy of the 
Company/ or its counterparties.
2.3 Significant Accounting Policies
	
a) 	 Financial Instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be 
termed as financial instruments.
	
	
Financial instruments are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
terms of the instruments.
	
(i)	 Classification of Financial Instruments
	
	
The Company classifies its financial assets into 
the following measurement categories:
	
	
1. 	 Financial assets to be measured 
at amortised cost
	
	
2. 	 Financial assets to be measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income
	
	
3. 	 Financial assets to be measured at fair 
value through profit or loss account
	
	
The classification depends on the contractual 
terms of the financial assets’ cash flows and 
the Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
	
The Company classifies its financial liabilities 
at amortised cost unless it has designated 
liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss 
account or is required to measure liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) such 
as derivative liabilities. Financial liabilities, 
other than loan commitments and financial 
guarantees, are measured at FVTPL when 
they are derivative instruments or the fair 
value designation is applied.
	
	
Transaction costs directly pertaining to the 
acquisition or issue of financial instruments 
are added to or deducted from the initial 
measurement amount of the instrument 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
124
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
except where the instrument is initially 
measured as fair value through profit or loss.
	
(ii)	 Assessment 
of 
business 
model 
and 
contractual cash flow characteristics for 
financial assets
	
	
Business model assessment
	
	
The Company determines its business model 
at the level that best reflects how it manages 
groups of financial assets to achieve its 
business objective. The Company’s business 
model determines whether the cash flows will 
be generated by collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling financial assets or by both.
	
	
The Company’s business model is assessed at 
portfolio level and not at instrument level, and 
is based on observable factors such as:
	
	
(i)	 How the performance of the business 
model and the financial assets held 
within that business model are evaluated 
and reported to the entity’s key 
management personnel;
	
	
(ii)	 The risks that affect the performance of 
the business model and, in particular, the 
way those risks are managed;
	
	
(iii)	 The expected frequency, value and 
timing of sales are also important 
aspects of the Company’s assessment. 
The business model assessment is 
based on reasonably expected scenarios 
without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress 
case’ scenarios into account.
	
	
Solely payment of principal and interest 
(SPPI) test
	
	
Subsequent to the assessment to the relevant 
business model of the financial assets, the 
Company assesses the contractual terms of 
financial assets to identify whether the cash 
flow realised are towards solely payment of 
principal and interest.
	
	
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined 
as the fair value of the financial asset at initial 
recognition and may change over the life of the 
financial asset. The most significant elements 
of interest within a lending arrangement are 
typically the consideration for the time value 
of money and credit risk.
	
(iii)	 Initial measurement of financial instruments
	
	
The classification of financial instruments at 
initial recognition depends on their contractual 
terms and the business model for managing 
the instruments. Financial instruments are 
initially measured at their fair value.
	
(iv)	Classification of Financial Instruments as per 
business model and SPPI test
	
	
(a)	 Loans 
and 
Debt 
instruments 
at 
amortised cost
	
	
	
A ‘loan or debt instrument’ is measured at 
the amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
	
i)	
The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
	
ii)	
The contractual terms of the asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortization is included 
in interest income in the profit or loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the profit or loss.
	
	
(b)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
if these financial assets are held within 
a business model whose objective is 
achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows that give rise on specified dates 
to sole payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding and 
by selling financial assets.
	
	
(c)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are those that are either 
held for trading and have been either

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
designated by management upon initial 
recognition or are mandatorily required 
to be measured at fair value under Ind 
AS 109. Management only designates 
an instrument at FVTPL upon initial 
recognition when one of the following 
criteria are met (such designation 
is determined on an instrument-by-
instrument basis):
	
	
	
The designation eliminates, or significantly 
reduces, the inconsistent treatment that 
would otherwise arise from measuring 
the assets or recognising gains or losses 
on them on a different basis.
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are recorded in 
the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in 
fair value are recorded in profit and loss.
	
	
(d) 	Debt securities and other borrowed 
funds
	
	
	
After initial measurement, debt issued and 
other borrowed funds are subsequently 
measured 
at 
amortised 
cost. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on 
issue funds, and costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. A compound financial 
instrument which contains both a liability 
and an equity component is separated at 
the issue date.
	
	
(e)	 Financial guarantees
	
	
	
Financial guarantees are initially 
recognised in the financial statements 
(within ‘Provisions’) at fair value, being 
the premium/deemed premium received. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
Company’s liability under each guarantee 
is measured at the higher of (i) the amount 
initially recognised less cumulative 
amortisation recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss and (ii) the amount of 
loss allowance. The premium/deemed 
premium is recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis 
over the life of the guarantee.
	
	
(f)	 Undrawn loan commitments
	
	
	
Undrawn 
loan 
commitments 
are 
commitments under which, over the 
duration of the commitment, the 
Company is required to provide a loan 
with pre-specified terms to the customer. 
Undrawn loan commitments are in the 
scope of the ECL requirements.
	
(v) 	Reclassification of financial assets and 
liabilities
	
	
The Company does not reclassify its financial 
assets subsequent to their initial recognition, 
apart from the exceptional circumstances in 
which the Company acquires, disposes of, or 
terminates a business line.
	
(vi)	Derecognition of financial assets in the 
following circumstances
	
	
(a)	 Derecognition of financial assets due to 
substantial modification of terms and 
conditions
	
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial 
asset, such as a loan to a customer, 
when the terms and conditions have 
been renegotiated to the extent that, 
substantially it becomes a new loan 
with the difference recognised as a 
derecognition gain or loss, to the extent 
that an impairment loss has not already 
been recorded. The newly recognised 
loans are classified as Stage 1 for ECL 
measurement purposes, unless the new 
loan is deemed to be credit-impaired at 
the origination date.
	
	
	
If the modification does not result in cash 
flows that are substantially different, 
the modification does not result in 
derecognition. Based on the change in 
cash flows discounted at the original EIR, 
the Company records a modification gain 
or loss, to the extent that an impairment 
loss has not already been recorded.
	
	
(b)	 Derecognition of financial assets other 
than due to substantial modification
	
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
	
A financial asset or a part of financial 
asset is derecognised when the rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial 
asset have expired. The Company also 
derecognises the financial asset if it has 
transferred the financial asset and the 
transfer qualifies for derecognition.
	
	
	
The Company has transferred the financial 
asset if, and only if, either:
•	 The Company has transferred its 
contractual rights to receive cash 
flows from the financial asset; or
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
126
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
•	 It retains the rights to the cash flows, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows.
	
	
	
A 
transfer 
only 
qualifies 
for 
derecognition if either:
•	 The 
Company 
has 
transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset; or
•	 The Company has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
	
	
	
The Company considers control to be 
transferred if and only if, the transferee 
has the practical ability to sell the 
asset in its entirety to an unrelated 
third party and is able to exercise that 
ability unilaterally and without imposing 
additional restrictions on the transfer.
	
	
	
When the Company has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards and has 
retained control of the asset, the asset 
continues to be recognised only to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement, in which case, the Company 
also recognises an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that 
the Company has retained.
	
	
	
Write off
	
	
	
The Company writes off a financial asset 
when there is information indicating that 
the counterparty is in severe financial 
difficulty and there is no realistic prospect 
of recovery. Financial assets written 
off may still be subject to enforcement 
activities under the Company’s recovery 
procedures, taking into account legal 
advice where appropriate. Any recoveries 
made are recognised in Statement of 
profit and loss.
	
(vii)	Derecognition of Financial liabilities
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. Where an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and the recognition of 
a new liability. The difference between the 
carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
b) 	 Fair Value Measurement
	
	
On initial recognition, all the financial 
instruments are measured at fair value. 
For subsequent measurement, the Company 
measures certain categories of financial 
instruments at fair value on each balance 
sheet date. Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
	
	
The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the 
asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
	
i.	
In the principal market for the asset 
or liability, or
	
	
ii.	
In the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by 
using the asset in its highest and best use or 
by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and for 
which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
	
	
In order to show how fair values have been 
derived, financial instruments are classified 
based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, 
as summarised below:
	
	
Fair values are categorised into different levels 
in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs 
used in the valuation techniques as follows:

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
	
Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities;
	
	
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;
	
	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data.
	
	
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of 
an asset or a liability fall into different levels 
of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value 
measurement is categorised in its entirety in 
the same level of the fair value hierarchy as 
the lowest level input that is significant to the 
entire measurement.
	
	
The Company recognises transfers between 
levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of 
the reporting period during which the change 
has occurred, if any.
	
c) 	 Property plant and equipment
	
	
Recognition and measurement
	
	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is 
recognised when it is probable that the 
future economic benefits associated with it 
will flow to the company and the cost can be 
measured reliably.
	
	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises 
the purchase price and any attributable cost of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for 
its intended use. Borrowing costs relating to 
acquisition of assets which takes substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended 
use are also included to the extent they relate 
to the year till such assets are ready to be put 
to use. Any trade discounts and rebates are 
deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of 
such assets are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
	
Subsequent expenditure
	
	
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate only if it is probable 
that the future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Company and 
that the cost of the item can be reliably 
measured. The carrying amount of any 
component accounted for as a separate asset 
is derecognised when replaced. All other 
repair and maintenance expenses are charged 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the 
reporting period in which they are incurred.
	
	
Depreciation
	
	
Depreciation is provided on Straight 
Line Method (‘SLM’), which reflects the 
management’s estimate of the useful life of 
the respective assets. The estimated useful life 
used to provide depreciation are as follows:

Leasehold improvement is amortised on 
Straight Line Method over the lease term, 
subject to a maximum of 60 months.

in Schedule II of the Act has been estimated 
by

for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
	
The useful lives and the method of depreciation 
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. Changes in 
the expected useful life are accounted for 
by changing the amortisation period or 
methodology, as appropriate, and treated as 
changes in accounting estimates.
	
d) 	 Intangible assets
	
	
Recognition and measurement
	
	
An intangible asset is recognised only when 
its cost can be measured reliably and it is 
probable that the expected future economic 
benefits that are attributable to it will flow 
to the Company. Intangible assets acquired 
separately are measured on initial recognition 
at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. The cost of intangible assets 
acquired in a business combination is their 
fair value as at the date of acquisition.
	
	
Amortisation
	
	
Intangible assets are amortised using the 
straight line method over a period of 3 years, 
which is the management’s estimate of its 
useful life. The amortisation period and the 
amortisation method are reviewed at least 
as at each financial year end. If the expected 
useful life of the asset is significantly different 
from previous estimates, the amortisation 
period is changed accordingly.
	
	
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or 
disposal of an intangible asset are determined 
as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and recognised as income or expense 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
e) 	 Business Combination and goodwill thereon
	
	
Business combinations other than under 
common control are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured at the value which is aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at 
acquisition date fair value and the amount of 
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. 
The identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair 
values, as on date of acquisition.
	
	
Measurement
	
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests, and any previous 
interest held, over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. In case the 
excess is on account of bargain purchase, the 
gain is recognised directly in equity as capital 
reserve. When the transaction is of nature 
other than bargain purchase, then the gain is 
recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity 
as capital reserve.
	
f) 	 Impairment
	
(i)	 Financial Assets
	
	
(a)	 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles
	
	
	
The Company records allowance for 
expected credit losses for all loans, 
debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, 
undrawn loan commitments (referred to 
as ‘financial instruments’).
	
	
	
For the computation of ECL on the 
financial instruments, the Company 
categories its financial instruments as 
mentioned below:
	
	
	
Stage 1: All exposures where there has 
not been a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition or that has 
low credit risk at the reporting date 
and that are not credit impaired upon 
origination are classified under this stage. 
The Company classifies all advances upto 
30 days overdue under this category. 
Stage 1 loans also include facilities where 
the credit risk has improved and the loan 
has been reclassified from Stage 2.
	
	
	
Stage 2: Exposures are classified as 
Stage 2 when the amount is due for 
more than 30 days but do not exceed 
90 days. All exposures where there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition but are not credit 
impaired are classified under this stage.
	
	
	
Stage 3: All exposures are assessed as 
credit impaired when one or more events 
that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of that asset 
have occurred. Exposures where the

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
amount remains due for 91 days or more 
are considered as to be stage 3 assets.
	
	
	
The Company has established a 
policy to perform an assessment, at 
the end of each reporting period, of 
whether a financial instrument’s credit 
risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition, by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring 
over the remaining life of the financial 
instrument. The Company undertakes 
the classification of exposures within the 
aforesaid stages at borrower level.
	
	
(b) 	Definition of default
	
	
	
A default on a financial asset is when the 
counterparty fails to make the contractual 
payments within 90 days of when they 
fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets 
shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the 
reporting date, it has been more than 90 
days past due. Non-payment on another 
obligation of the same customer is also 
considered as a Stage 3.
	
	
(c) 	 Calculation of ECL:
	
	
	
ECL is a probability weighted credit 
losses (i.e. present value of all cash 
shortfalls) over the expected life of the 
financial instruments.
	
	
	
Cash shortfalls are the difference 
between the cash flows that the entity 
is entitled to receive on account of 
contract and the cash flows that the 
entity expects to receive.
	
	
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations 
are outlined below and the key elements 
are as follows:
	
	
	
Exposure-At-Default 
(EAD): 
The 
Exposure at Default is the amount the 
Company is entitled to receive as on 
reporting date including repayments 
due 
for 
principal 
and 
interest, 
whether scheduled by contract or 
otherwise, expected drawdowns on 
committed facilities.
	
	
	
Probability of Default (PD): The 
Probability of Default is an estimate of 
the likelihood of default of the exposure 
over a given time horizon. A default may 
only happen at a certain time over the 
assessed period, if the facility has not 
been previously derecognised and is still 
in the portfolio.
	
	
	
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given 
Default is an estimate of the loss arising 
in the case where a default occurs at a 
given time. It is based on the difference 
between the contractual cash flows due 
and those that the lender would expect 
to receive, including from the realisation 
of any collateral.
	
	
	
The ECL allowance is applied on 
the financial instruments depending 
upon the classification of the financial 
instruments as per the credit risk 
involved. ECL allowance is computed on 
the below mentioned basis:
	
	
	
12-month ECL: 12-month ECL is the 
portion of Lifetime ECL that represents 
the ECL that results from default events 
on a financial instrument that are 
possible within the 12 months after the 
reporting date. 12-month ECL is applied 
on stage 1 assets.
	
	
	
Lifetime ECL: Lifetime ECL for credit 
losses expected to arise over the life of 
the asset in cases of credit impaired loans 
and in case of financial instruments where 
there has been significant increase in 
credit risk since origination. Lifetime ECL 
is the expected credit loss resulting 
from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument. 
Lifetime ECL is applied on stage 2 and 
stage 3 assets.
	
	
	
The Company computes the ECL 
allowance either on individual basis or on 
collective basis, depending on the nature 
of the underlying portfolio of financial 
instruments. The Company has grouped 
its loan portfolio into Corporate loans, 
SME loans and Commercial vehicle loans.
	
	
	
ECL on Trade Receivables:
	
	
	
The Company applies the simplified 
approach for computation of ECL on 
trade receivables as allowed as per Ind AS 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
130
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
109. Thus, the Company is recognising 
lifetime ECL for trade receivables.
	
	
	
Significant increase in Credit Risk
	
	
	
The Company monitors all financial 
assets and financial guarantee contracts 
that are subject to the impairment 
requirements to assess whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition. If there 
has been a significant increase in credit 
risk, the Company will measure the 
loss allowance based on lifetime rather 
than 12-month ECL.
	
	
	
In assessing whether the credit risk on 
a financial instrument has increased 
significantly since initial recognition, the 
Company compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the financial instrument 
at the reporting date based on the 
remaining maturity of the instrument 
with the risk of a default occurring 
that was anticipated for the remaining 
maturity at the current reporting date 
when the financial instrument was first 
recognised. In making this assessment, 
the Company considers both quantitative 
and qualitative information that is 
reasonable and supportable, including 
historical experience and forward-looking 
information that is available without 
undue cost or effort, based on the 
Company’s historical experience and 
expert credit assessment.
	
	
	
Given that a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition is a relative 
measure, a given change in absolute 
terms in the PD will be more significant 
for a financial instrument with a lower 
initial PD than compared to a financial 
instrument with a higher PD.
	
	
	
As a back-stop when loan asset not 
being a loan becomes 30 days past 
due, the Company considers that a 
significant increase in credit risk has 
occurred and the asset is in stage 2 of the 
impairment model, i.e. the loss allowance 
is measured as the lifetime ECL in respect 
of all retail assets.
	
	
For the purpose of counting of days past due 
for the assessment of significant increase in 
credit risk, the special dispensations to any 
class of assets in accordance with COVID-19 
Regulatory Package notified by the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) has been applied 
by the company.
	
	
Modification and derecognition of financial 
assets
	
	
A modification of a financial asset occurs 
when the contractual terms governing 
the cash flows of a financial asset are 
renegotiated or otherwise modified between 
initial recognition and maturity of the financial 
asset. A modification affects the amount and/
or timing of the contractual cash flows either 
immediately or at a future date. In addition, the 
introduction of new covenants or adjustment 
of existing covenants of an existing loan 
may constitute a modification even if these 
new or adjusted covenants do not yet affect 
the cash flows immediately but may affect 
the cash flows depending on whether the 
covenant is or is not met (e.g. a change to the 
increase in the interest rate that arises when 
covenants are breached).
	
	
The Company renegotiates loans to 
customers in financial difficulty to maximise 
collection and minimise the risk of default. 
A loan forbearance is granted in cases where 
although the borrower made all reasonable 
efforts to pay under the original contractual 
terms, there is a high risk of default or default 
has already happened and the borrower 
is expected to be able to meet the revised 
terms. The revised terms in most of the cases 
include an extension of the maturity of the 
loan, changes to the timing of the cash flows 
of the loan (principal and interest repayment), 
reduction in the amount of cash flows due 
(principal and interest forgiveness) and 
amendments to covenants.
	
	
When a financial asset is modified the 
Company assesses whether this modification 
results in derecognition. In accordance 
with the Company’s policy a modification 
results in derecognition when it gives rise to 
substantially different terms. To determine if 
the modified terms are substantially different 
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Standalone 
131
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
from the original contractual terms the 
Company considers the following:
•	 Qualitative factors, such as contractual cash 
flows after modification are no longer SPPI,
•	 Change 
in 
currency 
or 
change 
of counterparty,
•	 The extent of change in interest rates, 
maturity, covenants.
	
	
If this does not clearly indicate a substantial 
modification, then:
	
	
(a)	 In the case where the financial asset is 
derecognised the loss allowance for ECL 
is remeasured at the date of derecognition 
to determine the net carrying amount 
of the asset at that date. The difference 
between this revised carrying amount 
and the fair value of the new financial 
asset with the new terms will lead to a 
gain or loss on derecognition. The new 
financial asset will have a loss allowance 
measured based on 12-month ECL except 
in the rare occasions where the new loan 
is considered to be originated-credit 
impaired. This applies only in the case 
where the fair value of the new loan is 
recognised at a significant discount to 
its revised par amount because there 
remains a high risk of default which has 
not been reduced by the modification. 
The Company monitors credit risk of 
modified financial assets by evaluating 
qualitative and quantitative information, 
such as if the borrower is in past due 
status under the new terms.
	
	
(b)	 When the contractual terms of a 
financial asset are modified and 
the modification does not result in 
derecognition, the Company determines 
if the financial asset’s credit risk has 
increased significantly since initial 
recognition by comparing:
•	 the remaining lifetime PD estimated 
based on data at initial recognition and 
the original contractual terms; with
•	 the remaining lifetime PD at the 
reporting 
date 
based 
on 
the 
modified terms.
	
	
	
For 
financial 
assets 
modified, 
where modification did not result in 
derecognition, the estimate of PD reflects 
the Company’s ability to collect the 
modified cash flows taking into account 
the Company’s previous experience of 
similar forbearance action, as well as 
various behavioural indicators, including 
the borrower’s payment performance 
against the modified contractual terms. 
If the credit risk remains significantly 
higher than what was expected at initial 
recognition the loss allowance will 
continue to be measured at an amount 
equal to lifetime ECL. The loss allowance 
on forborne loans will generally only 
be measured based on 12 month ECL 
when there is evidence of the borrower’s 
improved repayment behaviour following 
modification leading to a reversal of the 
previous significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
	
Where a modification does not lead to 
derecognition, the Company calculates 
the modification gain/loss comparing 
the gross carrying amount before and 
after the modification (excluding the ECL 
allowance). Then the Company measures 
ECL for the modified asset, where the 
expected cash flows arising from the 
modified financial asset are included in 
calculating the expected cash shortfalls 
from the original asset.
	
	
	
Presentation of ECL allowance in 
the Balance Sheet
	
	
	
Loss 
allowances 
for 
ECL 
are 
presented in the statement of financial 
position as follows:
•	 for financial assets measured at 
amortised cost: as a deduction from the 
gross carrying amount of the assets;
•	 for debt instruments measured 
at FVTOCI: no loss allowance is 
recognised in Balance Sheet as the 
carrying amount is at fair value.
	
	
(ii) 	 Financial Liabilities
	
	
	
(a)	 Loan commitments
	
	
	
	
Undrawn loan commitments are 
commitments under which, over 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
132
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
the duration of the commitment, 
the Group is required to provide 
a loan with pre-specified terms 
to the customer. Undrawn loan 
commitments are in the scope of the 
ECL requirements.
	
	
	
(b) 	Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
	
	
The Group’s liability under financial 
guarantee is measured at the higher 
of the amount initially recognised less 
cumulative amortisation recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss, 
and the ECL provision. For this 
purpose, the Group estimates ECLs 
by applying a credit conversion 
factor. The ECLs related to financial 
guarantee contracts are recognised 
within Provisions. Currently, the 
Group has not recognised any ECL in 
respect of financial guarantee based 
on estimate of expected cash flows.
	
	
(iii)	 Non-financial assets
	
	
	
(a)	 Intangible assets
	
	
	
	
The carrying amount of assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet 
date if there is any indication of 
impairment based on internal/
external factors. An impairment loss 
is recognised when the carrying 
amount of an individual asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value of the asset less cost of 
its disposal and value in use.
	
	
	
(b)	 Goodwill
	
	
	
	
Goodwill is recorded at the cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses 
in the previous years. Goodwill on 
acquisition is tested for impairment 
where the same allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units 
that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units.
	
	
	
	
A cash generating unit (CGU) to 
which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment on annual 
basis or whenever required in case 
where the Company is of the opinion 
that goodwill may be impaired. 
If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro rata based 
on the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. Any impairment 
loss for goodwill is recognised in 
profit or loss. Such impairment loss 
already recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in subsequent periods.
	
g) 	 Recognition of income
	
	
Revenue generated from the business 
transactions (other than for those items to 
which Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments are 
applicable) is measured at fair value of the 
consideration to be received or receivable 
by the Company. Ind AS 115 Revenue from 
contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers.
	
	
The Company recognises revenue from 
contracts with customers based on a five step 
model as set out in Ind AS 115:
	
	
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer;
	
	
Step 2: Identify performance obligations in 
the contract(s);
	
	
Step 3: Determine the transaction price;
	
	
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the 
performance obligations in the contract(s);
	
	
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the 
Company satisfies a performance obligation.
	
	
(a)	 Recognition of interest income
	
	
	
Interest income is recorded using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method 
for all financial instruments measured 
at amortised cost. The EIR is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial instrument or, when

Financial Statements

133

Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount of the financial asset.
	
	
	
The EIR for the amortised cost asset is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition, 
origination fees and transaction costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR.
	
	
	
If expectations regarding the cash 
flows on the financial asset are revised 
for reasons other than credit risk, the 
adjustment is booked as a positive or 
negative adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the asset in the balance sheet 
with an increase or reduction in interest 
income. The adjustment is subsequently 
amortised through Interest income in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
The Company calculates interest income 
by applying the EIR to the gross carrying 
amount of financial assets other than 
credit-impaired assets. When a financial 
asset becomes credit-impaired and is, 
therefore, regarded as ‘Stage 3’, the 
Company recognised the interest income 
by applying the effective interest rate to 
the net amortised cost of the financial 
asset. If the financial status of the financial 
asset improves and it no longer remains 
to be a credit-impaired, the Company 
revises the application of interest income 
on such financial asset to calculating 
interest income on a gross basis.
	
	
	
Interest income on all trading assets and 
financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at FVTPL is recognised 
as interest income in the statement of 
profit or loss.
	
	
(b) 	Dividend income
	
	
	
Dividend income is recognised when the 
Company’s right to receive the payment 
is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the 
dividend will flow to the Company and 
the amount of the dividend can be 
measured reliably.
	
	
(c) 	Syndication, advisory & other fees
	
	
	
Syndication, advisory & other fees 
are recognised as income when the 
performance obligation as per the 
contract with customer is fulfilled and 
when the right to receive the payment 
against the services has been established.
	
	
(d) 	Origination fees
	
	
	
Origination fees, which the Company has 
received/recovered at time of granting 
of a loan, is considered as a component 
for computation of the effective rate 
of interest (EIR) for the purpose of 
computing interest income.
	
	
(e)	 Management Fees:
	
	
	
Management fees and other fees 
are recognised as income when the 
performance obligation as per the 
contract with customer is fulfilled and 
when the right to receive the payment 
against the services has been established.
	
	
(f)	 Assignment income
	
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, in case of 
assignment transactions with complete 
transfer of risks and rewards, gain 
arising on such assignment transactions 
is recorded upfront in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss and the corresponding 
asset is derecognised from the Balance 
Sheet immediately upon execution of 
such transactions. Further the transfer of 
financial assets qualifies for derecognition 
in its entirety, the whole of the interest 
spread at its present value (discounted 
over the expected life of the asset) is 
recognised on the date of derecognition 
itself as excess interest spread and 
correspondingly recognised as profit on 
derecognition of financial asset.
	
	
(g)	 Securitisation transactions:
	
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, in case of 
securitisation transactions, the Company

rewards of ownership of a transferred 
financial asset, the company continues 
to recognise the financial asset and also

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
recognises a collateralised borrowing for 
the proceeds received.
	
	
(h) 	Net gain/(loss) on Fair value changes
	
	
	
Any differences between the fair values 
of financial assets classified as fair value 
through the profit or loss, held by the 
Company on the balance sheet date is 
recognised as an unrealised gain or loss 
as a gain or expense respectively.
	
	
	
Similarly, any realised gain or loss on 
sale of financial instruments measured at 
FVTPL and debt instruments measured 
at FVOCI is recognised in net gain / loss 
on fair value changes.
	
	
(i)	 Sourcing and servicing fee
	
	
	
The revenue from the contract as a service 
provider (sourcing and collection agent) 
on behalf of customer, is recognised 
upfront for services rendered as sourcing 
agent and on straight line basis over the 
loan tenure for services in the nature 
of collection and performance agent. 
The financial guarantee provided under 
the service contract is recognised at fair 
value on sourcing and is amortised over 
the period of contract with subsequent 
measurement 
at 
higher 
of 
the 
unamortised value as per Ind AS 115 or 
expected credit losses as per Ind AS 109.
	
h) 	 Finance Costs
	
	
The Company recognises interest expense 
on the borrowings as per EIR methodology 
which is calculated by considering any 
ancillary costs incurred and any premium 
payable on its maturity.
	
i) 	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
	
(i)	 Defined Contribution Plan
	
	
	
Provident Fund
	
	
	
All the employees of the Company are 
entitled to receive benefits under the 
Provident Fund, a defined contribution 
plan in which both the employee and 
the Company contribute monthly at a 
stipulated rate. The Company has no 
liability for future Provident Fund benefits 
other than its annual contribution and 
recognises such contributions as an 
expense, when an employee renders the 
related service.
	
	
(ii) 	 Defined Benefit schemes
	
	
	
(a)	 Gratuity
	
	
	
	
The Company provides for the 
gratuity, a defined benefit retirement 
plan covering all employees. The plan 
provides for lump sum payments 
to employees upon death while in 
employment or on separation from 
employment after serving for the 
stipulated year mentioned under 
‘The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972’. 
The Company accounts for liability 
of future gratuity benefits based on 
an external actuarial valuation on 
projected unit credit method carried 
out for assessing liability as at the 
reporting date.
	
	
	
	
Net interest recognised in proﬁt 
or loss is calculated by applying 
the discount rate used to measure 
the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability 
or asset. The actual return on the 
plan assets above or below the 
discount rate is recognised as 
part of re-measurement of net 
deﬁned liability or asset through 
other comprehensive income. 
Remeasurements, comprising of 
actuarial gains and losses, the 
effect of the asset ceiling, excluding 
amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability and 
the return on plan assets (excluding 
amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability), 
are recognised immediately in the 
balance sheet with a corresponding 
debit or credit to retained earnings 
through Other comprehensive 
income (‘OCI’) in the period in which 
they occur. Remeasurements are 
not reclassified to profit or loss in 
subsequent periods.

are expected to occur within 
twelve months after the end of

the period in which the employee 
renders the related services are 
provided for based on estimates. 
Compensated absences which are 
not expected to occur within twelve 
months after the end of the period 
in which the employee renders 
the related services are provided 
for based on actuarial valuation. 
The actuarial valuation is done as per 
projected unit credit method as at 
the reporting date. Actuarial gains/
losses are immediately taken to 
Statement of profit and loss account 
and are not deferred.
	
j) 	
Share based employee payments
	
	
Equity settled share based payments
	
	
The stock options granted to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the options at 
the grant date. The fair value of the options 
is treated as discount and accounted as 
employee compensation cost over the vesting 
period on a straight line basis. The amount 
recognised as expense in each year is arrived 
at based on the number of grants expected 
to vest. If a grant lapses after the vesting 
period, the cumulative discount recognised as 
expense in respect of such grant is transferred 
to the general reserve within equity.
	
k) 	 Ind AS 116 Leases
	
	
The determination of whether an arrangement 
is a lease, or contains a lease, is based on the 
substance of the arrangement and requires 
an assessment of whether the fulfilment of 
the arrangement is dependent on the use 
of a specific asset or assets or whether the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
	
	
Company as a lessee
	
	
Leases that do not transfer to the Company 
substantially all of the risks and benefits 
incidental to ownership of the leased items are 
treated as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the 
statement of profit and loss on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, unless the increase 
is in line with expected general inflation, in 
which case lease payments are recognised 
based on contractual terms. Contingent rental 
payable is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they it is incurred.
	
	
Critical accounting estimate and judgement
	
	
1. 	
Determination of lease term
	
	
	
Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee 
to determine the lease term as the 
non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted 
with any option to extend or terminate 
the lease, if the use of such option is 
reasonably certain. The Company makes 
assessment on the expected lease term on 
lease by lease basis and thereby assesses 
whether it is reasonably certain that 
any options to extend or terminate the 
contract will be exercised. In evaluating 
the lease term, the Company considers 
factors such as any significant leasehold 
improvements undertaken over the lease 
term, costs relating to the termination 
of lease and the importance of the 
underlying to the Company’s operations 
taking into account the location of the 
underlying asset and the availability of 
the suitable alternatives. The lease term 
in future periods is reassessed to ensure 
that the lease term reflects the current 
economic circumstances.
	
	
2. 	 Discount Rate
	
	
	
The discount rate is generally based 
on the incremental borrowing rate 
specific to the lease being evaluated 
or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
	
l) 	
Foreign currency translation
	
	
Functional and presentational currency
	
	
The financial statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees which is also functional 
currency of the Company and the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which 
the Company operates.
	
m) 	 Provisions
	
	
A provision is recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation as a result of past 
event; it is probable that outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation, in 
respect of which a reliable estimate can be 
made. Provisions are not discounted to its 
present value and are determined based on 
best estimate required to settle the obligation 
at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates.

n) 	 Taxes
	
	
(i)	 Current tax
	
	
	
Current tax assets and liabilities for the 
current and prior years are measured at 
the amount expected to be recovered 
from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. 
The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are 
enacted, or substantively enacted, by 
the reporting date in the countries where 
the Company operates and generates 
taxable income.
	
	
	
Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside profit or loss is 
recognised outside profit or loss (either 
in other comprehensive income or in 
equity). Current tax items are recognised 
in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly 
in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax 
returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions 
where appropriate.
	
	
(ii) 	 Deferred tax
	
	
	
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary differences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised, except:
	
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part 
of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
re-assessed at each reporting date and 
are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable 
profits will allow the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised 
outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). 
Deferred tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the 
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
	
o) 	 Earnings Per Share
	
	
The Company reports basic and diluted 
earnings per share in accordance with Ind 
AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic EPS is 
calculated by dividing the net proﬁt or loss for 
the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted 
earnings per share, the net proﬁt or loss for 
the year attributable to equity shareholders 
and the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year are adjusted 
for the effects of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are 
deemed converted as of the beginning of 
the period, unless they have been issued at a 
later date. In computing the dilutive earnings 
per share, only potential equity shares that 
are dilutive and that either reduces the 
earnings per share or increases loss per 
share are included.

p) 	 Contingent Liabilities
	
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation 
that arises from past events whose existence 
will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events beyond the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not 
recognised because it is not probable that an 
outﬂow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises 
in extremely rare cases where there is a liability 
that cannot be recognised because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The Company does not 
recognize a contingent liability but discloses 
its existence in the ﬁnancial statements.
	
q) 	 Segment reporting
	
	
Operating segments are those components 
of the business whose operating results are 
regularly reviewed by the chief operating 
decision making body in the Company to 
make decisions for performance assessment 
and resource allocation.
	
	
The reporting of segment information is the 
same as provided to the management for the 
purpose of the performance assessment and 
resource allocation to the segments.
	
	
Segment accounting policies are in 
line with the accounting policies of the 
Company. In addition, the following specific 
accounting policies have been followed for 
segment reporting:
	
	
i) 	
Segment revenue includes operational 
revenue directly identifiable with/
allocable to the segment.
	
	
ii) 	 Expenses that are directly identifiable 
with/allocable 
to 
segments 
are 
considered 
for 
determining 
the 
segment result.
	
	
iii) 	 Income which relates to the Company as 
a whole and not allocable to segments 
is included in “unallocable corporate 
income / (expenditure) (net)”.
	
	
iv) 	 Segment result includes the finance costs 
incurred on interest bearing advances 
with corresponding credit included 
in “unallocable corporate income/
(expenditure)(net)”.
	
	
v) 	 Segment assets and liabilities include those 
directly identifiable with the respective 
segments. 
Unallocable 
corporate 
assets and liabilities represent the 
assets and liabilities that relate to the 
Company as a whole.
2.4 Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
	
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires that the 
management of the Company makes estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of income and expenses of the period, the 
reported balances of assets and liabilities and the 
disclosures relating to contingent liabilities as of 
the date of the financial statements. The estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates include useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment & intangible assets, allowance for 
expected credit losses, fair value measurement, 
business projections for impairment assessment of 
goodwill etc. Difference, if any, between the actual 
results and estimates is recognised in the period 
in which the results are known.
2.5	 Securities premium account
	
a)	
Securities premium includes:
•	 The difference between the face value of 
the equity shares and the consideration 
received in respect of shares issued;
•	 The fair value of the stock options which 
are treated as expense, if any, in respect 
of shares allotted pursuant to Stock 
Options Scheme.
	
b)	 The issue expenses of securities which qualify 
as equity instruments are written off against 
securities premium account/ retained earning 
in accordance with Ind AS.
2.6	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies 
new standards or amendments to the existing 
standards under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.
	
On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2023, as below:

The Company has assessed that there is no impairment of Goodwill as at and for the year ended March 2023. 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation. The calculation uses cash flow 
projections of commercial vehicle business based on financial budgets covering a five-year period and a discount 
rate of 19%. The Company has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes 
in the assumptions of yield/spread during the budget period and the discounting rate. The management believes 
that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, on which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders (after adjusting profit 
impact of dilutive potential equity shares, if any) by the aggregate of weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year and the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion 
of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

Financial instruments – Fair values and Risk management
A. 	 Accounting classification and fair values
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market 
conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.
	
The management has assessed that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, loans carried at 
amortised cost, other financial assets, trade payables, borrowings, bank/book overdrafts and other current 
liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
B. 	 Risk Management Framework:
	
The Company’s risk management framework is based on
	
(a) 	 Clear understanding and identification of various risks
	
(b) 	Disciplined risk assessment by evaluating the probability and impact of each risk
	
(c) 	 Measurement and monitoring of risks by establishing key risk indicators with thresholds for all 
critical risks and
	
(d) 	Adequate review mechanism to monitor and control risks.
	
The Company’s risk management division works as a value centre by constantly engaging with the business 
providing reports based on key analysis and insights. The key risks faced by the Company are credit risk, 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, reputational and regulatory risk, which are broadly classified as 
credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The Company has a an established risk reporting and monitoring 
framework. The Company identifies and monitors risks periodically. This Process enables the company to 
reassess all the critical risks in a changing environment that need to be focused on.

C. 	 Risk governance structure:
	
The Company’s risk governance structure operates with a well-defined Board and Risk Management 
Committee (‘RMC’) with a clearly laid down charter and roles and responsibilities. The Board oversees 
the risk management process and monitors the risk profile of the Company directly as well as through 
a Board constituted Risk Management Committee. The Committee reviews the risk management policy, 
implementation of risk management framework, monitoring of critical risks, review and approval of exposures 
with conflict of interest and review of various other initiatives. The risk management policies are established 
to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate limits and controls and to monitor 
risks and adherence to limits. The RMC reviews the risk management policies regularly to reflect the changes 
in market conditions and Company’s activities.
	
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with risk management policies 
and procedures and reviews the adequacy of risk management framework in relation to the risk faced 
by the Company.
	
The risk management committee has established a comprehensive risk management framework across the 
business and provides appropriate reports on risk exposures and analysis in its pursuit of creating awareness 
across the Company about risk management. 
D. 	 Fair value hierarchy
	
Ind AS 107, ‘Financial Instrument - Disclosure’ requires classification of the valuation method of financial 
instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, using a three level fair-value-hierarchy (which reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to un-adjusted 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority 
to un-observable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair-value-hierarchy under Ind AS 
107 are described below:
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and place limited reliance on entity 
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument 
is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level.

E. 	 Credit risk
	
Credit risk arises when a borrower is unable to meet his contractual obligations to the lender. The effective 
management of credit risk requires the establishment of appropriate credit risk policies and processes. 
The Company has comprehensive and well defined credit policies across various businesses, products and 
segments, which encompass credit approval process for all businesses along with guidelines for mitigating 
the risks associated with them. The appraisal process includes detailed risk assessment of the borrowers, 
physical verifications and field visits. The company has a well-defined post sanction monitoring process to 
identify portfolio-wise credit risk trends and early warning signals. This enables it to implement necessary 
changes to the credit policy, whenever the need arises to prevent any further slippage in the credit quality.
 
Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis
	
The company splits its exposure into smaller homogeneous portfolios, based on shared credit risk 
characteristics, as described below in the following order:
•	 Customer i.e. corporate and retail
•	 Nature of product i.e. commercial vehicle and SME
	
Significant increase in credit risk
	
The credit risk on a financial asset of the Company are assumed to have increased significantly since 
initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. The retail loans where the 
renegotiated terms are not substantially different and involve repayment terms to be extended including 
interest or the EMI amount readjusted over the tenure are classified as Stage 2. In case of corporate loan the 
assessment of significant increase in credit risk is performed on a case to case basis. Additionally, accounts 
identified and reviewed by the credit committee for labelling as breaching pre-defined critical credit risk 
parameters will also be classified as Stage 2. Accordingly, the financial assets shall be classified as Stage 2, 
based on the quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
	
Write off
	
The Company writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in 
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets written off may still 
be subject to enforcement activities under the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal 
advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in Statement of profit and loss.
	
Restructured financial assets
	
A loan where repayment terms are renegotiated on substantially different terms as compared to the original 
contracted terms due to significant increase in credit risk of the borrower are classified as stage 2. Such loans 
continue to be in stage 2 until they exhibit regular payment of renegotiated principal and interest over a 
minimum observation period typically 12 months-post renegotiation, and there are no other indicators of 
impairment. Having satisfied the conditions of timely payment over the observation period these loans could 
be transferred to stage 1 or 2 and a fresh assessment of the risk of default is done.
	
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss principles
	
The Company records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans, debt financial assets not held at 
FVTPL, undrawn loan commitments (referred to as ‘financial instruments’).
	
For the computation of ECL on the financial instruments, the Company categories its financial instruments 
as mentioned below:
	
Stage 1: All exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or 
that has low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are classified 
under this stage. The Company classifies all advances upto 30 days overdue under this category. Stage 1 loans 
also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
Stage 2: Exposures are classified as Stage 2 when the amount is due for more than 30 days but do not exceed 
90 days. All exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but 
are not credit impaired are classified under this stage.
	
Stage 3: All exposures are assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. Exposures where the amount remains 
due for 91 days or more are considered as to be stage 3 assets.
	
The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of 
whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering 
the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Company 
undertakes the classification of exposures within the aforesaid stages at borrower level.
	
Definition of default
	
A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make the contractual payments within 90 days 
of when they fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, 
it has been more than 90 days past due. Non-payment on another obligation of the same customer is also 
considered as a Stage 3.
	
The calculation of ECL
	
ECL is a probability weighted credit losses (i.e. present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of 
the financial instruments. Cash shortfalls are the difference between the cash flows that the entity is entitled 
to receive on account of contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows:
	
Portfolio Segmentation:
	
For ECL purpose, the loan portfolio is broadly segmented as below:
	
1)	
Corporate lending
	
2) 	 Small and medium enterprises lending (‘SME’)
	
3) 	 Commercial vehicle lending
	
Exposure-At-Default (EAD): The Exposure at Default is the amount the Company is entitled to receive as 
on reporting date including repayments due for principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or 
otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities.
	
Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default of the 
exposure over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, 
if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.
	
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default 
occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that 
the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.
	
The ECL allowance is applied on the financial instruments depending upon the classification of the financial 
instruments as per the credit risk involved. ECL allowance is computed on the below mentioned basis:
	
12-month ECL: 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represents the ECL that results from default 
events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 12-month ECL 
is applied on stage 1 assets.

Lifetime ECL: Lifetime ECL for credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset in cases of credit 
impaired loans and in case of financial instruments where there has been significant increase in credit risk 
since origination. Lifetime ECL is the expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument. Lifetime ECL is applied on stage 2 and stage 3 assets. The Company 
computes the ECL allowance either on individual basis or on collective basis, depending on the nature of 
the underlying portfolio of financial instruments. The Company has grouped its loan portfolio into Corporate 
loans, SME loans and Commercial vehicle loans.
	
Forward looking information
	
The company employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the 
remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. 
Such statistical models are selected considering the availability of information related to the probability of 
default for each product. This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between 
changes in GNPA as proxy for default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors. Key economic 
indicators considered for forward looking includes:
•	 Gross national saving
•	 WPI (Wholesale price index)
	
For the purpose of determination of impact of forward looking information, the company applies macro 
economic (ME) variables as stated above to each product and assess the trend of the historical probability 
of defaults as compared to the forecasted probability of default. Based on the directional trend of output, 
management applies an overlay if required. Overtime, new ME variable may emerge to have a better 
correlation and may replace ME being used now.
	
An analysis of changes in the gross carrying amount and the corresponding ECL allowances in relation to 
loans and advances is as follows:

F. 	 Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity is the Company’s capacity to fund increase in assets and meet both the expected and unexpected 
obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet such obligations 
as they become due without adversely affecting the company’s financial conditions. The Asset Liability 
Management Policy of the Company stipulates a broad framework for Liquidity risk management to ensure 
that the Company can meet its liquidity obligations. The Asset Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’) 
monitors composition, characteristics and diversification of funding sources to ensure there is no over reliance 
on single source of funding. The Company tracks the cash flow mismatches for measuring and managing 
net funding requirement and reviews short-term liquidity profiles based on business projections and other 
commitments for planning purposes through Liquidity analysis. The ALCO also reviews the individual 
mismatch in each time bucket and cumulative mismatch and ensures the bucket wise limits are not breached.
	
The Company maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that are assumed to be easily 
liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The liquidity position of the company is 
assessed under a variety of scenarios giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in 
general and risk specifics to the Company. Basis the liquidity position assessed under various stress scenarios; 
the Company reviews the following to effectively handle any liquidity crisis:
•	 Adequacy of contingency funding plan in terms of depth of various funding sources, time to activate, 
cost of borrowing, etc
•	 Availability of unencumbered eligible assets

changes in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates and other asset prices. The Company’s 
exposure to market risk is a function of asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity assessment. 
The company is exposed to interest rate risk and liquidity risk, if the same is not managed properly. 
The company continuously monitors these risks and manages them through appropriate risk limits. The Asset 
Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’) reviews market related trends and risks and adopts various 
strategies related to assets and liabilities, in line with the Company’s risk management framework.
H. 	 Operational risk
	
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, 
or from external events. The operational risks of the Company are managed through comprehensive internal 
control systems and procedures. Failure of managing operational risk might lead to legal / regulatory 
implications due to non-compliance and lead to financial loss due to control failures. While it is not practical 
to eliminate all the operational risk, the Company has put in place adequate control framework by way of 
segregation of duties, well defined process, staff training, maker and checker process, authorisation and clear 
reporting structure. The effectiveness of control framework is assessed by internal audit on a periodic basis. 
To manage fraud risk effectively, the Company has Independent Risk Containment Unit (‘RCU’) which is 
responsible for implementing fraud risk management framework and ensure compliance. The RCU undertakes 
various activities such as pre-sanction loan applicant verification, pre-sanction and post disbursement 
documents verification, vendor verification, etc to prevent and manage frauds.
I.

Note 41 - Other notes
Note 41.1
As indicated in the prior reporting periods, the Company engaged a leading professional services firm to assist 
it in undertaking a review of its loan portfolio. The final findings of this review were submitted to the Audit 
Committee on August 5, 2022. The Company made incremental ECL provisions based, among others, on the 
findings of this review in its financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022. (also refer note 
41.2 to the financial statements).
The Company subsequently engaged a leading law firm, to carry out a review for undertaking root cause analysis 
of deviations to policies and gaps in the internal financial controls and systems (including of control gap/control 
override and individuals involved) focusing on the Company’s commercial vehicles and SME businesses (“Conduct 
Review”). The final findings of this review were submitted to the Audit Committee.
The Company, under the guidance and supervision of the Audit Committee, has completed its review of the 
findings thereon, and has taken necessary remedial and accountability measures. Among others, the Company 
has initiated measures to strengthen controls and improve the process and control environment of the Company 
including by way of senior managerial level changes and appointments, improving entity level controls, policy 
related changes, process improvements and technological enhancements. The Company has also concluded that 
with respect to the findings in the Conduct Review Report, there is no further reporting requirement under the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Note 41.2
In the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022, the Company had made incremental provision for 
expected credit loss (ECL) allowances on account of certain deficiencies in the Company’s internal controls that 
were identified during this period. Considering that these control deficiencies have since been remediated during 
the current year and the findings of the Conduct Review have been adequately evaluated (refer note 41.1), no 
incremental provisioning is considered necessary during the year ended 31 March 2023.
Although the possibility that the control deficiencies that were identified could potentially have had an impact 
on the financial statements for periods ending prior to 1 April, 2021, the Company had concluded that it was 
impracticable to determine the prior period – specific effects, if any, in respect of the charge to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss on account of the following:
(i) 	 impairment allowance on loan assets and investment in security receipts;
(ii) 	 loan assets written off; and

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
(iii) 	changes in fair value of financial guarantee contracts
when it finalised its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 because significant judgements had 
been applied in determining the staging of the loan assets and the related impairment allowance for events and 
conditions which existed as on 31 March 2022. The Company believes it is not practicable to apply the same 
judgement without hindsight for the prior period(s).
Consequent to the above, in respect of such account balances, related income and the related disclosures, 
the figures for the year ended 31 March 2023 may not be strictly comparable with the figures for the year 
ended 31 March 2022.
Note 41.3 - Going Concern
As at 31 March 2023, the Company has equity which is significantly in excess of the minimum Capital Risk 
Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) that has been stipulated by the Reserve Bank of Indian (RBI) (including the proportion 
of Tier I Capital). Its liquid assets as of that date are also significantly in excess of the minimum stipulated by 
the RBI. Based on the Company’s forecast of cashflows over the twelve months following 31 March 2023, the 
available liquid assets and the expected cash inflows would be sufficient to meet its liabilities even under a 
stressed scenario. Additionally, during the year ended 31 March 2023 and till the adoption of these financial 
statements, the Company has been successful in raising additional debt of ` 4,58,698.46 lakhs from banks and 
financial institutions and through securitisation (including ` 25,500.00 lakh subsequent to the balance sheet 
date). In view of the above, the Management has concluded that no material uncertainties related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exist as on 
the date of the balance sheet.
Note 41.4
In relation to the loans portfolio, the Management has on a best effort basis and knowledge, has not identified 
transactions with Nil financiers (previous year approximately 32) aggregating ` Nil (previous year ` 21,461.69 
lakhs) used for refinancing loans of the customers.
The Company respectfully submits that it is unable to provide the disclosure relating to these transactions in 
the format as required under Division III of the Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013 as the transactions are 
individually small and voluminous.
Note 41.5
The disclosure on the following matters required under Schedule III as amended not being relevant or applicable 
in case of the Company, same are not covered:
a) 	 The Company has not traded or invested in crypto currency or virtual currency during the financial year.
b) 	 No proceedings have been initiated or are pending against the Company for holding any benami property 
under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988) and rules made thereunder.
c) 	 The Company has not been declared wilful defaulter by any bank or financial institution or government or 
any government authority.
d) 	 The Company has not entered into any scheme of arrangement.
e) 	 Charges or satisfaction to be registered with Registrar of Companies (ROC) have been registered within the 
stipulated statutory timelines.
f) 	 There are no transactions which are not recorded in the books of account which have been surrendered or 
disclosed as income during the year in the tax assessments under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

of the Group as at March 31, 2023, and its consolidated 
profit, its consolidated total comprehensive income, 
its consolidated cash flows and their consolidated 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
As explained in Note 42.2 to the consolidated financial 
statement, the Parent had recorded a charge to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss on account of impairment 
allowance, loan assets written off and changes in fair 
value of financial-guarantee contracts recorded during 
the quarter and year ended March 31, 2022. The Group 
had concluded that it was impracticable to determine 
the prior period-specific effects, if any, of this charge 
because significant judgements had been applied in 
determining the staging of the loan assets recorded 
at amortised cost at amortised cost and the related 
impairment allowance for events and conditions which 
existed as on 31 March 2022. The Group believes it is 
not practicable to apply the same judgements without 
hindsight for the prior period(s).
As a result, we were unable to determine whether any 
adjustments were required for prior period(s) relating 
to the impairment charge recorded for the quarter 
and year ended March 31, 2022 and consequently, 
adjustments to the income from interest, fees 
and commission on the corresponding assets and 
related disclosures.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2022 was modified 
accordingly. Our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 (“current 
year”) is also modified because of the possible effect 
of this matter on the comparability of the current 
period’s figures and the corresponding figures of 
the previous year.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143 (10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that 
are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the 
Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe 
that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matters section 
below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our qualified audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. In addition to the matter described in 
the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, 
we have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses 
(ECL) on Loan Assets:
(Refer Notes 5 and 2.3(f)(i) to the 
consolidated financial statements)
As at 31 March, 2023, loan assets 
aggregated ` 651,567 lakhs (net of ECL 
` 55,415 lakhs), which are measured at 
amortised cost, constituting 71% of the 
Group’s total assets.
As part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that significant judgement 
is used in classifying these loan 
assets 
and 
applying 
appropriate 
measurement 
principles. 
The 
allowance for ECL on loan assets has a 
high degree of estimation uncertainty, 
with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes for the financial statements. 
The elements of estimating ECL which 
involved increased level of audit focus 
are the following:
•	 Staging the loan assets i.e. 
classification in ‘significant increase 
in credit risk’ (‘SICR’) and ‘default’ 
categories
•	 Basis 
used 
for 
estimating 
Probabilities of Default (“PD”);
•	 Basis used for estimating Loss Given 
Default (“LGD”);
•	 Adjustments to model driven ECL 
results, to address emerging trends.
•	 Impact, if any, arising out of the 
findings of the Conduct Review in 
respect of Commercial Vehicle (“CV”) 
loan assets portfolio and Small and 
Medium Enterprises (“SME”) loan 
portfolio. (Refer note 42.1)
Principal audit procedures performed:
We have read and assessed the accounting policies and the 
governance framework approved by the Board of Directors of 
the respective Companies.
We have verified the methodology adopted for computation of 
ECL (“ECL Model”) on loan assets that complies with policies 
approved by the respective Board of Directors, procedures and 
controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on the loan assets 
measured at amortised cost.
Our audit procedures related to the allowance for ECL on loan 
assets included the following, among others:
•	 Testing the design and effectiveness of controls over the:
•	 completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default 
(“EAD”) and the classification thereof into stages consistent 
with the definitions applied in accordance with the policy 
approved by the Board of Directors of the respective 
companies including the appropriateness of the qualitative 
factors (including findings arising from Conduct Review) to 
be applied.
•	 appropriateness of information used in the estimation of the 
PD and LGD for the different stages depending on the nature 
of the portfolio; and
•	 computation of the ECL including methodology used to 
determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments to the 
output of the ECL Model.
•	 Additional controls instituted and modifications to the existing 
controls that were carried out to address the findings of the 
Conduct Review.
•	 Also, for the samples tested included the following, among 
others:
•	 the appropriateness of the qualitative factors applied by the 
Management for staging of loans as SICR or default categories 
in view of Company’s policy on restructuring and arising from 
the findings of the Conduct Review;
•	 We tested the input data used in estimating the PD;
•	 We evaluated reasonableness of LGD estimates.
•	 mathematical accuracy of the computation of the ECL including 
methodology used to determine macro-economic overlays and 
adjustments to the output of the ECL Model.

•	 The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the management 
discussion and analysis and Board’s report and its 
annexures, but does not include the consolidated 
financial statements, standalone financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The management 
discussion and analysis and Board’s report and its 
annexures are expected to be made available to us 
after the date of this auditor’s report.
•	 Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
•	 In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information, compare with the financial 
statements of the subsidiary audited by the other 
auditor, to the extent it relates to these entities and, 
in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other 
auditors and consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated

194
Annual Report 2022-23
financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated. Other information so far 
as it relates to the subsidiaries, is traced from their 
financial statements audited by the other auditors.
•	 When we read the management discussion and 
analysis and Board’s report and its annexures, if 
we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
therein, we are required to communicate the matter 
to those charged with governance as required under 
SA 720 ‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to 
Other Information’.
Responsibilities of Management and Those 
Charged with Governance for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, 
consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in 
equity of the Group in accordance with the Ind AS and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for maintenance 
of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the financial statements that 
give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which 
have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Directors of 
the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
the respective Boards of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of the respective entities to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of 
Directors either intend to liquidate their respective 
entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The respective Boards of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on 
whether the Parent has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events

Financial Statements
Consolidated 
195
Annual Report 2022-23
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities 
within the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial statements of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entity included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by the other 
auditor, such other auditor remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit carried out by them. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
consolidated financial statements that, individually 
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
consolidated financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Parent and such other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are 
the independent auditors regarding, among other 
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
We did not audit the financial statements of one 
subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total 
assets of ` 145,427 lakh as at March 31, 2023, total 
revenues of `  20,830 lakh and net cash inflows 
amounting to ` 618 lakh for the year ended on that 
date, as considered in the consolidated financial 
statements. These financial statements have been 
audited by other auditor whose reports have been 
furnished to us by the Management and our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as 
it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of this subsidiary, and our report in terms of 
subsection (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it 
relates to the aforesaid subsidiary, is based solely on 
the reports of the other auditor.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
above and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of the

Annexure “A”  
to the Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated Ind 
AS financial statements of the Company as of and 
for the year ended March 31, 2023, we have audited 
the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements of IndoStar Finance 
Capital Limited (hereinafter referred to as “Parent”) 
and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent 
and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements 
based on the internal control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements criteria established 
by the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards 
on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in 
all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor 
of the subsidiary company, which is company 
incorporated in India, in terms of their report referred 
to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Parent and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our 
report of even date)

preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Basis for Qualified opinion
With respect to the Parent, according to the information 
and explanations given to us and based on our audit, 
the following material weakness has been identified 
in the operating effectiveness of the Parent’s internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements as at March 31, 2023:
The Group had concluded that it was impracticable 
to determine the prior period-specific effects, if any, 
of the charge to the Statement of Profit and Loss on 
account of impairment allowance, loan assets written 
off and changes in fair value of financial-guarantee 
contracts recorded during the year ended March 31, 
2022 in respect of account balances identified and 
explained by the Company in Note 42.2 of the 
consolidated financial statements. As a result, we were 
unable to determine whether any adjustments were 
required for prior period(s) relating to the impairment 
charge recorded for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 
consequently, adjustments to income from interest, 
fees and commission on the corresponding assets and 
related disclosures.
Because of the deficiency in financial closing and 
reporting process, in respect of comparative information 
as aforesaid, we were unable to assess whether or not 
the current year’s figures are comparable to those of 
the previous year.
A ‘material weakness’ is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the company’s annual or interim 
financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
on a timely basis.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based 
on the consideration of the reports of the other 
auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, the Parent and its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India have, in 
all material respects, maintained adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements as of March 31, 2023, based on 
the criteria for internal financial control with reference 
to consolidated financial statements established by 
the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India, and except for the possible 
effects of the material weakness described in Basis for 
Qualified Opinion paragraph above on the achievement 
of the objectives of the control criteria, the Parent’s 
and its subsidiary companies, internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as of March 31, 2023.
We have considered the material weakness identified 
and reported above in determining the nature, timing, 
and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended March 31, 2023, and the 
material weakness does not affect our opinion on the 
said consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act 
on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements insofar as it relates to one 
subsidiary company, which is company incorporated 
in India, is based solely on the corresponding report 
of the auditor of such company incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of 
the above matter.

Basis of Preparation, Basis for Consolidation 
and Significant accounting policies
2.1.a Basis of Preparation
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015, as amended from time to time and presented 
in the format prescribed in the Division III to 
Schedule III to the Act applicable for Non Banking 
Financial Companies (“NBFC”). The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
application of fair value measurements required 
or allowed by relevant accounting standards. 
Accounting policies have been consistently applied 
to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
	
The financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis, as the management is satisfied 
that the Group shall be able to continue its 
business for the foreseeable future. In making this 
assessment, the management has considered a 
wide range of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including future projections of 
profitability, cash flows and capital resources.
2.1.b Basis for Consolidation
	
The consolidated financial statements comprise 
the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023. The Company 
consolidates a subsidiary when it controls it. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee.
	
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority 
of voting rights result in control. To support this 
presumption and when the Group has less than 
a majority of the voting or similar rights of an 
investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power 
over an investee, including:
•	 The contractual arrangement with the other 
vote holders of the investee
•	 Rights arising from other contractual  
arrangements
•	 The Group’s voting rights and potential  
voting rights
•	 The size of the Group’s holding of voting 
rights relative to the size and dispersion of the 
holdings of the other voting rights holders
	
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls 
an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses 
control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control 
the subsidiary.
	
Consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. The financial statements of all 
entities used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn up to same reporting date as that of the 
Company, i.e., year ended on 31 March 2023.
	
Consolidation procedure:
	
(a)	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows 
of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. 
For this purpose, income and expenses of 
the subsidiary are based on the amounts of 
the assets and liabilities recognised in the 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
206
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
consolidated financial statements at the 
acquisition date.
	
(b) 	Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to 
account for any related goodwill.
	
(c)	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash 
flows relating to transactions between entities 
of the Group (profits or losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions that are recognised 
in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, 
are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses 
may indicate an impairment that requires 
recognition in the consolidated financial 
statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies 
to temporary differences that arise from the 
elimination of profits and losses resulting 
from intragroup transactions.
	
Profit or loss and each component of OCI are 
attributed to the equity holders of the parent of 
the Group and to the non-controlling interests, 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. A change in the ownership 
interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is 
accounted for as an equity transaction.
2.2 Presentation of financial statements
	
The Balance Sheet and the Statement of Profit 
and Loss are prepared and presented in the 
format prescribed in the Division III to Schedule 
III to the Act applicable for Non Banking Financial 
Companies (“NBFC”). The Statement of Cash 
Flows has been prepared and presented as per 
the requirements of Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash 
Flows”. The disclosure requirements with respect 
to items in the Balance Sheet and Statement of 
Profit and Loss, as prescribed in the Division III 
to Schedule III to the Act, are presented by way 
of notes forming part of the financial statements 
along with the other notes required to be 
disclosed under the notified accounting Standards 
and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015.
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally 
reported gross in the balance sheet. They are only 
offset and reported net when, in addition to having 
an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts without being contingent 
on a future event, the parties also intend to settle 
on a net basis in all of the following circumstances:
•	 the normal course of business;
•	 the event of default;
•	 the event of insolvency of bankruptcy of the 
Group or its counterparties.
2.3 Significant Accounting Policies
a) 	 Financial Instruments
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities can be 
termed as financial instruments.
	
Financial instruments are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
terms of the instruments.
	
(i) 	 Classification of Financial Instruments
	
	
The Group classifies its financial assets into 
the following measurement categories:
	
	
1. 	 Financial assets to be measured 
at amortised cost
	
	
2. 	 Financial assets to be measured 
at 
fair 
value 
through 
other 
comprehensive income
	
	
3. 	 Financial assets to be measured at fair 
value through profit or loss account
	
The classification depends on the contractual terms 
of the financial assets’ cash flows and the Group’s 
business model for managing financial assets.
	
The Group classifies its financial liabilities at 
amortised cost unless it has designated liabilities at 
fair value through the profit and loss account or is 
required to measure liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL) such as derivative liabilities. 
Financial liabilities, other than loan commitments 
and financial guarantees, are measured at FVTPL 
when they are derivative instruments or the fair 
value designation is applied.
	
(ii) 	 Assessment of business model and cash 
flows for financial assets
	
	
Business model assessment
	
	
The Group determines its business model at 
the level that best reflects how it manages 
groups of financial assets to achieve its 
business objective. The Group’s business 
model determines whether the cash flows will 
be generated by collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling financial assets or by both.

for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
	
The Group’s business model is assessed at 
portfolio level and not at instrument level, and 
is based on observable factors such as:
	
	
(i)	 How the performance of the business 
model and the financial assets held 
within that business model are evaluated 
and reported to the entity’s key 
management personnel;
	
	
(ii)	 The risks that affect the performance of 
the business model and, in particular, the 
way those risks are managed; and
	
	
(iii) 	The expected frequency, value and 
timing of sales are also important 
aspects of the Group’s assessment. 
The business model assessment is 
based on reasonably expected scenarios 
without taking ‘worst case’ or ‘stress 
case’ scenarios into account.
	
	
Solely payment of principal and interest 
(SPPI) test
	
	
Subsequent to the assessment to the relevant 
business model of the financial assets, the 
Group assesses the contractual terms of 
financial assets to identify whether the cash 
flow realised are towards solely payment of 
principal and interest.
	
	
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined 
as the fair value of the financial asset at initial 
recognition and may change over the life of the 
financial asset. The most significant elements 
of interest within a lending arrangement are 
typically the consideration for the time value 
of money and credit risk.
	
(iii)	 Initial measurement of financial instruments
	
	
The classification of financial instruments at 
initial recognition depends on their contractual 
terms and the business model for managing 
the instruments. Financial instruments are 
initially measured at their fair value.
	
(iv)	Classification of Financial Instruments as per 
business model and SPPI test
	
	
(a)	 Loans 
and 
Debt 
instruments 
at 
amortised cost
	
	
	
A ‘loan or debt instrument’ is measured at 
the amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
	
	
	
i) 	
The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
	
	
	
ii)	
The contractual terms of the asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding. 
	
	
	
After initial measurement, such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and 
fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
in interest income in the profit or loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are 
recognised in the profit or loss.
	
	
(b) 	Financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income 
if these financial assets are held within 
a business model whose objective is 
achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows that give rise on specified dates 
to sole payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding and 
by selling financial assets.
	
	
(c)	 Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are those that are either 
held for trading and have been either 
designated by management upon initial 
recognition or are mandatorily required 
to be measured at fair value under Ind 
AS 109. Management only designates 
an instrument at FVTPL upon initial 
recognition when one of the following 
criteria are met (such designation 
is determined on an instrument-by-
instrument basis):
	
	
	
The designation eliminates, or significantly 
reduces, the inconsistent treatment that 
would otherwise arise from measuring 
the assets or recognising gains or losses 
on them on a different basis.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
	
	
Financial assets at FVTPL are recorded in 
the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in 
fair value are recorded in profit and loss.
	
	
(d) 	Debt securities and other borrowed funds
	
	
	
After initial measurement, debt issued and 
other borrowed funds are subsequently 
measured 
at 
amortised 
cost. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on 
issue funds, and costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. A compound financial 
instrument which contains both a liability 
and an equity component is separated at 
the issue date.
	
	
(e) 	 Financial guarantees
	
	
	
Financial guarantees are initially 
recognised in the financial statements 
(within ‘Provisions’) at fair value, being 
the premium/deemed premium received. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
Group’s liability under each guarantee 
is measured at the higher of the amount 
initially recognised less cumulative 
amortisation recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. The premium/deemed 
premium is recognised in the statement 
of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis 
over the life of the guarantee.
	
	
(f) 	 Undrawn loan commitments
	
	
	
Undrawn 
loan 
commitments 
are 
commitments under which, over the 
duration of the commitment, the Group 
is required to provide a loan with 
pre-specified terms to the customer. 
Undrawn loan commitments are in the 
scope of the ECL requirements.
	
(v)	 Reclassification of financial assets and 
liabilities
	
	
The Group does not reclassify its financial 
assets subsequent to their initial recognition, 
apart from the exceptional circumstances in 
which the Group acquires, disposes of, or 
terminates a business line.
	
(vi)	Derecognition of financial assets in following 
circumstances
	
	
(a)	 Derecognition of financial assets due to 
substantial modification of terms and 
conditions
	
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial 
asset, such as a loan to a customer, 
when the terms and conditions have 
been renegotiated to the extent that, 
substantially it becomes a new loan 
with the difference recognised as a 
derecognition gain or loss, to the extent 
that an impairment loss has not already 
been recorded. The newly recognised 
loans are classified as Stage 1 for ECL 
measurement purposes, unless the new 
loan is deemed to be credit-impaired at 
the origination date.
	
	
	
If the modification does not result in cash 
flows that are substantially different, 
the modification does not result in 
derecognition. Based on the change in 
cash flows discounted at the original EIR, 
the Group records a modification gain or 
loss, to the extent that an impairment 
loss has not already been recorded.
	
	
(b) 	Derecognition of financial assets other 
than due to substantial modification
	
	
	
Financial assets
	
	
	
A financial asset or a part of financial 
asset is derecognised when the rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial 
asset have expired. The Group also 
derecognises the financial asset if it has 
transferred the financial asset and the 
transfer qualifies for derecognition.
	
	
	
The Group has transferred the financial 
asset if, and only if, either:
•	 The Group has transferred its 
contractual rights to receive cash 
flows from the financial asset; or
•	 It retains the rights to the cash flows, 
but has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows.
	
	
	
A 
transfer 
only 
qualifies 
for 
derecognition if either:
•	  The Group has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset; 
or
•	 The Group has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset

The Group considers control to be 
transferred if and only if, the transferee 
has the practical ability to sell the 
asset in its entirety to an unrelated 
third party and is able to exercise that 
ability unilaterally and without imposing 
additional restrictions on the transfer.
	
	
	
When the Group has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards and has retained control 
of the asset, the asset continues to be 
recognised only to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement, in 
which case, the Group also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset 
and the associated liability are measured 
on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Group has retained.
	
	
Write off
	
	
The Group writes off a financial asset when 
there is information indicating that the 
counterparty is in severe financial difficulty 
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. 
Financial assets written off may still be 
subject to enforcement activities under the 
Group’s recovery procedures, taking into 
account legal advice where appropriate. 
Any recoveries made are recognised in 
Statement of profit and loss.
	
(vii)	Derecognition of Financial liabilities
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged, 
cancelled or expires. Where an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as a derecognition of 
the original liability and the recognition of 
a new liability. The difference between the 
carrying value of the original financial liability 
and the consideration paid is recognised in 
profit or loss.
b) 	 Fair Value Measurement
	
On initial recognition, all the financial instruments 
are measured at fair value. For subsequent 
measurement, the Group measures certain 
categories of financial instruments at fair value 
on each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.
	
The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
i. 	
In the principal market for the asset 
or liability, or
	
ii. 	 In the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
In order to show how fair values have been 
derived, financial instruments are classified 
based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as 
summarised below:
	
Fair values are categorised into different levels in 
a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in 
the valuation techniques as follows.
	
Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities;
	
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included 
in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly;
	
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data.
	
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that 
is significant to the entire measurement.
	
The Group recognises transfers between levels 
of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the

reporting period during which the change has 
occurred, if any.
c) 	 Property plant and equipments
	
Recognition and measurement
	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is recognised 
when it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with it will flow to the company 
and the cost can be measured reliably.
	
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price 
and any attributable cost of bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use. 
Borrowing costs relating to acquisition of assets 
which takes substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use are also included to the extent 
they relate to the year till such assets are ready to 
be put to use. Any trade discounts and rebates are 
deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
	
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of such 
assets are measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and are recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
	
Subsequent expenditure
	
Subsequent costs are included in the assets 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate only if it is probable that the 
future economic benefits associated with the item 
will flow to the Group and that the cost of the item 
can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of 
any component accounted for as a separate asset 
is derecognised when replaced. All other repair 
and maintenance expenses are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred.
	
Depreciation
	
Depreciation is provided on Straight Line Method 
(‘SLM’), which reflects the management’s 
estimate of the useful life of the respective 
assets. The estimated useful life used to provide 
depreciation are as follows:

Property, plant and equipment items individually 
costing less than ` 5,000 are depreciated fully in 
the year of purchase.
	
Leasehold improvement is amortised on Straight 
Line Method over the lease term, subject to a 
maximum of 60 months.
	
Useful life of assets different from prescribed 
in Schedule II of the Act has been estimated 
by 
management 
and 
supported 
by 
technical assessment.
	
Depreciation on assets acquired/sold during 
the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the 
statement of Profit and Loss till the date of sale.
	
The useful lives and the method of depreciation 
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate. Changes in the expected useful life 
are accounted for by changing the amortisation 
period or methodology, as appropriate, and 
treated as changes in accounting estimates.
d) 	 Intangible assets
	
Recognition and measurement
	
An intangible asset is recognised only when its 
cost can be measured reliably and it is probable 
that the expected future economic benefits 
that are attributable to it will flow to the Group. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on initial recognition at cost. Following initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. The cost of intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination is their 
fair value as at the date of acquisition.
	
Amortisation
	
Intangible assets are amortised using the straight 
line method over a period of 3 years, which is 
the management’s estimate of its useful life.

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method are reviewed at least as at each financial 
year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is 
significantly different from previous estimates, the 
amortisation period is changed accordingly.
	
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or 
disposal of an intangible asset are determined as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and 
recognised as income or expense in the statement 
of Profit and Loss.
e) 	 Business Combination and goodwill thereon
	
Business combinations other than under common 
control are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at 
the value which is aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in 
the acquiree. The identifiable assets acquired and 
the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair 
values, as on date of acquisition. Any contingent 
consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
	
Measurement
	
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. In case the excess is on account 
of bargain purchase, the gain is recognised directly 
in equity as capital reserve. When the transaction 
is of nature other than bargain purchase, then 
the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in 
equity as capital reserve.
f) 	 Impairment
	
(i) 	 Financial Assets
	
	
(a) 	Expected Credit Loss (ECL) principles 
for Financial assets
	
	
	
The Group records allowance for 
expected credit losses for all loans, other 
debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, 
undrawn loan commitments (referred to 
as ‘financial instruments’).
	
	
	
For the computation of ECL on the 
financial instruments, the Group 
categories its financial instruments as 
mentioned below:
	
	
	
Stage 1: All exposures where there has 
not been a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition or that has 
low credit risk at the reporting date 
and that are not credit impaired upon 
origination are classified under this stage. 
The Group classifies all advances upto 
30 days overdue under this category. 
Stage 1 loans also include facilities where 
the credit risk has improved and the loan 
has been reclassified from Stage 2.
	
	
	
Stage 2: Exposures are classified as 
Stage 2 when the amount is due for 
more than 30 days but do not exceed 
90 days. All exposures where there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk 
since initial recognition but are not credit 
impaired are classified under this stage.
	
	
	
Stage 3: All exposures are assessed as 
credit impaired when one or more events 
that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of that asset 
have occurred. Advances where the 
amount remains due for more than 90 
days are considered to be stage 3 assets.
	
	
	
The Group has established a policy to 
perform an assessment, at the end of 
each reporting period, of whether a 
financial instrument’s credit risk has 
increased significantly since initial 
recognition, by considering the change 
in the risk of default occurring over the 
remaining life of the financial instrument. 
The Group undertakes the classification 
of exposures within the aforesaid stages 
at borrower level.
	
	
(b) 	Definition of default
	
	
	
A default on a financial asset is when the 
counterparty fails to make the contractual 
payments within 90 days of when they 
fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets 
shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the 
reporting date, it has been more than 90 
days past due. Non-payment on another 
obligation of the same customer is also 
considered as a Stage 3.
	
	
(c) 	 Calculation of ECL:
	
	
	
ECL is a probability weighted credit 
losses (i.e. present value of all cash

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
shortfalls) over the expected life of the 
financial instruments. Cash shortfalls are 
the difference between the cash flows 
that the entity is entitled to receive on 
account of contract and the cash flows 
that the entity expects to receive.
	
	
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations 
are outlined below and the key elements 
are as follows:
	
	
	
Exposure-At-Default 
(EAD): 
The 
Exposure at Default is the amount the 
Group is entitled to receive as on reporting 
date including repayments due for 
principal and interest, whether scheduled 
by contract or otherwise, expected 
drawdowns on committed facilities.
	
	
	
Probability of Default (PD): The 
Probability of Default is an estimate of 
the likelihood of default of the exposure 
over a given time horizon. A default may 
only happen at a certain time over the 
assessed period, if the facility has not 
been previously derecognised and is still 
in the portfolio.
	
	
	
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given 
Default is an estimate of the loss arising 
in the case where a default occurs at a 
given time. It is based on the difference 
between the contractual cash flows due 
and those that the lender would expect 
to receive, including from the realisation 
of any collateral.
	
	
	
The ECL allowance is applied on 
the financial instruments depending 
upon the classification of the financial 
instruments as per the credit risk 
involved. ECL allowance is computed on 
the below mentioned basis:
	
	
	
12-month ECL: 12-month ECL is the 
portion of Lifetime ECL that represents 
the ECL that results from default events 
on a financial instrument that are 
possible within the 12-months after the 
reporting date. 12-month ECL is applied 
on stage 1 assets.
	
	
	
Lifetime ECL: Lifetime ECL for credit 
losses expected to arise over the life of 
the asset in cases of credit impaired loans 
and in case of financial instruments where 
there has been significant increase in 
credit risk since origination. Lifetime ECL 
is the expected credit loss resulting 
from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument. 
Lifetime ECL is applied on stage 2 and 
stage 3 assets.
	
	
	
The Group computes the ECL allowance 
on either individual basis or collective 
basis, depending on the nature of 
the underlying portfolio of financial 
instruments. The Group has grouped 
its loan portfolio into Corporate 
loans, SME loans, Commercial vehicle 
loans and Home loans
	
	
	
ECL on Trade Receivables:
	
	
	
The Group applies the simplified 
approach for computation of ECL on 
trade receivables as allowed as per Ind 
AS 109. Thus, the Group is recognising 
lifetime ECL for trade receivables.
	
	
	
Significant increase in Credit Risk
	
	
	
The Group monitors all financial assets 
and financial guarantee contracts 
that are subject to the impairment 
requirements to assess whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition. If there 
has been a significant increase in credit 
risk, the Group will measure the loss 
allowance based on lifetime rather 
than 12-month ECL.
	
	
	
In assessing whether the credit risk on 
a financial instrument has increased 
significantly since initial recognition, the 
Group compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the financial instrument 
at the reporting date based on the 
remaining maturity of the instrument 
with the risk of a default occurring 
that was anticipated for the remaining 
maturity at the current reporting date 
when the financial instrument was first 
recognised. In making this assessment, 
the Group considers both quantitative 
and qualitative information that is 
reasonable and supportable, including 
historical experience and forward-looking

information that is available without 
undue cost or effort, based on the 
Group’s historical experience and expert 
credit assessment.
	
	
	
Given that a significant increase in credit 
risk since initial recognition is a relative 
measure, a given change in absolute 
terms in the PD will be more significant 
for a financial instrument with a lower 
initial PD than compared to a financial 
instrument with a higher PD.
	
	
	
As a back-stop when loan asset not 
being a loan becomes 30 days past due, 
the Group considers that a significant 
increase in credit risk has occurred and 
the asset is in stage 2 of the impairment 
model, i.e. the loss allowance is measured 
as the lifetime ECL in respect of 
all retail assets.
	
	
	
For the purpose of counting of days past 
due for the assessment of significant 
increase in credit risk, the special 
dispensations to any class of assets in 
accordance with COVID19 Regulatory 
Package notified by the Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) has been applied by the Group.
	
	
	
Modification 
and 
derecognition 
of 
financial assets
	
	
	
A modification of a financial asset occurs 
when the contractual terms governing 
the cash flows of a financial asset are 
renegotiated or otherwise modified 
between initial recognition and maturity 
of the financial asset. A modification 
affects the amount and/or timing of the 
contractual cash flows either immediately 
or at a future date. In addition, the 
introduction of new covenants or 
adjustment of existing covenants 
of an existing loan may constitute 
a modification even if these new or 
adjusted covenants do not yet affect the 
cash flows immediately but may affect 
the cash flows depending on whether the 
covenant is or is not met (e.g. a change 
to the increase in the interest rate that 
arises when covenants are breached).
	
	
	
The Company renegotiates loans to 
customers in financial difficulty to 
maximise collection and minimise the 
risk of default. A loan forbearance is 
granted in cases where although the 
borrower made all reasonable efforts 
to pay under the original contractual 
terms, there is a high risk of default or 
default has already happened and the 
borrower is expected to be able to meet 
the revised terms. The revised terms in 
most of the cases include an extension 
of the maturity of the loan, changes 
to the timing of the cash flows of the 
loan (principal and interest repayment), 
reduction in the amount of cash flows 
due (principal and interest forgiveness) 
and amendments to covenants.
	
	
	
When a financial asset is modified 
the Company assesses whether this 
modification results in derecognition. 
In accordance with the Company’s policy 
a modification results in derecognition 
when it gives rise to substantially 
different terms. To determine if the 
modified terms are substantially different 
from the original contractual terms the 
Company considers the following:
•	 Qualitative factors, such as contractual 
cash flows after modification are no 
longer SPPI,
•	 Change in currency or change of 
counterparty,
•	 The extent of change in interest rates, 
maturity, covenants.
	
	
	
If this does not clearly indicate a 
substantial modification, then:
	
	
	
(a)	 In the case where the financial asset 
is derecognised the loss allowance 
for ECL is remeasured at the date 
of derecognition to determine the 
net carrying amount of the asset at 
that date. The difference between 
this revised carrying amount and 
the fair value of the new financial 
asset with the new terms will lead 
to a gain or loss on derecognition. 
The new financial asset will have a 
loss allowance measured based on 
12-month ECL except in the rare 
occasions where the new loan is 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
214
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
considered to be originated-credit 
impaired. This applies only in the case 
where the fair value of the new loan is 
recognised at a significant discount 
to its revised par amount because 
there remains a high risk of default 
which has not been reduced by the 
modification. The Company monitors 
credit risk of modified financial 
assets by evaluating qualitative and 
quantitative information, such as if 
the borrower is in past due status 
under the new terms.
	
	
	
(b) 	When the contractual terms of a 
financial asset are modified and 
the modification does not result 
in derecognition, the Company 
determines if the financial asset’s 
credit risk has increased significantly 
since initial recognition by comparing:
•	 the 
remaining 
lifetime 
PD 
estimated based on data at initial 
recognition and the original 
contractual terms; with
•	 the remaining lifetime PD at the 
reporting date based on the 
modified terms.
	
	
	
	
For financial assets modified, 
where modification did not result 
in derecognition, the estimate of 
PD reflects the Company’s ability 
to collect the modified cash flows 
taking into account the Company’s 
previous experience of similar 
forbearance action, as well as various 
behavioural indicators, including the 
borrower’s payment performance 
against the modified contractual 
terms. If the credit risk remains 
significantly higher than what was 
expected at initial recognition the 
loss allowance will continue to be 
measured at an amount equal to 
lifetime ECL. The loss allowance on 
forborne loans will generally only 
be measured based on 12-month 
ECL when there is evidence of the 
borrower’s improved repayment 
behaviour following modification 
leading to a reversal of the previous 
significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
	
	
Where a modification does not lead 
to derecognition, the Company 
calculates the modification gain/
loss comparing the gross carrying 
amount before and after the 
modification (excluding the ECL 
allowance). Then the Company 
measures ECL for the modified 
asset, where the expected cash flows 
arising from the modified financial 
asset are included in calculating the 
expected cash shortfalls from the 
original asset.
	
	
	
	
Presentation of ECL allowance in 
the Balance Sheet
	
	
	
	
Loss allowances for ECL are 
presented in the statement of 
financial position as follows:
•	 for financial assets measured at 
amortised cost: as a deduction 
from the gross carrying amount 
of the assets;
•	 for debt instruments measured 
at FVTOCI: no loss allowance 
is recognised in Balance Sheet 
as the carrying amount is at fair 
value.
	
(ii)	 Financial Liabilities
	
	
(a)	 Loan commitments
	
	
	
Undrawn 
loan 
commitments 
are 
commitments under which, over the 
duration of the commitment, the Group 
is required to provide a loan with 
pre-specified terms to the customer. 
Undrawn loan commitments are in the 
scope of the ECL requirements.
	
	
(b)	 Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
	
The Group’s liability under financial 
guarantee is measured at the higher 
of the amount initially recognised less 
cumulative amortisation recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss, and 
the ECL provision. For this purpose, 
the Group estimates ECLs by applying 
a credit conversion factor. The ECLs 
related to financial guarantee contracts 
are recognised within Provisions. 
Currently, the Group has not recognised 
any ECL in respect of financial guarantee 
based on estimate of expected cash flows.

(iii) 	Non-financial assets
	
	
(a) 	Intangible assets
	
	
	
The carrying amount of assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date if there is 
any indication of impairment based on 
internal/external factors. An impairment 
loss is recognised when the carrying 
amount of an individual asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value 
of the asset less cost of its disposal 
and value in use.
	
	
(b) 	Goodwill
	
	
	
Goodwill is recorded at the cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses in the 
previous years. Goodwill on acquisition 
is tested for impairment where the 
same allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units that are expected 
to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned 
to those units.
	
	
	
A cash generating unit (CGU) to which 
goodwill has been allocated is tested 
for impairment on annual basis or 
whenever required in case where the 
Group is of the opinion that goodwill 
may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit 
is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro rata 
based on the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. Any impairment loss 
for goodwill is recognised in profit or 
loss. Such impairment loss already 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed 
in subsequent periods.
g) 	 Recognition of income
	
Revenue generated form the business transactions 
(other than for those items to which Ind AS 109 
Financial Instruments are applicable) is measured 
at fair value of the consideration to be received 
or receivable by the Group. Ind AS 115 Revenue 
from contracts with customers outlines a single 
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue 
arising from contracts with customers.
	
The Group recognises revenue from contracts 
with customers based on a five step model as set 
out in Ind AS 115:
	
Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer;
	
Step 2: Identify performance obligations 
in the contract;
	
Step 3: Determine the transaction price;
	
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the 
performance obligations in the contract;
	
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group 
satisfies a performance obligation.
	
(a)	 Recognition of interest income
	
	
Interest income is recorded using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method for all financial 
instruments measured at amortised cost. 
The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument or, 
when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount of the financial asset.
	
	
The EIR for the amortised cost asset is 
calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition, origination fees 
and transaction costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR.
	
	
If expectations regarding the cash flows on the 
financial asset are revised for reasons other 
than credit risk, the adjustment is booked 
as a positive or negative adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the asset in the balance 
sheet with an increase or reduction in interest 
income. The adjustment is subsequently 
amortised through Interest income in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
The Group calculates interest income by 
applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount 
of financial assets other than credit-impaired 
assets. When a financial asset becomes 
credit-impaired and is, therefore, regarded as 
‘Stage 3’, the Group recognised the interest 
income by applying the effective interest 
rate to the net amortised cost of the financial 
asset. If the financial status of the financial 
asset improves and it no longer remains 
to be a credit-impaired, the Group revises 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
216
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
the application of interest income on such 
financial asset to calculating interest income 
on a gross basis.
	
	
Interest income on all trading assets and 
financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at FVTPL is recognised using 
the contractual interest rate in net gain on 
fair value changes.
	
(b) 	Dividend income
	
	
Dividend income is recognised when the 
Group’s right to receive the payment is 
established, it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the dividend will flow 
to the Group and the amount of the dividend 
can be measured reliably.
	
(c)	 Syndication, advisory & other fees
	
	
Syndication, advisory & other fees are 
recognised as income when the performance 
obligation as per the contract with customer 
is fulfilled and when the right to receive 
the payment against the services has 
been established.
	
(d)	 Origination fees
	
	
Origination fees, which the Group has 
received/recovered at time of granting 
of a loan, is considered as a component 
for computation of the effective rate of 
interest (EIR) for the purpose of computing 
interest income.
	
(e)	 Management Fees:
	
	
Management fees and other fees are 
recognised as income when the performance 
obligation as per the contract with customer 
is fulfilled and when the right to receive 
the payment against the services has 
been established.
	
(f)	 Assignment income
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, in case of 
assignment transactions with complete 
transfer of risks and rewards without any 
retention of residual interest, gain arising on 
such assignment transactions is recorded 
upfront in the Statement of Profit and Loss and 
the corresponding asset is derecognised from 
the Balance Sheet immediately upon execution 
of such transactions. Further the transfer of 
financial assets qualifies for derecognition in 
its entirety, the whole of the interest spread 
at its present value (discounted over the life 
of the asset) is recognised on the date of 
derecognition itself as excess interest spread 
and correspondingly recognised as profit on 
derecognition of financial asset.
	
(g)	 Securitisation transactions:
	
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, in case of 
securitisation transactions, the Group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, 
the Group continues to recognize the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
(h)	 Net gain/(loss) on Fair value changes
	
	
Any differences between the fair values 
of financial assets classified as fair value 
through the profit or loss, held by the Group 
on the balance sheet date is recognised 
as an unrealised gain or loss as a gain or 
expense respectively.
	
	
Similarly, any realised gain or loss on 
sale of financial instruments measured at 
FVTPL and debt instruments measured at 
FVOCI is recognised in net gain / loss on 
fair value changes.
	
(i)	 Sourcing and servicing fee
	
	
The revenue from the contract as a service 
provider (sourcing and collection agent) on 
behalf of customer, is recognised upfront 
for services rendered as sourcing agent and 
on straight line basis over the loan tenure 
for services in the nature of collection and 
performance agent. The financial guarantee 
provided under the service contract is 
recognised at fair value on sourcing and is 
amortised over the period of contract with 
subsequent measurement at higher of the 
unamortised value as per Ind AS 115 or 
expected credit losses as per Ind AS 109.
h)	
Finance Costs
	
The Group recognises interest expense on the 
borrowings as per EIR methodology which is 
calculated by considering any ancillary costs 
incurred and any premium payable on its maturity.
i) 	
Retirement and other employee benefits
	
(i) 	 Defined Contribution Plan
	
	
Provident Fund
	
	
All the employees of the Group are entitled to 
receive benefits under the Provident Fund, a

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
defined contribution plan in which both the 
employee and the Group contribute monthly 
at a stipulated rate. The Group has no liability 
for future Provident Fund benefits other 
than its annual contribution and recognises 
such contributions as an expense, when an 
employee renders the related service.
	
(ii) 	 Defined Benefit schemes
	
	
(a) 	Gratuity
	
	
	
The Group provides for the gratuity, a 
defined benefit retirement plan covering 
all employees. The plan provides for lump 
sum payments to employees upon death 
while in employment or on separation 
from employment after serving for 
the stipulated year mentioned under 
‘The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972’. 
The Group accounts for liability of future 
gratuity benefits based on an external 
actuarial valuation on projected unit 
credit method carried out for assessing 
liability as at the reporting date.
	
	
	
Net interest recognised in proﬁt or loss 
is calculated by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation to the net deﬁned beneﬁt 
liability or asset. The actual return on 
the plan assets above or below the 
discount rate is recognised as part of 
re-measurement of net deﬁned liability 
or asset through other comprehensive 
income. Remeasurements, comprising 
of actuarial gains and losses, the effect 
of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts 
included in net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability and the return on plan 
assets (excluding amounts included in 
net interest on the net defined benefit 
liability), are recognised immediately in 
the balance sheet with a corresponding 
debit or credit to retained earnings 
through Other comprehensive income 
(‘OCI’) in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurements are not reclassified to 
profit or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
(b) 	Compensated absences
	
	
	
Short term compensated absences 
are provided for based on estimates. 
Long term compensated absences are 
provided for based on actuarial valuation. 
The actuarial valuation is done as per 
projected unit credit method as at the 
reporting date.
	
	
	
Actuarial gains/losses are immediately 
taken to Statement of profit and loss 
account and are not deferred.
j) 	
Share based employee payments
	
Equity settled share based payments
	
The stock options granted to employees are 
measured at the fair value of the options at 
the grant date. The fair value of the options is 
treated as discount and accounted as employee 
compensation cost over the vesting period on 
a straight line basis. The amount recognised as 
expense in each year is arrived at based on the 
number of grants expected to vest. If a grant lapses 
after the vesting period, the cumulative discount 
recognised as expense in respect of such grant is 
transferred to the general reserve within equity.
k) 	 Ind AS 116 Leases
	
The determination of whether an arrangement is a 
lease, or contains a lease, is based on the substance 
of the arrangement and requires an assessment 
of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is 
dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets 
or whether the arrangement conveys a right 
to use the asset.
	
Group as a lessee
	
Leases that do not transfer to the Group 
substantially all of the risks and benefits incidental 
to ownership of the leased items are treated as 
operating leases. Operating lease payments are 
recognised as an expense in the statement of profit 
and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term, unless the increase is in line with expected 
general inflation, in which case lease payments 
are recognised based on contractual terms. 
Contingent rental payable is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they it is incurred.
	
Critical accounting estimate and judgement
	
1. 	
Determination of lease term
	
	
Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine 
the lease term as the non-cancellable period 
of a lease adjusted with any option to extend 
or terminate the lease, if the use of such 
option is reasonably certain. The Group 
makes assessment on the expected lease 
term on lease by lease basis and thereby 
assesses whether it is reasonably certain 
that any options to extend or terminate the 
INDOSTAR CAPITAL FINANCE LIMITED
218
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
contract will be exercised. In evaluating the 
lease term, the Group considers factors such 
as any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs 
relating to the termination of lease and the 
importance of the underlying to the Group’s 
operations taking into account the location 
of the underlying asset and the availability 
of the suitable alternatives. The lease term 
in future periods is reassessed to ensure 
that the lease term reflects the current 
economic circumstances.
	
2. 	 Discount Rate
	
	
The discount rate is generally based on the 
incremental borrowing rate specific to the 
lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of 
leases with similar characteristics.
l) 	
Foreign currency translation
	
Functional and presentational currency
	
The financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupees which is also functional currency of the 
Group and the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
m) 	 Provisions
	
A provision is recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of past event; it is 
probable that outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a 
reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not 
discounted to its present value and are determined 
based on best estimate required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. These are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates.
n) 	 Taxes
	
(i)	 Current tax
	
	
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current 
and prior years are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from, or paid to, 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax 
laws used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by 
the reporting date in the countries where the 
Group operates and generates taxable income.
	
	
Current income tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Current tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. 
Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations 
are subject to interpretation and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
	
(ii) 	 Deferred tax
	
	
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences at the reporting date between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes.
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all 
deductible temporary differences, the carry 
forward of unused tax credits and any unused 
tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
re-assessed at each reporting date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss is recognised outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
are offset if a legally enforceable right exists 
to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate 
to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
o) 	 Earnings Per Share
	
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per 
share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings 
per share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net proﬁt or loss for the year attributable 
to equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the year are 
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares 
are deemed converted as of the beginning of 
the period, unless they have been issued at a 
later date. In computing the dilutive earnings per 
share, only potential equity shares that are dilutive 
and that either reduces the earnings per share or 
increases loss per share are included.
p) 	 Contingent Liabilities
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that 
arises from past events whose existence will be 
conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Group or a present obligation that 
is not recognised because it is not probable that 
an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises 
in extremely rare cases where there is a liability 
that cannot be recognised because it cannot be 
measured reliably. The Group does not recognize 
a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the ﬁnancial statements.
q) 	 Segment reporting
	
Operating segments are those components 
of the business whose operating results are 
regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision 
making body in the Group to make decisions for 
performance assessment and resource allocation.
	
The reporting of segment information is the same 
as provided to the management for the purpose 
of the performance assessment and resource 
allocation to the segments.
	
Segment accounting policies are in line with the 
accounting policies of the Group. In addition, the 
following specific accounting policies have been 
followed for segment reporting:
i) 	
Segment revenue includes operational revenue 
directly identifiable with/allocable to the segment.
ii)	
Expenses that are directly identifiable with/
allocable to segments are considered for 
determining the segment result.
iii)	 Income which relates to the Group as a whole and 
not allocable to segments is included in “unallocable 
corporate income / (expenditure)(net)”.
iv) 	 Segment result includes the finance costs incurred 
on interest bearing advances with corresponding 
credit included in “unallocable corporate income/
(expenditure)(net)”.
v)	
Segment assets and liabilities include those 
directly identifiable with the respective segments. 
Unallocable corporate assets and liabilities 
represent the assets and liabilities that relate to 
the Group as a whole.
2.4 Significant accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions
	
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires that the 
management of the Group makes estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
income and expenses of the period, the reported 
balances of assets and liabilities and the disclosures 
relating to contingent liabilities as of the date of the 
financial statements. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates include useful 
lives of property, plant and equipment & intangible 
assets, allowance for expected credit losses, fair 
value measurement, business projections used 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment etc. 
Difference, if any, between the actual results and 
estimates is recognised in the period in which the 
results are known.
2.5	 Securities premium account
	
a)	
Securities premium includes:
•	 The difference between the face value of 
the equity shares and the consideration 
received in respect of shares issued;
•	 The fair value of the stock options which 
are treated as expense, if any, in respect of 
shares allotted pursuant to Stock Options 
Scheme.

The issue expenses of securities which qualify

2.6	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies 
new standards or amendments to the existing 
standards under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.
a)	
Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements - 
This amendment requires the entities to disclose 
their material accounting policies rather than their 
significant accounting policies. The effective date 
for adoption of this amendment is annual periods 
beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Company 
has evaluated the amendment and the impact of 
the amendment is insignificant in the Consolidated 
financial statements.
b)	
Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes 
in Accounting Estimates and Errors - This 
amendment has introduced a definition of 
‘accounting estimates’ and included amendments 
to Ind AS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in 
accounting policies from changes in accounting 
estimates. The effective date for adoption of this 
amendment is annual periods beginning on or 
after April 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated 
the amendment and there is no impact on its 
Consolidated financial statements.
c)	
Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes - This amendment has 
narrowed the scope of the initial recognition 
exemption so that it does not apply to transactions 
that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary 
differences. The effective date for adoption of 
this amendment is annual periods beginning 
on or after April 1, 2023. The Company has 
evaluated the amendment and there is no 
impact on its Consolidated financial statement

The Company has assessed that there is no impairment of Goodwill as at and for the year ended March 2023. 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation. The calculation uses cash flow 
projections of commercial vehicle business based on financial budgets covering a five-year period and a discount 
rate of 19%. The Company has determined that the recoverable amount calculations are most sensitive to changes 
in the assumptions of yield/spread during the budget period and the discounting rate. The management believes 
that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, on which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to equity holders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders (after adjusting profit 
impact of dilutive potential equity shares, if any) by the aggregate of weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year and the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion 
of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

Note 31
Financial instruments – Fair values
A. 	 Accounting classification and fair values
	
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market 
conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.
	
The management has assessed that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, loans carried at 
amortised cost, other financial assets, trade payables, borrowings, bank/book overdrafts and other current 
liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
B. 	 Risk Management Framework:
	
The Group’s risk management framework is based on:
	
(a)	 Clear understanding and identification of various risks;
	
(b)	 Disciplined risk assessment by evaluating the probability and impact of each risk;
	
(c)	 Measurement and monitoring of risks by establishing key risk indicators with thresholds for all 
critical risks; and
	
(d)	 Adequate review mechanism to monitor and control risks.
	
The Group’s risk management division works as a value centre by constantly engaging with the business 
providing reports based on key analysis and insights. The key risks faced by the Group are credit risk, 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, reputational and regulatory risk, which are broadly classified 
as credit risk, market risk and operational risk. The Group has a an established risk reporting and monitoring 
framework. The Group identifies and monitors risks periodically. This process enables the Group to reassess 
the all critical risks in a changing environment that need to be focused on.
C. 	 Risk governance structure:
	
The Group’s risk governance structure operates with a well-defined Board and Risk Management Committee 
(‘RMC’) with a clearly laid down charter and roles and responsibilities. The Board oversees the risk management 
process and monitors the risk profile of the Group directly as well as through a Board constituted Risk 
Management Committee. The Committee reviews the risk management policy, implementation of risk 
management framework, monitoring of critical risks, review and approval of exposures with conflict of interest 
and review of various other initiatives. The risk management policies are established to identify and analyse 
the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to 
limits. The RMC reviews the risk management policies regularly to reflect the changes in market conditions 
and Group’s activities.
	
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of risk management framework in relation to the risk faced by the Group.
	
The risk management committee has established a comprehensive risk management framework across the 
business and provides appropriate reports on risk exposures and analysis in its pursuit of creating awareness 
across the Group about risk management. 
D. 	 Fair value hierarchy
	
Ind AS 107, ‘Financial Instrument - Disclosure’ requires classification of the valuation method of financial 
instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, using a three level fair-value-hierarchy (which reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to un-adjusted 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority 
to un-observable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair-value-hierarchy under Ind AS 
107 are described below:
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.

240
Annual Report 2022-23
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity 
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument 
is included in level 2.
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities included in level 3.
	
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets including their levels in 
the fair value hierarchy:

* Discounted cash flow approach adopted for fair valuation of level 3 instruments
	
The management has assessed that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, loans carried at 
amortised cost, investments in pass-through-certificates, other financial assets, trade payables, borrowings, 
bank overdrafts and other current liabilities are a reasonable approximation to their fair value.
E.	
Credit risk
	
Credit risk arises when a borrower is unable to meet his contractual obligations to the lender. The effective 
management of credit risk requires the establishment of appropriate credit risk policies and processes. 
The Company has comprehensive and well defined credit policies across various businesses, products and 
segments, which encompass credit approval process for all businesses along with guidelines for mitigating 
the risks associated with them. The appraisal process includes detailed risk assessment of the borrowers, 
physical verifications and field visits. The company has a well-defined post sanction monitoring process to 
identify portfolio-wise credit risk trends and early warning signals. This enables it to implement necessary 
changes to the credit policy, whenever the need arises to prevent any further slippage in the credit quality.
 
Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis
	
The Group splits its exposure into smaller homogeneous portfolios, based on shared credit risk characteristics, 
as described below in the following order:
•	 Customer i.e. corporate and retail
•	 Nature of product i.e. Commercial Vehicle, Corporate loan, SME and Housing Finance
	
Significant increase in credit risk
	
The credit risk on a financial asset of the Group are assumed to have increased significantly since initial 
recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. The retail loans where the 
renegotiated terms are not substantially different and involve repayment terms to be extended including 
interest or the EMI amount readjusted over the tenure are classified as Stage 2. In case of corporate loan the 
assessment of significant increase in credit risk is performed on a case to case basis. Additionally, accounts

identified and reviewed by the credit committee for labelling as breaching pre-defined critical credit risk 
parameters will also be classified as Stage 2. Accordingly, the financial assets shall be classified as Stage 2, 
based on the quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
	
Write off
	
The Company writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in 
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets written off may still 
be subject to enforcement activities under the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal 
advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in Statement of profit and loss.
	
Restructured financial assets
	
A loan where repayment terms are renegotiated on substantially different terms as compared to the original 
contracted terms due to significant increase in credit risk of the borrower are classified as stage 2. Such loans 
continue to be in stage 2 until they exhibit regular payment of renegotiated principal and interest over a 
minimum observation period typically 12 months-post renegotiation, and there are no other indicators of 
impairment. Having satisfied the conditions of timely payment over the observation period these loans could 
be transferred to stage 1 or 2 and a fresh assessment of the risk of default is done.
	
Overview of the Expected Credit Loss principles
	
The Group records allowance for expected credit losses for all loans, debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, 
undrawn loan commitments (referred to as ‘financial instruments’).
	
For the computation of ECL on the financial instruments, the Group categories its financial instruments as 
mentioned below:
	
Stage 1: All exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or 
that has low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are classified 
under this stage. The Group classifies all advances upto 30 days overdue under this category. Stage 1 loans 
also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.
	
Stage 2: Exposures are classified as Stage 2 when the amount is due for more than 30 days but do not exceed 
90 days. All exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but 
are not credit impaired are classified under this stage.
	
Stage 3: All exposures are assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. Exposures where the amount remains 
due for 91 days or more are considered as to be stage 3 assets.
	
The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment, at the end of each reporting period, of 
whether a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, by considering 
the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The Group 
undertakes the classification of exposures within the aforesaid stages at borrower level.
	
Definition of default
	
A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make the contractual payments within 90 days 
of when they fall due. Accordingly, the financial assets shall be classified as Stage 3, if on the reporting date, 
it has been more than 90 days past due. Non-payment on another obligation of the same customer is also 
considered as a Stage 3.
	
The calculation of ECL
	
ECL is a probability weighted credit losses (i.e. present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of 
the financial instruments. Cash shortfalls are the difference between the cash flows that the entity is entitled 
to receive on account of contract and the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.

for the year ended March 31, 2023
(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows:
	
Portfolio Segmentation:
	
For ECL purpose, the loan portfolio is broadly segmented as below:
	
1) 	 Corporate lending
	
2) 	 Small and medium enterprises lending (‘SME’)
	
3) 	 Commercial vehicle lending
	
4) 	 Housing finance
	
Exposure-At-Default (EAD): The Exposure at Default is the amount the Group is entitled to receive as 
on reporting date including repayments due for principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or 
otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities.
	
Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default of the 
exposure over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, 
if the facility has not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.
	
Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default 
occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that 
the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.
	
The ECL allowance is applied on the financial instruments depending upon the classification of the financial 
instruments as per the credit risk involved. ECL allowance is computed on the below mentioned basis:
	
12-month ECL: 12-month ECL is the portion of Lifetime ECL that represents the ECL that results from default 
events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. 12-month ECL 
is applied on stage 1 assets.
	
Lifetime ECL: Lifetime ECL for credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset in cases of credit 
impaired loans and in case of financial instruments where there has been significant increase in credit risk 
since origination. Lifetime ECL is the expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the 
expected life of a financial instrument. Lifetime ECL is applied on stage 2 and stage 3 assets. the Group 
computes the ECL allowance either on individual basis or on collective basis, depending on the nature of the 
underlying portfolio of financial instruments. the Group has grouped its loan portfolio into Corporate loans, 
SME loans and Commercial vehicle loans and Housing Finance.
	
Forward looking information
	
The Group employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining 
lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time. 
Such statistical models are selected considering the availability of information related to the probability of 
default for each product. This analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between 
changes in GNPA as proxy for default rates and changes in key macro-economic factors. Key economic 
indicators considered for forward looking includes:
•	 Gross national saving
•	 WPI (Wholesale price index)
	
For the purpose of determination of impact of forward looking information, the company applies macro 
economic (ME) variables as stated above to each product and assess the trend of the historical probability 
of defaults as compared to the forecasted probability of default. Based on the directional trend of output, 
management applies an overlay if required. Overtime, new ME variable may emerge to have a better 
correlation and may replace ME being used now.

F. 	 Liquidity risk
	
Liquidity is the Group’s capacity to fund increase in assets and meet both the expected and unexpected 
obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet such obligations as 
they become due without adversely affecting the Group’s financial conditions. The Asset Liability Management 
Policy of the Group stipulates a broad framework for Liquidity risk management to ensure that the Group can 
meet its liquidity obligations. The Asset Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’) monitors composition, 
characteristics and diversification of funding sources to ensure there is no over reliance on single source of 
funding. The Group tracks the cash flow mismatches for measuring and managing net funding requirement 
through Maturity Ladder approach and reviews short-term liquidity profiles based on business projections and 
other commitments for planning purposes through Liquidity analysis. The ALCO also reviews the individual 
mismatch in each time bucket and cumulative mismatch and ensures the bucket wise limits are not breached.

G. 	 Market risk
	
Market Risk is the possibility of loss arising from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a result 
of changes in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates and other asset prices. The Group’s 
exposure to market risk is a function of asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity assessment. 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk and liquidity risk, if the same is not managed properly. The Group 
continuously monitors these risks and manages them through appropriate risk limits. The Asset Liability 
Management Committee (‘ALCO’) reviews market related trends and risks and adopts various strategies 
related to assets and liabilities, in line with the Group’s risk management framework.

H. 	 Operational risk
	
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or 
from external events. The operational risks of the Group are managed through comprehensive internal control 
systems and procedures. Failure of managing operational risk might lead to legal / regulatory implications 
due to non-compliance and lead to financial loss due to control failures. While it is not practical to eliminate 
all the operational risk, the Group has put in place adequate control framework by way of segregation of 
duties, well defined process, staff training, maker and checker process, authorisation and clear reporting 
structure. The effectiveness of control framework is assessed by internal audit on a periodic basis.
	
To manage fraud risk effectively, the Group has Independent Risk Containment Unit (‘RCU’) which is responsible 
for implementing fraud risk management framework and ensure compliance. The RCU undertakes various 
activities such as pre-sanction loan applicant verification, pre-sanction and post disbursement documents 
verification, vendor verification, etc to prevent and manage frauds.

Note 42 - Other notes
Note 42.1
As indicated in the prior reporting periods, the Company engaged a leading professional services firm to assist 
it in undertaking a review of its loan portfolio. The final findings of this review were submitted to the Audit 
Committee on August 5, 2022. The Company made incremental ECL provisions based, among others, on the 
findings of this review in its financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022. (also refer note 
42.2 to the financial statements).
The Company subsequently engaged a leading law firm, to carry out a review for undertaking root cause analysis 
of deviations to policies and gaps in the internal financial controls and systems (including of control gap/control 
override and individuals involved) focusing on the Company’s commercial vehicles and SME businesses (“Conduct 
Review”). The final findings of this review were submitted to the Audit Committee.
The Company, under the guidance and supervision of the Audit Committee, has completed its review of the 
findings thereon, and has taken necessary remedial and accountability measures. Among others, the Company 
has initiated measures to strengthen controls and improve the process and control environment of the Company 
including by way of senior managerial level changes and appointments, improving entity level controls, policy 
related changes, process improvements and technological enhancements. The Company has also concluded that 
with respect to the findings in the Conduct Review Report, there is no further reporting requirement under the 
Companies Act, 2013.
Note 42.2
In the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022, the Company had made incremental provision for 
expected credit loss (ECL) allowances on account of certain deficiencies in the Company’s internal controls that 
were identified during this period. Considering that these control deficiencies have since been remediated during 
the current year and the findings of the Conduct Review have been adequately evaluated (refer note 42.1), no 
incremental provisioning is considered necessary during the year ended 31 March 2023.
Although the possibility that the control deficiencies that were identified could potentially have had an impact 
on the financial statements for periods ending prior to 1 April, 2021, the Company had concluded that it was 
impracticable to determine the prior period – specific effects, if any, in respect of the charge to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss on account of the following:
(i) 	 impairment allowance on loan assets and investment in security receipts;

(Currency : Indian Rupees in Lakhs)
(ii) 	 loan assets written off; and
(iii) 	changes in fair value of financial guarantee contracts
when it finalised its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 because significant judgements had 
been applied in determining the staging of the loan assets and the related impairment allowance for events and 
conditions which existed as on 31 March 2022. The Company believes it is not practicable to apply the same 
judgement without hindsight for the prior period(s).
Consequent to the above, in respect of such account balances, related income and the related disclosures, 
the figures for the year ended 31 March 2023 may not be strictly comparable with the figures for the year 
ended 31 March 2022.
Note 42.3
Going Concern
As at 31 March 2023, the Company has equity which is significantly in excess of the minimum Capital Risk 
Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) that has been stipulated by the Reserve Bank of Indian (RBI) (including the proportion 
of Tier I Capital). Its liquid assets as of that date are also significantly in excess of the minimum stipulated by 
the RBI. Based on the Company’s forecast of cashflows over the twelve months following 31 March 2023, the 
available liquid assets and the expected cash inflows would be sufficient to meet its liabilities even under a 
stressed scenario. Additionally, during the year ended 31 March 2023 and till the adoption of these financial 
statements, the Company has been successful in raising additional debt of ` 4,58,698.46 lakhs from banks and 
financial institutions and through securitisation (including ` 25,500.00 lakh subsequent to the balance sheet 
date). In view of the above, the Management has concluded that no material uncertainties related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exist as on 
the date of the balance sheet.
Note 42.4
In relation to the loans portfolio, the Management has on a best effort basis and knowledge, has not identified 
transactions with Nil financiers (previous year approximately 32) aggregating ` Nil (previous year ` 21,461.69 
lakhs) used for refinancing loans of the customers.
The Company respectfully submits that it is unable to provide the disclosure relating to these transactions in 
the format as required under Division III of the Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013 as the transactions are 
individually small and voluminous.
Note 42.5
The disclosure on the following matters required under Schedule III as amended not being relevant or applicable 
in case of the Group, same are not covered:
a) 	 The Group has not traded or invested in crypto currency or virtual currency during the financial year.
b) 	 No proceedings have been initiated or are pending against the Group for holding any benami property under 
the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988) and rules made thereunder.
c) 	 The Group has not been declared wilful defaulter by any bank or financial institution or government or any 
government authority.
d) 	 The Group has not entered into any scheme of arrangement.
e) 	 Charges or satisfaction to be registered with Registrar of Companies (ROC) have been registered within the 
stipulated statutory timelines.
f) 	 There are no transactions which are not recorded in the books of account which have been surrendered or 
disclosed as income during the year in the tax assessments under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
