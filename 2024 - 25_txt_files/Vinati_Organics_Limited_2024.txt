S.

identified
Indicate 
whether risk or 
opportunity
The rationale for 
identifying the risk /
opportunity
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Climate Change 
Management
Risk
The environmental impact 
of chemical manufacturing 
necessitates climate-
resilient operations. 
Reputation in global 
markets must also be 
safeguarded.
Business practices are 
aligned with international 
climate goals, supported 
by certifications like 
ISO 14001, ISO 45001, 
Responsible Care, and 
EcoVadis Gold rating.
Initial costs arise 
from climate action 
investments. Long-
term benefits include 
reduced operational 
expenditure and climate 
risk mitigation.
2.
Energy 
Management
Risk/Opportunity
High reliance on coal 
generates harmful 
emissions and growing 
energy demand amplifies 
this exposure.
We have commissioned 33 
MW of Solar Power Plants 
which ensure efficient use 
of resources and transition 
toward renewable energy. 
Currently 58% of electricity 
requirement is met through 
renewable sources.
Capital investment is 
required initially for shift 
to renewables. Long-term 
financial upside is derived 
from energy security and 
reduced operating costs.
3.
Materials
Risk
Usage of key raw materials 
(e.g., Toluene, Acrylonitrile, 
water, coal, etc) risks 
natural resource depletion 
and climate-related supply 
chain disruption.
A sustainable procurement 
policy and focus on 
circularity through 
optimized inputs and 
process efficiency help 
mitigate environmental 
strain.
Cost savings are 
achieved by using 
efficient, recycled, and 
optimized materials.
4.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Inadequate waste handling 
poses regulatory, health, 
and environmental risks.
Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) systems and Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs) 
are installed. Hazardous 
waste is responsibly 
managed through 
Treatment, Storage, and 
Disposal Facility. Fly ash is 
also sent for co-processing 
to produce bricks.
Financial costs are 
incurred for infrastructure 
and operations. Long-
term gains include 
improved yields and 
compliance-driven 
productivity.
5.
Water 
Stewardship
Risk
Industrial water use 
leads to depletion of 
natural resources and 
affects communities and 
ecosystems.
Rainwater harvesting and 
reverse osmosis (RO) 
systems are deployed 
to ensure efficient water 
usage and recharge water 
tables.
Investment is required 
for water-efficient 
systems; however, it 
reduces future risks and 
supports environmental 
sustainability.

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or

6.
Customer 
Relationship
Opportunity / 
Risk
Export operations depend 
on timely deliveries and 
product quality. Both are 
key to customer retention 
and satisfaction.
Account managers 
address client queries, 
while structured feedback 
mechanisms enhance 
service and customer 
experience.
Positive financial return 
driven by market 
expansion and stronger 
customer relationships.
7.
Human Capital 
Management 
- Equal 
Opportunity, 
Diversity & 
Inclusion, 
Retention 
Strategy & 
Training
Risk
Competent human capital 
is essential for chemical 
manufacturing, safety and 
equipment handling.
Company policies promote 
equal opportunity and zero 
discrimination. Regular 
EHS training also is 
provided to employees.
Training and HR policy 
implementation incur 
costs, but yield higher 
productivity and retention.
8.
Human Rights
Risk
Human rights violations 
in chemical industry 
operations may harm 
workforce and reputation.
Strict zero-tolerance 
policies are enforced 
across labor practices, 
harassment prevention, 
and stakeholder 
engagement. No 
grievances were reported 
during FY 2024-25.
Financial impact stems 
from compliance and 
policy enforcement 
but protects corporate 
integrity and workforce 
welfare.
9.
Local 
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity/Risk
Chemical processes can 
harm nearby communities; 
engaging with them builds 
trust and goodwill.
Local engagement 
includes hiring, rural 
development, clean water 
projects, solar pumps, and 
women’s education. Local 
contractors are prioritized.
Inclusive growth and 
positive reputation create 
long-term value.
10.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Manufacturing hazardous 
chemicals increases 
occupational health risks 
for workers.
ISO 45001:2018 
certification and 
Responsible Care status 
underline safety efforts. 
EHS training is regularly 
conducted to safeguard 
employees.
Safety-related operational 
costs rise, including 
protective equipment and 
training. Benefits include 
legal compliance and 
workforce well-being.
11.
Stakeholder 
Engagement
Opportunity
Strong stakeholder 
relations reduce conflict 
and boost transparency 
and productivity.
Engagement through 
reports, media, regulator 
collaboration, and 
whistleblower policies 
ensure accountability.
Financial gains are 
derived through better 
reputation, trust, and 
improved employee 
morale.

12.
Business 
Continuity 
Planning
Risk
Climate risks and disasters 
threaten operational 
continuity.
Robust IT systems are 
backed up on cloud 
platforms to maintain 
digital continuity.
Setup costs apply for 
infrastructure but they 
minimize disruption and 
improve resilience.
13.
Compliance 
(Environment & 
Regulatory)
Risk
Regulatory changes pose 
risk to compliance and 
business continuity.
Comprehensive 
environmental and social 
responsibility are aligned 
with global commitments 
and sustainable business 
practices.
Investments are 
required for compliance 
frameworks, but protect 
reputation and ensure 
uninterrupted business 
operations.
14.
Data Privacy & 
Cyber Security
Risk
Potential cyberattacks 
threaten sensitive data, 
business operations, and 
company reputation.
The organization 
implements strong 
cybersecurity and data 
privacy protocols across 
all systems, and also has a 
Business Continuity Policy 
in place.
Hardware/software 
investments needed 
for data protection but 
avoid major financial and 
reputational harm.
15.
Economic 
Performance
Opportunity
Expanding global demand 
for specialty chemicals 
presents a growth 
opportunity.
The Company’s operations 
encompass a diversified 
portfolio of specialty 
chemicals manufacturing 
with exports accounting for 
over 55% of the total sales. 
Notably, the Company 
holds the distinction of 
being the world’s largest 
producer of IBB and ATBS.
Market growth boosts 
financial performance 
and reinforces leadership 
status.
16.
Ethical Business 
Conduct
Risk
Unethical business 
practices can lead to 
penalties, sanctions, and 
reputation loss.
Comprehensive Code of 
Conduct, whistleblower 
policies, and training 
programs ensure 
compliance with ethical 
norms. Annual declarations 
by directors and KMPs 
reinforce independence 
and transparency.
Compliance systems 
involve cost but improve 
brand trust, governance, 
and customer loyalty.
17.
Intellectual 
Capital - R&D & 
Innovation
Opportunity
Innovation is key to 
product relevance and 
competitive advantage.
Dedicated R&D teams 
focus on new product 
development and existing 
product refinement to 
improve quality and 
operational efficiency.
Financially beneficial 
due to market-ready 
innovations and sustained 
leadership.

Risk
Poor procurement 
impacts product quality, 
supply reliability, and 
environmental footprint.
Sustainable procurement 
policy and daily review

material handling and 
storage.
Expenses linked to 
safe transport, supplier

are incurred, but prevent

objectives.
Value generated through
