10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. 
Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and 
toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage 
such wastes.  
 
Sepnt Catalyst: Once the catalyst is exhausted, it is removed from the processes and is 
oxidized completely. This reduces the risk of fire hazard. After removal, the catalyst is packed in 
the drums containing impervious lining and clearly labeled as “Spent Catalyst - Hazardous”. The 
spent catalyst drums are stored in covered, protected and earmarked area. Spent catalyst is 
disposed to APPCB authorized Re-cyclers/Re-processors through APEMC.  
 
CDR Plant Reclamation Waste: Reclamation waste from Carbon-Di-Oxide Recovery Plant is 
disposed to APPCB authorized vendors through APEMCL. The reclamation waste is being 
disposed to M/s Coastal Waste Management Project, Vizag, for incineration. 
 
Spent Activated Carbon: Activated carbon is used in Ammonia plant I & II, CDR Plant and in 
DM plant. In ammonia process, the activated carbon is used to purify K2CO3 solution whereas 
in CDR Plant, the activated carbon is used to purify KS1 Solution. In DM plant, activated carbon 
is used for the physical adsorption of chlorine and organic matter from the water. The activated 
carbon removed from the above processes is packed in containers with proper lining. The 
containers are labeled prominently and stored in a well-marked, covered and protected area 
and disposed to cement industries/vendors authorized by APPCB vendors through APEMCL.    
 
Waste Oils: In the complex, oils are being used mainly for lubrication purposes. In the process 
plants, the lubricating oils are centrifuged and reused in the process, hence quantity of waste 
oils generated is less when compared to the quantities in use. The waste oils generated from 
the process plants are reused in the bagging plant area for the lubrication of stitching thread. 
Used oil is disposed to APPCB vendors through APEMCL.  
 
Used Lead Acid Batteries: Used Lead Acid Batteries are being returned to the supplier 
through buyback scheme or disposing to the authorized recyclers/dismantlers. 
 
PTP (Pre Treatment Plant) Sludge: The raw water supplied from the Samalkot summer 
reservoir contains fine clay, which is coagulated and filtered in the pretreatment plant. The 
sludge generated from the process is siliceous and alluvial in nature and hence, it is very fertile. 
Considering the fertile nature of the generated sludge, it is used for land filling of low-lying areas 
in the green belt.
