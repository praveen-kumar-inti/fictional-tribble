Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
Director’s Statement on BRSR
	
As the Director (Projects) of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, I am pleased to announce the 
publication of our first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) (previously known as the 
Business Responsibility Report). The report has been prepared as per the formats provided by the Securities 
and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI).
	
The BRSR is a comprehensive document that provides an overview of POWERGRID's sustainability initiatives 
and performance. It covers a wide range of topics, including environmental protection, social development, 
and corporate governance.
	
The publication of the BRSR is a significant milestone for POWERGRID. It demonstrates our commitment to 
transparency and accountability towards sustainability goals. It also shows our stakeholders that we are 
serious about sustainability and that we are taking concrete steps to improve our environmental and social 
performance.
	
I would like to thank all our customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders for their support in 
helping us to achieve our sustainability goals. I would also like to thank the team that worked tirelessly to put 
together the BRSR.
	
I am confident that the BRSR will help us to raise awareness of our sustainability initiatives and to build 
stronger relationships with our stakeholders. I am also confident that it will help us to continue to improve our 
environmental and social performance.
	
POWERGRID is committed to operating in a sustainable manner. We believe that sustainability is essential to 
our long-term success and to the well-being of the communities we serve.
	
Our sustainability initiatives include:
●	
Adoption of Renewable energy for internal consumption as well as acting as a facilitator for the 
integration with the grid: 
	
We have committed to meeting 50% of our internal energy needs from renewable sources by 2025. We 
have already installed 8.2 MWp of solar capacity and replaced 67 diesel vehicles with electric vehicles. We 
are also playing a pivotal role in the grid integration of renewable energy projects across India.
●
●
Taking care of Water footprint
	
We have adopted a water management policy that aims to achieve net water positivity by 2030. 
●
●
Optimum Consumption of Natural Resources & Responsible Waste Management
	
We are committed to using natural resources in an optimum and responsible manner. We are also working 
to reduce our waste generation and to recycle and reuse as much waste as possible.
●
●
Protecting & Creating Carbon sink
	
We are committed to protecting and creating carbon sinks. We have reduced our involvement in forests 
by more than 60% in the past few years. We have also planted 656,702 trees, which will absorb 14,296 tons 
of CO2 annually.
●
●
Undertaking impactful CSR projects 
	
We spend 2% of our profit before tax (PBT) on socially relevant CSR projects. These projects focus on rural 
livelihood, education, health, environment, and skill development.
●
●
Proactive adoption of technology for Sustainability
	
We are committed to adopting innovative technologies that can help us to reduce our environmental 
impact. For example, we are using multi-circuit towers, narrow base towers, and better conductors to 
reduce our land use and our impact on wildlife, replacement of synthetic oil with Ester oil for transformers, 
replacement of SF6 gas with more environment friendly gases, developing digital substations where 
optical fibres are used minimizing the usage of copper cables etc.
	
I am proud of the progress that POWERGRID has made in sustainability. We are committed to continue 
working towards our sustainability goals and operate in a way that is beneficial to the environment and to 
the communities we serve.

variety of activities that have an impact on its operation.
	
Some of the specific examples of such initiatives are mentioned below:
●
●
Substation Inspection Robot has been taken up for development in collaboration with IIT Kanpur. Once 
deployed, it can reduce the risk of accidents and injuries for workers by replacing the traditional manual 
activities with robots.
●
●

In addition, the significant capital expenditure of POWERGRID pertains to development of transmission 
infrastructure towards evacuation of renewable energy.
2. 
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
POWERGRID follows a set of pre-defined processes and procedures towards sustainable sourcing for its 
various procurement needs. These processes and procedures are designed to ensure that POWERGRID's 
procurement activities are environmentally and socially responsible and  that they comply with all relevant 
statutory requirements.
	
Some of the key elements of POWERGRID's sustainable procurement practices include:
	
Compliance with statutory requirements:  POWERGRID requires all contractors to comply with all relevant 
laws and regulations related to pollution prevention, labor standards and occupational health and safety 
like The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, The Water 
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Contract Labor (Regulation & Abolition) Act 1970, Employee’s 
Compensation Act 1923, Equal Remuneration Act 1979, Minimum Wages Act 1948, Child Labor (Prohibition & 
Regulation) Act 1986 etc.
	
Development of an environmental management plan:  Contractors that are awarded contracts for supply-
cum-installation packages are required to develop and implement an environmental management plan. 
This plan must identify and assess the environmental impacts of the project and it must outline the measures 
that will be taken to mitigate these impacts.
	
Adoption of an Integrity Pact Program:  POWERGRID has adopted an Integrity Pact Program, which is a legally 
binding agreement between POWERGRID and its contractors. The Integrity Pact commits the contractor to 
observe the highest standards of business ethics and  it prohibits the contractor from engaging in corrupt or 
fraudulent practices.
	
In addition to the above, various sustainability related aspects are embedded in the contract entered with 
Vendors/ Contractors for its compliance during execution of work. Some of the aspects are as following:
●
●
Supplier Code of Conduct for Environmental standards for the suppliers’ processes, products or services 
-The Contractor is required to establish an operational system of managing environmental impacts and 
carry out all the monitoring and mitigation measures set forth in the environment management plan. 
Further, Contractors are also required to comply all requirements of Social Accountability Standards 
(SA8000).
●
●
Supplier Code of Conduct pertaining to Child Labor is governed through provision for Child Labor 
(Prohibition & Regulation) Act 1986) in tender document. Further, Contractor is also required to comply all 
requirements of Social Accountability Standards (SA 8000).
●
●
Supplier Code of Conduct pertaining to fundamental human rights (e.g., labor, freedom of association) 
is governed through provision (Compliance with Labor Regulations) in tender document. Further, 
Contractor is also required to comply all requirements of Social Accountability Standards (SA8000) and 
comply all requirements of Integrity Pact executed for respective tender.
	
Considering the nature of procurement for large & complex technical transmission projects having stringent 
timelines for operation of the power system smoothly, each procurement under the respective project in 
POWERGRID is critical in nature. Therefore, each supplier undergoes various levels of scrutiny for capacity & 
capability analysis such as package-wise qualifying requirement, pre-defined events etc.
	
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
The above information outlines a defined procedure for sustainable sourcing, including supplier codes of 
conduct for environmental standards, child labor, and fundamental human rights. Contractors are required 
to comply with these codes, as well as with specific standards such as SA8000 and the Integrity Pact. 
Procurement for large and complex projects undergoes rigorous scrutiny to assess capacity and capability. 
It demonstrates that POWERGRID has comprehensive framework in place to ensure that sustainable sourcing 
practices are followed.
3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the

Description
1.
Background and 
purpose of the 
practice/
intervention
Considering the catastrophic impacts climate change can impose on human 
society, demands for urgent action on climate change grew even louder. Every 
section of society including consumers businesses and governments recognized 
the need to accelerate global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
POWERGRID shares this sense of urgency and is committed to play its part in 
the global transition by facilitating more and more clean energy. DG sets are a 
well-known source of both Air and Noise pollution, especially in Rural Areas. The 
CO2 emission of a diesel generator is between  2.4-2.8 kg CO2/L  depending on 
the characteristics of both the engine and the fuel. The average specific fuel 
consumption of a diesel generator is 0.33 L/kWh, so the CO2 emission generated 
by a diesel generator is estimated to be 0.8-0.93 kg CO2/kWh.
2.
Technology/ 
Product/ Process / 
Practice details
POWERGRID has taken proactive measures towards Sustainability to mitigate 
the environmental impacts of use of DG sets. POWERGRID undertook a major 
& pioneering initiative to purposefully utilize induction power in earth wire for 
powering of telecom equipment. Under this, a technological arrangement of 
various modern equipment was placed on Transmission towers to tap the 
inductive power (acquired due to induction from conductors) present in earth 
wires of transmission lines for powering of telecom equipment. This will eliminate 
the use of DG sets, a constant source of pollution and GHGs emission. This initiative 
has already been approved by the regulator and is ready for implementation at 
a wider level. This initiative will also eliminate the location disadvantage of small 
towns towards accessibility and affordability of high-speed internet.
S.L.
Title
Description
3.
Implementing 
organizations
This innovative technology of reduction of future CO2 emanating from use of 
DG sets is a complete in-house initiative guided by our long-term Sustainability 
Goals as a result of collective efforts and outstanding teamwork of professionals 
from Telecom, Engineering, Environment & Social management department and 
Technology Development departments under the guidance of top Management 
of POWERGRID.
4.
Current status
This new technical initiative has been successfully implemented and mobile 
connectivity was demonstrated. The connectivity was improved at nearby sites 
without any interference. Currently, this initiative is planned to be implemented at 
various remote locations having low availability of power supply, with plan in place 
to suitably expand it in future.
5.
GHG emission 
reduction
- Achieved/ 
projected
As discussed earlier, this technological innovation eliminates the use of polluting 
and GHG emitting DG sets for powering of telecom antennas. By doing so, it 
reduces the future GHG emission of around 40-50 t CO2/year at each location. 
6.
Financial details
At each location, installation of this technological innovation is estimated to 
cost around Rs 19-20 lakhs. The model is self-sustainable through replacement /
eliminating the requirement of new telecom towers along with DG sets.
7.
Advantages and 
challenges
Advantages accrued as a result of the intervention:
Saving of future GHG emission to the tune of 40-50 t CO2/year/location.
Significant saving for telecom service providers in terms of capital and operational 
cost of DG sets including the cost of manpower.
Better rapport with stakeholders including Regulatory agencies, Policy makers and 
funding agencies.
Challenges faced:
Addressing technological roadblocks through focused R&D approach.
Bringing team members from different departments on the same footing through 
proper co-ordination and handholding.
Getting approval from the Regulator for commercial application.
Future challenge is convincing the telecom service providers about the usefulness 
of the technology in the form of win-win situation it creates for all stakeholders 
both in terms of economic as well as environmental benefits.
8.
Scalability 
This technological innovation is scalable and after getting approval from the 
Regulator, POWERGRID has developed a proper business plan to ensure its future 
expansion on a much wider scale, in consultation with state utilities and telecom 
service providers.
Assuming the application of this innovation at 1000 locations, total saving on future 
CO2 emission to the tune of around 40,000-50,000 t CO2/year is easily achievable.

Provide information on the project(s) for which ongoing Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) is being 
undertaken by your entity:   
	
During the reporting period, POWERGRID reiterated its commitment to responsible land acquisition practices. 
Whether it be securing government-owned land for its substations or voluntarily engaging in direct land 
purchases on a “Willing Buyer Willing Seller” basis at fair market or negotiated rates, the company ensures 
that all land acquisitions are carried out with utmost transparency and mutual consent. It is important to note 
that there have been no instances of involuntary land acquisition, thereby eliminating the presence of Project 
Affected Persons (PAP) or Project Displaced Persons (PDP). Consequently, the need for extensive Resettlement 
and Rehabilitation (R&R) activities has not arisen.
	
However, POWERGRID’s dedication to social progress extends beyond land acquisition. Through its robust 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, the company proactively supports the broader community. 
These initiatives focus on uplifting the well-being and prosperity of the local communities, promoting 
sustainable development, and fostering positive social impact. By engaging in meaningful and impactful 
CSR endeavors, POWERGRID contributes to the holistic growth and welfare of the communities it operates in, 
establishing itself as a catalyst for positive change.
	
In summary, POWERGRID’s land acquisition practices demonstrate its unwavering commitment to ethical 
and voluntary approaches. While ensuring the absence of involuntary displacement, the company extends 
its support to the community at large through impactful CSR initiatives, solidifying their role as a responsible 
corporate citizen dedicated to creating a sustainable and inclusive future.

and precise manner. This also includes the company’s principles, commitments, expectations from citizens, 
integrated management policy, services offered, values and standards of services, access to information, 
and grievance redressal.
	
To further smoothen the relationship with community, we have developed an effective Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM) to resolve any grievance of community/public. The GRM has two tiers, the first being 
Project/Substation level Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) and the second being the Corporate Level GRC 
chaired by the Director (Projects) of the company. All written and verbal complaints received by Project level 
GRC are to be resolved within 20 days of receipt of complaint. If the complainant is not satisfied with the 
outcome of the project level GRC, he/she can approach the Corporate Level GRC, which in turn, has to resolve 
the complaint/grievance within 45 days. Notice regarding Corporate Level GRC is publicly available and can 
be accessed at:
