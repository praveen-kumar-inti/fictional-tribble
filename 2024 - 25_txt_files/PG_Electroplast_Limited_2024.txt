Risk
As a manufacturer in the 
electroplast sector, PGEL’s 
operations are energy-
intensive and contribute to 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Increasingly frequent extreme 
weather events could disrupt 
production schedules, damage 
facilities, and impact resource 
availability, particularly water 
and energy supply. Regulatory 
and stakeholder pressures 
further necessitate proactive 
climate action.
PGEL is adopting 
cleaner production 
technologies, 
increasing energy 
efficiency, and 
exploring renewable 
energy integration.
Negative: Potential 
operational 
disruptions and 
compliance costs if 
unmanaged; Positive: 
enhanced resilience,

systems in high-dust 
areas. Real-time air 
quality monitoring is 
implemented across 
sites, and preventive 
maintenance ensures

systems in critical 
areas. Employees 
are provided with 
PPE, and regular 
workplace air quality 
monitoring ensures

with energy-efficient 
alternatives, installs 
LED lighting, and 
explores renewable 
energy procurement.
Positive: Reduced 
costs, improved 
sustainability 
performance, 
potential eligibility 
for incentives.
Water 
Management
Risk

to statutory violations and 
community concerns.
PGEL manufacturing 
sites has Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) units, 
recycling treated 
water for gardening, 
cooling, and cleaning. 
Rainwater harvesting 
and regular water 
quality monitoring 
are in place.
Negative : High 
capital and O&M 
costs for water 
systems; Positive 
:compliance, 
reduced freshwater 
dependency.
Solid Waste 
Management
Risk / Opportunity
Production processes 
generate plastic scrap and 
packaging waste, which 
if unmanaged can cause 
environmental pollution and 
regulatory issues.
PGEL segregates 
waste at source, 
recycles plastic 
scrap into usable 
material, and engages 
authorized recyclers.
Positive :Reduced 
disposal costs, 
potential revenue 
from recyclables; 
Negative: penalties 
and environmental 
damage if 
unmanaged.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
As a B2B organization, PG Group does not directly engage in the reclamation of end-of-life products from individual end-
users. However, recognizing its extended responsibility toward environmental sustainability and circular economy goals, the 
Company has established formal partnerships with authorized waste handlers and Producer Responsibility Organizations 
(PROs) to manage the recovery, recycling, and safe disposal of various types of waste generated during manufacturing 
operations. These include plastics (including packaging materials), e-waste, and hazardous waste.
	
Through these partnerships, PG Group ensures that the collection and disposal processes are carried out in compliance 
with applicable environmental regulations and industry best practices. The PROs and waste management partners are 
selected based on their certifications, operational capabilities, and adherence to environmental and safety norms. They are 
responsible for collecting waste materials as per the collection targets defined under applicable laws and extended producer 
responsibility (EPR) frameworks.
	
In the case of plastic waste, especially packaging material generated during inward and outward logistics, PG Group 
works with certified recyclers to ensure that plastic is appropriately segregated, stored, and sent for recycling or energy 
recovery. Similarly, for e-waste generated during manufacturing processes-such as damaged electrical components or 
discarded electronic equipment-the Company engages with authorized e-waste recyclers who follow environmentally sound 
dismantling and disposal methods. For hazardous waste such as used oils, solvents, chemical containers, or contaminated 
materials, the Company follows a stringent hazardous waste management protocol, ensuring that such waste is handled, 
stored, and transported securely to approved treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs).
	
By collaborating with expert agencies and following a responsible waste management approach, PG Group ensures that its 
environmental footprint is minimized, legal compliance is maintained, and sustainability commitments are honored, even 
beyond the immediate scope of product usage
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If 
not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to PG Group’s operations, particularly in relation to plastic 
packaging, e-waste, and other regulated waste streams generated during manufacturing. The Company is in the process of 
implementing a structured EPR waste collection and management plan, which is being aligned with the guidelines issued by 
the Central and State Pollution Control Boards. This plan outlines roles, responsibilities, and processes for the collection, 
segregation, and recycling of waste generated from the Company's activities, including packaging materials, obsolete 
equipment, and other industrial waste.
	
PG Group’s waste management strategy is designed to go beyond mere compliance and integrate broader sustainability 
goals. At the core of the strategy is the principle of waste minimization at the source, followed by recovery, recycling, and 
responsible disposal. The Company actively partners with certified waste handlers, recyclers, and Producer Responsibility 
Organizations (PROs) to ensure that collection targets are met, and all relevant data and documentation are maintained for 
regulatory audits. This helps ensure transparency and traceability across the waste management value chain.
	
Moreover, PG Group continuously monitors developments in environmental regulations and amends its processes 
accordingly. The Company regularly conducts internal reviews and compliance checks to assess the effectiveness of its 
waste management systems and to drive improvements. Awareness programs and employee engagement initiatives further 
reinforce responsible behavior towards waste handling within the organization.

No Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) have been conducted by the entity for any of its products.
	
In line with its ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, PG Group has initiated Life Cycle 
Assessments (LCA) for selected Room Air Conditioning (RAC) products. These assessments are currently underway and 
are designed to comprehensively evaluate the environmental impact of these products across their entire lifecycle-from 
raw material extraction, manufacturing, and distribution to usage and end-of-life disposal. The objective is to gain detailed 
insights into the environmental footprint associated with each stage of the product’s life, thereby identifying key areas 
where improvements can be made to reduce emissions, conserve resources, and promote circularity.
	
This initiative reflects PG Group’s proactive approach toward embedding sustainability into product development and 
decision-making processes. By leveraging the LCA methodology, the Company aims to not only ensure regulatory compliance 
but also strengthen its contribution to global climate goals and sustainable consumption practices. The assessments are 
being conducted in collaboration with technical experts and aligned with internationally recognized standards.
	
PG Group remains actively engaged in the evaluation process and is focused on integrating the findings into its sustainability 
roadmap. The Company anticipates sharing the outcomes and actionable insights derived from the LCA studies in the next 
financial year, demonstrating transparency and continued progress towards greener, more responsible products

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The PG Group has actively implemented projects to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions as part of its broader commitment 
to environmental sustainability and climate responsibility.
	
One of the key initiatives in this regard is the transition to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles for logistics and material 
movement operations. By replacing conventional diesel and petrol powered vehicles with CNG-powered alternatives, the 
Group has significantly lowered direct (Scope 1) CO₂ emissions and other harmful pollutants. CNG, being a cleaner-burning 
fuel, offers measurable reductions in carbon intensity while also delivering long-term operational benefits such as reduced 
fuel costs and lower vehicle maintenance requirements. This shift aligns with national vehicular pollution control objectives 
and supports broader climate change mitigation targets.
	
Another major initiative is the installation of solar power systems to offset electricity consumption from fossil fuel-based 
grid sources. The renewable energy generated directly contributes to reducing indirect (Scope 2) emissions, lowering the 
Group’s overall carbon footprint.
	
In addition to fleet decarbonization and renewable energy adoption, the Group regularly monitors its energy consumption 
and carbon footprint across all units and processes. Future phases of the GHG reduction strategy include:
 
 
Expanding renewable energy capacity.
 
 
Optimizing energy efficiency in manufacturing operations.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
The PG Group is committed to responsible waste management practices across all its manufacturing and operational facilities. 
In alignment with environmental compliance requirements and sustainability objectives, the company has implemented 
systematic processes for handling both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.
	
Hazardous waste generated at the Company’s plants primarily consists of used oil and other lubricants arising from production 
and maintenance activities. This waste is collected in designated storage areas with proper labeling and safety measures, as 
per the guidelines prescribed by the Pollution Control Boards. The hazardous waste is then handed over to government-
authorized handlers and recyclers who are licensed for environmentally sound disposal. This ensures complete traceability 
and compliance with the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. Regular 
audits, record-keeping, and submission of returns to statutory authorities further strengthen the Company’s adherence to 
legal frameworks.
	
In addition to hazardous waste, the Company also manages a significant amount of non-hazardous waste, which is primarily 
generated from day-to-day office operations and production-related packaging activities. This waste mainly includes 
paper, cardboard, plastic wrapping, thermocol, and miscellaneous disposables. To enhance waste segregation efficiency, 
30
PG Electroplast Limited
clearly marked bins and collection zones are placed across factory and office premises. Employees are sensitized and 
encouraged to follow the correct segregation process at source, ensuring that recyclable and non-recyclable materials are 
handled appropriately.
	
All recyclable non-hazardous waste is regularly sent to certified and approved waste management vendors for processing, 
recycling, or reuse, in accordance with environmental best practices. These efforts not only reduce landfill contribution 
but also support the principles of circular economy and resource optimization. Waste metrics are monitored to evaluate 
reduction trends and efficiency improvements.
11.	 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, 
biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where environmental approvals

the Factories Act, 1948. The plan is aimed at managing emergencies and minimizing the risks associated with major accidents, 
natural calamities, equipment failures, and external threats that could adversely impact human life, property, environment, 
and business operations.
	
The plan includes a structured On-site Emergency Plan (OSEP), supported by detailed disaster control measures and mock 
drill provisions conducted at least once a year. It classifies emergencies into three levels based on severity, ranging from on-
site incidents manageable with internal resources (Level-1), to off-site emergencies involving external agencies and district 
authorities (Level-3). Risk assessments, hazard identification, and failure scenario analyses are integral to the plan.
	
The entity has designated key emergency personnel such as the Chief Emergency Controller and Chief Incident Controller, and 
established an Emergency Control Centre equipped with essential resources including communication systems, firefighting 
tools, emergency lighting, and protective gear. Assembly points, evacuation protocols, personnel accountability mechanisms, 
and first aid stations are in place to ensure employee safety and continuity of operations.
	
To address business continuity, the plan includes measures to accelerate the resumption of normal operations post-incident, 
minimize damage to equipment and facilities, safeguard surrounding communities, and mobilize both internal and external 
resources. Communication protocols cover internal alerts, outreach to authorities, and notifications to neighboring firms and 
the general public. The entity also maintains a Transport Emergency (TREM) Card system for hazardous material handling and 
has provisioned lightning arresters for natural calamity preparedness.
	
Employees are trained to respond through R-A-C-E (Rescue, Alarm, Confine, Evacuate) procedures during fire incidents and 
are expected to maintain discipline during emergencies. Regular training, drills, and periodic plan revisions are conducted to 
ensure preparedness.
