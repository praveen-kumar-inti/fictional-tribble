Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or negative

1
Energy 
Efficiency 
& Water 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Proactively identifying 
the risks associated 
with energy and water 
management, paired with 
policies to reduce their 
consumption is a critical part 
of the Company’s pathway 
towards sustainability. Lack 
of energy conservation 
and waste management 
measures will lead to 
increased cost, reduced 
resource efficiencies and 
potentially regulatory/
compliance related costs.
Opportunity- Explicit plans 
to combat the risks can 
improve the Company’s 
resource productivity, reduce 
the costs and can foster 
competitiveness
At Pearl Global, 
we believe in long-
term preservation 
of resources. The 
Company’s commitment 
towards environment 
management is reflected 
through its various 
sustainability initiatives 
and certifications. The 
Company complies 
with Global Recycled 
Standard (GRS). 
The Company has 
a framework that 
helps anticipate and 
meet environment 
performance 
expectations, ensure 
regulatory compliance, 
minimise environmental 
risks and establish 
long-term environmental 
strategies. The Company 
has ETP/WTP/STP 
systems for water 
treatment solutions 
and a Central Water 
Monitoring unit. It has 
also incorporated an 
environmental impact 
measurement software 
to measure ways to 
reduce and adopt 
innovative eco-friendly 
ways to save water and 
energy.  
Positive- The Company’s 
emphasis on reducing the 
environmental impact not 
only glides through the 
decarbonisation journey 
but also gains credibility 
amongst stakeholders and 
lowers the cost borne by 
the Company in the longer-
term. The Company’s focus 
on strengthening climate 
and ESG-specific initiatives 
bolsters long-term value-
creation and enables the 
Company to effectively 
respond to rising stakeholder 
demands. 
Negative: Lack of robust 
initiatives and action plans to 
contribute to ESG awareness 
and climate change could 
adversely impact ESG profile 
of the Company. It could also 
adversely impact company’s 
sustainable growth and 
expansion into new markets, 
eventually leading to loss of 
market share to better aligned 
ESG companies

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk-  Well-structured 
and efficient supply chain 
management mitigates 
the risks associated with 
procurement, production, 
strikes and labour disputes 
as well as costs which could 
have a negative impact on 
the business activities.
Opportunities- With 
a transparent and 
unambiguous value chain 
engagement, the Company 
can optimise efforts, create 
a circular economy and 
enhance profitability. This 
results in the Company 
delivering products at a 
faster-turnaround time 
leading to an increased 
wallet share of customers. 
Efficacious supply chain 
management leads to better 
collaboration, improved 
quality control, improved 
risk mitigation, eco-friendly 
initiatives and a transparent 
product procurement
Pearl Global’s focus 
is always on offering 
end-to-end supply 
chain solutions to 
their partners while 
maintaining design, 
technology, innovation, 
sustainability, and 
quality at the forefront. 
The Company complies 
with Organic Content 
Standards (OCS) which 
verifies the organic 
content of products in 
every step of the value 
chain and ensures that 
the organic content in the 
product can be traced 
back to the source. 
The Company is also 
certified under Global 
Organic Textile Standards 
(GOTS) & OekoTex which 
is recognised as the 
world’s leading standard 
of textile production in 
organic fibers. These 
certifications set out 
high-level environmental 
criteria and ensures that 
the product is processed 
sustainability.
Positive- Efficient supply 
chain management ensures 
that the Company delivers 
maximum business value 
with the least possible cost. 
This in turn results from 
reduced environmental impact 
and long-term value to the 
Company’s sustainability-led 
endeavours. 
Negative- A mismanaged 
supply chain leads to 
ineffective utilisation of 
resources, hampers natural 
procurement of materials 
and elimination of waste 
throughout the product 
lifecycle.
3
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Risk- The risks involves 
hazards caused in the 
working environment in the 
form of non-compliance 
with safety measures by 
employees, non-awareness 
of a safe and secure 
environment and non-
compliance of COVID-19 
safety measures leading to 
injuries, accidents, illness 
and fatalities. These risks 
lead to interruptions in 
workplace operations and 
higher attrition rate.
Pearl Global values 
each individual as an 
important part of the 
organisation and is 
committed to high 
standards of safety 
and protection. Each 
employee is responsible 
to follow the respective 
Company’s safety and 
security procedures, as 
well as applicable local 
laws and regulations 
at all times. The 
Company owns and 
operates facilities with 
the necessary permits, 
approvals, and controls 
that are designed to 
protect health, safety, 
and the environment. 
All other Ecosystem 
Participants are expected 
to commit to at least, 
similar levels of health 
and safety protection.
Negative- Weak mechanisms 
to promote health and safety 
in the workplace lead to 
higher absenteeism, employee 
turnover rates impacting 
the overall productivity. The 
reputation of the Company 
is hampered and leads to 
loss of confidence amongst 
stakeholders. It could also lead 
to losses due to legal actions 
and claims affecting the top-
line of the organisation.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- The Company can 
be exposed to product 
risk losses associated 
with non-compliance of 
product quality with the 
requirements or standards. 
It directly impacts customer 
satisfaction and the risk 
of continued partnership 
thereby affecting the top-line 
growth of the Company.
Opportunities- Product 
quality and safety 
determines the success 
of the Company and its 
reputation in the customer 
markets. It earns customer 
loyalty, helps establish brand 
recognition and manages 
the costs. High product 
quality produces higher 
return on investments, 
higher productivity directly 
proportional to higher 
consumer demand. 
The Company’s 
commitment towards 
providing high-
quality products is 
reflected through 
their internationally 
recognised certifications- 
Standard 100 by OEKA-
TEX, Organic Content 
Standard (OCS) and 
Global Organic Textile 
Standards (GOTS). They 
have quality systems 
and practices aligned 
closely with customer’s 
expectations and are 
in constant touch with 
customer representatives 
to facilitate process 
improvements. The 
Company has dedicated 
customer-certified pearl 
associates to certify the 
products on their behalf.
Positive- Higher product 
quality ensures higher 
customer satisfaction 
and stronger customer 
relationship. The Company 
should maintain direct 
relationships with all the 
customers and continuous 
monitoring of the 
developments in customer’s 
market
Negative- Poor product quality 
and safety can have several 
consequences such as losing 
customers, lower productivity 
and increased costs. Increased 
product recalls leads to 
liable legal actions and 
affects the goodwill of the 
Company thereby impacting 
the organisation’s revenue 
generation.
5
Employee 
Engagement & 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Employee development 
programs and provision for 
employee benefits could 
be considered as incurred 
expenses to the Company. 
Opportunities- Structured 
employee development 
and engagement programs 
accelerate the work 
satisfaction of the Company 
thereby enhancing the 
performance and company’s 
topline. An enhanced 
collaboration amongst 
the team members lead 
to better communication, 
trust, talent pipeline, share 
understanding of company’s 
goals and priorities and 
improved employee 
retention. An empowered 
and organised workforce is 
more stable, predictable and 
productive which reduces 
resource shocks and 
generates productivity gains.
The Company’s forward-
thinking and employee-
centric human resource 
department is devoted to 
provide effective policies, 
procedures, people-
friendly guidelines and 
support governance 
within the organisation. 
They ensure capability 
building at all levels 
with programmes, such 
as iLEAD [Leadership 
Development 
Programme], 
SEED [Operational 
Development 
Programme], innovate 
with technology 
with our Human 
Resource Management 
System, Pay for 
Performance [Achieve: 
Pearl’s Performance 
Management System]. 
Thereby, building a 
PearlONE culture, with 
employee engagement 
being centric of all our 
HR initiatives. 
Positive- A strong workforce 
with higher engagement, 
retention rate and diversity 
in the workforce brings new 
perspectives, experiences, and 
ideas which enable innovation, 
enhances the performance 
and enables a positive culture 
in the organisation, and 
highlights the Company’s 
efforts toward creating a 
conducive work environment.
Negative-  The inability to meet 
workforce expectations may 
result in adverse impacts on 
workforce productivity, morale 
and the Company’s growth 
plan in a long run.

Business 
Ethics
Risk  
Risk- Compromising ethical 
standards would highly 
impact the reputation and 
integrity of the organisation. 
There is an increased risk of 
decreased productivity and 
business revenue growth 
due to the tarnished image 
of the organisation. The 
investors could negatively 
respond to the firm’s 
unethical behaviour and 
could thereby influence their 
willingness to invest further. 
This could indirectly lead to 
lower performance levels of 
the employees, increased 
turnover and a challenging 
employee recruitment.
Effective policies and 
mechanisms needs to 
be in place to promote 
a culture of integrity 
and conduct as well as 
address the evolving 
risks and challenges. 
Company has adopted 
a conflict of interest 
policy, a code of business 
conduct setting out the 
Company’s requirements 
and process to report 
and deal with non-
compliance. The policy is 
expected to be adhered 
by all the stakeholders.
Negative- Unethical behaviour 
could directly impact the 
reputation of the Company. 
It could also lead to loss 
of morale and employee 
productivity thereby affecting 
the top-line growth of the 
organisation. 
7
Regulatory 
& Legal 
Compliances
Risk  
Risk- Risk of non-
compliance exposes 
the organisation to legal 
penalties and financial 
losses resulting from failure 
to comply with the industry 
laws and regulations. 
Failure to adhere to the 
laws would directly affect 
the Company’s revenue, 
valuations and could lead 
to loss of reputation and 
business opportunities. 
More compliant companies 
tend to have improved 
performances and better 
process efficiency. 
Compliance gives assurance 
and provides a broader 
insight to the investors.
The Company appoints 
an industrial engineer, 
whose role is to ensure 
compliance with industry 
norms and monitor 
production processes 
in line with the set 
guidelines. The Company 
has a robust internal 
control and compliance 
system with onboarding 
of customers only after 
ensuring complete 
compliance standard. 
The Company has an 
internal control system 
that has accurate 
recording of transactions 
with internal checks
 and prompt reporting 
through SAP. The 
Company has adequate 
systems of internal 
controls to
ensure that transactions 
are properly recorded, 
authorised and reported 
apart from safeguarding 
Pearl Global’s assets.
Negative- Non-compliance 
would lead to loss of 
reputation and consequently 
affect the business activities.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity 
	
At Pearl Global, we identify our stakeholders through a stakeholder mapping exercise that is conducted periodically. Our 
early engagement policy provides a valuable opportunity to influence stakeholders’ perception and helps create long term 
relationships that can enhance performance. We prioritise our stakeholders based on their level of importance to our 
business operations. We categorise them according the nexus to the stage of operations along with the impact and risks 
incurred to the stakeholders. Pearl Global has conducted its materiality assessment for the first time this financial year. 
The materiality assessment was based on a survey conducted with a diverse set of internal and external stakeholders. 
The valuable responses received from stakeholders played a crucial role in identifying the key material issues that are 
pertinent to the Company. This allows us to further address the matters and develop our business sustainably.
