Principle 2: Product lifecycle sustainability 
BHEL is contributing to a greener environment through 
development of environment friendly technologies and 
improvement in efficiency of equipment. Continuous 
improvement in power cycle efficiency and reduced 
emissions from coal based power plants have been achieved 
over the time by evolution of technology from sub-critical 
to supercritical. Attributes of BHEL supplied power plant 
equipment such as lower auxiliary power consumption, 
higher plant efficiency, lower design heat rate and higher 
operating availability help in attaining lower life cycle cost.
BHEL provides comprehensive solutions for reducing 
emissions through supply and commissioning of Flue-
gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems, Selective Catalytic 
Reduction 
(SCR) 
systems, 
Solar 
Photovoltaic 
plants, 
Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP). BHEL has developed fully 
indigenous Pressurized Fluidized Bed Gasification (PFBG) 
technology for generating syngas from high ash Indian Coal. 
The syngas further acts as a feed for production of industrial 
chemicals. There is also conscious effort towards reduction 
of embodied carbon in products. Company has opted to 
replace polluting fuels with cleaner ones, e.g., gas is now 
used as a source of heat energy (instead of coal earlier) during 
production of products like ceralin, and has also converted 
furnaces to RLNG from LPG at its manufacturing plants.

b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?  
Yes, BHEL has implemented e-procurement/ GeM 
as business improvement and sustainable business 
practice. Also supplier registration is done in online 
mode only. BHEL sources varied input material and 
component from several of its value chain partners 
which are certified and compliant with standards 
such as ISO 14001, ISO 45001 etc.
100% of our inputs are sourced sustainably.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your 
products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste 
(c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.  
	
BHEL products fall under capital goods category where 
product life goes beyond 25 years in majority of cases. 
The market requirement is for extension of the life of 
products or systems through process of refurbishments. 
After end of desired life of capital goods, they become 
unfit for reuse and hence being disposed as scrap by 
owner of the capital good products.

Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total 
material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
Company’s manufacturing processes generate fair 
amount of metal scrap, however engineering measures 
are taken to minimize waste generation. The scrap 
subsequently undergoes recycling within the company 
and is reused. For example, Central Foundry Forge 
Plant (CFFP) in Haridwar manufactures Steel Forgings 
and Castings for which steel scrap is a major raw 
material. Reusable material is also used in packaging 
manufactured goods. Where possible, goods are 
supplied in specifically designed crates to project sites, 
where the crate material is reused during construction.
The value of such recycled/reused items is not being 
captured at the moment.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life 
of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused, recycled, 
and safely disposed, as per the following format: 
BHEL’s business is B2B in nature and products/ systems 
we supply fall under capital goods category with long 
lifecycle (25 years and beyond). All the associated 
packaging material for supplies become the property 
of our customers that spread across the country and 
abroad. In this given situation, it is not feasible to reclaim 
the product (end of life) or packaging material from the 
customer.
5.	
Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as 
percentage of products sold) for each product category.
As explained in point 4 (previous point).
Principle 3: Employees’ well-being
BHEL has been a frontrunner in the area of human resource 
management. The guiding principle for company’s Human 
Resource Management policy is to ensure availability of 
competent, motivated and effectively contributing human 
resources and to facilitate achievement of their full potential 
at all times to realize organizational goals. Company has 
documented HRM policies and rules in the form of a 
‘Personnel Manual’ to ensure transparency and uniformity 
of implementation for regulating employment relationship, 
career growth/ development and employees’ emoluments/ 
benefits, healthcare and well-being. These policies are 
further complemented by a grievance redressal mechanism 
through two schemes – one for workers and other for 
staff & officers. A grievance for the purpose of the scheme 
means a grievance relating to any individual employee arising 
out of the implementation of Company policies/rules or 
Management Decisions. Both these schemes provide for 
three-tier resolution. Defined timelines are laid down for 
resolution of grievance at each stage. Besides, an appellate 
mechanism is also provided under the scheme, in the case 
of grievance redressal scheme for staff & officers which an 
aggrieved employee can approach in case he/she is not 
satisfied with the resolution of the grievance.
BHEL has a Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) policy which 
underlies the commitment of the organization to provide 
safe and healthy work environment to all its employees as 
well as other stakeholders giving due consideration for 
the safeguard of environment. The policy conforms to the 
requirements of ISO 14001 & ISO 45001 management system 
certification standards and can be accessed through the 
link 
https://www.bhel.com/sites/default/files/HSEPOLICY.
pdf. HSE cells at all units/ divisions implement this policy 
and Corporate HSE department provides strategic guidance 
related to HSE matters at organization level. The HSE policy is 
prominently displayed at all workplaces to create awareness 
amongst the employees and other stakeholders about the 
same and is also translated into local language. Periodic 
audits by internal as well as external agencies are carried 
out to ensure the effectiveness of ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 
management systems implemented at workplaces which

Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
In our manufacturing activity, reduction of waste generation 
is taken as a very important activity and our nesting plan for 
cutting of metal sheet is made in such a way to take care 
of this aspect. However, once the scrap is generated, it is 
either used in the local foundry shop for making castings/ 
forgings or sent to CFFP Haridwar / authorized recycler for 
melting into the furnace for avoidance of new raw material 
consumption.
Across BHEL, solid wastes/ scrap having resale value 
were collected, segregated, stored and sold to authorized 
recyclers. Some of it not having any resale value is used for 
filling up low lying areas. Hazardous wastes/ e-waste are 
disposed of as per the stipulations in the relevant statutes.
The hazardous waste generated at units are disposed as 
per the regulatory requirement and necessary records for 
scrutiny of authority is duly maintained. Hazardous waste 
which can be used outside is sent to authorized recyclers. 
Rest of the hazardous waste which is to be incinerated or 
buried in secured landfill is sent to Treatment Storage and 
Disposal Facility (TSDF) of their respective states for ultimate 
disposal of such hazardous wastes.

Plants / Divisions. MSEs represent approx. 30% of the supplier 
base of BHEL. As mandated in the Public Procurement Policy 
for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Amendment Order, 
2018 (issued by the Ministry of MSME, Government of India), 
more than 25% of BHEL’s total procurement has been made 
from MSEs in the past few years. 
During FY 2022-23, total procurement of goods and services 
from MSEs stand at 32.6%, from SC/ ST MSEs at 0.06% and 
from women owned MSEs at 0.41%. Together SC/ ST MSEs 
and women MSEs constitute less than 2% of total registered 
suppliers. The low procurement shares of SC/ ST MSEs and 
women MSEs are due to the fact that participations of these 
type of entities in BHEL tenders are low and moreover such 
supplier entities many times do not declare their category 
status in the tenders/ MSE Certificate despite provision being 
available in the Udyam Registration Certificate.
Further, BHEL has on-boarded itself on the Trade Receivables 
Discounting System (TReDS) platform to support MSEs. 
Programs are in place to encourage MSE suppliers to use 
TReDS platform wherein they can avail early payments by 
discounting their bills. During FY 2022-23, the acceptance/ 
rejection of invoices of Goods & Services by BHEL through 
TReDS was at 100%.
During the last two years, BHEL has enhanced its procurement 
through Government e-Marketplace (GeM). During FY 2022-
23, 58.94% of company’s goods and services have been 
procured through GeM.
