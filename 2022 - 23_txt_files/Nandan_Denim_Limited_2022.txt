S. No. Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether  risk 
Or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale
for identifying
the risk /
opportunity
In case of
risk, approach
to adapt or 
mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Chemical
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Shifting consumer preference 
towards safe & sustainable 
products. Additionally, the 
regulatory environment is 
getting more stringent on 
the sustainability aspects of 
chemicals and its associated 
impacts.
Opportunity:
To become a globally preferred 
denim brand in manufacturing 
safe, sustainable products 
while adhering to all regulatory 
compliances
We are engaged 
with our vendors 
and suppliers for 
the elimination 
of hazardous 
chemicals and 
to implement 
safer sustainable 
products
Positive:
Reputational benefit 
resulting in increased 
demand for goods. 
Increased revenue due 
to better competitive 
position to reflect 
shifting consumer 
preferences.
Negative:
Reduced revenue from 
decreased demand of 
goods
2
People
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Reputational risk if we fail to 
ensure fair labour practices, 
protection of human rights, 
health and safety of our 
employee & workers.
Opportunity:
By addressing the above 
risks, we are securing our 
social license to operate and 
representing ourselves
We have identified 
potential hazards 
and associated 
risks across 
our facility and 
integrating them 
into SOPs. We have 
adopted various 
social compliance 
certifications like 
GOTS, Better 
Cotton, Oeko Tex 
Standard 100 in 
operating sites.
Positive:
While ensuring our 
people’s prosperity in 
consideration, we seek 
to improve employee 
satisfaction, better 
retention and lowering 
cost of management.
Negative:
Reduced revenue due 
to negative impact on 
workforce.
3
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
While energy contributes 
to the growth of textile and 
apparel industry, resulting 
emissions are a dampener 
for environmental health. 
Increasing demand of textile 
and apparels in the world, 
followed by increased 
production is the cause of 
higher GHG emissions.
Opportunity:
Improving upon the energy 
efficiency and increasing 
renewable usage will support 
us in cutting down the energy 
expenses and achievement of 
pertinent emission reduction 
commitments.
We have 
implemented 2 
MW Wind Mill 
Power Project for 
captive electricity 
consumption and 
under process for 
installation of solar 
rooftop system in 
the coming years.
Positive:
Wind Mill Project 
installation for captive 
consumption shall 
result in reduction 
in energy cost and 
reduction in fuel 
consumption
Negative:
Due to increase in price 
of fuel and energy, 
the cost of production 
increases

4
Innovation
Opportunity
Investing in innovation and 
technology to accelerate the 
journey ahead across product 
development, manufacturing, 
supply chain, waste 
management and consumer 
engagement
NA
Positive :
Partnering with 
innovative summit, 
product innovation, 
digital transformation, 
Sewage Treatment 
plant.
5
Cotton
Risk
Cotton is our main raw material 
and being an agricultural 
product it is dependent 
on weather/ environment. 
Inadequate rain results in 
lower production of cotton 
and in turn result high price of 
cotton
Preparation of 
advance strategic 
plan for purchase of 
cotton to mitigate 
any shortage in raw 
material.
Negative
Increase in cost of raw 
materials which in turn 
results in increase in 
product cost.
6
Natural fiber
Opportunity
Due to increasing green 
revolution and environment 
sustainability, the use of 
natural fiber is increasing due 
to increase in demand by 
customers.
NA
Positive Implications
Increase in revenue 
due to increase in 
demand of sustainable 
products
7
Water
Risk
Water is one of the essential 
requirement for our operation 
and due to its scarcity, efficient 
management of water is highly 
essential for our operations
We reuse and 
recycle water by 
establishing an 
Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP) and a 
Reverse Osmosis 
Plant (RO) within 
our facility. We also 
treat wastewater 
with our Sewage 
Treatment Plant 
(STP) and reuse the 
treated water for 
gardening. In order 
to utilise backwash 
water, we have also 
installed a pipeline 
from the power 
plant to the fabric 
division
Positive Implications
Increase in cost 
to adopt new 
technologies but in 
the long run it will 
result in controlling our 
operational expenses
8
Climate 
Change
Risk
Due to inadequate climate 
conditions and unseasonal 
rain, the production of cotton 
and other essential raw 
materials are effected which 
results in scarcity of available 
raw materials
The company 
prepares a strategic 
plan for mitigating 
the risk in line with 
production
Negative implication
Non Availability of raw 
materials at reasonable 
price, which results in 
sourcing of materials at 
higher price.
