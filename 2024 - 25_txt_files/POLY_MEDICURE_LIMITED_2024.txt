damage, legal 
actions, loss of 
certifications, or 
disruption to

Therefore, 
governance and 
ethics are both 
strategic enablers 
and material risks 
for the business. 
We implement a 
robust 
governance 
framework 
supported by a 
well-defined Code 
of Conduct 
applicable to 
employees, 
suppliers, 
distributors, and 
other third 
parties. 
Mandatory 
training, internal 
audits, 
whistleblower 
mechanisms, and 
compliance 
monitoring help in 
early detection 
and prevention of 
misconduct. 
Regular policy 
updates and 
board-level 
oversight ensure 
accountability. 
Engagement with 
stakeholders and 
third-party due 
diligence further 
support ethical 
operations across 
the value chain. 
Positive: Strong 
governance 
enhances brand 
reputation, 
ensures 
compliance with 
domestic and 
international

increases investor 
and customer 
trust, leading to 
long-term financial

Environmental 
Impact 
Risk 
We must continue 
our 
environmental 
management 
efforts to 
maximize positive 
impacts and 
reduce negative 
effects by 
minimizing waste 
generation, 
reducing water 
consumption, 
ensuring proper 
disposal, and 
improving energy 
efficiency. Failure 
to manage these 
aspects effectively 
may lead to non-
compliance, 
reputational 
harm, and 
restricted access 
to certain 
markets. 
We consistently 
seek opportunities 
to reduce adverse 
environmental 
impacts from our 
operations. Our 
initiatives include 
adopting 
technology to 
minimize plastic 
waste, offering 
PVC-free products, 
reusing materials, 
utilizing 
renewable energy 
sources, 
implementing 
digital solutions, 
and complying 
with waste 
disposal 
regulations. 
Additionally, we 
closely monitor 
energy 
consumption to 
enhance efficiency 
and lower our 
carbon footprint. 
Negative: Failing 
to address 
increasing 
environmental 
expectations could 
impact access to 
capital markets, 
result in regulatory 
penalties, and 
damage the

Water & Effluent 
Management 
Risk 
Water availability 
could become a 
concern. As a 
responsible 
corporation, we 
must map and 
manage our water 
usage across 
operations, 
ensuring 
consumption is 
socially equitable 
and 
environmentally 
sustainable. 
Failure to 
effectively 
manage water 
risks can disrupt 
operations and 
cause 
environmental 
harm. 
We have 
implemented 
measures to 
reduce and 
conserve water 
across our 
manufacturing 
plants. 
Wastewater 
treatment and 
recycling systems 
have been 
established to 
decrease 
freshwater 
consumption, and 
rainwater

Treated 
wastewater is 
used for HVAC

Question E8 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.  
Yes, we have entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) tied to a 9.9 MWp solar power plant, which will 
supply a significant share of our electricity requirements from renewable sources. This initiative is projected to 
reduce our Scope 2 emissions by approximately 28%, advancing our efforts toward meeting the 2030 climate 
goals. In parallel, we have expanded our rooftop solar capacity to further minimize dependence on conventional 
energy. To reduce Scope 1 emissions, we have deployed dual-fuel generator systems and introduced CNG-
powered vehicles, with a gradual transition planned toward green mobility solutions. Additionally, the adoption of 
digital energy management tools has contributed to the avoidance of around 120 tCO₂e by enhancing energy 
efficiency and optimizing consumption. We remain focused on identifying and implementing similar renewable 
energy opportunities across our other operational sites.

We provide comprehensive information of our products through our official website: 
https://www.polymedicure.com. The website serves as a central platform for stakeholders to access detailed 
product descriptions, technical specifications, certifications, company updates, and investor-related information. 
The website features dedicated sections for various product categories, allowing users to explore offerings in 
specific therapeutic areas. 
 
Question L2 
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services. 
We have implemented multiple measures to inform and educate consumers, healthcare professionals, and other 
stakeholders about proper product usage, handling, and safety precautions. Each product is accompanied by 
detailed labelling and packaging information, in compliance with applicable national and international regulatory 
standards. This includes clear instructions for use (IFUs), warnings, contraindications, and safety guidelines. These 
are printed in user-friendly formats. 
A key initiative in this regard is the organization of Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) programs/events, which 
are conducted in collaboration with hospitals, and healthcare institutions. These sessions are designed to train 
nursing staff and paramedics on correct product application, safety precautions, and maintenance procedures for 
various medical devices. 
 
Question L3 
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services. 
We have established proactive mechanisms to ensure transparent communication with customers in the event of 
any potential disruption or discontinuation of essential products. We recognize the critical nature of our medical 
devices in patient care and therefore prioritizes timely and responsible stakeholder engagement. In cases where 
temporary discontinuation or changes to a product are being considered—such as material modifications or 
Poly Medicure Limited 
62 
BRSR FY 2024-2025 
regulatory updates—we initiate a structured consultation process with customers. This includes seeking customer 
feedback through questionnaires and direct communication through mails and conversations, enabling the 
company to understand user requirements and evaluate the impact of the proposed change. Once customer 
input is gathered, we provide a formal prior intimation, typically 1 to 1.5 months in advance, through official email 
communication and feedback forms. This advance notice ensures that customers have adequate time to prepare 
for the transition and make any necessary adjustments in their procurement or clinical workflows. We continue to 
refine these mechanisms to align with best practices and stakeholder expectations. 
 
Question L4 
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to 
consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of 
the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)  
Yes, we provide product information in compliance with local regulatory requirements, including labeling details 
such as product name, manufacturing information, batch number, expiry date, and relevant regulatory marks. In 
addition, we include supplementary information to support the safe and effective use of our products, such as 
usage guidelines, storage instructions, safety warnings, and clear illustrative symbols. These measures reflect our 
commitment to quality, safety, and transparency, ensuring healthcare professionals have the information they 
need for proper product use. 
 
Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services 
of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No) 
Yes, we regularly conduct customer satisfaction surveys to assess feedback on our key products and services 
across major operational regions. These surveys are distributed through email and feedback forms, primarily to 
healthcare professionals, institutional clients, and distribution partners. The insights gathered help us understand 
user experiences, identify areas for improvement, and inform product development or modifications. This 
approach ensures that we remain responsive to customer needs and aligned with their expectations
