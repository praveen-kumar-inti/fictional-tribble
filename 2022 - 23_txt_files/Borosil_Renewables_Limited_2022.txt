coming from exports and through domestic 
reputed customers. There is zero tolerance 
for human rights violations expected in 
these export markets and for the domestic 
customers as well. Having a robust human 
rights management process ensures that 
there is limited impact on our supply chain 
from human rights issues. This will result in 
better brand building and better positioning 
of the company in the markets.

One of our key objectives is to increase the share of renewable energy in our total power consumption. In FY 2022-23, 
we successfully invested in 10MW of solar energy, and ongoing evaluations are being conducted to further enhance this 
share. However, due to regulatory challenges at the state level, a complete shift of total power consumption to renewable 
energy sources is not currently possible.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace
 
To ensure a safe and healthy workplace, the Company implements the following measures:
 
1. 
Elimination of potential hazards
 
 
The Company maintains a hazard-free workplace by adhering to OSHA standards and regulations. Digital signage 
systems are employed to remind employees about proper body mechanics, forklift safety, PPE requirements, and ways 
to prevent slips, trips, and falls. Employees are encouraged to identify and report safety issues, and prompt action is 
taken to resolve them.
124
Annual Report 2022 - 2023
BOROSIL RENEWABLES LIMITED
 
2. 
Comprehensive Training:
 
 
The Company ensures that all employees receive safety training in a language they understand. New employees undergo 
initial safety training, and refresher courses are provided to existing employees or when job roles change. Electronic 
message boards are utilized to reinforce safety training with concise messages.
 
3. 
Proper Equipment Provision:
 
 
The Company ensures that employees have access to safe tools and equipment and also ensures their proper 
maintenance. Workplace digital signage is used to promote injury prevention and employees are educated on the safe 
handling of hazardous materials, lock-out tag-out procedures, and machine guarding.
 
4. 
Visual safety Aids and Messages:
 
 
The workplace employs color codes, posters, labels, and signs to alert employees about potential hazards. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) posters are displayed throughout the workplace, and digital 
signage broadcasts important safety information and updates. Employers can display their safety recordable using 
automated counters. This visual aide displays real-time data and reminds employees to prioritize safety.

matters. Regular departmental or company-wide safety meetings are also held to solicit employee feedback, enhancing

6. 
Incorporating Fun into Safety:
 
 
While safety is taken seriously, the Company tries to engage employees by making safety learning enjoyable. By adding 
an element of fun, employees are more likely to stay engaged, retain safety information, and actively contribute to 
accident prevention.
 
7. 
Periodic Health and Safety (H&S) Audits
