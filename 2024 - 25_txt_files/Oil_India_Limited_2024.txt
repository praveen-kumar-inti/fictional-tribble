Statement by director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets, 
and 
achievements 
I am pleased to present the latest edition of OIL’s Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR), developed in alignment with SEBI’s disclosure 
framework. This report reflects not only our ongoing progress in embedding ESG 
principles across our operations but also reaffirms our commitment to national 
energy priorities and sustainable value creation. 
 
OIL is committed to becoming a net-zero company by 2040, aligning with 
India’s climate goals and the global shift toward sustainable energy. This goal is 
central to our strategy and reflects our deep commitment to responsible energy 
leadership. 
 
We have already made significant strides in reducing our carbon footprint. In FY 
2024–25, OIL lowered its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 12.55%, with the 
emissions reducing to 1.268 million metric tonnes of CO₂ equivalent 
(MMTCO₂e), down from 1.45 MMTCO₂e in FY 2023–24. This has resulted in a 
reduction in emission intensity per unit of production, with our emission 
intensity reducing from 0.222 (MMTCO2e/MMToE) in FY 2023-24 to 0.189 
(MMTCO2e/MMToE). This reduction underscores our determination to drive 
tangible change and lead in decarbonization. 
 
Our enhanced sustainability performance was also reflected in our external 
ratings. In 2024–25, OIL recorded a significant improvement in its CDP Climate 
Rating, as well as an upward revision in its S&P Global ESG rating, reaffirming 
investor and stakeholder confidence in our climate strategy, transparency, and 
ESG practices. 
 
To further accelerate our transition, OIL has initiated the incorporation of a 
wholly owned subsidiary focused on alternate and clean energy. This entity 
will anchor our investments—targeting ₹20,000 crore by 2040—across key low-
carbon areas, including: 
• 
Renewable energy 
• 
Green hydrogen 
• 
Biofuels such as bioethanol and compressed biogas (CBG) 
• 
Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCS/CCUS) 
• 
Geothermal energy 
 
As part of our broader environmental commitment, OIL has also entered into 
 
20 
strategic partnerships with OGDC (Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter) and 
IBBI (India Business & Biodiversity Initiative). These collaborations aim to 
accelerate the development and adoption of sustainable technologies, 
promote 
cross-border 
knowledge 
exchange, 
and 
scale 
impactful 
environmental solutions across our operations. 
 
These initiatives are guided by our Vision & Strategy 2040, developed in 
consultation with global experts. This roadmap outlines OIL’s transformation 
into an Integrated Energy Company capable of thriving in a diversified, low-
carbon energy future. 
 
At the core of this transformation is a belief that sustainable growth must be 
inclusive, innovation-led, and focused on long-term value creation. OIL will 
continue investing in clean technologies, partnerships, and operational 
excellence to serve India’s evolving energy needs while staying true to our 
values of governance, ethics, and national responsibility.

risk management, further strengthening safety outcomes. 
OIL’s dedicated HSE policy is built on the principle of continual improvement, aligning with best practices in 
occupational health, safety, and environmental stewardship 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
Oil India Limited has instituted a robust and multi-layered framework for the routine and non-routine identification of 
work-related hazards and risk assessment, as an integral part of its Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) 
Management System. These processes are designed to uphold a safe and healthy workplace, ensuring risks are 
minimized. The processes that are set in place are as follows: 
Hazard Identification & Risk assessment: Comprehensive methodologies such as HAZOP (Hazard and Operability 
Studies) and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) are periodically conducted at operational installations. 
Appropriate hazard/risk control measures are put in place for bring the risk to a  ALARP (As Low As Reasonably 
Practicable) level. Findings from these studies guide the implementation of control measures to address identified 
risks effectively. 
a) Job Safety Analysis (JSA): JSAs are routinely performed to evaluate task-specific risks and establish control 
protocols prior to job execution. 
b) Incident Reporting and Investigation: A structured system is in place for documenting and investigating 
incidents, near misses, and accidents. These investigations aim to uncover root causes and inform 
preventive strategies. 
 
37 
c) Health and Safety Committees: Regularly convened HSE committee meetings chaired at the apex level by 
the Chairman and Managing Director facilitate cross-level collaboration in identifying hazards, assessing 
risks and proposing mitigation strategies. 
d) Work Permits: For non-routine or high-risk operations, a formal work permit system is enforced, including 
mandatory pre-task risk assessments and safety protocols. These permits ensure that appropriate safety 
procedures are followed before and during the task. 
e) Training and Awareness: Continuous training and awareness initiatives are delivered to empower 
employees to recognize, assess, and report workplace hazards. This helps to foster a proactive safety culture 
within the organization. 
f) 
Review of HSE Data: Incident records, trend reports, and other safety metrics are routinely analyzed to 
identify recurring risks and emerging hazards. 
g) Regulatory Compliance: OIL ensures adherence to relevant health and safety regulations and guidelines 
issued by statutory bodies including Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD), Directorate General of Mines 
Safety (DGMS), State Factory Inspectorates, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), and 
Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO), contributing to enhanced process safety and 
compliance integrity. 
h) Safe Operating Procedures (SOPs): OIL has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical 
operations, safety practices, emergency response, and asset integrity management. These SOPs serve as 
structured guidelines to ensure consistent, safe, and efficient execution of operational activities across all 
locations. 
i) 
Policy: In the spirit of upholding strict standards and not tolerating any violations related to operational 
integrity and HSE practices, OIL has published a Zero Tolerance Policy for its employees. This policy clearly 
defines unacceptable behaviors and empowers the organization to take prompt and decisive action in the 
event of any lapses, thereby reinforcing a culture of safety, accountability, and operational discipline. 
j) 
Loss Control Tours: Loss Control Tours have been initiated and integrated into a digital application to enable 
prompt reporting, tracking, and resolution of safety observations. 
Additionally, the company conducts mock drills (Level I, II, and III) at regular intervals to test emergency response 
readiness. Disaster and emergency response plans such as DMP, ERDMP, and CDMP are in place. 
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N) 
Yes, Oil India Limited has established a structured mechanism that enables employees to report work-related 
hazards promptly and without fear of reprisal. All reported incidents are assessed based on their severity, and 
appropriate enquiries or investigations are conducted to identify root causes and implement corrective and 
preventive measures. 
In addition, the organization has instituted a Stop Work Policy, which empowers employees at all levels to 
immediately halt operations if they encounter imminent hazards or unsafe working conditions.

Yes. Oil India Limited has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system across its operational areas through the 
deployment of Produced Water Re-Injection (PWRI) systems and centralized Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), including 
modular units at remote sites. Treated water is re-injected into disposal wells after meeting MINAS standards. Plans are 
underway to establish a desalination unit to convert high-salinity water into reusable process water. Through these 
targeted interventions, OIL is embedding circular water use into its operations and setting a higher benchmark for 
environmental stewardship in the energy sector

were reported less than 6, it is considered 6 for computing average figure. Similarly, VOC & HAP values reported ‘<4.2’ respectively reflects the 
minimum detection threshold of the monitoring instrument. 
50 While calculating the monthly average for the year, data from a few installations was unavailable due to contract transition, installation 
maintenance/closure, or occasional equipment breakdowns or calibration requirements; hence, the average is based on available data 
51 For FY 2023-24, Air emission data for February–March 2024 could not be recorded due to expiry of the contract, and annual figures were 
derived from monthly averages for April 2023–January 2024.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such waste. 
Oil India Limited (OIL) has instituted a structured and environmentally responsible waste management system to ensure 
the safe handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste across its operations: 
Hazardous Waste 
 
59 
• 
Oily Sludge: Sludge generated from tank bottoms at installations is processed at OIL’s installations in FHQ, 
Duliajan, where recoverable crude is extracted and redirected to collection stations. The residual waste is 
treated through in-situ and ex-situ bioremediation in collaboration with authorized environmental agencies. 
Emergency spill scenarios are also addressed using the same bioremediation protocols. 
• 
Spent Oil: Used lubricants from operational facilities are systematically collected and transferred to 
authorized recyclers for either reuse or co-processing, ensuring no environmental discharge. 
• 
Chemical sludge from wastewater treatment: In wastewater treatment facility, By-products from effluent 
treatment units are securely contained in HDPE-lined pits, effectively preventing soil contamination and 
leaching. 
• 
Oil soaked cotton rag: Contaminated rags and absorbents are either incinerated or subjected to 
bioremediation based on contamination level and regulatory norms. 
Non-Hazardous Waste 
• 
Drill Cuttings: Drill cuttings, solid materials removed from the wellbore generated during drilling operations are 
thoroughly cleaned and stored in HDPE lined pits. Under Project Bhuvan Mitra, OIL has introduced a Vertical 
Cutting Dryer (VCD) that uses centrifugal force to recover drilling fluid from cuttings, eliminating wastewater 
generation and allowing for reuse of fluids within operations. 
• 
E-Waste: Spent batteries are routed through registered recyclers, ensuring safe disposal and materials 
recovery. 
• 
Battery: Spent batteries are routed through registered recyclers, ensuring safe disposal and materials recovery. 
• 
Bio-Medical Waste: Medical waste from healthcare facilities is incinerated using a double-chamber system in 
compliance with State Pollution Control Board standards. 
• 
Other Scrap: Miscellaneous scrap ranging from metals to plastics and wood is disposed of via a formal 
arrangement with MSTC, promoting transparency and sustainability in scrap handling.

Gas Blending 
System 
 As a step toward sustainable drilling operations by 
introducing Dynamic Gas Blending (DGB) kits across 
select drilling rigs. The DGB technology represents an 
innovative retrofit solution that allows diesel engines, 
specifically 1,000 RPM Caterpillar engines, to operate 
on a flexible blend of diesel and natural gas, with the 
system capable of substituting up to 70% of the diesel 
requirement with natural gas. 
In FY2024-25, DGB-equipped rigs 
achieved notable cost savings—
over ₹24.6 million—by reducing 
diesel 
consumption, 
lowering 
greenhouse gas emissions, and 
maintaining engine power. This 
initiative 
improves 
both 
operational efficiency and OIL’s 
sustainability profile 
5 
Diesel 
Oxidation 
Catalyst 
(DOC) 
Initiative 
OIL implemented Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOCs) 
across drilling rigs to control particulate emissions 
from powerpack engines. The DOC system uses a 
catalytic reaction to reduce carbon monoxide, 
hydrocarbons, and the soluble organic fraction of 
particulate matter in exhaust gases, thus lowering air 
pollution. The initiative started with the successful 
installation and testing of DOC units on Rig S#7, with 
emission parameters recorded before and after 
installation to validate effectiveness. The DOCs 
demonstrated significant improvements in emission 
reductions, 
supporting 
compliance 
with 
environmental regulations and contributing to 
cleaner operations and workplace safety

OIL has established a grievance redressal mechanism to address concerns and complaints from community 
stakeholders in a transparent, responsive, and equitable manner. Key features of the mechanism are: 
• 
Community members can register grievances by approaching the nearest OIL installation, where their 
complaint is formally recorded and forwarded to the designated grievance cell for review and resolution. 
• 
The grievance cell engages directly with the complainant onsite, understands the issue and takes appropriate 
remedial action. Every effort is made to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the complainant. 
• 
In instances where resolution at the site level is not achieved, the grievance cell may escalate the issue to higher 
authorities within the organization or seek support from the District Administration or a neutral third party, to 
arrive at a mutually agreeable outcome. 
Additionally, stakeholders may choose to approach other relevant departments within the company based on the nature 
of the grievance. Cases of higher complexity or sensitivity may be escalated to OIL’s senior management for intervention 
and final resolution. This mechanism is designed to be timely, impartial, and accessible, reinforcing OIL’s commitment 
to being a responsible corporate citizen that listens to and constructively engages with the communities in which it 
operates.
