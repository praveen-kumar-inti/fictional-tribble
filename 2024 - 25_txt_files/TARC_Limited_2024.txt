Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
At TARC, the Human Resource Department is entrusted with addressing human rights issues, serving as the primary channel 
for related complaints. Employees and stakeholders are encouraged to submit grievances through our HR helpdesk, 
leverage our open-door policy, or engage with designated grievance officers. The HR Head adheres to a consistent and 
transparent approach in investigating and resolving issues, ensuring that all concerns are addressed confidentially, fairly, 
and promptly. Should the HR Head be unable to resolve a grievance, it is escalated to senior management for further 
examination and resolution. Our commitment to upholding human rights is further demonstrated by the presence of a 
legally compliant Internal Committee (IC) for handling POSH cases, alongside offering anonymous reporting options to 
safeguard against retaliation.
Regular training sessions are conducted to enhance employee awareness regarding their rights and the grievance redressal 
procedures, in alignment with our Human Rights Policy and the principles set forth by the International Labor Organization 
(ILO). Through these comprehensive measures, TARC Limited underscores its dedication to maintaining an equitable and

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
The Company has instituted a comprehensive whistle-blower policy exclusively for employees, allowing them to report 
concerns or breaches directly to the Chief Financial Officer/Audit Committee. In instances where an employee discovers 
impropriety or misconduct, a formal complaint can be lodged with the Chief Financial Officer/Audit Committee, which 
promptly initiates an inquiry to gather all pertinent information and evidence to ascertain the facts of the alleged infraction. 
Should the inquiry determine that misconduct has occurred, appropriate action is taken in response to the findings.
	
Preventive Mechanisms Against Retaliation for Complainants
TARC enforces a stringent zero-tolerance policy against any form of discrimination or harassment within the workplace. 
As part of our commitment to the POSH Policy and broader human rights standards, several mechanisms have been 
established to protect complainants:
1.	
Confidential Handling: All complaints are processed with strict confidentiality to safeguard the identity and dignity 
of the complainant.
2.	
No Retaliation Guarantee: We ensure that no employee faces victimization or penalization for filing a complaint or 
partaking in the investigative process.
3.	
Internal Committee (IC): Our legally compliant, gender-neutral Internal Committee is empowered to address 
grievances and oversee the fairness and impartiality of proceedings.
4.	
Policy Awareness: Regular sensitization programs are conducted to inform employees of their rights, the POSH Act, 
and the complaints redressal process, encouraging a safe and informed reporting environment.
5.	
Respect & Dignity Clause: We mandate that all individuals treat others with dignity and respect, preventing any hostile 
or biased conduct toward complainants.
Through these robust measures, TARC endeavors to foster a culture where complainants feel secure, supported, and 
heard, ensuring they can report issues without fear of retaliation. This commitment is integral to our mission to maintain 
a respectful and equitable workplace for all employees.
9.

rights requirements. These agreements are meticulously evaluated to ensure adherence to legal standards and principles 
that uphold human rights, reflecting the Company’s commitment to ethical business practices and social responsibility.

complaints.
TARC remains steadfast in its commitment to providing employees with a safe and positive work environment, where 
they have access to platforms to discuss workplace issues or concerns. No human rights grievances or complaints 
have necessitated the modification or introduction of business processes thus far. However, as part of our unwavering 
commitment to uphold human rights across all levels of our operations, we have proactively enhanced our internal 
processes to align with our updated Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy. Following are the modifications introduced 
in the financial year based on industry best practices:
1.	
Our efforts include strengthening awareness and accessibility by incorporating clearly articulated human 
rights provisions and redressal procedures into employee induction programs, policy handbooks, and internal 
communication channels. This ensures that all employees are well-informed of their rights and the mechanisms 
available to address any concerns.
2.	
Our Code of Conduct has been updated to explicitly emphasize ethical practices regarding individual dignity, equality, 
and respectful workplace behavior, facilitating swift action against any form of human rights violations. Additionally, 
we have launched a dedicated channel for confidential reporting of human rights concerns, designed to ensure 
psychological safety and encourage reporting without fear of retaliation.
3.	
Senior management and directors are now required to affirm adherence to the Code of Conduct annually, reinforcing 
top-down compliance and accountability. Moreover, our policy oversight team regularly reviews the implementation 
of the Human Rights Policy and Code of Conduct, monitoring potential risks or gaps and initiating corrective 
measures as necessary.
These enhancements embody TARC Limited’s core values of Sadhna, Sadachar, and Sraddha, underscoring our dedication 
to creating a respectful, fair, and equitable environment for all stakeholders.

of the business. These audits include third-party evaluations of employment practices and assessments of conformity with 
all relevant labor laws. This rigorous auditing process assists in identifying any risks or issues related to human rights, which 
are then addressed through appropriate remedial measures.
The effectiveness of these measures is closely monitored to ensure continuous improvement and adherence to the 
highest standards of human rights compliance. Through these diligent efforts, TARC Limited demonstrates its unwavering 
commitment to upholding human rights across its operations.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes, TARC has undertaken a series of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability across its 
operations. One of the primary steps includes transitioning to LED lighting at all project sites, corporate offices, and site 
cabins, leading to an approximate 20% reduction in energy consumption. Additionally, HVAC systems have been upgraded 
with high-efficiency VRV/VRF units and energy-rated equipment to further decrease power demand in new developments. 
TARC also conducts bi-annual internal energy audits to pinpoint inefficiencies in lighting, HVAC, and pumping systems, 
subsequently implementing corrective measures.
To optimize operations, the Company has introduced auto-sensor-based lift controls and pressure-controlled pumps, 
particularly in high-rise buildings, which notably lowers idle energy draw. Rooftop solar installations have been piloted 
at flagship sites like TARC Tripundra and TARC Maceo, cutting grid dependency by 10–12%. Furthermore, solar street 
lighting is being incorporated in the master planning of gated communities and commercial landscapes. The feasibility 
of integrating solar water heating systems is also being evaluated for luxury apartment complexes with significant 
hot water needs.
TARC has embraced Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve design accuracy and decrease on-site rework, alongside 
advancing its MEP systems with sensor-based and smart controls for real-time energy management. The use of precast 
and modular construction methods in specific components has expedited execution, minimized labor requirements, and 
reduced material waste. As part of its commitment to sustainable innovation, TARC is exploring smart-enabled green 
buildings and experimenting with low-carbon materials, in collaboration with third-party sustainability experts to meet 
IGBC/GRIHA certification standards.
These initiatives have yielded significant benefits, including a 15–20% reduction in project execution time due to 
technology-led planning, a decrease in material waste by approximately 10%, enhanced customer satisfaction from 
integrated smart controls and automation, and improved compliance with regulatory and green certification norms. 
TARC’s ongoing dedication to innovation in design, energy optimization, and construction efficiency underscores its 
leadership in sustainable development.

The implementation of energy efficiency 
measures has resulted in significant 
energy savings for TARC, achieving 
reductions of approximately 20%. These 
initiatives have not only optimized 
energy consumption but have also 
contributed to reducing idle load energy 
draw, enhancing overall operational 
efficiency. These measures are integral 
to our broader environmental strategy 
and underscore our dedication to 
reducing the carbon footprint of our 
operations.
