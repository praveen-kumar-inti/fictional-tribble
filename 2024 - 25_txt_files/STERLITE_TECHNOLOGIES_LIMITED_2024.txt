7.  Statement by director responsible for the 
     business responsibility report, highlighting 
     ESG related challenges, targets and 
     achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
     regarding the placement of this disclosure)
In view of the major transformations caused by 
recent global difficulties and resulting economic 
fluctuations, there has been a fundamental 
rethinking of society and business strategy 
around the world. During these changing 
socioeconomic landscapes, the importance of 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
concepts has expanded significantly. Talks at 
the political and business levels now inevitably 
include concerns about climate change, 
sustainable development, and other sustainability-
related concerns.
Our ESG objectives include a wide range of 
programs targeted at promoting sustainable 
practices. These include commitments to 
sustainable sourcing and manufacturing, 
GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
achieving net-zero emissions, promoting water 
positively across our worldwide locations, and 
reducing waste to landfills. Furthermore, we 
focus product lifecycle assessments to reduce 
environmental footprints.
To achieve meaningful and long-term change, we 
recognise the necessity of taking action across 
our value chain and in the communities we serve. 
As a result, we collaborate with both upstream 
and downstream partners to reduce packaging 
and waste while also addressing global issues 
such as gender inequity, healthcare disparities, 
and digital education gaps. Furthermore, 
our focus is on developing the world’s digital 
backbone, which demonstrates how we are 
allowing nations to become digital economies in 
the areas where we operate, demonstrating our 
dedication to inclusivity and empowerment.

Yes, our commitment to upholding the highest ethical and business standards across our global operations 
is a cornerstone of our corporate ethos. This commitment, however, relies heavily on the collaboration and 
dedication of our stakeholders and employees.
Every member of our workforce is expected to adhere unwaveringly to our code of business conduct and 
ethics, ensuring that our principles are upheld at every level of our organisation.
To foster a culture of transparency and accountability, we have implemented a robust whistle-blower policy. 
This policy empowers not only our employees but also off-roll employees, workers, and business partners to 
voice concerns regarding any malpractice, impropriety, abuse, or misconduct at an early stage, without fear 
of reprisal or discrimination. Importantly, this policy has been extended to encompass external stakeholders, 
including vendors and customers, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Additionally, the toll-free 
number and email ID that can be used for making a complaint are displayed in all offices.
Moreover, we have established a Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee (PSHC) to oversee and address

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented 
by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the 
coverage such system?
b.	
What are the processes used to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks on 
a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
Yes, our company boasts a meticulously 
structured Quality, Environment, Health 
& Safety (QEHS) management system, 
meticulously implemented and upheld in 
accordance with our established procedures 
and legal mandates. Clear delineation of 
roles and responsibilities within the EHS 
team ensures effective oversight, with 
regular monitoring facilitated through 
comprehensive management reviews.
Furthermore, our unwavering commitment to 
excellence is underscored by the ISO 45001 
and 14001 certifications obtained by all our 
manufacturing facilities. These internationally 
recognized certifications serve as a 
testament to our dedication to ensuring the 
highest standards of occupational health, 
safety, and environmental management 
across our operations.
As an ISO 45001 certified organisation, 
we prioritise the safety and well-being of 
our workforce through comprehensive risk 
assessment and management practices. 
Utilising our internal tool, we systematically 
evaluate risks associated with our processes 
on both routine and non-routine bases, 
ensuring proactive identification and 
mitigation of potential hazards.
Our commitment to maintaining high 
environmental and safety standards is further 
demonstrated through the governance of 
all manufacturing processes by our Quality, 
Environment, Health, and Safety (QEHS) 
policy. Each operational area is meticulously 
monitored through ISO 14001 certified 
Environment Management Systems and 
ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety 
management systems, facilitating the 
continuous improvement of our practices 
and the identification of any gaps.
To ensure that our workforce remains aware 
of potential hazards and risks, we provide 
access to policies such as the Quality, 
Environment, Health, and Safety policy, 
as well as Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) procedures. Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) are readily 
available to guide workers in navigating 
potential risks and preventing injury or ill 
health while on duty.
In the event of work-related incidents, our 
robust accident investigation procedures 
are promptly activated, allowing for 
thorough examination and analysis to 
prevent recurrence. Additionally, our plant 
implementation committees play a crucial 
role in spearheading initiatives such as 
Project Abhay, aimed at fostering cultural 
transformation in our EHS practices and 
continually optimising our safety protocols.
Key processes and SOPs are in place to 
systematically identify work-related hazards 
and assess risks, including:
•	
Identification of occupational safety 
hazards and risks for all activities, 
with mandatory adherence to control 
measures as per procedure. Non-routine 
or hazardous tasks require a Permit to 
Work (PTW) for initiation.
•	
Regular implementation of hazard 
identification and risk assessment for 
both routine and non-routine activities.
•	
Rigorous investigation of work-
related incidents through established 
accident and investigation procedures, 
facilitating continuous improvement and 
preventative action implementation.
Through these structured approaches, 
we remain steadfast in our commitment 
to ensuring the safety and well-being of 
our employees while fostering a culture 
of continuous improvement in our 
environmental and safety practices.

is responsible for quality & unbiased, cross 
functional investigations & horizontal deployment 
of findings across all relevant location.
We also use different tools like, Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), 
Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Pre-
Startup Safety Review (PSSR), Management of 
Change (MOC) to identify risks proactively & 
implement corrective actions to control Risks. 
We also adopt hierarchy of controls by adopting 
Elimination, substitution, Engineering Controls, 
Administrative Controls and Personal Protective 
Equipment’s, respectively.

Yes, all our Indian manufacturing units have achieved 100% Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) certification, 
demonstrating our commitment to environmental sustainability. Our efforts include the installation of Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETP) and Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) plants, along with various in-plant modifications to 
our processes.
Before treatment in the ETP, a comprehensive study of wastewater parameters is conducted, enabling us to 
reduce the load on the plant effectively. This process includes treating wastewater from scrubber processes, 
silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), and softener plants. Through chemical treatments and a three-stage centrifuging 
process in the MEE plant, solid particles and chlorine are removed from the water, allowing for its reuse in 
boiler and scrubber processes.
The implementation of Effluent and Sewage Treatment Plants has facilitated zero liquid discharge at all our 
Indian facilities.
The ZLD certification, conducted by DQS in accordance with Circular Water Management, Compliances, and 
ISO 14021:2016 Environmental labels and declarations, attests to our adherence to globally accepted standards.

S.No
Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, 
may be provided along-with summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Rooftop Solar Power
The installation of a rooftop green solar 
system, along with a new roof sheet and 
skylights, has yielded multiple benefits. 
During daylight hours, the skylights 
provide natural light, reducing the need for 
artificial plant lighting.
This has resulted in the yearly saving 
of 1 lakh units of electricity and cost 
savings of ₹ 6.5 Lakh
2
Cooling Tower 
Optimization
A centralised control system coupled with 
fan driven through temperature sensor 
for cooling towers has yielded impressive 
results.
This approach has led to a yearly 
saving of 2.36 lakh units of electricity 
and a reduction of water evaporation 
losses by a remarkable 86 lakh liters
3
PHE System 
Integration
The integration of a PHE system for 
buffering and sheathing machines has 
resulted in improved efficiency and 
reduced chiller operation.
This innovative approach has led to 
a combined annual saving of 7.8 lakh 
units across the FG and buffering 
sections
4
Ensuring zero liquid/
effluent discharge into 
communities
To ensure Zero liquid discharge, a detailed 
study of parameters has been done on the 
wastewater before its treatment in the ETP 
which has in turn helped reduce the load 
on the plant.
https://www.stl.tech/esg/
Each of our manufacturing units 
in Aurangabad and Silvassa are 
all zero-liquid discharge certified. 
Effluent treatment (ETP) and multi-
effective evaporator (MEE) plants 
installed, in addition to several in-
plant modifications to our processes 
help us ensure this.
5
Ensuring 100% 
manufacturing 
facilities to be Zero 
Waste to Landfill 
certified
We ensure our processes comply with 
stringent waste management rules in 
the countries we operate, we also verify 
the approaches our recyclers adopt. 
This assures us that they are operating 
according to the prescribed laws and our 
by-products or waste are further reused, 
promoting a circular economy.
https://www.stl.tech/esg/
All Indian manufacturing units are 
Zero waste to landfill certified.
