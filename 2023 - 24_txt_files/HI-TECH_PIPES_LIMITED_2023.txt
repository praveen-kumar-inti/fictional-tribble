the “Code of Conduct” for 
Directors and employees. 
This code lays down the

Energy
operations
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Climate change and 
environmental risk 
have recognised 
energy management 
as a critical material 
concern. Climate change 
and environmental 
threats are discussed to 
highlight the Company’s 
ecological awareness and 
commitment to climate 
change mitigation plans.
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive resource 
management plans that 
align with the company’s 
strategy for protecting 
the environment 
will emphasise the 
Company’s commitment 
to enhancing 
environmental 
preservation and its 
contribution to initiatives 
to mitigate climate 
change.
The Company 
concentrates on four 
critical climate change-
related areas: waste 
minimisation, renewable 
energy utilisation, water 
conservation, and energy 
conservation.
Positive Implications:
The Company’s emphasis 
on improving climate 
initiatives bolsters long-
term value creation and 
enables the Company 
to address growing 
stakeholder expectations 
successfully.
3.
Human Rights
Practices
The Company’s 
performance in the 
social realm from the 
perspective of the 
employee workforce and 
the community will be 
impacted by the lack of a 
comprehensive Human 
Rights governance 
structure regarding 
working conditions, 
child/forced labour, fair 
remuneration, gender 
diversity, prevention 
of sexual harassment, 
freedom of association, 
and collective 
bargaining.
The Company respects 
the human rights of all 
relevant stakeholders 
and groups, including 
communities, consumers, 
and marginalised 
communities, both 
within and outside the 
workplace. Human rights 
are recognised and 
protected by all of the 
Company’s operations 
and policies, including 
its interactions with 
vendors, to preserve the 
human rights of all of our 
workers, including their 
freedom of association, 
non-discrimination, 
prohibitions of child 
and forced labour, and 
their right to engage in 
collective bargaining.
Positive: 
The Company’s 
performance in the 
social realm is enhanced 
by its comprehensive 
alignment with the 
guiding principles of 
national and international 
human rights standards, 
which also demonstrates 
its commitment to 
human rights integration 
inside the company’s 
business strategy.

Human Rights
Practices
It integrates a solid 
human rights governance 
framework that considers 
the freedom of association, 
human rights, and due 
diligence across all 
business operations, 
especially suppliers and 
vendors.
Negative: 
The absence of a human 
rights governance 
structure could result in 
employee dissatisfaction, 
impacting the 
workforce’s productivity 
and the company’s long-
term business growth 
plan. The lack of a robust 
redressal mechanism 
may result in non-
compliance issues from 
a relevant regulatory 
perspective.
4.
Board 
Diversity and 
Independence
Opportunity
Opportunity: 
The Company 
acknowledges 
and embraces the 
importance of a diverse 
Board in its success. We 
believe that having a 
truly diverse board will 
help us to maintain our 
competitive advantage 
by leveraging diversity 
in thought, perspective, 
knowledge, ability, 
industry expertise, age, 
ethnicity, and gender.
Ensure a transparent 
nomination process for 
directors with various 
perspectives, experiences, 
expertise, skills, and 
performance excellence.
Positive:
Consistent efforts 
would lead to a positive 
impact due to improved 
productivity, etc.
5.
Water and
Management
Water availability may 
become a concern. 
As a responsible 
Company, it needs to 
map and manage the 
water used across its 
operations and ensure 
that the consumption 
is socially equitable 
and environmentally 
sustainable.
The Company has 
commissioned state-of-
the-art technologies to 
consumption, maximise 
recyclability and minimise 
external discharge.
Dependency on fresh 
water, lack of recyclability, 
and excess discharge 
may impact future 
resource availability and 
the environment.

a comprehensive ‘Corporate Ethics and Code of Conduct.’ This framework encompasses a range of 
critical aspects, including directives to counteract bribery and corruption. Moreover, the Company has
