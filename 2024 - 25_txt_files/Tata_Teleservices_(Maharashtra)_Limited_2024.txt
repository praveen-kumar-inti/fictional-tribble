satisfaction can positively impact revenue, 
brand reputation and market position.
TTML 
gives 
utmost 
importance 
to 
improving 
service 
quality, 
investing 
in customer support, and enhancing 
product offerings based on customer 
feedback. Regular surveys and personalised 
communications 
enable 
enhancing 
the customer engagement and allow

2.
Data security 
and system 
stability
Risk
Data security and system stability are critical 
to TTML for its digital and connectivity 
solution services. Risks include cyber 
threats, data breaches, and system failures 
impacting service continuity. Robust data 
security measures are essential to prevent 
reputational damage, legal issues, and 
loss of customer trust, affecting business 
operations.
TTML actively addresses this risk by 
implementing 
robust 
cybersecurity 
measures, conducting regular system audits, 
and providing continuous staff training, 
utilising encryption, access controls, and 
incident response plans strengthens data 
protection. TTML has partnered with OTON 
(One Tata Operating Network) to improve 
its cybersecurity posture for its IT systems 
and has created a roadmap to refresh 
technology that doesn’t support the latest 
security patches. All Network and IT systems 
have a comprehensive BCP/ DR mechanism 
to ensure high availability across the 
components to provide world class stability.

compliance with regulatory standards

exploitation, 
human 
trafficking, 
or

to legal and reputational consequences. 
Ethical supply chain management and fair 
labour practices are essential for mitigating 
risks and ensuring responsible business 
conduct.
TTML actively mitigates this risk and has 
developed Supplier Code of Conduct 
to guide its decision-making. The code 
guides suppliers conduct in relation to 
ethics, labour and human rights, health 
and safety, environmental protection, and 
management practices. Engaging with 
stakeholders through Supplier Assessment

accountability. Regular audits and corrective 
actions uphold ethical business practices 
and respect for human rights.

opportunity 
to

stakeholder 
trust, attract investors, and demonstrate 
accountability. 
Clear 
and 
accurate 
reporting builds credibility and fosters 
positive relationships with stakeholders. 
Transparency can differentiate TTML as a 
responsible and ethical organisation in the 
telecommunications industry.
TTML capitalises on this opportunity 
by adopting robust reporting practices, 
disclosing key performance indicators, 
and 
engaging 
with 
stakeholders.

informed, promoting trust and long-term 
partnerships.

workforce skills, improve performance, and 
foster employee engagement. Investing 
in training programs boosts employee 
morale and retention. Skilled employees

leverage 
this 
opportunity, 
TTML

training programs, mentorship, and career 
development initiatives. Tailored plans

management
Opportunity

supply 
chain 
management 
represents an opportunity for TTML to 
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and 
minimise risks. Optimising the supply chain 
can lead to improved quality, shorter lead 
times, and better customer satisfaction. 
Sustainable practices in the supply chain 
also contribute to TTML's corporate social 
responsibility objectives.

and implementing sustainable sourcing 
practices.

goals.
Positive
10 Responsible 
marketing
Risk
Responsible marketing is crucial for TTML 
to avoid regulatory scrutiny, consumer 
backlash, 
and 
reputational 
damage. 
Risks include misleading advertising, 
privacy violations, or unethical targeting 
practices. Non-compliance with marketing 
regulations can lead to legal consequences 
and erosion of brand trust. Upholding 
ethical standards in marketing is essential 
for sustainable business practices.
To address this risk, TTML emphasises 
adherence to ethical marketing guidelines,

In FY 25, energy-saving opportunities were identified such as 
Free Cooling Units and Smart Rack Solutions for data centres and 
implemented at select locations as pilot program.
Free Cooling Units significantly reduced energy consumption 
by utilising ambient air for cooling. By reducing the load on air 
conditioning units, it has helped to extend the lifespan of existing 
cooling equipment and minimise the use of refrigerants.
Smart racks help in optimising cooling and power distribution by 
providing real-time data on temperature, humidity, power usage 
etc. by sensors and monitoring tools. These racks are designed 
to maximise space utilisation, allowing for higher density of 
equipment without compromising on accessibility or cooling. As 
smart racks support remote monitoring and management, it is 
useful for distributed data centers for TTML.
TTML relies on data center for smooth 
delivery of its services to its enterprise 
customers. Hence, the reliability and 
efficiency of its IT infrastructure and 
service delivery equipment are of utmost 
importance 
to 
TTML 
for 
customer 
satisfaction.
Free Cooling Units and Smart Rack Solutions 
for data centres have significantly reduced 
energy consumption, cost savings, leading 
to reducing environment footprint.
2.
Renewable 
Energy
Currently TTML does not consume any renewable energy as our 
business operations are spread across locations in decentralised 
manner and at varied scale. With varied RE models available in India, 
we decided to pool in energy demand for energy intensive locations 
and opt for Group Captive Open Access model. TTML is investing in 
renewable energy power plant of 6.7 MW in Maharashtra. 
TTML being digital & connectivity solutions 
provider relies heavily on electricity for 
providing its services. Transitioning to 
renewable energy will not only reduce 
operational cost for TTML but also reduces 
carbon emissions to large extent.
3.
Water 
Conservation
TTML is committed to water conservation to reduce water demand, 
recycle wastewater and focus on rainwater harvesting to reduce our 
water intensity.
In line with Tata Group’s Sustainability Commitment under “Project 
Aalingana”, we’re applying a systemic, circular economy approach 
to reduce resource use in our operations.
Our Corporate Headquarters at Navi Mumbai is now equipped with 
Rooftop Rainwater harvesting, replenishing freshwater back to 
nature.
20 lakh litres of water is being replenished 
annually by the rooftop rainwater harvesting 
installed at Hq.
Our municipal water demand has reduced 
by 33 lakh litres in FY 25 due to multiple 
water conservation measures such as 
installation of sensor taps with aerators, 
reuse & recycling of wastewater, and 
waterless sanitary facilities in our owned 
buildings.
