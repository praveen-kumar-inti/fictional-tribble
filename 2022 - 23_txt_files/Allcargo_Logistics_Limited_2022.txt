Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Supply 
chain 
disruptions 
can 
impede processes and create 
obstacles throughout Allcargo’s 
value 
chain. 
Human 
right 
violations and poor environmental 
performance 
of 
our 
vendors 
can lead to an impaired brand 
reputation are a few of the 
disruptions that can occur which 
subsequently lead to financial 
losses.
Allcargo’s 
Supplier 
Code 
of Conduct establishes its 
stance over issues such as 
human 
rights, 
community 
development, 
business 
ethics 
and 
transparency, 
environmental 
performance, 
and whistle-blowing.
Allcargo has also formulated 
a Sustainable Procurement 
Policy for its suppliers with 
guidance to acquire from 
sustainable and local sources.
Negative 
implications
3.
Community 
Development
Opportunity
Engaging 
in 
community 
development 
is 
imperative 
to 
build long lasting relations with 
our 
associated 
communities, 
given our nation-wide presence. 
Furthermore, 
corporate 
social 
responsibility also providing a 
social license to operate, increase 
in investor interest and improved 
brand value recognition.

Positive 
implications
4.
Energy
Opportunity
Being 
in 
the 
logistics 
sector, 
efficiently managing our energy 
usage is important to ensure 
that our dependency on non-
renewable 
energy 
sources 
is 
reduced and the transition to 
options such as Solar Energy and 
Green fuels is optimized. Although 
adopting better technology to 
reduce our energy consumption 
may incur a significant initial 
investment, 
it 
will 
ensure 
seamless transition to cleaner 
fuels. Additionally, this will reduce 
emissions in the process.
-
Positive 
implications
5.
Energy
Risk
We are largely dependent on our 
business vendors such as shipping 
liners for being able to transition 
towards green energy fuel in our 
operations of ocean freight, air 
freight, and road freight. However, 
the financial implications of the 
same would be limited to the short 
term.
Allcargo 
has 
formulated 
an Environmental Policy to 
monitor its performance on 
reducing GHG emissions over 
a period of time.
Negative 
implications
6.
Emissions
Risk
A prime source of emissions 
for Allcargo is ocean freight, air 
freight, and road freight. Therefore, 
non-management of emissions 
can 
lead 
to 
environmental 
deterioration.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Actively making use of green 
logistics solutions at the company

attracting 
and 
retaining 
customers

numerous customers are aiming 
to make their supply chains more 
sustainable in nature. Redressal 
of

obtaining timely feedbacks can 
work towards improving customer 
loyalty and increase the rate of 
customer retention.

It is imperative to ensure good 
governance 
and 
transparent

reputation, reduce the company’s 
vulnerability to risks and improve

company.
