Corporate Overview  |  Statutory Reports  |  Financial Statements  
26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Material concerns are those that have a direct or indirect impact on a company’s operations and footprint, as well as the company’s 
economic, environmental, and social value. APL Apollo recognizes sustainable development entails not just addressing material 
challenges relating to corporate governance operations and strategy, but also identifying and prioritizing its most important 
challenges based on stakeholder concerns.
	
Therefore, to understand the stakeholder’s perspective, we initially identified the universe of relevant ESG topics pertaining to our 
industry by evaluating different standards and frameworks. Secondly, we carried out detailed stakeholder engagements through 
questionnaires and collected the response from various stakeholder groups. The issues identified are deeply relevant to our ability to 
succeed and are addressed in our stakeholder communications, internal strategic priorities, and corporate responsibility approach. 
During the reporting period, the list of material topics was revalidated through internal stakeholder consultations. The information 
collected from internal and external stakeholders was analyzed and the 15 key material issues were identified and grouped into 4 
major categories:
Responsible Business 
Responsible Operations
Responsible Employment 
Responsibility towards 
communities
Corporate Governance
Energy Management 
Health and Safety 
Local Communities
Market Presence
Water and Effluent 
Management
Labour Relations and Human 
Rights 
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
Economic Performance 
Compliances 
Emissions Management
Training and Education
Waste Management
