1
Product 
innovation, 
safety, and 
quality
Risk
Product innovation, quality, and safety 
issues can significantly impact our 
ability to meet customer demand and 
generate value for stakeholders. Any 
lapses in these areas can lead to 
reputational damage, loss of market 
share, and legal liabilities.
We enforce rigorous testing, 
compliance measures, and 
comprehensive quality manage-
ment systems to proactively 
identify and address potential 
issues. Investing in employee 
training ensures our workforce 
maintains high standards. Our 
proactive measures include be-
ing one of the first in the industry 
to adopt ISO 45001 certification, 
demonstrating our commitment 
to safety and quality manage-
ment. Global accreditation 
further validates our dedication 
to excellence.
Positive: Positive financial 
implications are anticipated as 
we prioritize product innovation 
and quality, aiming for increased 
customer satisfaction and 
revenue growth through value-
added products.
2
Economic 
Value 
Distributed
Opportunity
Economic value distribution is integral 
to our stakeholder strategy, facilitating 
the allocation of financial resources 
towards strategic investments aligned 
with our defined strategic objectives.
NA
Positive. Economic value 
distribution is anticipated to 
enhance market capitalization, 
providing opportunities for 
fundraising to support growth.

3
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
Risk
As regulatory and compliance re-
quirements regarding climate change 
intensify, our business must adapt to 
evolving standards through appropri-
ate investments. However, immediate 
returns on investments in energy 
and emission management are not 
immediately visible, posing financial 
uncertainties.
We prioritize energy-efficient 
processes and emission 
reduction initiatives. Continuous 
investments in managing 
energy and emission that leads 
to improvement in process 
efficiency, which underscores 
our commitment to sustainability.
Negative. Despite the lack 
of immediate ROI visibility, 
we prioritize initiatives for 
energy-efficient processes 
and reducing emissions.  
Investments in energy and 
emission management 
systems and technologies 
impact our financials, which 
we acknowledge as part of 
our strategic approach to 
sustainability and regulatory 
compliance.
4
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Our workforce forms the foundation 
of our operations, necessitating a 
commitment to providing a safe and 
healthy environment. Occupational 
health and safety incidents not only 
pose regulatory and reputational 
risks but also threaten business 
continuity and the well-being of our 
employees. Non-compliance could 
adversely affect operational efficiency 
and compromise our ability to meet 
customer demands.
We prioritize investments 
in assuring safe working 
environment and technology 
while maintaining 
comprehensive safety training 
programs to mitigate risks. 
Additionally, our well-equipped 
Occupational Health Centres 
(OHCs) underscore our 
commitment to employee well-
being and safety.
Positive. Despite the investments 
required in maintaining these 
standards and ensuring a 
safe work environment, with 
safety technology and training, 
employee safety remains 
our paramount concern. 
The financial benefits of 
uninterrupted operations far 
outweigh the associated costs, 
safeguarding both our workforce 
and operational continuity.
5
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Elevating customer satisfaction serves 
as a strategic avenue for driving 
market development, enhancing 
market penetration, and delivering 
superior value propositions to our 
clientele. Furthermore, it plays a 
pivotal role in strengthening the 
reliability of our brand, thereby 
facilitating sustained growth and 
profitability.
NA
Positive. Enhanced customer 
satisfaction translates into 
tangible benefits such as 
increased repeat orders and 
expanded market presence. This 
solidifies our positioning as a 
valued reliable partner, thereby 
yielding favourable financial 
outcomes and contributing to 
sustained business success.
6
Ethics and 
Compliance
Opportunity
Prioritizing ethics and compliance 
within our organization cultivates a 
conducive business environment 
which favours in furthering employee 
loyalty, consequently reducing 
attrition rates and enhancing talent 
attraction efforts. A motivated 
workforce inherently translates into 
heightened productivity and develops 
a cohesive organizational culture. 
Moreover, the emphasis on ethics and 
compliance not only contributes to 
employee morale but also facilitates 
cost savings through increased 
productivity and efficiency gains.
NA
Positive. A steadfast commitment 
to ethics and compliance 
yields tangible benefits such 
as heightened employee 
retention rates and cost savings 
associated with rehiring efforts. 
Additionally, it empowers us to 
surpass performance targets, 
thereby promoting sustainable 
business growth and success.
7
Risk, 
Opportunities 
and Crisis  
Management
Opportunity
Taking a proactive stance on crisis 
management not only enables the 
establishment of resilient systems but 
also positions the organization as a 
forward-thinking entity, staying ahead 
of industry competitors.
NA
Positive. Although the 
establishment of robust Health, 
Safety, and Environment (HSE) 
protocols and employee 
training initiatives require initial 
investments, the resulting 
prevention of avoidable 
operational disruptions 
yields substantial positive 
impacts, ultimately enhancing 
organizational resilience and 
sustainability.

Supply Chain  
Management 
Opportunity
The current global scenario with 
respect to conflicts and instability has 
significantly disrupted supply chain 
systems, presenting an opportune 
moment for us to innovate and 
establish alternative SCM models. 
This strategic move not only positions 
us to navigate uncertainties but 
also allows us to gain a competitive 
edge in the market while optimizing 
production costs.
NA
Positive. Implementing a robust 
supply chain management 
strategy not only enhances 
operational efficiency but also 
provides improved customer 
satisfaction, thereby paving the 
way for sustainable business 
growth and profitability.
9
Employee 
Wellbeing
Opportunity
Prioritizing employee wellbeing 
is essential for the organization’s 
sustainable growth. Despite 
the challenge of immediate ROI 
assessment, investing in employee 
wellbeing not only helps in attracting 
talent but also helps in retention 
and contributes to uplifting overall 
workforce morale.
NA
Positive. While implementing 
and maintaining employee 
wellbeing programs require 
initial investments and ongoing 
costs, the tangible benefits such 
as increased employee loyalty 
and longer average service 
tenure contribute to enhanced 
organizational performance and 
overall business success.
10
Water  
Management 
Risk
Water, a vital yet limited resource, 
poses a significant risk due to its 
scarcity. Our commitment to efficient 
water management involves stringent 
monitoring and conservation efforts, 
including recycling practices. We 
ensure that our plants follow Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism 
for efficient water management and 
conservation.
Despite our efforts to minimize 
water usage in the manufacturing 
processes, the inherent risk lies 
in meeting discharge standards 
and addressing water scarcity 
concerns. To mitigate this risk, 
we prioritize water recycling 
initiatives and incorporate water 
reuse at various stages in our 
production processes.
Negative. While our direct water 
consumption remains relatively 
low, there are associated costs 
and investments required 
to maintain robust water 
management practices. 
11
Waste  
Management
Risk
Despite our diligent efforts to 
minimize solid or hazardous waste 
generation, waste management 
remains a significant risk area within 
our operations.
Our waste management strategy 
primarily focuses on recycling 
and appropriate disposal prac-
tices for solid waste. Addition-
ally, we utilize waste as a raw 
material input in our production 
processes to reduce environ-
mental impact.
Negative. While our direct op-
erations result in minimal waste 
generation, there are associated 
costs and investments required 
to maintain effective waste 
management practices. These 
expenditures, though essential, 
pose financial challenges to our 
operations.
12
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Developing a diverse and inclusive 
workplace culture, free from 
discrimination based on factors 
such as caste, creed, faith, gender, 
or reduced mobility, is paramount 
for organizational success. We are 
committed to cultivating an inclusive 
environment.
NA
Positive. Embracing diversity and 
inclusion not only enhances our 
organizational culture but also 
brings substantial value to our 
operations. This commitment 
to D&I contributes positively to 
employee morale, productivity, 
and overall business success.
13
Respect for 
Human Rights
Risk
Human rights considerations are 
often influenced by external factors 
beyond our direct control, making 
them inherently risky. Dependence 
on external environments and 
stakeholders can pose challenges 
in upholding human rights standards 
within our operations.
To mitigate this risk, we have 
established robust policies and 
procedures that encourages 
and facilitates continuous 
dialogue and collaboration 
among stakeholders to ensure 
a supportive work environment 
throughout the organization. 
Positive. Investing in frameworks 
and guidelines for human rights 
preservation incurs marginal 
costs, however the benefits in 
maintaining are conducive work 
environment and upholding 
ethical standards which far 
outweigh the initial investments.
