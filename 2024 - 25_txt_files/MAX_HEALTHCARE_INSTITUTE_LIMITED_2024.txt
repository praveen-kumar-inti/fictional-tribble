Service Quality, 
Patient Safety 
and Satisfaction
Opportunity
Providing top-tier services 
guarantees 
that 
patients 
benefit 
from 
effective, 
prompt, 
and 
empathetic 
care. Placing a high value 
on patient safety reduces 
potential harm and cultivates 
confidence, while ensuring 
patient 
satisfaction 
leads 
to 
favourable 
patient 
interactions 
and 
stronger 
connections.
_
Positive
2.
Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
The disclosure of confidential 
patient 
data 
can 
result 
in substantial fines, legal 
complications, and a decline 
in stakeholder confidence. 
Security breaches can also 
interrupt operations, leading 
to 
periods 
of 
inactivity 
and 
expensive 
recovery 
processes. 
Furthermore, 
the damage to reputation 
caused by data breaches 
can discourage prospective 
patients 
and 
partners, 
negatively affecting income 
and expansion.
We 
are 
dedicated 
to 
protecting 
sensitive 
data 
through 
carefully 
constructed privacy and 
security frameworks. To this 
end, we have implemented 
a strong Information and 
Cyber Security program, 
built 
upon 
thorough 
policies and standards that 
adhere to leading industry 
practices.

Economic 
Performance
Opportunity
Robust 
economic 
performance indicates sound

enabling 
the 
Company 
to 
allocate 
resources 
towards growth, innovation, 
sustainability 
initiatives, 
expansion into new markets, 
enhanced services, and the 
welfare of its employees. 
Consequently, this fosters 
future growth and reinforces

Business 
Continuity
Risk
The absence of a proactive 
strategy 
to 
manage 
unforeseen 
disruptions 
like 
natural 
disasters, 
cyberattacks, or pandemics 
can lead to considerable 
operational 
interruptions. 
Furthermore, patient safety 
is put at risk if there aren’t 
clear procedures in place to 
maintain essential services.
To 
ensure 
business 
resilience, 
we 
have 
established 
a 
strong 
business 
continuity 
and 
disaster 
management 
plan. This plan is designed 
to 
minimize 
disruptions 
to 
business 
functions 
and 
prioritize 
essential 
operations in the event of 
unforeseen circumstances, 
including 
emergencies, 
cyberattacks, and natural 
disasters.

Access to 
Healthcare
Opportunity
Expanding 
access 
to 
healthcare is a key strategic 
goal for us. By enabling 
more individuals to receive 
preventive 
care, 
timely 
diagnoses, and appropriate 
treatment, 
we 
actively 
contribute 
to 
building 
a 
healthier population and a 
better future.
_
Positive
9.
Anti-Corruption 
and Anti-Bribery
Risk
Unethical actions undermine 
stakeholder trust, harm the 
Company’s reputation, and 
jeopardize 
patient 
well-
being. The procurement of 
substandard 
products 
or 
services 
through 
bribery, 
along with the misuse of 
resources 
intended 
for 
essential care, can result in 
diminished service quality 
and customer attrition.
Our 
Anti-Bribery 
and 
Anti-Corruption 
Policy 
governs our actions and 
reflects 
our 
dedication 
to upholding high ethical 
standards in our business 
dealings. 
Furthermore, 
we 
have 
implemented 
stringent internal controls, 
conduct regular training 
programs, and cultivate a 
culture of accountability 
to proactively prevent any 
instances of bribery or 
corruption.
Negative
10.
ESG Risk 
Management
Risk
The absence of effective 
ESG risk management could 
expose 
us 
to 
resource 
scarcity, 
dissatisfaction 
within 
communities 
and 
our workforce, a shrinking 
customer base, instances of 
non-compliance, operational 
inefficiencies, and a negative 
public perception.
Taking 
a 
proactive 
approach to managing ESG 
risks helps us avoid financial 
setbacks 
resulting 
from 
environmental harm and 
regulatory non-compliance. 
This also strengthens the 
Company’s 
reputation, 
attracting 
stakeholders 
who prioritize sustainability 
and ethical conduct.

4.
Business Ethics 
and Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
A lack of business ethics 
and failure to comply with 
regulations 
can 
result 
in 
monetary 
fines 
and 
penalties, as well as the 
revocation 
of 
licenses 
and certifications, thereby 
limiting the Company’s ability 
to 
operate. 
Furthermore, 
unethical conduct erodes the 
trust of stakeholders, leading 
to a loss of credibility and a 
decline in patient numbers 
and 
partnerships, 
which 
in turn negatively affects 
revenue and growth.
Our dedication to ethical 
conduct 
goes 
beyond 
mere adherence to rules; 
it 
includes 
principles 
of 
fairness, 
integrity, 
and respect in all our 
interactions 
and 
when 
making 
decisions. 
We 
strictly 
follow 
all 
legal 
mandates and regulatory 
requirements. To ensure 
and maintain compliance 
in 
areas 
like 
financial 
reporting, 
data 
privacy, 
environmental regulations, 
and employee safety, we 
have 
rigorous 
internal 
controls and procedures in 
place for monitoring. We 
also conduct regular audits 
and assessments to identify 
any 
shortcomings 
and 
address them promptly.
Negative
5.
Information to 
Customers
Opportunity
Offering 
thorough 
and 
precise 
information 
to 
patients/customers 
is 
of 
utmost importance to us, 
as it enables them to make 
well-informed 
choices 
regarding their health and 
treatment possibilities. Clear 
and open communication 
about services, treatment 
approaches, potential risks, 
and advantages cultivates 
trust and strengthens the 
bond between doctor and 
patient.

Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
For us, energy efficiency is 
critical. It not only lowers 
our operational expenses 
but also introduces us to 
state-of-the-art technologies. 
By optimizing our energy 
consumption, 
we 
can 
significantly decrease our 
electricity costs. Furthermore, 
embracing 
energy-efficient 
practices helps in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
thereby 
supporting 
our 
efforts to mitigate the human-
caused impacts of climate 
change.

Water 
Management
Risk
Ineffective 
water 
management 
can 
cause 
interruptions 
in 
our 
operations and drive up 
expenses. At the same time, 
mishandling water resources 
can 
lead 
to 
sanitation 
problems, 
potentially 
jeopardizing patient safety 
and increasing the likelihood 
of waterborne illnesses.
We have put in place 
several water conservation 
measures 
across 
our 
hospitals. Currently, we treat 
and reuse our wastewater 
for non-drinking purposes 
using advanced Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs). 
Our adoption of Membrane 
Bioreactor 
(MBR) 
technology has significantly 
aided 
us 
in 
effectively 
utilizing 
wastewater 
through recycling.

Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
Opportunity
A 
diverse 
workforce 
introduces 
a 
broader 
spectrum of viewpoints and 
experiences, which cultivates 
creativity, 
innovation, 
and 
more 
effective 
problem-
solving. 
When 
equity 
is 
guaranteed, everyone has 
an 
equal 
opportunity 
to 
thrive, resulting in a more 
motivated and productive 
workforce. Inclusion fosters 
a 
sense 
of 
belonging, 
enabling all employees to 
contribute their best. Over 
the years, our commitment 
to diversity and inclusion is 
clearly demonstrated by the 
significant increase in female 
representation 
within 
our 
workforce.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Ineffective 
waste 
management 
presents 
environmental, 
legal, 
and 
financial dangers. Incorrect 
disposal of waste can cause 
pollution and health risks for 
our personnel, patients, and 
the wider community. Failure 
to comply with regulations or 
adhere to the rules governing 
hazardous and biomedical 
waste 
management 
can 
lead to substantial penalties, 
legal proceedings, and the 
possible revocation of our 
operating permits.
Implementing 
effective 
waste 
management 
practices, guided by the 
3R 
principle 
(Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle), is crucial 
for 
us. 
This 
approach 
benefits the environment 
by lessening pollution and 
conserving 
resources, 
while 
also 
leading 
to 
cost efficiencies through 
streamlined 
operations. 
We carefully segregate and 
label all biomedical waste 
generated in our facilities, 
strictly adhering to the 
regulations established by 
the State Pollution Control 
Boards.
Negative
12.
Response to 
Climate Change
Risk
A failure to address climate 
change 
could 
result 
in 
higher operational expenses 
due to extreme weather 
events, disruptions in supply 
chains, scarcity of essential 
resources, and the alienation 
of 
environmentally 
aware 
investors.
We 
acknowledge 
the 
importance 
of 
tackling 
the negative effects of 
climate 
change 
through 
a 
thorough 
response 
strategy. 
This 
includes 
lowering 
our 
carbon 
footprint, improving energy 
efficiency, and promoting 
a sense of environmental 
responsibility 
among 
our 
employees 
and 
stakeholders. Furthermore, 
transparently 
disclosing 
our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and the proactive 
steps we are taking to 
reduce them demonstrates 
our 
dedication 
to 
environmental stewardship.
Negative
13.
Occupational 
Health &  Safety
Risk
The absence of robust or 
proactive 
occupational 
health and safety protocols 
can create significant risks 
in the workplace. This may 
result in a greater number of 
workplace accidents, injuries, 
and illnesses, consequently 
leading 
to 
increased 
medical and compensation 
expenditures.
Managing 
Occupational 
Health and Safety (OH&S) 
is essential to how the 
Company 
operates. 
We 
place a high priority on 
OH&S to ensure a safer and 
healthier work environment 
for our employees, which in 
turn reduces accidents and 
absenteeism, leading to 
lower healthcare expenses 
and enhanced productivity.

Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
The absence of effective 
supply chain management 
can cause interruptions in 
the availability of essential 
resources 
and 
products 
precisely when they are 
needed. Inefficient supply 
chain operations can lead 
to delays, higher expenses, 
and insufficient stock levels, 
ultimately 
impacting 
the 
Company’s 
capacity 
to 
guarantee the availability of 
critical patient needs.
We prioritize responsible 
sourcing throughout our 
supply chain. Our strategic 
approach 
to 
managing 
the supply chain involves 
integrating 
sophisticated 
analytics, 
robust 
procurement 
methods, 
and flexible logistics to 
guarantee 
the 
timely 
availability 
of 
medical 
supplies, pharmaceuticals, 
and 
advanced 
medical 
equipment. 
Furthermore, 
we have a Supplier Code 
of Conduct that clearly 
outlines 
the 
standards 
expected of our suppliers, 
manufacturers, 
and 
distributors 
to 
ensure 
alignment 
with 
the 
Company’s core values.
Negative
18.
Transparency
Risk
A 
lack 
of 
transparency 
can hide essential details 
regarding 
patient 
care, 
financial 
practices, 
and 
operational 
procedures, 
potentially 
leading 
to 
regulatory 
investigations. 
Furthermore, it can contribute 
to 
unfavorable 
patient 
outcomes if crucial health 
information is not shared or 
managed effectively.
We are deeply committed 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
accountability, integrity, and 
a genuine concern for the 
well-being of our patients. 
This dedication is reflected 
in 
our 
commitment 
to 
providing transparent and 
thorough information about 
the services we offer.
Negative
19.
Human Rights 
and Labour 
Management
Risk
A lack of focus on upholding 
human rights and sound 
labor management practices 
can 
erode 
the 
trust 
of 
patients, 
employees, 
and 
investors. This can lead to 
challenges in attracting and 
retaining skilled employees, 
potential strikes, decreased 
productivity, 
and 
the 
emergence of operational 
inefficiencies.
Upholding human rights 
and ensuring sound labor 
management are essential 
as they promote the well-
being of employees and 
fair labor practices. By 
prioritizing human rights, 
we cultivate a positive 
work 
environment 
and 
boost employee morale, 
which in turn contributes 
to increased productivity. 
Furthermore, 
establishing 
n o n - d i s c r i m i n a t i o n 
mechanisms fosters a fair 
and inclusive workplace. 
This results in a more 
engaged and motivated 
workforce, as individuals 
are 
empowered 
to 
focus on their skills and 
contributions.

Specific commitments, 
goals and targets set by 
the entity with defined 
timelines, if any
Ensuring sustainability is a continuous journey for us. We had finalised the following commitments, goals, and 
targets last year for FY 2024-25 with FY 2015-16 as baseline.
 
 
Implementation of ISO 14001:2015 Standards
 
 
Reducing the environmental footprint by targeting a 60% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions
 
 
Increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, with a goal of reaching 60% utilisation
 
 
Sustainable water management practices are a priority for the Company, aiming to reduce freshwater 
consumption intensity by 45%
 
 
While adhering to regulatory requirements, the Company endeavours to increase efficiency of Research 
and development processes which is good for the patient and for the planet 
 
 
Patient Safety Excellence: “Chasing Zero” patient safety movement to minimize safety incidents to as close to zero.
 
 
Community Outreach: Max Healthcare seeks to positively impact underprivileged individuals through 
various community outreach and health education programmes
 
 
Pursuit of ISO 27001 certification, a recognised standard for information security management systems, 
aimed at strengthening data privacy and security efforts
We recognise that achieving desired sustainability results require continuous efforts, continuous monitoring 
and innovative solutions.
6.
Performance of the 
entity against the 
specific commitments, 
goals, and targets along-
with reasons in case the 
same are not met.
As of FY 2024–25, the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS) standard has been 
implemented across nine hospitals. This excludes the recently acquired facilities in Lucknow and Nagpur, 
as well as the newly commissioned hospital in Dwarka, which became operational toward the end of the 
reporting period.
We recorded an approximate 47% reduction in emissions intensity (kg/OBD) compared to the base year 
FY 2015–16.
Our renewable energy contribution during FY 2024–25 stood at approximately 17%.
Freshwater consumption intensity (per occupied bed day) decreased by nearly 50% against the base year 
FY 2015–16.
We achieved a reduction of around 30% in waste intensity (per occupied bed day) during FY 2024–25 
compared to FY 2023–24, excluding construction and demolition waste.
Continuing our commitment from the previous reporting cycle, we have progressed in estimating Scope 
3 emissions by identifying relevant categories, initiating data mapping exercises, and engaging with key 
internal and external stakeholders. Although Scope 3 disclosures have not been included in this year’s BRSR, 
significant groundwork has been laid for future reporting.
We ensured annual investments in research and development, with 20% of R&D efforts directed toward 
technologies aimed at enhancing environmental and social performance in our products and processes.
We maintained near-zero safety incidents under the Patient Safety Movement, reflecting our strong focus on 
patient well-being.
Annual community outreach, health education programmes, and resource conservation initiatives were 
conducted, directly benefiting over 14,500 individuals through various CSR activities.
We also obtained ISO 27001 certification during the reporting period, further strengthening our information 
security management systems and aligning with global best practices.

offering, authorizing, or promising money or anything of value to any person, including government officials, to improperly influence 
decisions or secure undue advantages for the Company. This policy applies across all levels of our organization, its subsidiaries, and 
associated healthcare service providers within our hospital network. Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy can be accessed

progress; (d) Awareness on emerging 
medical technologies, digital healthcare

In the event of any safety incident, we conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause and implement a comprehensive 
corrective action plan to prevent recurrence and enhance overall workplace safety.

(a)	
Employees (Y/N): Yes
	
(b)	
Workers (Y/N): Yes
	
Response: Yes, we have adopted a comprehensive approach to employee benefits, covering all aspects of our employees’ financial 
and social security needs. For instance, our Group Life and Personal Accident Insurance Policy provides financial support to an 
employee’s family through an assured amount in the unfortunate event of death. All our employees are fully covered under this 
policy. Additionally, we prioritize the well-being and health of our workers by providing them coverage under Employees’ State 
Insurance Corporation (ESIC).
2.	
Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory dues have been deducted and deposited by the value 
chain partners.
	
Response: As per our contractual terms, contractor invoices are processed fully, only upon submission of documentary evidence 
confirming payment of ESI contributions, health insurance premiums, PF contributions, and other applicable statutory payments or 
deposits. In addition, we conduct regular audits to ensure that contractors comply with all statutory obligations and that these dues 
are deposited in a timely manner.
	
	
We adopt a comprehensive and systematic approach to prevent and mitigate significant occupational health and safety risks 
associated with our operations and business relationships. This includes robust Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA) processes, which encourage all employees to identify, assess and report workplace hazards and near-miss incidents 
without fear of retaliation. A formal 48-hour reporting mechanism is used for incident resolution, root cause analysis and 
mitigation planning.  Detailed risk assessments cover a wide range of hazards, including chemical exposures, ergonomic risks, 
physical hazards, psychosocial factors, and environmental impacts. These risks are carefully evaluated based on their severity, 
likelihood, and potential consequences for employees, patients, and other stakeholders. We follow a structured hierarchy of 
controls to manage and minimize risks effectively:
 
 
Elimination: Physically removing the hazard wherever possible.
 
 
Substitution: Replacing hazardous materials or processes with safer alternatives.
 
 
Engineering Controls: Isolating people from hazards through equipment and process modifications.
 
 
Administrative Controls: Changing work practices and procedures to reduce exposure.
 
 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Providing appropriate protective gear to safeguard employees when other controls 
are insufficient.
	
	
In addition, fire safety is an integral part of our safety strategy. We have implemented a proactive, multi-layered fire prevention 
system across all our facilities. This includes comprehensive electrical audits, fire detection and suppression systems, nitrogen 
injection for transformer protection and total fire suppression systems for critical equipment. Regular fire drills, DDMA-led 
mock drills, SOPs for fire response and photo-luminescent evacuation plans ensure preparedness and safety for staff, 
patients and visitors. 
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N) 
	
	
Response: Yes, we have process to report work related hazards and to remove them from such risks. The Staff Health and 
Safety Program is reviewed annually to continually address the occupational health safety risks. Also we have HIRA (Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment) program in the network to address the issues.
	
d. 	
Do the eployees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)

workers beyond their routine occupational needs. These include preventive health check-ups, wellness programs, subsidised 
consultations and diagnostics at Max facilities, mental health and counseling support through the Employee Assistance 
Programme, vaccination drives, and access to digital health platforms. These initiatives are designed to support the overall 
physical and mental well-being of employees and their families, reinforcing a culture of care and holistic health.

employees, communities, regulators, suppliers, and industry associations, to understand their expectations and concerns at 
regular intervals. Effective stakeholder engagement forms the cornerstone of building strong, collaborative, and mutually beneficial

We consider individuals, groups, institutions, or entities that contribute to shaping our business, add value, or constitute a core 
part of our value chain as key stakeholders. These include both internal and external stakeholders, with direct as well as indirect 
influence on our operations. Our process of stakeholder identification and classification is based on their level of interest, impact 
and participation in the company’s operations, including involvement in environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. 
	
By identifying and addressing the needs, interests, and potential concerns of our stakeholders, we are able to mitigate risks, 
uncover new opportunities, foster innovation, enhance collaboration, and build lasting trust. Our stakeholder engagement process 
follows a structured approach comprising the following key steps:
 
 
Identifying Key Stakeholders: We systematically identify stakeholder groups and individuals who have significant influence 
over our operations or are directly impacted by our activities.
 
 
Developing a Communication Strategy: We define tailored engagement approaches for each stakeholder group, considering 
factors such as communication frequency, preferred channels, and the nature of interactions to ensure meaningful dialogue.
 
 
Defining Engagement Objectives: Clear objectives are established for each engagement initiative, such as enhancing 
customer satisfaction, improving employee retention, or strengthening supplier relationships, to drive focused and outcome-
oriented engagement.
 
 
Measuring Effectiveness: We establish specific metrics to assess the effectiveness of our engagement initiatives and track 
progress against these indicators, ensuring transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.

Action Planning: Based on the feedback from the Board and the ESG and Sustainability Committee, we develop and formalize 
an action plan to address the identified material topics and integrate them into our sustainability strategy.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Response: Yes, stakeholder consultation is a critical component of our approach to identifying, managing, and addressing key 
environmental and social topics. The Board-level ESG and Sustainability Committee plays a pivotal role in this process, providing 
strategic oversight and governance to ensure our sustainability initiatives are aligned with stakeholder expectations and global 
best practices. This Committee is entrusted with endorsing our sustainability vision and goals, monitoring progress against defined 
targets, and reviewing compliance with statutory sustainability obligations. Its operations are guided by a formal charter approved 
by the Board, reinforcing its accountability and strategic importance.
	
We actively seek stakeholder inputs on environmental and social issues through a variety of engagement platforms, ensuring that 
diverse perspectives are captured and integrated into our decision-making processes. These insights are regularly reviewed by 
the ESG and Sustainability Committee and inform strategic interventions. For example, stakeholder feedback on reducing our 
environmental footprint has directly contributed to the implementation of energy-efficient practices and the adoption of green 
technologies across our hospital network. Similarly, social concerns raised during consultations have led to the expansion of 
community health programmes and enhancements in patient care services.
	
Materiality assessments play an instrumental role in guiding our stakeholder consultations, helping to identify and prioritize the 
most relevant Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics for both the organization and its stakeholders. The Committee 
is regularly updated on materiality assessment procedures and the key topics identified through this process. This ensures that 
stakeholder engagement remains focused on high-impact and high-relevance issues, enabling stakeholders to provide targeted 
insights and actionable recommendations on the ESG matters that matter most.
	
The insights gained from these consultations are systematically integrated into our policies, management approaches, and 
strategic initiatives. 
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups. 
	
Response: We are committed to making quality healthcare accessible to all, with focus on supporting underprivileged communities. 
As a responsible healthcare provider, we work towards enhancing patient care and improving community health outcomes. In 
alignment with this commitment, Max Healthcare has established a dedicated help desk to assist patients enrolled under the 
government’s Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) programme.
	
We have allocated 160 beds specifically for EWS patients, with daily availability prominently displayed at the Admission Counters 
and regularly updated on the government’s official website to ensure transparency and timely access. In FY 2024–25, we 
extended support to over 1.81 Lakh EWS patients, delivering critical healthcare services, valued at approximately H112 Crore at the 
consolidated level.

The increase in total water consumption in FY 2024–25 is primarily due to the expansion of Max Healthcare’s hospital network. During the reporting period, 
the Company operationalised and integrated three major facilities—Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida (500 beds), Max Hospital, Chitta (200 beds), and Max 
Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka (303 beds). Also, for Nagpur and Lucknow, we are now reporting the complete year’s data. Earlier, only one or two months of 
data was reported, based on the date of acquisition.
*The water consumption data for FY 2024-25 includes data from our hospitals, MAX Lab, Offices, Nursing centre and Med centre
**Water discharge quality from our facilities adheres to regulatory requirements as notified by State Pollution Control Boards. Independent external agencies 
regularly assess the condition of the treated water we release from our facilities. Water flow meters at required locations are also installed in adherence to 
notified norms and guidelines. We are in process of installing sub-meters to report on quantity of water discharged as per BRSR requirements.

Response: Based on applicable regulations pertaining to bio-medical waste management, hazardous waste management, we 
ensure proper on-site storage and work with operators for transportation of waste to certified facilities for recycling or other disposal 
methods. We meticulously categorise and label the biomedical waste produced in our facilities, adhering to the regulations set 
forth by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB). Labelling forms a crucial aspect for correct and safe disposal of each type of 
waste. Our certified waste collection partners ensure biomedical waste is transported and disposed-off with the utmost care and in 
accordance with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules 2016 (BMWR). Mechanisms are in place for periodic inspection of waste 
disposal facilities to ensure compliance with BWMR-2016 norms. 
	
Hazardous waste is sent to the authorised vendor as per Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016 and the 
conditions mentioned in the consent to operate issued by the SPCB.
	
Additionally, we follow the C&D Waste Management Rules 2016 with respect to the responsible handling and disposal of construction 
and demolition waste generated during infrastructure upgrades or facility maintenance. 
	
We have also implemented segregation of solid waste at the source by placing  separate wet and dry bins across our facilities. Wet 
waste is composted in organic waste convertor. Dry waste is disposed through the authorised recycler.  Adequate space is allocated 
within the premises for solid waste management activities including segregation and composting.

Additionally, we offer pre- and post-treatment counselling, where healthcare professionals emphasize the importance of adhering 
to prescribed treatment regimens and the correct use of medical products. We also organize workshops and seminars to educate

Assurance Methodology
We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation 
and calculation methodologies, and a general review of the logic 
of inclusion/omission of relevant information/data in the Reports. 
Our review process included:
 
 
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification 
methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the BRSR Core indicators in the Report and 
non-financial information of the IAR.
 
 
Engagement through discussions with departmental heads, 
external stakeholders and corporate teams to understand 
the process for collecting, collating, and reporting as per 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Guidance 
Note on BRSR and GRI standards 2021.
 
 
Review of the sustainability initiatives, practices, on 
ground establishment, implementation, maintenance, and 
performance described in the Reports.
 
 
Review of data collection and management procedures, and 
related internal controls.
 
 
Assessment of the reporting mechanism and consistency 
with the reporting criteria.
 
 
Review 
of 
appropriateness 
of 
various 
assumptions, 
estimations 
and 
thresholds 
used 
by 
Company 
for data analysis.
 
 
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to 
determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, 
and aggregation.
 
 
Verification of the fact that no material distortion has been 
done at any stage.
Inherent Limitations and Exclusions
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, 
including, for example, the use of judgement and selective 
testing of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material 
misstatements in the sustainability information of the Reports may 
remain undetected.
TÜV SÜD has relied on the information, documents, records, 
data, and explanations provided to us by Company for the 
purpose of our review.
The Assurance scope excludes the following:
 
 
Data and information falling outside the defined reporting 
period (April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025).
 
 
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance 
indicators’ included in the Reports or on which reporting is 
based; we have been informed of by the Company that these 
are derived from the Company’s audited financial records.
 
 
The Company’s statements that describe qualitative/
quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, 
inference, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intention.
 
 
Any 
disclosures 
beyond 
those 
specified 
in 
the 
Scope section above.
Our observations
The sustainability disclosures of the Company, as defined under 
the scope and boundary of assurance, are fairly reliable, valid and 
the Company has appropriately consolidated data from different 
sources at the central level. The Company has made considerable 
efforts to ensure consistency of data for this Report; however, 
the Company may continue to improve robustness of its data 
collection and collation process.
Our above observations, however, do not affect our conclusion 
regarding the Report.
Conclusion
Based on the scope of our review, we conclude the following:
 
 
Reasonable Assurance of BRSR selected Core indicators: 
The non-financial sustainability disclosures of the BRSR 
selected Core indicators as mentioned in ‘Scope and 
boundary of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria 
of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and 
understandability as per ‘reasonable’ assurance criteria. 
We found that the information and data provided in all the 
sections and principles are consistent and adequate with 
regards to the reporting criteria of the BRSR.
 
 
Limited Assurance of selected indicators for BRSR (other 
than core) and IAR: Based on the procedures performed, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to 
believe that the disclosures of the Company is presented 
fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the relevant 
reporting guidelines/standards.
Based on the scope of our review, our conclusions are 
outlined below:
Governance, leadership and supervision: The top management’s 
commitment, business model promoting inclusive growth, 
action and strategies, focus on services, risk management, 
protection and restoration of environment, and priorities are 
represented adequately.
