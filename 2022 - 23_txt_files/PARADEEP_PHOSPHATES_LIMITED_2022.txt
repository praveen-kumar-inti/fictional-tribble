 1
Occupational 
health and 
Safety
Risk
As 
a 
responsible 
employer, 
we 
have 
a 
responsibility 
to 
ensure our workplace 
is safe and healthy, 
with no accidents or 
illnesses. In addition, 
poor 
occupational 
health and safety (OHS) 
performance results in 
a direct negative impact 
on labour costs through 
decrease in productivity. 
In order to mitigate the risk, 
Paradeep implements robust 
procedures such as both Goa 
and Paradeep plants are ISO 
45001 certified (Occupational 
Health 
and 
Safety 
Management 
Systems). 
Various safety oriented SOPs 
have been formulated and 
its strict implementation is 
strongly monitored. Regular 
health and safety training 
is 
organised. 
Additional 
initiatives included preparing 
for HIRA. Conducting Hazop 
study and process safety 
audit including observation 
by external agency and CICG 
inspection by Govt. of Odisha 
are also carried out.
Negative: Any workplace 
incidents, especially those 
resulting in injuries or 
harm to the workforce, 
can adversely impact the 
Company’s 
reputation. 
Negative 
publicity 
and 
public perception can lead 
to customer distrust, loss 
of business opportunities, 
and 
difficulties 
in 
attracting and retaining 
skilled employees.
2
Chemical 
Safety
Risk
Due to the nature of the 
operations, the Company 
is 
heavily 
involved 
in the production or 
handling of chemicals, 
particularly phosphates 
and ammonia. These 
chemicals 
can 
be 
hazardous 
if 
not 
handled and managed 
properly, posing various 
risks to both employees 
and 
the 
surrounding 
environment.
Paradeep has taken various 
initiatives to reduce harmful 
impact 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals:
- Various SOPs and safety 
manuals 
have 
been 
formulated specifying clear 
instructions on safe handling 
of the chemicals.
- 
Periodic 
meetings, 
training 
and 
discussions 
are undertaken to enable 
employees 
to 
proactively 
identify hazardous conditions 
and unsafe practices.
- Regular internal and third 
party audits are conducted 
and results are shared with 
the senior management
- Adequate PPEs are provided 
to ensure safety in storage, 
handling and transportation 
of chemicals.
Negative: Any incidents 
related to chemical safety 
can negatively impact the 
Company’s 
reputation 
among 
stakeholders, 
customers, and investors. 
Major 
accidents 
or 
environmental 
incidents 
could disrupt operations, 
leading 
to 
production 
delays 
or 
shutdowns, 
affecting the Company’s 
financial performance.

Business 
Ethics
Opportunity
Good 
governance 
helps 
standardise 
a 
company’s systems & 
processes. To ensure 
ethical conduct across 
the organisation, various 
governance 
oriented 
policies such as code of 
conduct, whistleblower 
policy, PoSH policy, etc. 
have been formulated. 
Defined 
roles 
and 
responsibilities  of senior 
management 
ensure 
strict 
implementation 
and proper review of 
issues/concerns,
Paradeep 
Phosphate’s 
Code of Business Conduct 
and 
Ethics 
provides 
its 
commitment against aspects 
such as bribery, gifts, insider 
trading, harassment, etc. It 
also mentions the escalation 
mechanism if an individual 
wants to raise a concern/
complaint.
The 
Company 
has 
formulated an ESG Steering 
Committee 
to 
support 
its 
commitment 
towards 
environment, 
corporate 
social 
responsibility 
and 
corporate governance.
Positive: Good corporate 
governance 
systems 
ensure that a company is 
managed in the interests 
of shareholders (including 
minority shareholders).
4
Environmental 
management
Risk
Paradeep 
Phosphate’s 
commitment 
towards 
protecting 
the 
natural 
environment 
and 
conserving 
resources 
has 
been 
embedded in our value 
system. 
Upholding 
these 
principles 
and 
complying 
with 
applicable 
regulatory 
requirements can affect 
the overall performance 
and 
enhance 
the 
Company’s image with 
the stakeholders. 
The 
Company’s 
manufacturing 
plants 
are 
ISO 
14001 
certified 
(Environmental Management 
Systems).
In the PAT Cycle-1, energy 
saving targets were achieved.
In the PAT Cycle-2, PPL is 
entitled to purchase 1,926 
no of escerts which are 
purchased from the energy 
exchange platform.
Regular third party energy 
audits are conducted and 
regular monitoring of the 
energy 
efficiency 
of 
our 
equipment and processes 
are done to identify key areas 
of improvement. 
Compliance with state and 
central 
pollution 
control 
boards 
requirements 
are 
adhered to at all times.
Negative: In case of any 
non-compliance 
with 
environmental norms and 
regulations, 
Paradeep 
Phosphates 
can 
face 
reputational damage as 
well as adverse financial 
repercussions.

Inclusion and 
Diversity
Opportunity
A 
diverse 
workforce 
brings 
together 
individuals 
with 
different 
backgrounds, 
perspectives, 
and 
experiences. 
This 
diversity 
of 
thought 
fosters creativity and 
innovation 
within 
the 
Company. 
When 
employees 
from 
diverse 
backgrounds 
collaborate, 
they 
can 
generate a wider range 
of ideas and solutions, 
leading 
to 
improved 
problem-solving and a 
competitive edge in the 
market.
For 
strong 
governance, 
the Company has a Board 
Diversity policy in place.
Focus on the right talent for 
the right role during hiring and 
recruitment, irrespective of 
individual’s gender, religion, 
and region.
Positive: 
Inclusive 
and 
diverse 
workplaces 
increase employee morale 
and job satisfaction. When 
employees 
feel 
valued 
and respected for their 
individuality, 
they 
are 
more likely to be engaged 
and committed to their 
work. This positive work 
environment 
leads 
to 
increased 
productivity 
and 
overall 
better 
performance.
6
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
As 
a 
phosphates 
manufacturer, Paradeep 
Phosphates 
Limited 
relies 
on 
a 
steady 
and 
reliable 
supply 
of raw materials. An 
efficient supply chain 
ensures 
that 
the 
Company can access 
the necessary inputs to 
maintain uninterrupted 
production 
and 
meet 
customer demands.
To mitigate risk, the Company 
has taken various initiatives:
- Shift to supply of Molten 
Sulphur from IOCL to reduce 
overall carbon footprints of 
the supply chain.
- 
Established 
a 
vendor 
evaluation 
system 
for 
onboarding a new supplier 
wherein 
suppliers 
are 
required to go through a 
screening 
process 
that 
includes various ESG criteria 
such as EHS compliance, 
safe work practices, etc.
- 
To 
ensure 
continuous 
supply, we have maintained 
critical vendor partnerships 
and 
created 
alternative 
domestic sources. 
Negative: 
A 
diversified 
supply chain can help 
withstand 
unexpected 
disruptions, 
such 
as 
natural 
disasters, 
geopolitical 
issues, 
or 
supplier-related problems. 
Having 
alternative 
suppliers or contingency 
plans in place ensures 
continuity of operations 
during challenging times.

Community 
Relations
Opportunity
Maintaining 
positive 
relationships with the 
local 
community 
is 
crucial 
for 
obtaining 
and retaining the social 
license 
to 
operate. 
When 
the 
Company 
has the support and 
trust of the community, 
and it is more likely 
to gain approval for 
its 
operations 
and 
expansion 
plans, 
reducing the risk of 
facing 
opposition 
or 
protests.
The 
Company’s 
CSR 
policy  provides the overall 
framework to our approach 
to 
community 
relations 
and 
development. 
Thrust 
areas of PPL’s community 
development 
framework 
include 
Livelihoods, 
Education, Health (WaSH-
Water, 
Sanitation 
and 
Hygiene), and Environment.
Positive: 
Positive 
community 
relations 
contribute to a favourable 
reputation 
and 
brand 
image 
for 
Paradeep 
Phosphates Limited. Being 
viewed as a responsible 
and engaged corporate 
citizen 
enhances 
the 
Company’s 
standing 
among 
consumers, 
investors, 
and 
other 
stakeholders.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
Yes, we have implemented an occupational health and safety management system. Both of our manufacturing 
units (Paradeep in Odisha and Zuarinagar in Goa) have been certified under ISO 45001. The coverage is 100% of our 
entity, and it covers both regular employees and contractors.
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No).
If yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
The Company has a centralised committee in place to which workers can reach out and raise their concerns about 
work-related hazards. These include the Central Safety Committee (Apex Safety Committee) and Zonal Safety 
Committees (Sub-Safety Committees). Regular monthly safety meetings are conducted by the contractor wherein 
workers’ concerns can be heard and addressed. In addition, safety suggestion boxes are kept at the gates and 
canteen and suggestions can be dropped into it. On every third Thursday of the month, mass safety responsiveness 
(Safety Mann Ki Baat) is organised. Concerns can also be raised during safety theme meeting & morning 
safety pep talks.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Yes/No)      -Yes
	
PPL employs a comprehensive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and 
non-routine basis. It further includes the active involvement of the Company’s senior executives, zonal safety 
members and contract workers. To identify the risk and its priority, we have employed Hazard identification and risk 
assessment (HIRA) which serves as a foundational step in our safety management process.
	
As part of our routine safety measures, the Company conducts a thorough Why-Why analysis, along with process 
safety audits, which often involve external agencies for impartial observations. Additionally, the entity undergoes 
inspections by the Government of Odisha’s CICG (Chief Inspectorate of Factories) to ensure adherence to safety 
standards.
	
Moreover, we proactively conduct Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies and Quantitative Risk Assessments 
(QRA) to gain deeper insights into potential risks. Based on the findings of these assessments, the Company 
formulates Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Operational Control Procedures (OCP), and Safety Management 
Plans (SMP), which are rigorously practiced across the organisation.
	
For non-routine activities that involve higher risk levels, job safety analysis (JSA) is performed to thoroughly assess 
and mitigate potential hazards. Safety Mobile App is launched that enables instant recording and sharing of 
unsafe observations. Safety touch initiatives and safety hot spots are implemented to identify unsafe conditions 
and vulnerable hot spots at the shopfloor. Daily inspections are carried out by dedicated safety officers, ensuring 
continuous monitoring of safety protocols. 
	
Employee participation is encouraged in safety improvement through a suggestion box placed strategically at 
various locations. To ensure ongoing commitment to safety, the entity sets Accident Prevention Plans with safety 
targets, actively overseen by Heads of Departments (HOD) and Heads of Sections (HOS). Regular surveys are 
conducted to understand the employees’ concerns regarding safety. A cross-functional team conducts monthly 
visits to the plant and contractors’ sheds to inspect tools and tackles. The Task Force Committee is established 
to focus on workplace safety, guiding personnel to adhere to SOPs and enforcing safe practices during shutdown 
procedures.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
	
Yes
d.	
Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
