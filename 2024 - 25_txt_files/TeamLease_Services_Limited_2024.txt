Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report
[As per Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015 read 
with Amendments]
Due credit must be given to the Indian capital markets regulator, The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for taking the 
lead in putting together the Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework. In response to the worldwide 
trends, SEBI, has adopted new sustainability reporting criteria as part of its ongoing efforts to improve ESG disclosures. This 
new, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), reporting format intends to establish ties between a Company’s 
financial outcomes and its ESG performance. This can help regulators, investors, and other stakeholders get a more accurate 
picture of a Company’s overall stability, growth, sustainability and transparency. It is a comprehensive framework, which calls for 
more measurable, quantitative metrics to facilitate better benchmarking.
With effect from the Financial Year 2022-2023, as per guidelines provided by SEBI, India, Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Reporting (BRSR) is mandated for the top 1000 listed companies (by market capitalization). At TeamLease, it was a collective 
decision to adopt the BRSR ahead of schedule from FY’22 onwards.
TeamLease continues to communicate the Company’s obligations and performance to all its stakeholders through its BRSR. As 
a responsible corporate citizen, TeamLease continues to actively engage with all its stakeholders to drive their growth for all. The 
Company believes in accelerating India’s transition to a knowledge economy and continues its efforts to create value for India by 
elevating the quality of life across the entire socio-economic spectrum.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
TeamLease’s key objective is to generate Employment, Employability and E-workforce in the country. The Company’s 
focus on ESG parameters is best reflected through core values that are imbibed in all spheres of activity of the Company. 
The Company believes in meeting a critical social objective with an endeavour to provide job solutions across all income 
categories. Given the acute shortage of jobs in India the demand for formalisation of the job market in India is immense. 
The Company has been built on the founding principles of kindness, fairness, effectiveness and efficiency. The Company 
believes that sound principles of governance are a necessary tool for creating long-term value for all its stakeholders and to 
promote sustainability. TeamLease regards respect for human rights as one of its fundamental and core values. TeamLease 
undertakes its developmental and welfare activities directly. The Company recognises that climate change is not just an 
environmental issue but also a business risk. The Company is increasing its due diligence on ESG risks in its policies. 
Employee sensitisation on ESG risks is crucial. The Company discourages wasteful usage of natural resources.

Section C
Principle 1
Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with Ethics, 
Transparency and Accountability
TeamLease is committed to achieving the highest principles of integrity and ethics. Our Code of Conduct (COC / Code) outlines 
the Company’s expected standards of ethical conduct and behavior. Our core values represent mutual respect, trust and personal 
growth for all. The Code of Conduct extends to employees at all  levels  and  other  individuals  working  with  the Company, 
its  Subsidiaries,  associates,  suppliers,  service  providers, channel partners and explicitly prohibits bribes, kickbacks, improper 
payments and direct them to ensure ethical business conduct.
The three pillars supporting the governance structure of the Company are as under:
a.	
Ethics: In consonance with the Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 (as amended from time-to-time), the Company 
has adopted a “TeamLease Code of Conduct and Business Ethics” which mandates the Directors, Senior Management and 
Employees of the Company to act honestly, fairly, ethically and with integrity, conduct themselves in professional, courteous 
and respectful manner.
b.	
Transparency: The Governance structure of the Company is further supported by a Whistle Blower and Vigil Mechanism 
Policy which serves as a tool for its directors and employees to report any genuine concerns about unethical behaviour, 
actual or suspected without fear of reprisal. The mechanism provides an avenue to stakeholders to raise concerns or 
violations pertaining to activities of the Company.
c.	
Accountability: In order to instil accountability amongst the employees of the Company and its Group Companies, 
TeamLease has in place an Internal Code of Conduct for Regulating, Monitoring and Reporting of Trades by Designated 
Persons. The Code serves a threefold objective of: 
 
 
monitoring the trades of designated employees of the Company; 
 
 
obligating the employees to handle price sensitive information of the Company on a need-to-know basis thereby 
avoiding leakage of information; 
 
 
mandating the employees to restrict unauthorized access to any individual other than the intended recipient of 
the information.

Principle 2
Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe 
and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle
While evaluating the impact of business operations, TeamLease aims to reduce any fallouts during the lifecycle of its services 
across the value chain.
A.	 Essential Indicators pertaining to Principle 2 
1.	
Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the 
Company, respectively. 
	
Given the nature of business of the Company, the relevance of the above is largely restricted to information technology 
(IT) capex. Greater adoption of digital platforms not only brings in increased efficiencies of operations but also ensures 
substantially reduced consumption of paper.

Confirmation on procedures in place for sustainable sourcing by the Company
	
Given the nature of the business of the Company, at a corporate level, consumption of resources is limited to running the 
operations. The Company, however, remains cognisant of reducing its resource consumption through ensuring better 
energy efficiency standards whilst procuring electronic equipment, lighting devices, computers, HVACs, sensors, amongst 
others. This initiative will bring in energy savings over the medium to long-term. At most of the Company’s offices, there are 
LED light fittings to conserve energy and conscious endeavours have been made to replace electronic equipment with high 
energy star ratings. Sensors are installed to economise power and water consumption only when these facilities are being 
used. The major suppliers of hardware are green standard compliant.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of

Not Applicable, as the Company does not have physical products as a part of its offerings.
4.

B.	
Leadership Indicators pertaining to Principle 2
1.	
Status of conducting Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)	
	
This is not applicable to the Company. The Company does not have any physical products as a part of its offerings to 
customers. It is a  service based Company. Hence the applicability of the life-cycle approach to the Company’s core 
operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products procured 
by the Company for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life 
cycle philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications 
for purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.
2.	
Significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of the products / 
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means
	
It’s a service based Company providing various kinds of services across the country. Therefore, no social or environmental 
concerns are associated with the use of its offerings.
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Not Applicable, as the Company does not have physical products as a part of its offerings.

Principle 3
Businesses should promote the  
well-being of all employees.
TeamLease believes that its success depends on its ability to develop knowledge, skills and expertise of its employees. This 
belief translates in ensuring that every business vertical is equipped  with  right  talent,  which  is both competent and engaged. 
The Company achieved this objective by undertaking various initiatives for talent development, employee engagement and 
communication. We have always been committed to inclusive and merit based policies. We are proud of the fact that the 
representation of women leaders in our senior team is at 38%. Our policies are for the benefit of all employees. In today’s world, 
the need for flexibility in terms of workplace (Work from home / work from office) is the most commonly mentioned and highly 
valued benefit and we are trying to create as much flexibility as possible without compromising on cohesion and team work. We 
have always had a transparent, merit-based and open culture. 
All our policies are geared towards equal opportunity. We pride ourselves on our compliance and ethical standards. All of these, 
put together create a work environment where everyone has a voice, has opportunities to grow and learn and take on higher 
responsibilities. Examples for this include our outcome-based performance management system, a promotion policy aligned 
with performance and learning opportunities for all our people.
We have monthly connect sessions with Department and Business Heads. People are encouraged to speak up and voice 
their thoughts, recommendations and suggestions. HR teams have regular connects with people to ensure that we are able 
to strengthen good practices and act proactively where gaps need to be addressed. There are CEO connect sessions for new 
joiners and senior leaders to ensure that transitions are smooth and there is a common language and culture of outcome 
based performance. We also have a cadence on Monthly, Quarterly and Annual Awards to recognize strong performance and 
adherence to our Principles. We have several recognition and connect activities to ensure that people have the resources and 
information they need to succeed and successes are recognized and rewarded. 
RETURNING TO OFFICE
At the start of the pandemic, many team members transitioned to working from home, allowing us to better protect both our 
team members who were required to come to our offices for essential operations as well as our team members who could 
perform their job duties remotely. As conditions improved in our communities around the country, we began enacting plans to 
return all team members to our TeamLease offices. We continue to adjust those plans, along with our Health & Safety protocols, 
to account for developments such as the emergence of variants. Recognizing that the needs of our team members have shifted 
over the course of the last two years, we remain committed to flexible work arrangements, and will continue to offer the option 
to work a combination of at office and remotely if the job allows. Hybrid working models give employees the benefit of in–person 
interactions with their colleagues while also enjoying the conveniences of working remotely.

All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. Further, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board evaluates the performance of the Executive Directors, members of 
Executive Management (one level below the Board), Senior Management Personnel and the Company Secretary on an annual 
basis. The underlying philosophy of the performance management system is to have a fair and transparent system of appraisal, 
which ensures an objective mechanism to measure each employee’s performance and potential and implement a reward system 
which recognises merit. The performance appraisal system has been designed to achieve the following objectives: 
 
 
Review the previous year’s performance with specific reference to achievement of targets and give constructive feedback 
on performance.
 
 
Provide an opportunity for communication and interaction between the appraiser and appraisee regarding the previous 
year’s performance and setting of performance targets for the next appraisal period. 
 
 
Reward employees who have performed well during the appraisal period and those who demonstrate the ability to handle 
higher responsibilities with promotions/increased job responsibilities.

Financial Statements
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
	
Stakeholder Mapping: The Company conducts a comprehensive stakeholder mapping exercise to identify and categorise 
the key stakeholder groups relevant to our business. This process involves analysing the impact and influence of various 
individuals, organisations, and communities on our operations and vice versa.
	
Internal Consultation: The Company engages with its internal teams, departments, and leadership to gather insights and 
perspectives on stakeholders. This includes conducting workshops, meetings, and consultations to identify stakeholders 
who have a direct or indirect impact on its businesses.
	
External Engagement: The Company actively engages with external stakeholders through various channels, including 
surveys, interviews, focus groups, and public consultations. This enables TeamLease to understand its stakeholder’s 
expectations, concerns, and interests related to its operations and sustainability practices.
	
Stakeholder Mapping Matrix: Based on the information gathered from internal and external consultations, the Company 
developed a stakeholder mapping matrix. This matrix helps the Company to prioritise and categorise stakeholders based 
on their level of influence, impact, and relevance to its business.
	
Continuous Monitoring and Feedback: TeamLease believes in maintaining an ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders 
to keep track of their evolving needs and expectations. The Company regularly seeks feedback through surveys, feedback 
forms, meetings, and other channels to ensure that its engagement remains effective and meaningful.
	
Stakeholder Engagement Plans: Once the key stakeholders are identified, the Company develops tailored engagement 
plans for each group. These plans outline the objectives, strategies, and activities for engaging with stakeholders, considering 
their specific interests and concerns.
	
By systematically identifying and engaging with its key stakeholders, TeamLease aims to build strong relationships, foster 
trust, and align its business practices with their expectations. This approach enables the Company to address its concerns, 
collaborate on shared goals, and create long-term value for all stakeholders involved.

industry best practices, and emerging issues, trends, and developments.

Principle 6
Business should respect, protect, and 
make efforts to restore the environment
Along its journey towards path of sustainability, the Company explored and implemented several green solutions. It is also 
continuously in search of more energy efficient technologies and innovative solutions for a greener future.
We are committed to playing our part in safeguarding the planet for future generations. We understand environmental stewardship 
to be an integral part of our purpose as an organisation. We dedicate our commitment in the following ways: • Seek to avoid and 
minimize the adverse impacts of our operations on the environment while promoting opportunities to conserve and enhance 
resources in the areas of our operations. • Stewardship initiatives aim to produce benefits for the environment and people, build 
trust, and support our social license to operate. • Environmental focus areas include climate, water, biodiversity, reclamation and 
waste management.
In our efforts, we continue to focus on areas where we see the biggest reduction potential, based on our industry and footprint. 
• Providing sustainable offices and taking a responsible approach to business travel. • Reduced water and paper usage in office 
workspace. • Our ability to impact electricity procurement is limited, especially for branches where we do not rent the entire 
building, but share it with other tenants. • To limit the use of fossil fuels, we constantly seek to increase the use of alternative, 
efficient, and natural energy resources (e.g., by replacing traditional lighting with LED lighting in our buildings).
