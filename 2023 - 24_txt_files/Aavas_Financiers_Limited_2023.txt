A brief on types of customers 
	
The Company specializes in providing home financing solutions to communities that have traditionally been 
underserved, unserved or overlooked by major financial institutions. Its strategic focus is on catering to the 
housing needs of low and middle-income groups primarily in semi-urban and rural areas. By doing so, the 
Company effectively bridges a critical gap in the housing finance landscape and reaches out to a niche market 
segment that is often neglected by larger financial institutions.

1.
Affordable 
Housing- 
Lending to 
Lower and 
middle 
income 
customers 
with 
undocumented 
income.
Opportunity 
as well as 
Risk
Opportunity:
Affordable Housing 
is need of the hour. 
The government 
has acted as a 
facilitator to make 
the segment an 
alluring venture for 
private developers 
and introduced 
several incentives 
and schemes over 
the years.
Risk:
The Company 
primarily focuses 
on serving Lower 
and Middle level 
customer from 
underserved and 
unserved areas, 
that largely consist 
of individuals with 
un-documented 
income.
The Company 
possesses strong 
customer assessment 
standards which helps 
to moderate risks. 
Measures for risk 
mitigation include 
verification of credit 
history from credit risk 
information bureaus, 
probability of default 
assessment etc.
The Company 
has maintained a 
lower delinquency 
percentage, compared 
to the industrial 
average, particularly in 
the affordable segment. 
Using conservative loan 
to value parameters 
and strong customer 
assessment standards, 
further aids the 
Company in mitigating 
credit risk.
Positive: India’s urban 
population is estimated 
to double between 
2018 and 2050. This 
trend is driven by 
factors such as rising 
per capita income 
and nuclearization 
of families, which 
gives immense scope 
to Company under 
Affordable Housing.
Negative: However, 
undocumented history 
of receiving income 
makes it difficult to 
determine ability of 
customers to receive 
stable income, in 
future.
2.
Financial 
and Digital 
Inclusion
Opportunity
The Company 
regards financial 
and digital inclusion 
as a significant 
opportunity to 
expand its reach, 
enhance customer 
engagement and 
make its services 
accessible to 
the underserved 
populations, thereby 
fostering social 
equity. 
The Company 
continues to expand 
its reach, penetrating 
deeper and deeper into 
semi-urban and rural 
peripheries of India. 
The Company has now 
embarked on 'Pragati' 
and implemented 
Salesforce and 
Oracle in its system. 
The Company also 
launched the ‘Go 
Green Initiative’ which 
represents a significant 
stride towards 
leveraging cutting-edge 
technology to minimize 
paper usage within 
the loan processing 
workflow.
Positive: Focusing 
on financial and 
digital inclusion not 
only democratizes 
finance, allowing 
broader segments 
of the population to 
participate in the 
economy, but it also 
promotes personalized 
and efficient service 
delivery, enhancing 
customer satisfaction.

3.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI)
Opportunity
The Company is 
uniquely positioned 
to lead in DEI 
because investment 
in a diverse and 
inclusive work 
culture mirrors the 
diverse clientele 
served, positioning 
the Company for 
broader affordable 
market relevance 
and sustained 
growth.
The Company has 
developed inclusive 
hiring practices to 
attract talent from 
diverse genders, 
cultural backgrounds, 
qualifications, and age 
groups. The Company 
also offers targeted 
mentorship programs, 
ensures equal pay 
for equal work and 
implements equitable 
promotion policies to 
retain its diverse talent 
pool.
Positive: A DEI-focused 
workplace promotes a 
sense of belongingness 
and respect, leading 
to higher employee 
morale and satisfaction. 
Diverse teams also 
bring in a variety of 
perspectives and ideas, 
fostering creative 
solutions to complex 
financing challenges.
4.
Climate 
Change 
Risk 
For any organization engaged in providing affordable housing finance, 
climate change presents multifaceted risks. The Company recognizes 
the environmental risks associated with its lending activities as well as 
its abilities to capitalize on opportunities in mitigating climate change by 
financing projects and home loans that are inclined towards sustainability.
(a) Physical Risks 
Risk
Occurrence of 
extreme weather 
events like rising 
sea levels, floods, 
cyclones, tsunami 
etc. 
The Company has 
a well-diversified 
portfolio across 
different geographies 
and segments, 
digitization of 
loan process and 
implementation of 
Business Continuity 
Management Policy 
(BCMP).
Negative: Potential 
for erosion of 
capital damage to 
infrastructure and 
assets leading to 
financial losses for the 
Company as well as its 
clients.

Transition 
Risk
 Risk
Shifting regulatory 
landscapes and 
policies aimed at 
combating climate 
change, which may 
include restrictions 
on business/
financing activities 
that directly or 
indirectly cause an 
adverse impact on 
the environment. 
The Company is 
making reasonable 
efforts to reduce 
and eliminate its 
direct and indirect 
adverse impacts on 
the environment by 
moderating resource 
consumption,  
encouraging 
sustainable and 
digitized operations 
with ‘Go Green 
Initiative’, promoting 
Green Offices/Branches 
and also, developing 
ecosystem for financing 
Green Affordable 
Housing.
Negative: Potential risk 
of asset devaluation for 
properties that are not 
built as per sustainable 
standards.  
Increased operational 
costs associated with 
adapting investment 
strategies to meet 
new market demands 
and regulatory 
requirements.
Potential for increased 
compliance costs 
as environmental 
regulations become 
stricter.
5.
Green Self-
Built Housing
Opportunity 
The Company is 
providing loans 
for construction 
of environment-
friendly homes 
and supporting 
its customers in 
building homes that 
are sustainable as 
well as affordable. 
The Company is 
working towards Green 
Home Ecosystem 
Development by 
reaching out to 
employees, customers, 
masons, contractors 
etc. and making 
them aware about 
the benefits of green 
homes through direct 
calling, SMS, Whatsapp 
messages, workshops, 
trainings, social 
media, brochures, and 
educative short films.
Positive: Loans for 
self-built housing have 
added a sustainability 
dimension to our 
value chain, making us 
pioneers in introducing 
concept of sustainable 
construction of self-
built homes in Indian 
Housing Finance space
6.
Community 
Wellbeing and 
Social Impact

welfare activities 
not only enhances a 
company's corporate 
goodwill and social 
reputation, but

connection, in turn, 
contributes to the 
company's long-

growth.
The company

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by Director responsible for business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
We are proud to share the remarkable progress we have made in embracing green and sustainable solutions not 
only within our work life but also beyond. We firmly believe that charity begins at home, which is why we began by 
obtaining green building certification for our own Corporate Office.
In the Indian Housing Finance space, we are breaking new ground by addressing the financing gap in supporting 
the construction of green self-built homes by beneficiaries, particularly in the affordable segment. We enable lower 
and middle-income households to construct energy-efficient, independent Green Homes, aiming for a substantial 
20% reduction in materials, energy consumption, and water usage. This initiative not only lowers the cost of 
home ownership but also elevates our commitment to environmental responsibility. This pioneering initiative is

unless otherwise stated and we have not performed 
any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any 
other elements included in the BRSR and therefore, do

Criteria
5.	
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the 
Identified Sustainability Information for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2024 is summarised below 
(‘BRSR Framework'):
	
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015, as 
amended;
	
Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability 
Reporting Requirements for listed entities as 
per Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/ 
CIR/P/2023/120 dated 11 July 2023; and

SEBI 
Circular

CIR/2023/122 
dated

Management’s Responsibilities
6.	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into 
account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to 
reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of 
the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
7.	
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities.
Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control
8.	
We are independent of the Company and have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
the requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ (‘IESBA’) and 
have the required competencies and experience to 
conduct this assurance engagement.
9.	
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, 
or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system 
of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Statutory Reports
45
Auditor’s Responsibility
10.	 Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance 
in the form of a conclusion on the Identified 
Sustainability Information based on the procedures 
we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
We conducted our limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance 
Engagements 
(ISAE) 
3000 
(Revised), 
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000 
(Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard 
requires that we plan and perform our engagement to 
obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified 
Sustainability Information is free from material 
misstatement.
11.	 A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use 
of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, identifying areas 
where material misstatement is likely to arise in the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to 
fraud or error, designing and performing procedures 
to address identified risk areas as necessary in the 
circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation 
of the Identified Sustainability Information.
12.	 A limited assurance engagement is substantially less 
in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement 
in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, 
including an understanding of internal control, and 
the procedures performed in response to the assessed 
risks.
13.	 The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional 
judgment 
and 
included 
inquiries, 
observation 
of 
processes 
performed, 
inspection 
of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification 
methods 
and 
reporting 
policies, 
analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records.
14.	 Given the circumstances of the engagement, in 
performing the procedures listed above, we:
	
Carried out discussions at the corporate office for 
data and document verification;
	
Interviewed senior executives to understand 
the reporting process, governance, systems and 
controls in place during the reporting period;
	
Reviewed the records and relevant documentation 
including information from audited financial 
statements or statutory reports submitted by 
the Company to support relevant performance 
disclosures within our scope;
	
Evaluated the suitability and application of 
Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied 
appropriately to the subject matter;
	
Selected key parameters and representative 
sampling, based on statistical sampling tables and 
agreeing claims to source information to check 
accuracy and completeness of claims such as 
source data, meter data, etc;
	
Re-performed calculations to check accuracy of 
claims;
	
Reviewed 
data 
from 
independent 
sources, 
wherever available;
	
Reviewed data, information about sustainability 
performance indicators and statements in the 
report;
	
Reviewed and verified information/ data as per the 
BRSR framework; and
	
Reviewed 
accuracy, 
transparency 
and 
completeness of the information/ data provided.
Exclusions:
15.	 Our limited assurance engagement scope excludes the 
following and therefore we do not express an opinion 
on the same:
	
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the 
Scope section above;
	
Data and information outside the defined reporting 
period;
	
Data related to Company’s financial performance, 
strategy and other related linkages expressed in 
the Report;
	
The Company’s statements that describe expression 
of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward 
looking statements provided by the Company and 
assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights 
and other competitive issues; and
	
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks 
other than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria 
above.
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and 
extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement 
was not designed to provide assurance on internal 
controls.
Aavas Financiers Limited | Annual Report 2023-24

The procedures did not include testing controls 
or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.
Conclusion
16.	 Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Identified 
Sustainability Information included in the BRSR for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2024 is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Restriction on use
17.	 Our limited assurance report has been prepared and 
addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company 
at the request of the Company solely, to assist the 
Company in reporting on the Company’s sustainability 
performance and activities. Accordingly, the Assurance 
Statement may not be suitable for any other purpose 
and should not be used by any other party other than 
the Board of Directors of the Company. Further, we do 
not accept or assume any duty of care or liability for 
any other purpose or to any other party to whom the 
assurance report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come.
