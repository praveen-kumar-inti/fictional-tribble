Risk/
Opportunity
The growing demand 
for two-wheelers, along 
with the phasing out of 
certain vehicle models, is 
impact existing business 
models, product 
portfolios, and overall cost 
structures. Companies 
will need to adapt 
swiftly to these shifts to 
remain competitive and 
meet evolving market 
expectations.
Changing consumer 
preferences are reshaping 
India’s automotive 
industry.
As part of our strategic response 
to evolving consumer demands, 
we have initiated several key 
measures. These include 
ongoing process improvements 
and targeted investments in 
new product development. We 
are actively automating our 
manufacturing processes to 
the rollout of innovative products. 
Additionally, we are expanding 
into new geographies and entering 
emerging market segments to 
remain competitive and aligned 
with the latest technological 
advancements.
The development 
of new models 
incorporating the 
latest technologies 
and aligned with 
evolving customer 
preferences will help 
attract new customers 
while retaining the 
existing base. This 
strategic approach 
is expected to drive 
revenue growth and 
strengthen our market 
presence.

With today’s increasingly 
digital manufacturing 
environment, 
cybersecurity threats 
pose serious risks that 
can have far-reaching 
consequences across 
reputational dimensions.

Hazards: Attacks on 
digital safety systems or 
automated controls may 
jeopardize the well-being 
of employees and the 
integrity of equipment, 
creating potential safety 
Operational 
Disruptions: 
Cyberattacks targeting 
production systems

manufacturing processes 
and delaying deliveries. 
Such disruptions not 
also result in substantial 
idle resources and missed 
deadlines.
Data Security 
Breaches: Unauthorized 
access to sensitive 
information including 
intellectual property, 
proprietary designs, 
and customer data can 
compromise competitive 
advantage and erode 
stakeholder trust.
We recognize the growing 
complexity and importance of 
cybersecurity in safeguarding 
our operations, data, and 
stakeholder trust. To address these 
challenges, we have implemented 
a comprehensive, enterprise-wide 
information security framework 
that is regularly reviewed by our 
senior leadership and governance 
committees.
Key components of our 
cybersecurity program include:
Deployment of advanced tools 
for cyber threat prevention, 
detection, and response, 
aligned with industry best practices
Mandatory information security 
training for all employees, covering 
topics such as phishing awareness, 
secure data handling
Procurement of cyber liability 
exposure from both internal and 
external threats
Regular reporting to the Audit 
Committee on cybersecurity 
trends, threat landscapes, and 
updates to our information security 
protocols.

Protecting the health

especially in environments 
with process-related risks. 
Every safety incident not 
well-being and morale but 
also carries reputational 
consequences that can 
impact the company’s 
standing and trust within 
the industry.
We have implemented 
a comprehensive set of 
Environmental Health and 
Safety (EHS) policies aimed at 
safeguarding our workforce and 
promoting a culture of well-being. 
These policies are designed to 
ensure safe working conditions, 
provide support systems, and 
foster a proactive approach to 
employee health and safety.
Workplace Well-being: 
Our focus is on creating an 
environment that supports physical 
and mental health through 
structured policies and responsive 
support mechanisms.
 
EHS training is an integral part 
of our onboarding process and 
is reinforced through ongoing 
coaching. This ensures that safety 
protocols are well understood 
and consistently applied across all 
levels of the organisation.
Employee Engagement: We 
actively involve our employees 
in safety risk assessments. Their

The production, 
transportation, storage, 
and handling of materials 
within our operations 
and across our supply

greenhouse gas (GHG)

Our Company remains 
committed to identifying 
and mitigating these 
impacts through 
process optimisation, 
and collaboration with 
environmentally conscious 
partners.
Adopting environmentally 
and socially responsible 
supply chain practices 
is essential for ensuring 
long-term business 
viability and maintaining 
our social license to 
operate. Furthermore, 
reducing Scope 3 
emissions not only 
contributes to climate 
goals but also enhances 
our reputation as a 
responsible and forward-
thinking organisation.
To enhance sustainability across 
our supply chain, NRB Bearings 
is actively working with value 
chain partners to promote 
environmentally and socially 
responsible practices. 
We encourage our suppliers to 
adopt clean energy and prioritize 
partnerships with those working 
toward carbon neutrality. 
Through regular ESG training 
and assessments, we help value 
chain partners align with our 
sustainability goals and close 
performance gaps.
A well-managed 
supply chain 
aligned with ESG 
principles can reduce 
environmental

approach helps us maintain

to minimize environmental impact. Key projects include:
1. Rooftop Solar Installation (Waluj)
A 19 kW solar power plant was installed to harness renewable energy, thereby reducing dependency on grid electricity 
and lowering carbon emissions.
2. Air Cooling to Water Cooling Conversion (Waluj)
Replaced air-cooled systems with water-cooled units, eliminating the use of R-22 refrigerant, which is a potent 
greenhouse gas.
3. Contract Demand Optimisation (Waluj & Engineering Centre)
Reduced contract demand to align with actual consumption, freeing up grid capacity and lowering peak load 
emissions.
4. Thyristor Panel Installation (Engineering Centre)

6. HT Kaizen
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company implemented a project to optimize propane usage in Endo gas

across operations.
These projects collectively contribute to a total estimated annual energy saving of over 625,505 kWh, which translates

strategy
We have implemented a robust waste management system for proper collection, segregation, and disposal of waste 
non-hazardous waste, such as used oil, paper, corrugated materials, plastics, and wood waste. The waste is stored 
at these designated sites until it is disposed of in accordance with the legal procedures and environmentally sound 
techniques. Hazardous waste is disposed of in a manner that meets the requirements of the MPCB/CPCB, while 
non-hazardous waste is sold to authorized recyclers or vendors. Our company prioritises environmentally responsible 
disposal practices and works with authorised recyclers/processors to ensure that all waste is handled and disposed 
of in a responsible and sustainable manner.
