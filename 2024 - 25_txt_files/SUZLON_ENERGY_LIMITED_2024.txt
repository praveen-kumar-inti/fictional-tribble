Corporate Overview
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
In FY 2024–25, Suzlon advanced its materiality assessment by adopting a double materiality approach, building on the 
impact-focused methodology used in FY 2023–24. This progression reflects the Company’s alignment with evolving global 
sustainability standards and best practices.
	
The assessment was guided by the EFRAG Double Materiality Assessment Implementation Guidelines, facilitating a 
structured evaluation of sustainability topics from both impact and financial materiality perspectives. This integrated 
approach enhances the robustness of ESG strategy, risk management, and disclosure preparedness.
	
Internal stakeholders were engaged to identify risks and opportunities related to previously recognised material topics. 
Each was scored based on magnitude and likelihood, culminating in the development of a Double Materiality Matrix that 
mapped 19 sustainability topics. These were classified as Critical, Significant, or Important based on their total scores. The 
identified critical material topics have been detailed below,

GHG Emissions 
& Climate 
Change 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Evolving regulations 
may raise compliance costs, 
while extreme weather 
and climate-related health 
risks can cause workforce 
loss, delays, and financial 
or reputational damage. 
Delayed adoption of 
low-carbon technologies 
may also reduce Suzlon’s 
appeal to global buyers and 
limit preferential sourcing 
opportunities.
Opportunity: Rising demand 
for product-level GHG data 
is influencing renewable 
energy procurement. 
Suzlon’s verified emissions 
data and low-carbon 
products enhance market 
access, sales, and cash 
flow. Its alignment with 
climate-focused policies 
strengthens its reputation as 
a responsible, resilient, and 
future-ready company.
We are actively incorporating 
renewable energy sources to 
mitigate risks in the transition 
to a low-carbon economy and 
enhance sustainability.
We achieved a Low Product 
Carbon Footprint certification 
for our S144–3.x MW Wind 
Turbine, underscoring our 
commitment to integrating 
low-carbon technologies and 
sustainable practices within 
our manufacturing processes.
We have conducted a 
comprehensive climate risk 
assessment (physical and 
transition risks) to ensure 
alignment with TCFD/IFRS S2 
disclosures. Findings from 
the assessment will influence 
operational decisions.
We have also developed 
implementation roadmaps 
and decarbonization plans to 
ensure climate resilience.

Sustainable 
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Supply chain 
disruptions can harm local 
livelihoods and trigger 
socio-economic unrest. 
Gaps in POSH awareness 
or enforcement may also 
lead to incidents that 
damage brand integrity and 
stakeholder trust.
Opportunity: Given Suzlon’s 
extensive interaction 
with suppliers to ensure 
alignment with the 
company’s Code of Conduct, 
a consistent and credible 
sustainability footprint 
has been established. 
Embedding sustainability 
standards across the value 
chain enhances operational 
reliability. Collaborating with 
suppliers on progressive 
steps toward Net Zero by 
2040 not only strengthens 
supplier relationships but 
also ensures an accelerated 
pace for decarbonization. 
These efforts position 
Suzlon as a forward-looking 
partner, improving brand 
standing and access to 
environmentally conscious 
markets and clients.
Suppliers are onboarded only 
upon meeting predefined 
criteria encompassing quality, 
cost-effectiveness, and 
timely delivery, in addition 
to compliance with ESG 
(Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) requirements. 
Emphasis is placed on 
evaluating the suppliers’ 
impact on human rights, 
including issues such as child 
labour, fair wages, and ethical 
working conditions.
Supplier audits and vendor 
interactions are conducted 
at regular intervals to identify 
concerns, share best practices, 
and foster continuous 
improvement. Supply chain 
due diligence procedures, 
including the assessment of 
suppliers during onboarding 
and their ongoing evaluation 
on an annual basis, have been 
instituted and are currently 
under implementation.
To support supplier 
performance and compliance, 
we have undertaken dedicated 
training and capacity-
building initiatives to equip 
our suppliers with relevant 
knowledge and expectations.
Additionally, a comprehensive 
supply chain management 
dashboard has been 
developed to enable effective 
tracking of key performance 
indicators. This tool assists 
in identifying potential areas 
for improvement, thereby 
supporting risk mitigation 
and unlocking opportunities 
for enhanced supply chain 
resilience and sustainability.

Research and

Opportunity
Suzlon’s cross-functional 
collaboration, culture of

drive improved turbine 
performance, safety, and 
digital transformation. 
Product innovation and 
recyclable components 
boost efficiency and 
competitiveness, while 
ongoing training builds 
agility and operational 
strength. Community-led 
R&D supports cost-effective, 
indigenous solutions for 
market differentiation. 
Tech-enabled POSH case 
management enhances 
internal systems and 
responsiveness. Collectively, 
these efforts reinforce 
Suzlon’s reputation and 
expand market access.

Talent 
Management/ 
Employee 
Engagement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: High attrition of skilled 
staff can impact productivity, 
morale, and investor 
confidence. It may also lead 
to quality and safety issues, 
while increasing recruitment 
and training costs.
Opportunity: Effective 
talent management boosts 
productivity, succession 
planning, and customer 
satisfaction by fostering 
a committed workforce. 
Retaining key talent 
through growth programs 
and engagement efforts 
ensures continuity, reduces 
costs, and builds long-
term capabilities. CSR 
involvement and gender 
sensitivity strengthen culture 
and brand perception, while 
a diverse, stable workforce 
drives innovation and 
sustained growth.
We are committed to nurturing 
talent through structured, 
inclusive, and forward-
looking talent management 
initiatives. Further, we have 
institutionalized cross-
functional rotations for 
functional heads across 
2–3 departments to build 
enterprise-wide leadership and 
ensure business continuity.
In addition, we offer employee 
benefits that are aligned 
with the evolving needs 
of our workforce and are 
focused on fostering a culture 
of well-being and holistic 
development.
We undertake a range of 
employee engagement 
initiatives, including 
participation in CSR 
volunteering activities, to 
foster a strong sense of 
belonging and alignment with 
Suzlon’s values and purpose.

Training & 
Development 
(T&D)/ Human 
Capital 
Development
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Rising industry 
demand for green-skilled 
professionals has led to 
high attrition, risking loss 
of expertise in wind energy 
and sustainability, disrupting 
operations, and driving up 
training and recruitment 
costs.
Opportunity: Investing 
in leadership training, 
succession planning, 
and upskilling enhances 
workforce capability, 
adaptability, and 
performance. Closing skill 
gaps and promoting young 
talent boosts resilience, 
engagement, and retention 
while lowering hiring 
costs. POSH sensitization 
and EHS training improve 
safety and care standards. 
Community skill-building 
further strengthens Suzlon’s 
employer brand and future 
talent pipeline.
We have designed curated 
learning and development 
programs aimed at enabling 
employees to enhance their 
skills, thereby improving their 
confidence, motivation, and 
preparedness for progression 
to higher management levels. 
Training modules covering 
ESG-related topics are 
available to employees and 
have witnessed increased 
participation across the 
organisation.
An MoU has been signed 
to support participation in a 
green skills study, enabling 
greater participation of youth 
in sector such as renewables. 
Our learning ecosystem 
is democratized, enabling 
employees at all levels to 
access any training module, 
regardless of designation.
We focus on nurturing 
talent from the ground up, 
encouraging entry at the 
operational level and enabling 
internal progression. High-
performance individuals are 
identified through objective, 
data-driven metrics to 
minimize subjectivity and 
enhance fairness in career 
development.

Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
Opportunity
An inclusive, diverse 
workplace boosts decision-
making, team productivity, 
and problem-solving 
through varied perspectives. 
Initiatives like equitable 
roles, women-friendly 
spaces, and inclusive hiring 
improve morale, retention, 
and reduce turnover costs. 
A strong inclusion culture 
enhances brand perception, 
builds customer loyalty, 
and equips Suzlon to meet 
evolving challenges with 
agility and creativity.

Human Rights 
and Labour 
Conditions
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Evolving regulations 
on human rights and labor 
standards pose legal 
risks if issues like forced 
labor or safety violations 
arise. Growing investor 
scrutiny and media visibility 
increases financial and 
reputational risks from 
ethical lapses. Poor POSH 
implementation or weak 
inductions can lower 
engagement, while human 
rights concerns with contract 
labor or security staff may 
lead to community tensions 
and damage Suzlon’s 
reputation.
Opportunity: Adhering to 
evolving labor and human 
rights laws, including for 
vendors, positions Suzlon 
as a responsible global 
business. Human Rights Risk 
Assessments across sites 
and contractors strengthen 
due diligence and ethical 
leadership. Regular health 
checks and workforce 
involvement promote 
safety and trust, boosting 
productivity and reinforcing 
Suzlon’s credibility with 
global partners, investors, 
and customers.
We have implemented a 
Human Rights Policy aligned 
with international and national 
frameworks, including the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights, ILO Core 
Conventions, UNGC Principles 
1 and 2, and the OECD 
Guidelines for Responsible 
Business Conduct. We uphold 
the rights of employees to 
freedom of association and 
collective bargaining. Human 
rights training has been 
initiated for security personnel.
We ensure that all human 
rights and POSH related 
metrics are publicly disclosed 
to ensure transparency and 
stakeholder trust.

Business Ethics 
& Integrity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Rising regulatory 
scrutiny increases 
compliance costs and raises 
legal and reputational 
risks from ethical lapses. 
Misconduct at project sites 
can damage community 
trust and disrupt operations, 
while vendor-related issues 
may invite further scrutiny. 
A weak ethical culture can 
harm morale, drive attrition, 
and in severe cases, lead 
to strikes or boycotts, 
escalating financial and 
operational risks.
Opportunity: Upholding 
strong ethics helps Suzlon 
build trusted, transparent 
stakeholder relationships. 
Policies like whistle-blower 
protection, employee 
awareness, and a healthy 
workforce promote 
accountability, boost 
productivity, and improve 
satisfaction. This visible 
commitment enhances 
credibility, strengthens 
partnerships, and builds 
stakeholder confidence in 
long-term value creation.
We are committed to 
upholding the highest 
standards of ethical conduct 
and integrity. Our Directors 
and senior management 
adhere to a stringent Code of 
Conduct and Ethics. Robust 
internal control systems and 
a well-established whistle-
blower mechanism are in place 
to support transparency and 
accountability.
The effectiveness and 
adequacy of these systems 
are periodically reviewed by 
the Management Assurance 
and Risk Management teams. 
Furthermore, continuous 
monitoring mechanisms 
are employed to ensure 
compliance with our Code of 
Ethics. A multilingual helpline 
is also available to facilitate 
confidential reporting under 
the Whistle-blower and 
Reporting framework, thereby 
reinforcing our commitment 
to an ethical and inclusive 
workplace.
Risk: Negative

Corporate

7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, 
and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
It is with great pride that I present Suzlon’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which reflects our 
unwavering commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and our continued efforts to embed 
sustainability across all facets of our business. In FY 2024–25, we placed particular emphasis on enhancing Product 
Stewardship, with several key initiatives highlighting our commitment to delivering not only best-in-class products but also 
those grounded in climate consciousness and social responsibility. Through a comprehensive Double Materiality Assessment, 
we engaged key internal stakeholders to identify the most critical material topics that will shape and guide our sustainability 
priorities moving forward.
Environmental Stewardship
Our journey in product stewardship has seen significant progress with the successful completion of Product Carbon Footprint 
(PCF) assessments, along with third-party verification, and Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) studies for our S120 and S144 
turbines, well ahead of our commitment to complete them by 2026. Furthermore, we have also completed PCF reporting and 
third-party verification for our castings. We remain steadfast in our commitments not just at the organizational level but also at 
the product level. We are proud to have established a global benchmark by achieving low-carbon certification on a Cradle-to-
Grave basis, with a PCF of only 6.17 gCO₂e/kWh of electricity generation for the S144-3.0 Wind Turbine Generator model. This 
certification, and our extensive efforts to strengthen product stewardship, is a testament to our focus on resource optimization, 
the use of low-carbon raw materials, local sourcing within India (with 83.25% of Tier-1 critical suppliers based locally), and 
enhanced traceability along the supply chain.
These achievements demonstrate our dedication to providing clean energy solutions with reduced environmental impacts 
throughout the product lifecycle. By adopting internationally recognised best practices and third-party verified methodologies, 
we are setting new benchmarks for responsible manufacturing in the renewable energy sector.
Simultaneously, we have undertaken a comprehensive climate risk assessment to enhance our strategic resilience. This 
assessment helped us identify and address both physical and transition risks associated with climate change, thereby aligning 
our business continuity planning and investment decisions with long-term environmental sustainability.
We continue to monitor our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, and waste generation and management 
practices closely, ensuring a net positive environmental impact across operations. Our efforts and actions across locations have 
enabled us to meet our objectives much ahead of the targeted timelines. We have recorded a reduction in energy intensity, 
waste intensity, water intensity, and GHG emissions scope 1 and 2 intensities as compared to the previous year, reflecting 
the effective implementation of environmentally conscious practices across all our locations. Water and waste recycling 
initiatives have been implemented at all applicable sites. Furthermore, we have achieved 90.14% Zero Waste to Landfill as 
against our target of 100% in 2028. Emissions reduction remains a core priority, particularly through the transition to renewable 
energy sources across our manufacturing facilities. We have taken aggressive targets of RE100 by 2030, EV 100 by 2035 and 
Net Zero (including Scope 3) by 2035 aligned to our ongoing commitments towards Responsible Generation.

Social Impact
At Suzlon, we recognise that our success is deeply interconnected with the well-being of the communities we serve. We 
continue to prioritise local procurement, invest in supplier capacity-building, and conduct ESG assessments to ensure our 
supply chain reflects our core values. We are now a member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and due to our 
consistent efforts in strengthening our sustainable supply chain, we have received UNGC’s Faster Award for Sustainable 
Supply Chain. In FY 2024–25, we provided targeted sustainability training to our suppliers, advancing our efforts to 
decarbonise the broader value chain. Furthermore, we have carried out assessments of 91.1% Tier-1 critical suppliers not only 
for alignment with BRSR but also on 7-pillar evaluation and assessment methodology. We have also evaluated Risk of suppliers 
based on commodity and geographies.
Our approach to community development is participatory and need-based, focusing on livelihood enhancement, healthcare, 
and education. These programs are underpinned by strong grievance redressal mechanisms, fostering trust, accountability, 
and responsiveness. Through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs, we aim to foster long-term partnerships with 
communities and ensure meaningful, measurable impact across all areas of engagement.
Internally, we remain committed to employee development by creating an enabling environment that encourages upskilling and 
upward mobility within the organisation.
Governance Excellence
A culture of strong governance forms the foundation of our operations. Over the past year, we have further strengthened our 
internal policies to promote transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct across all project sites and business functions. We 
continue to build institutional capabilities to ensure full compliance with regulatory requirements while driving internal alignment 
with our sustainability goals.
In FY 2024–25, we conducted targeted training and awareness sessions on key ESG topics for our Board of Directors and 
senior management, ensuring alignment at the highest level of the organisation with our sustainability objectives and targets. 
We have provided training to 100% Board members on NGBRC and POSH.
Looking Ahead
As we move forward, we remain focused on reducing emissions across our product lifecycle and value chain, embedding 
ESG performance into core business operations, enhancing stakeholder engagement through capacity-building initiatives, 
awareness sessions, robust grievance redressal mechanisms, and transparent disclosures. Enhancing climate resilience, Human 
rights awareness, supplier due diligence, and responsible sourcing will continue to be key areas of focus as we strive for 
holistic, inclusive growth.
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report is not only a reflection of our progress but a reaffirmation of our purpose. 
We thank you for your continued trust and support, and we look forward to building a greener, more equitable future—together.

this commitment is met
	
HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment): Hazard identification and risk assessment involve evaluating the 
risks associated with both routine and non-routine activities. Hazards are assessed using a rating scale, with the risk 
score derived from multiplying the severity and probability of the hazard. Critical risks are rated from P1xS4 to P4xS4, 
while moderate and low risks are categorized as significant (P1xS3 to P4xS2) and insignificant (P1xS1), respectively.
	
PPE (Personal Protective Equipment): Management is responsible for ensuring the proper use of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) by the workforce and enforcing compliance with PPE protocols. Procedures are in place for maintaining 
an inventory of PPE, conducting inspections, and ensuring that adequate PPE is available at all times.
	
Training: The organization provides both general and specific training programs to ensure the safety of its employees and 
those in the value chain. General training modules include induction, first aid, firefighting, and emergency preparedness, 
among others. Specific training includes work at height, confined space entry, energy isolation/LOTO, and electrically 
qualified professional training. Additionally, mock drill sessions, lifesaving training, and other safety-related trainings 
are conducted regularly as per the training calendar. Defensive driving training was conducted for both light and heavy 
motor vehicle drivers, with GPS systems added to all light motor vehicles. Specialized third-party training is provided 
for crane safety, Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS), and GWO protocols. The SWIFT program trained 500 new employees 
this year, involving a 20-day training module and 67 mandatory certifications before being allowed on-site.
	
Safety Committee: The organization ensures that employees are empowered to refuse work in hazardous situations 
until a sufficient safe work system is established. Employees can notify the respective site or plant in-charge about 
any hazards. The safety committee, consisting of both management and worker representatives (including contract 
personnel), meets regularly to address health and safety concerns. The committee must have 50% representation from 
each side and is led by the respective plant head or project manager. The workers’ representative advocates for worker 
safety, while the management representative focuses on implementing and improving safety measures.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the process for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Suzlon Group places strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement as a core element of its business strategy, recognizing 
the need to address their concerns effectively. By actively engaging with stakeholders, the company seeks to address 
social, environmental, and governance challenges linked to its operations. Suzlon values stakeholder input and incorporates 
their feedback into strategic planning, contributing to the continuous improvement of its internal systems and processes. 
The team maintains regular dialogue with a broad spectrum of stakeholders who may be affected by its decisions. These 
interactions help identify stakeholder priorities, enabling the development of targeted and practical solutions. Suzlon 
ensures that all necessary procedures and protocols are followed to implement these solutions effectively.
	
Suzlon has already undertaken Impact Materiality in FY 23-24. It has also conducted a Double Materiality Assessment in 
FY 2024-25 to identify the financial, reputational, and operational implications of key environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) risks and opportunities for stakeholders across the organization. The assessment involved participation from 
stakeholders across various business and functional units and will serve as a key input in shaping the company’s strategy 
and decision-making processes. Suzlon has strategically elevated its sustainability governance by adopting this Double 
Materiality Assessment (DMA) framework, aligning with the latest EFRAG–ESRS guidelines. This approach integrates both 
impact materiality (how Suzlon affects people and the environment) and financial materiality (how sustainability-related 
risks and opportunities affect Suzlon’s enterprise value), offering a comprehensive lens for ESG risk management and 
long-term value creation.
	
Suzlon has established a comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement Policy aimed at strengthening communication, fostering 
trust, and ensuring equitable benefits for all stakeholders. This policy defines our strategy for meaningful engagement, 
with a strong focus on transparency and relationship-building. Through stakeholder engagement, Suzlon aims to identify 
and address social, environmental, and governance issues related to its business. The Company is of the view that it is 
important to develop an understanding of its stakeholders’ needs, interests and expectations and the Company strives to 
accomplish this by collaborating and communicating with all of the stakeholder groups. Effective stakeholder engagement 
is an ongoing process. By encouraging active stakeholder participation in decision-making processes, we promote mutual 
trust and nurture long-lasting, collaborative relationships.

Suzlon’s stakeholder engagement process is built on extensive and direct consultation with a wide range of stakeholder 
groups. This process enables the company to identify critical issues that require prompt attention. To ensure effective 
engagement, Suzlon utilizes multiple communication channels, including emails, e-portals, Community Advisory Panel 
(CAP) meetings, questionnaires, and personal visits. This multi-channel approach supports a thorough understanding of 
stakeholder perspectives, helping Suzlon to accurately identify key concerns and assess their significance. It also enables 
the company to gain deeper insights into the issues raised and respond effectively.
	
Within the wind energy sector, diverse stakeholders contribute significantly to the industry. It is imperative to interact with 
these stakeholders to ensure success as well as sustainability of wind energy projects. Apart from internal stakeholders 
such as staff and leadership, who participate in different meetings, forums, and surveys, Suzlon engages with the following 
key external stakeholders focusing on environmental, social, and governance matters:
	
Government Officials and Regulatory Bodies – Suzlon engages with government authorities through formal meetings 
and industry forums to stay abreast of evolving policies, regulatory frameworks, and incentive schemes related to wind 
energy development. These interactions also serve as a platform to advocate for progressive and enabling policy 
measures that support the growth of renewable energy.
	
Local Communities – Engagement with local communities is conducted through public consultations and structured 
community outreach initiatives. Suzlon prioritizes transparent communication, offering clear information about the 
socio-economic and environmental benefits of wind energy and related community investments. Community feedback 
is actively sought during both the planning and operational phases of projects. Continuous dialogue is maintained to 
address concerns, foster trust, and keep stakeholders informed of project milestones and progress.
	
Investors – Suzlon maintains strategic relationships with investors through regular meetings and presentations of well-
structured, compelling business cases for wind energy projects. These communications include detailed insights into 
return on investment, risk assessment, and overall project viability. Comprehensive financial and technical reports are 
shared to ensure transparency and build investor confidence, thereby fostering long-term partnerships grounded in 
trust and reliability.
	
Suppliers and Contractors – Collaborations with suppliers and contractors are anchored in mutual cooperation and 
efficient communication. Regular coordination ensures the timely procurement and delivery of equipment and materials, 
as well as strict adherence to quality benchmarks. Suzlon promotes a collaborative environment to ensure seamless 
execution and operational excellence throughout the project lifecycle.
	
Environmental Groups – Suzlon actively consults with environmental organizations to identify and mitigate potential 
impacts on local ecosystems, wildlife, and habitats. The company implements environmentally responsible practices 
aimed at minimizing ecological disruption while promoting long-term sustainability. Regular sharing of environmental 
monitoring data and reports underscores Suzlon’s commitment to transparency and stewardship.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The responsibility for engaging stakeholders on Sustainability and ESG matters lies with the respective departments 
across the organization. These departments ensure ongoing dialogue and collaboration with stakeholders. In line with 
our long-term ESG strategy, we adopt a consistent approach, leveraging these consultations to guide our preparation and 
actions. Key issues are identified and prioritized based on their relevance and impact on both our stakeholders and the 
business. We maintain regular engagement with our stakeholders to understand and assess their needs and expectations. 
This ongoing dialogue supports our commitment to building strong, trustworthy relationships. The feedback we receive 
is actively integrated into our decision-making processes, enabling us to create value for all stakeholders.
	
Furthermore, we maintain transparency in our engagement with external stakeholders by regularly updating ESG-related 
disclosures on the Suzlon website. The ESG disclosures and survey on inputs and materiality assessment from all external 
stakeholders is available throughout the year and Suzlon enacts on data collection, survey and analysis of feedback 
received from external stakeholders. Additionally, the CSR & ESG committee meetings at Board level are responsible for 
taking all decisions on ESG matters for ongoing implementation of the strategy and to take decisions for alignment with 
long-term roadmap.
	
The process under implementation involves identifying key stakeholders based on their relevance and influence on the 
organization’s operations. This includes customers, employees, value chain workers, suppliers, investors, local communities, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), media representatives, and regulatory authorities. The stakeholder mapping 
exercise involved categorizing stakeholders according to their interests, level of influence, and potential impact on the 
company’s strategic and operational decisions.
	
This systematic approach enabled Suzlon to prioritize its engagement efforts effectively. A diverse array of consultation 
channels is employed—including surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, public meetings, digital platforms, and 
structured dialogues—to ensure inclusive and meaningful engagement. The insights and feedback gathered through these 
consultations are consolidated and reported to the Executive Governance Body (EG), thereby integrating stakeholder 
perspectives into the company’s decision-making processes.
	
Annual General Meetings (AGMs) further serve as a platform for stakeholders, including shareholders and other interested 
parties, to raise concerns and ask questions directly to the Board and senior management. Suzlon has established a 
feedback mechanism, in the form of a dedicated email address, through which stakeholders can provide comments, 
suggestions, or complaints directly to the Company. The response from the company is also provided in requisite timelines.
	
Suzlon has recently enhanced its materiality assessment framework by incorporating financial materiality through a double 
materiality approach. This advancement enables the organization to systematically evaluate the financial implications 
of external events on its operations. The assessment process involved active participation from multiple business units 
across Suzlon, with material topics evaluated in alignment with the specific functions and responsibilities of each unit. 
This structured methodology ensures that consultation efforts are strategically directed toward the most critical issues. 
Insights gathered through stakeholder consultations play a pivotal role in shaping the organization’s strategic direction 
and decision-making processes. These engagements also serve as a catalyst for continuous enhancement of Suzlon’s 
economic, environmental, and social performance.
	
The consultation processes between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social matters are 
also overseen on ongoing basis by the Suzlon Foundation—an independent entity incorporated as a Section 8 Company, 
entrusted with the responsibility of leading Suzlon’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. These consultation 
mechanisms are designed to be transparent and are firmly grounded in Suzlon’s core values: Agility, Creativity, Value 
Addition, Commitment, and Integrity.
	
Beyond direct stakeholder engagement, the Suzlon Foundation—acting on behalf of the Suzlon Group—actively 
collaborates with external stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), industry associations, and 
subject matter experts. These partnerships facilitate the exchange of valuable insights and feedback on material topics.

Annual Report 2024-25
Through transparent, inclusive, and purpose-driven dialogue, Suzlon ensures that its decisions are well-informed and 
aligned with the long-term interests of both the organization and its stakeholders.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation serves as a critical mechanism for identifying, managing, and addressing key environmental 
and social issues at Suzlon. The detailed Impact Materiality Assessment was undertaken after involvement of all internal 
and external stakeholders to consolidate inputs related to ESG topics that are of relevance to Suzlon across all BU’s. The 
material topics were further taken up to plan Sustainability strategy and roadmap for short-term, mid-term and long-term.
	
In the previous reporting cycle i.e. FY 23-24; Suzlon conducted an impact materiality assessment, focusing on how its 
operations effect the environment and society in accordance with detailed Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality 
Assessment (SEMA). In FY 24-25, Suzlon has transitioned to a double materiality approach by adding financial materiality 
to its assessment. This allows Suzlon to evaluate not only how it impacts the environment and society, but also how 
sustainability issues may affect its financial outcomes. It serves as relevance to the organization as it determines material 
topics with sustainability-related risks or opportunities that could influence the company’s future cash flow, enterprise 
value, or overall business performance.
	
FY 2024–25, Suzlon conducted a comprehensive Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) to evaluate both internal 
and external ESG topics of significance to the organization. It is aligned with the latest EFRAG–ESRS guidelines. This 
approach integrates both impact materiality (how Suzlon affects people and the environment) and financial materiality (how 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities affect Suzlon’s enterprise value), offering a comprehensive lens for ESG risk 
management and long-term value creation. All 19 topics from the previous impact assessment were retained and reviewed 
for continued relevance and targeted Stakeholder Engagement was carried out during Double Materiality Assessment 
which provided focused insights on financial materiality.
	
This assessment offered valuable insights into the impact and financial materiality of each material topic across various 
business units. The resulting materiality matrix now plays a pivotal role in shaping Suzlon’s strategic focus and resource 
allocation, ensuring concentrated efforts on the most critical areas. Based on inputs from internal stakeholders regarding 
the risks and opportunities associated with each material topic, structured roadmaps are being developed to mitigate 
identified risks and strengthen potential opportunities. Stakeholder feedback has significantly influenced the direction 
and content of Suzlon’s sustainability disclosures, including the double materiality assessment. These insights are central 
to identifying, validating, and prioritising ESG topics within the Company’s sustainability agenda.
	
Suzlon also maintains an ongoing feedback mechanism with employees and workers regarding safety conditions at our 
operational sites. This feedback is systematically reviewed, and appropriate mitigation measures are implemented to 
uphold a safe and secure working environment for all personnel involved in Suzlon’s operations.
	
The Suzlon Foundation, a Section 8 Company established to lead the Group’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives, plays a central role in engaging with underprivileged and marginalised communities. The Foundation’s 
programs span diverse thematic areas and are guided by continuous dialogue with vulnerable stakeholder groups. These 
consultations have provided crucial insights into environmental and social issues that are material to both the organisation 
and the communities we serve.
	
The community engagement efforts are fundamentally rooted in stakeholder consultation. Inputs from local communities 
have been instrumental in designing initiatives that are responsive to their unique needs and challenges. Similarly, feedback 
from employees—an integral stakeholder group—has informed initiatives focused on well-being, work-life balance, diversity 
and inclusion, and occupational health and safety.
	
To facilitate open dialogue, Suzlon has institutionalized regular engagement platforms such as stakeholder forums, 
roundtable discussions, and public consultations. These are complemented by grievance redressal and issue resolution 
mechanisms, which ensure that all stakeholder concerns are addressed transparently and in a timely manner. This inclusive, 
consultative approach not only strengthens trust and accountability but also enhances Suzlon’s capacity to respond

proactively to emerging environmental and social risks—thereby creating long-term value for both the company and 
its stakeholders.
	
Stakeholder engagement and consultations enable us to achieve the following objectives:
	
Enhanced Risk Visibility: The DMA identifies ESG risks that could materially impact Suzlon’s financial performance, 
including regulatory shifts, reputational exposure, and operational disruptions.
	
Strategic Opportunity Mapping: It highlights areas where Suzlon can unlock financial, reputational, and operational 
values such as climate leadership, supply chain resilience, and innovation in low-carbon technologies.
	
Investor-Grade ESG Insights: The assessment supports more robust, transparent, and investor-relevant disclosures, 
aligning with global reporting expectations and sustainable finance frameworks.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Suzlon has proactively engaged with vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups to ensure their voices are heard 
and their concerns meaningfully addressed. Through direct consultations, we have gained valuable insights into their 
unique needs, challenges, and aspirations within their local contexts. These engagements help shape our inclusive and 
community-focused approach to sustainability.
	
While the primary aim of stakeholder engagement is to foster support, it is important to recognize that the inclusion of 
marginalized stakeholders’ voices should not be contingent upon alignment with the organization’s views or objectives. 
At Suzlon, we acknowledge and respect differing perspectives. Our community outreach initiatives are designed to 
genuinely understand and incorporate the interests of external communities, including vulnerable and marginalized groups, 
irrespective of consensus or dissent.
	
The following steps are being implemented at Suzlon to ensure no impacts on marginalized/vulnerable groups:
	
Identification and mapping
	
The first step is to identify and map the marginalized communities that are relevant to the project or initiative. This means 
doing a thorough stakeholder analysis that considers the diversity, complexity, and dynamics of the different groups 
and subgroups that are affected by or can affect work. It is being carried out using tools such as stakeholder matrices to 
categorize and prioritize stakeholders based on their level of interest, influence, impact, and vulnerability. The consultation 
with existing networks, organizations, or representatives of marginalized communities is also being carried out to gain a 
deeper understanding of their context, culture, and concerns.
	
Engage and consult
	
The next step being adhered is to engage and consult with the marginalized communities in a meaningful and respectful 
way. This means designing and implementing a stakeholder engagement strategy that is tailored to their specific needs, 
preferences, and capacities. We are using various methods and channels to communicate and interact with them, such as 
surveys, interviews, focus groups, workshops, forums, or online platforms.
	
Involve and collaborate
	
The final step being followed is to involve and collaborate with the marginalized communities in the decision-making and 
implementation of projects or initiatives. This means creating and facilitating opportunities for them to contribute their 
ideas, opinions, feedback, and solutions to the issues and challenges that affect them. Suzlon uses participatory methods 
and tools to co-create, co-design, or co-deliver work with them, such as prototyping, testing, or monitoring. Suzon also 
recognizes and values their knowledge, skills, and experiences, and provides them with the necessary resources, support, 
and recognition to enable their participation and empowerment.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
Suzlon prioritizes sustainable development and the involvement of all stakeholders in its journey of sustainability. The 
community holds significant importance as a stakeholder.
	
Establishing a grievance mechanism for impacted communities is crucial for handling and resolving project-related 
grievances effectively. By implementing a robust grievance handling procedure, the organization can maintain a 
harmonious environment.
	
The primary objective of the grievance redressal mechanism is to provide communities with a local avenue for resolving 
issues, offering an alternative to external dispute resolution processes such as legal or administrative systems.
	
The mechanism to receive and redress grievances of the community is defined as below:
	
Any individual belonging to the Community has the right to raise a grievance. The term “Community” in this context includes 
the Members residing in the village where the wind turbine or factory is situated, as well as the villages through which 
there is transit for business purposes. However, it does not include employees, vendors, or suppliers who may reside in 
the village, as they have alternative mechanisms to address their grievances. The affected Community Members have the 
option to raise their grievances with the relevant competent Authority, such as the Site in-charge, area in-charge, section 
in-charge, project Manager, or Heads of departments. Furthermore, the affected Community can choose to raise their 
grievance through various modes, including telephone, email, or direct meetings.
	
The Grievance can be officially registered in accordance with Grievance Redressal Procedure adopted by Suzlon. 
Furthermore, the External Grievances related to Community can also be captured through a helpline (available in multi-
lingual mode) which enables an additional mechanism to capture and address community related grievances, if any
	
Registering the Grievance: The Suzlon employees from manufacturing locations/project sites/operations who receives 
a complaint is required to report it to the state CSR Manager within 48 hours of receiving the complaint. The complaint 
should include the complainant’s name, address, phone number, details of the issue, and the desired resolution. Even if 
the complaint does not initially appear to be a grievance, it is still documented for review by the committee to determine 
its eligibility.
	
Grievance resolution: The complaint is reviewed by the appropriate individuals from the Grievance Redressal Cell, as 
designated by the relevant committee member of the department, and a formal response will be provided to the complainant 
within 45 days. If the response is not acceptable to the complainant, then it will be escalated, and the grievance redressal 
committee of the company will respond to the complainant within 15 days.
