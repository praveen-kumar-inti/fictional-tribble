Grievance Redressal Mechanism in Place
Communities
ITC’s Social Investments Programme (SIP) team takes up Annual Community Engagement to 
capture the views, issues, complaints and grievances of community members pertaining to 
the projects implemented by SIP team, in addition to periodical need assessments and regular 
interactions with all stakeholders. The major stakeholders of SIP being communities for whom 
the programmes are implemented, this engagement focusses on primarily getting their feedback. 
This annual engagement happens typically during February/March every year, and their resolution 
tends to happen in the subsequent financial year.  
During 2023-24, 42 such community engagements were held across major states where SIP 
projects are implemented – Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, 
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, 
Uttarakhand and West Bengal. These were conducted by ITC SIP team’s state level Managers. 
Meetings were organised with community members in villages and urban catchments wherein the 
programme implementing NGOs were also present. All meetings were planned and reviewed by 
the SIP team at Head Office.
6 cases of grievances (mainly as requests for further interventions and scope of improvement) 
were reported pertaining to the projects under SIP. The SIP state teams have taken cognisance 
of the relevant requests and expectations and appropriate actions have been incorporated in the 
plans for the upcoming year.

1.
Climate 
Change 
Risk
Climate related 
physical and 
transition risks 
may impact 
business 
operations, 
sourcing, supply 
chain and increase 
compliance costs. 
Risk Mitigation Strategy 
Physical Risk 
Management:
• Usage of contemporary 
climate risk modelling 
tools for identifying 
high-risk/vulnerable 
sites and agri value 
chains, and undertaking 
detailed assessments 
for developing locally 
contextual adaptation 
plans, risk mitigation 
strategies and 
undertaking measures 
for improving climate 
resilience;
•	Promotion of climate 
smart agriculture, and 
development of heat/
drought tolerant and 
high yielding varieties to 
improve productivity by 
adopting micro region-
specific agronomic 
practices:
-	Developing region-
specific package of 
practices and promoting 
climate smart farming 
techniques to mitigate 
impact of weather;
-	Enhancing climate 
resilience of farmers 
through capacity 
building programmes by 
leveraging ITCMAARS and 
the Farmers’ Producer 
Organisation (FPO) 
ecosystem, supported 
by field demonstrations 
under Choupal 
Pradarshan Khets;
-	Comprehensive 
programmes on social 
forestry, soil and moisture 
conservation and 
biodiversity conservation;
Potential impact
• As average temperatures 
rise, extreme weather 
events are expected to 
grow in terms of severity 
and frequency which could 
have significant impact on 
the Company’s operations, 
its physical assets and 
agri value chains. These 
may lead to complete or 
partial outage of operations. 
Further, these events may 
also adversely impact the 
availability and quality of 
agri raw materials and 
consequently, the production 
and sales of the Company’s 
products;
•	Vagaries of weather caused 
by climate change may 
impact crop cycles, output 
and productivity resulting 
in disruption of operations/
supply chain;
•	Availability of water for 
own operations as well 
as agri value chains may 
be adversely impacted 
by erratic precipitation 
patterns;
•	Besides physical risks, 
transition risks associated 
with climate change, may 
impact the Company’s 
operations:
-	Additional levies may be 
imposed by regulatory 
authorities for emission/
water intensive industries 
to address climate change, 
resulting in higher cost of 
compliance, and potential 
regulatory penalties and 
reputational risk in case of 
non-compliance.

Management:
•	Continue to focus on energy 
conservation, improving 
energy productivity and 
enhancing the share of 
renewables in ITC’s total 
energy requirement as part 
of ITC’s Sustainability 2.0 
targets; 
•	Strengthen governance 
mechanisms for reviewing 
performance and progress 
against Sustainability 
2.0 targets through the 
Sustainability Compliance 
and Review Committee 
(SCRC);
•	Adopt the Life-Cycle 
Assessment (LCA) approach 
to evaluate the potential 
environmental impacts of 
products during their entire 
lifecycle; leverage the same 
for designing sustainable 
products and offering 
the same to consumers 
anchored on scientific and

and Plastic 
Packaging 
Risk
Difficulty in 
complying with 
current or future 
regulation on 
plastic packaging 
and/or failure to 
meet commitments 
on packaging and 
the environment.
Risk Mitigation Strategy 
• Going beyond compliance 
wherever possible: 
-	Ensuring plastic neutrality 
ahead of regulatory 
targets through 
source segregation 
programmes, creating 
replicable, scalable and 
sustainable models of 
solid waste management, 
and developing viable 
recycling options for 
Multi-Layered Plastic 
(MLP) packaging. 
Additionally undertaking 
third party assurance of 
underlying data related to 
plastic waste generation 
and collection;
-	Ensuring a robust 
compliance management 
system supported by 
internal and external 
process review;
•	Partnering with upstream 
players and suppliers 
for ensuring supply 
of recycled plastic for 
meeting regulatory/
market demand for 
increasing recycled 
content in plastic 
packaging; 
•	Harnessing the enterprise 
strengths of ITC (Life 
Sciences and Technology 
Centre, Paperboards 
& Specialty Paper 
Division and Packaging 
and Printing Division) 
in driving cutting-edge 
innovation to offer 
sustainable alternatives 
to single use plastics. 
Pursue sustainable 
packaging initiatives 
like reduction in plastic 
packaging intensity and 
improving recyclability of 
plastic packaging.
Potential impact
•Non-compliance with 
plastic waste management 
regulations could lead to 
imposition of environmental 
compensation, that may 
negatively impact Company’s 
reputation. Additionally, 
stricter government laws 
around usage of plastics 
including bans may give 
rise to multiple challenges 
such as redesign of product 
packaging, shelf life- and 
product distribution related 
issues;
•Disruptions in the supply 
chain for recycled plastic 
or plastic packaging 
substitutes as required 
by law, could impact the 
Company’s ability to comply, 
produce and distribute 
products; 
•Inability to provide 
sustainable alternatives 
could have a negative impact 
on consumer sentiment.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like specific energy consumption, specific 
greenhouse gas emissions, specific water intake and specific waste generation. 
In order to achieve these targets, all ITC Units have established management 
systems which entail regular monitoring of environmental KPIs, development of 
an environmental management plan, and reviewing progress on a regular basis to 
ensure that Businesses are on track with respect to the agreed roadmap.

The Company’s state-of-the-art ITC Life Sciences and 
Technology Centre (LSTC) in Bengaluru is at the core 
of driving science-led product innovation to support 
and build ITC’s portfolio of world-class brands. 
ITC LSTC’s research and development initiatives 
are equipped with world-class scientific platforms 
and centres of excellence that not only help deliver 
superior differentiated value to consumers but also 
improvements in environmental and social impacts, 
some of which are summarised below -
Agroforestry and Crop Sciences: Agroforestry, one of 
LSTC’s key expertise, involves working on productivity 
improvement of trees by using contemporary research 
tools for Eucalyptus, Casuarina, Corymbia, and Subabul 
species. LSTC has released several new clones for all 
the four species, aimed at improving productivity and 
catering to the sourcing needs of ITC’s paper business. 
Last year, 12.8 million new clones with improved 
productivity were distributed to farmers. Crop sciences 
team is involved in development of crops such as 
Tobacco, Wheat and Potato that would help in meeting 
targets of climate resilience and farmer profitability 
with enhanced yield and quality. 
Sustainable Packaging & Material Sciences: This 
vertical works on reducing the impact of single-use 
plastics and plastic packaging by focusing on suitable 
alternatives, improving recyclability of multi-layered 
plastic packaging, and increasing the use of recycled 
content, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of 
packaging. LSTC is deeply engaged in developing 
innovative packaging solutions by improving functional 
barrier properties of paper, paper board and flexibles.
Health, Wellness and Nutrition: Wellness platform 
focuses on multiple aspects of human health stratified 
across age, gender, specific health concerns as well as 
uniqueness of the Indian consumer. LSTC, over the last 
decade, has been instrumental in creating scientifically 
validated solutions catering to areas such as diabetes, 
cardiovascular health, weight management, gut 
health, immunity, brain health, women’s health, 
kids’ health, targeted nutrition as well as various 
concerns associated with ageing. Solutions range from 
delivering benefits in various product formats including 
nutraceuticals. Scientific due diligence as well as 
clinical efficacy has helped in generating health claims 
and in providing nutrition, nourishment, health and 
wellness to the Indian consumer.
Apart from the above, various businesses of the 
Company also engage in focussed interventions in 
the areas of crop development, plastic substitution, 
sustainable packaging etc.

for a commercial transaction, or (b) an employee is in a position to benefit someone with whom he/she has a close 
relationship, in relation to the Company’s business. However, this is an area in which it is impossible to provide 
comprehensive guidance, but the guiding principle is that conflict, if any, or any potential conflict must be disclosed to 
higher management for guidance and action as appropriate.
Further, the Directors of the Company are required to disclose to the Board whether they, directly or indirectly or on 
behalf of third parties, have material interest in any transaction or matter directly affecting the Company. In addition, 
an annual confirmation is sought from the Directors in this connection. For the financial year 2023-24, all Directors of 
the Company have confirmed that they did not, either directly or indirectly or on behalf of third parties, have material 
interest in any transaction or matter, directly affecting the Company.

2.a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
Yes, there are procedures in place for sustainable sourcing. ITC has a Board approved Policy on ‘Sustainable Supply 
Chain and Responsible Sourcing’ and a ‘Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Service Providers’. The Code reflects ITC’s 
commitment to environmental conservation, business integrity and human rights across the supply chain. It upholds 
the spirit outlined in the International Labour Organisation Guidelines and United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. All suppliers are encouraged to fully comply with the Code. Additionally, ITC businesses, 
including Agri, FMCG and Paper Businesses, depend on farm and forestry-based supply chains for key raw materials. 
Accordingly, focus of ITC’s interventions in agri value chains has been largely around improving farmer livelihoods, 
increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening regional water security, and addressing the challenge of climate 
change and enhancing resilience. ITC’s key agri value chains are also certified as per global standards like Rainforest 
Alliance (RFA), Forest Stewardship Council®, Fairtrade, India Organic, USDA Organic and Bio-Suisse. These 
certifications specify environmental and social standards for agricultural practices, and help ensure sustainability, 
traceability and transparency across value chains. 
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing practices pertaining to key agri value chains and key value chain 
partners like third-party manufacturers, refer to ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Agriculture’ and ‘Sustainable Supply 
Chain and Responsible Sourcing’ sections of ITC Sustainability Report 2024.
b.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
ITC businesses, including Agri, FMCG and Paper Businesses, depend on farm and forestry-based supply chains for 
key raw materials. Accordingly, farmers constitute a vital part of ITC’s supply chain, and the Company engages with 
farmers to ensure adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. ITC’s key agri value chains are also certified as per 
global standards like Rainforest Alliance (RFA), Forest Stewardship Council®, Fairtrade, India Organic, USDA Organic 
and Bio-Suisse.
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing practices pertaining to key agri value chains and key value chain 
partners like third-party manufacturers, refer to ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Agriculture’ and ‘Sustainable Supply

Company’s key products from Paperboards and Specialty Papers Business, Personal Care Products Business, Branded 
Packaged Foods Business and Matches & Agarbattis Business for identifying additional opportunities to reduce 
environmental impact across the value chain. These assessments have enabled identification of concrete solutions 
towards more efficient packaging designs, and loading efficiencies in transportation. Studies conducted on the 
selected products also provided valuable insights which are duly considered for new product development and design. 
Additionally, during the year, capacity building programmes were conducted for practitioners across ITC Businesses 
and LSTC in order to further strengthen the application of LCAs at product design stage itself including interventions 
related to using alternative raw materials/formulations, manufacturing processes, and packaging, and minimising 
use phase and end-of-life impacts.

Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent 
Workers
Yes, ITC’s Grievance Redressal Procedure is available to employees and workers. The objective of the policy 
is to facilitate open and structured discussion on employees’ work-related grievances with the intent of 
ensuring that the grievance is dealt with in a fair and just manner whilst being in compliance with the 
Company’s policies. ITC’s open-door practices encourage an amicable and fair resolution of grievances. 
Employees are encouraged to first discuss the grievance with their immediate reporting authority, and 
attempt to arrive at a resolution before invoking a formal grievance redressal mechanism. In Unionised 
Units, grievances of workmen are also taken up for discussion by Union Office Bearers and resolved 
through dialogue with human resources managers and other designated managers. Units also have 
Committees with joint representation of workers and managers, which address grievances raised by one or 
more workers. In addition, many Units have forums where workers interact with the unit leadership team in 
small groups and share any suggestions or grievances they may have, for resolution.
The Company’s Whistleblower Policy is also available for the permanent employees.
Other than 
Permanent 
Workers
The Whistleblower Policy of the Company encourages  all employees to bring to the Company’s attention, 
instances of illegal or unethical conduct, actual or suspected incidents of fraud, actions that affect 
the financial integrity of the Company, or actual or suspected instances of leak of unpublished price 
sensitive information that could adversely impact the Company’s operations, business performance and/
or reputation. In terms of the said Policy, the Company investigates such incidents, when reported, in an 
impartial manner and takes appropriate action to ensure that the requisite standards of professional and 
ethical conduct are always upheld. This Policy can be accessed on the Company’s corporate website at

*A vast majority of women workers are based in manufacturing units which currently do not have union representation 
These are units that were commissioned in the recent past. ITC believes that all employees are important stakeholders 
in the enterprise, and it is imperative to build a culture of mutual trust and respect, interdependence, and meaningful 
engagement. This approach helps in building, strengthening and sustaining harmonious employee relations across the 
organisation. It is ITC’s policy:
• To respect the dignity of the individual and the freedom of employees to lawfully organise themselves into interest groups, 
independent of supervision by the management
• To ensure that employees are not discriminated against for exercising this freedom in a lawful manner and consistent with 
ITC’s core values

10. Health and Safety Management System:
a.	 Whether an Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System has been implemented by the 
Entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes, ITC has implemented occupational health and safety 
management system in all its Factories, Hotels, Offices 
and Warehouses. ITC endeavours that Environment, 
Health & Safety (EHS) standards at all its units are ahead 
of applicable legislation and regulations, Standards 
and Codes, and are benchmarked against international 
best practices across sectors in which it operates. ITC’s 
approach to occupational health & safety standards is 
articulated in the Board approved Environment, Health and 
Safety Policy. It is based on an EHS management system 
that emphasises on enhancing EHS performance by setting 
objectives and targets and continually monitoring key 
performance indicators.
Further, the Company promotes a culture of safety 
through behaviour change programmes and by providing 
appropriate training to employees as well as service 
providers’ employees, while continually investing in 
state-of-the-art technology and in developing human 
capital.
EHS requirements are integrated at the design stage for 
all new investments. Compliance with EHS standards 
during the construction phase as well as in operation 
phase of ITC units, Hotels, Warehouses and Offices is 
ensured by implementing project EHS management 
systems and through established EHS management 
systems with designated roles and responsibilities for 
competent resources, respectively.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
ITC has identified the EHS Risk Management framework as 
one of the integral steps towards building a robust safety 
management system in all its factories, hotels, offices and 
warehouses. This framework entails a set of processes for 
continual risk identification, assessment and mitigation, 
with active participation of the workforce in each of its 
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024

facilities. Shop floor processes in this regard include hazard 
spotting tours, suggestion schemes, daily briefings and 
periodic EHS Committee meetings in which employees 
participate. In addition, all ITC Units undergo periodic 
Environment, Health & Safety audits at the Business as well 
as Corporate level which endeavours to identify additional 
latent risks besides verifying compliance with standards. 
Several national awards and certifications acknowledge 
ITC’s commitment and efforts towards providing a safe and 
healthy workplace to all.
c.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes. A system is in place across ITC factories, hotels 
and offices for workers to spot and report work-related 
hazards, and offer suggestions for improvements.
Necessary training is given to all employees in 
recognising hazards and issues. Joint inspections by 
management representatives and employees on the 
shop floor are also carried out at regular intervals, 
and respective corrective and preventive measures are 
undertaken to mitigate the identified risks. In order to 
create an open and transparent safety culture across 
ITC Units, employees are encouraged to participate and 
discuss safety related issues in forums like periodic EHS 
Committee meetings and Departmental Open Forums.
d.	 Do the employees/worker of the entity have access 
to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
Yes, permanent employees and their family members 
have access to the Company provided or Company 
supported medical benefits. Workers have access to 
medical benefits through Company provided group 
insurance policies, Company funded medical support 
and where applicable, statutory benefits under the 
Employees’ State Insurance Act.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
In line with the Company’s Environment, Health and Safety Policy, safety as a value-led concept has been 
institutionalised by inculcating a sense of ownership at all levels and driving behavioural change, leading to the 
creation of a cohesive safety culture. ITC has put in place comprehensive health and safety protocols for the safety 
and well-being of its stakeholders. ITC endeavours that EHS standards at all its units are ahead of applicable 
legislations, regulations, and Standards and Codes, and are benchmarked against international best practices across 
the diverse sectors in which it operates.
ITC continues to strengthen its safety processes, adopting globally recognised best practices, and ensuring that 
facilities are designed, constructed, operated and maintained in an inherently safe manner. ITC will continue to 
undertake efforts for creating a safe working environment and a strong safety culture by:
• Integrating safety at the design stage itself and ensuring it through design reviews, stage inspections and pre-
commissioning audits, thereby strengthening the engineering control measures through ‘design for safety’ principles.
• Conducting pre-commissioning and periodic operational audits during construction and operational stages 
respectively.
• Implementing behaviour-based safety initiatives to facilitate engagement for collaborative work on improving safety 
performances.
• Adoption of keystone behaviours by individual units to demonstrate collective commitment and create a shared 
vision of safety and discipline.

Leadership Indicators
1.	Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations 
provided to the Board.
ITC believes that an effective stakeholder engagement 
process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal 
of inclusive growth. In this context, the Company has 
laid down a four layered mechanism to deal with the 
aspect of stakeholder engagement. 
The Board, through the CSR and Sustainability 
Committee, inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides 
strategic direction to the Company’s CSR and 
sustainability practices towards fulfilling its Triple 
Bottom Line objectives. Half-yearly reports on the 
progress made by the Company in this regard are 
placed by the CMC before the CSR and Sustainability 
Committee. The CMC in turn has constituted the 
Sustainability Compliance Review Committee (SCRC), 
comprising senior members of management, which 
evaluates and monitors compliance with the Policy 
formulated in this connection. The SCRC places a 
quarterly report on the subject before the CMC.
The Company has a practice of periodically assessing 
employee engagement through a Company-wide survey. 
Since 2016, the Company has made a concerted effort 
to assess and improve engagement. The impact is 
visible in the consistent improvement of engagement 
over the years.
2.	Whether stakeholder consultation is used to 
support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes, the Company believes that an effective stakeholder 
engagement process is necessary for achieving its 
sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, 
the Company anchors stakeholder engagement on the 
following principles:
a) Materiality – Prioritised consideration of the 
economic, environmental and social impacts identified 
to be important to the stakeholders as well as the 
organisation.
b) Completeness – Understanding key concerns of 
stakeholders and their expectations.
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
XXXI
c) Responsiveness – Responding coherently and 
transparently to such issues and concerns. The 
Company has put in place systems and procedures to 
identify, prioritise and address the needs and concerns 
of its stakeholders across Businesses and Units in 
a continuous, consistent and systematic manner. It 
has implemented mechanisms to facilitate effective 
dialogues with all stakeholders across Businesses, 
identify material concerns and their resolution in an 
equitable and transparent manner. These measures 
have helped the Company develop strong relationships, 
which have stood the test of time. Select examples of 
how stakeholder inputs have been incorporated into 
ITC’s policies and activities are presented below:
1.	Investors: The Company engages extensively with 
the investor ecosystem i.e., analysts representing 
institutional equity investors, fund/portfolio managers 
in top FIIs, Domestic Mutual Funds, FPIs, Private 
Insurance Companies etc. The Company hosted its 
second ‘Investor Day’ event for the investor community 
to provide deeper insights into ITC’s Corporate Strategy 
and operating segments including inter alia, the ‘ITC 
Next Strategy’ which incorporates Sustainability 2.0 as 
a significant strategic pillar of the organisation. The 
event was hosted in hybrid mode with over 100 physical 
attendees and 400+ overall attendees. The Company 
continues to communicate quarterly performance 
takeaways through press releases and detailed Investor 
presentations along with post-result calls with analysts. 
Key highlights of the performance are also being shared 
with the shareholders by e-mail. The Investors section 
of the Company’s website is also being updated on an 
ongoing basis. The Company is well-recognised for its 
ESG credentials, and is acknowledged as one of the 
pioneers of adopting the Triple Bottom Line philosophy 
in India. 
2.	Customers & Value Chain Partners:  Customers, 
Consumers and Value Chain Partners are some of ITC’s 
core stakeholders. Various tech-enabled avenues have 
been deployed to constantly receive feedback and ideas 
from these stakeholders.
A specialised team, ‘Team Synthesis’, has progressively 
evolved from being a ‘Customer Interactions’ team to a 
‘Customer Experience’ team to ‘Stakeholder Experience 
Team’, and now into a ‘Stakeholder Experience 
Management Team’. In its current avatar, in addition 
to keeping customer centricity as the base, SOPs 
and policies are designed and implemented in such a 
manner that the experience of all stakeholders is taken 
into equitable consideration. This has not just helped 
in achieving better experience for customers as well as 
the employees, but has also made every stakeholder 
accountable for the team’s and the organisation’s 
growth. Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly 
being monitored through social listening, in-depth 
immersions and are being carefully synthesised to 
transform into relevant solutions. A few key initiatives 
that demonstrate the above are:
•	 The entire customer experience process has been 
incentivised for the associates, team leaders as well 
as for the Quality Analysts (QAs) in such a manner 
that each month they accumulate certain points for 
their monthly performance based on objective and 
quantitative parameters. This has given the primary 
stakeholders (the associates) an opportunity to perform 
better. The parameters include factors like ideation 
(KAIZEN) and initiatives taken beyond tasks to improve 
the process continuously.
•	 The scenarios related to matters like environment, 
product, packaging, ergonomics, quality engineering, 
etc. highlighted by the customers are answered as per 
the respective brand teams, and any new or unique 
scenario highlighted by the customers is shared 
with the respective stakeholders as a VOC (Voice of 
Customer).
3.  Community: Presented ahead are some of the 
instances where inputs received from stakeholders 
were incorporated into interventions. 
Core Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) is done in 
ITC’s catchments to understand the need of the 
communities and design the interventions basis that. 
A comprehensive community needs assessment was 
earlier undertaken in 2015-16 in ITC’s core areas, that 
is, factory and agri-catchments. Basis this the CAPP 
1.0 was developed. Whilst we keep revisiting the needs, 
basis regular stakeholder engagements, CAPP 2.0 
was taken up in FY 2021-22 which also focussed on 
ITC’s core catchments across 21 factories and 7 agri 
locations. The objectives of CAPP 2.0 were to:
•	 Revisit coverage and community needs in the 
changed external context;
•	 Assess reasons for not achieving the earlier planned 
outcomes (if any); and
•	 Re-strategise MSK themes and approach based on 
the findings
As a follow up to the second CAPP 2.0 done in FY 2021-
22, household surveys are conducted every year on a 
lower sample to re-assess and reaffirm the continued 
relevance of the needs identified and accordingly 
cognise for the same in the future plans. In FY 2023-24, 
over 6,000 households across 4 states were covered.
Forming large-scale long-term partnerships with 
Government to amplify reach & scale is one of the 
core tenets of SIP’s implementation approach. 
In this case, stakeholder feedback was received 
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
XXXII
through consultations and interactions and they 
were duly incorporated during renewal/extension of 
the partnership. During the year, some PPPs with 
government ended and discussions were initiated on 
what changes and additions need to be considered in 
the next phase of partnership.  Two such examples are 
shared below:
•	 In Madhya Pradesh, Climate Smart Village (CSV) 
programme is being implemented in 1,500 villages 
by ITC directly.  Considering the need for replicating 
CSVs across the state, ITC organised field visits for the 
State Agricultural Department. Post visits, discussions 
were taken up on how can CSV model be replicated 
by the Government. ITC presented its CSV approach 
to Department’s state and district level officials. Post 
the meetings, an MoU was signed to replicate ITC’s 
CSV model in the entire state starting with six districts 
in Phase-1. The CSV approach will be replicated by 
the Government staff with ITC’s support for capability 
building. On-ground delivery of the programme has 
since been initiated.
•	 In Andhra Pradesh, ITC was working with Women 
Development and Child Welfare in the area of Early 
Childhood Education and Care (ECCE) in 13 districts. 
ITC trained Integrated Child Development Services 
(ICDS) Supervisors who in turn cascaded the training 
to Anganwadi Sevikas. After successfully implementing 
the programme in 13 districts, it was decided that 
there is a need to replicate the approach to entire state. 
Accordingly, a MoU was signed with the Department 
during FY 2023-24 to expand the partnership to the 
entire state.
3.	Provide details of instances of engagement 
with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups.
ITC’s SIP adopts a bottoms-up approach to identify 
and address the emerging needs of the community. 
Presented hereunder are a few instances wherein 
changing community needs were addressed either 
through modifications in ongoing programme 
components or by introducing entirely new 
interventions.
•	 ITC through the skill training centres provides 
vocational training to unemployed youth from 
marginalised sections to help them get livelihood 
opportunities. In Pune, unemployed women from two 
villages were not able to travel to the skill centre as 
traveling cost was high, which they were not able to 
bear. During mobilisation meetings, the community 
requested if training can be provided in a nearby place.  
To overcome the challenge, ITC started a temporary 
community level vocational skilling centre in their 
villages itself. 27 youth from these villages including 20 
women were trained in electrical trade with all required 
equipment and standards.
•	 In ITC catchments, toilets have been constructed 
and catchments were declared Open Defecation Free 
(ODF) by the Government, but many of the earlier 
constructed toilets are single pit. During meetings, the 
community expressed requirement of double pit toilets 
as their single pit toilet may get filled up in the coming 
year and thus toilet will become non-usable. In a twin 
pit toilet, once one pit is filled up, second pit is used 
and desludging is done for faecal sludge management 
in first pit.  To address this, ITC worked with the 
local Swachh Bharat Mission team and helped needy 
households to retrofit another pit to their existing toilet. 
This intervention would thus help in sustaining the ODF 
status of the area.
•	 ITC has been working with Watershed Development 
Department of Karnataka as part of its partnership 
for drought proofing programme for last three years. 
In the current year, there was severe drought in North 
Karnataka districts which required additional support. 
ITC immediately geared up to respond to the issue 
by designing and implementing drought support 
interventions in three North Karnataka districts – 
Balagavi, Kalaburagi and Yadgir. ITC provided critical 
irrigation support using rain guns, liquid fertiliser 
application through drones, renovation of open wells 
and water bodies, and fodder support to feed the 
animals. Approximately 2,200 poor households were 
benefited covering 3,000 acres, who could save their 
rabi crop, ensure survival of their animals and also had 
income generation opportunities in the village itself.
•	 In Kapurthala district of Punjab, ITC has been 
implementing Crop Residue Management programme 
since 2018, to help farmers not to burn paddy crop 
residue and to incorporate stubble into soil in order 
to improve soil health. However, over a period of time, 
farmers realised that in addition to adding stubble into 
soil, there is also a need for options to sell stubble 
(ex-situ solutions) and generate income. Considering 
this need, a small pilot was taken up in 2022-23 
with 10 rural entrepreneurs which was extended to 
73 entrepreneurs in 2023-24. These entrepreneurs 
handled 1,900 tons of residue which was sold for 
fodder and ethanol purposes. A workshop was also 
organised in December 2023, to make the farmers 
aware of various ex-situ marketing solutions available. 
Solutions discussed included Biofuel, Bio-ethanol, 
Building material, Biogass, Biochar, Pellets, Kitchen 
and tableware. The solutions which were of interest to 
farmers were listed out and are being pursued in the 
field by connecting farmers and rural entrepreneurs 
with the specific buyers/end-users.

4. Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee) 
responsible for addressing human rights impacts or 
issues caused or contributed to by the business? 
(Yes/No). 
Yes. ITC has a long-standing commitment to human 
rights and it is reflected in its Code of Conduct. The 
Company has policies on human rights which are 
applicable to its employees, suppliers and service 
providers. The said Policies and their implementation 
are directed towards adherence to applicable laws and 
upholding the spirit of human rights, as enshrined in 
existing international standards such as the Universal 
Declaration and the Fundamental Human Rights 
Conventions of the International Labour Organisation 
(ILO). The Company continues to work towards 
strengthening and introducing systems to ensure 
sound implementation of ITC’s policies on human 
rights and decent workplace. All ITC contracts for the 
construction of hotels, factories and property upgrades 
incorporate the environment, health, safety and human 
rights clauses, including workplace environment and 
compliance of labour practices and are supervised by 
ITC managers for adherence.
Human Rights related policies of the Company are 
available on the ITC Portal. These include ITC Code of 
Conduct, Policy on Freedom of Association, Policy on 
Prohibition of Child Labour and Prevention of Forced 
Labour at the Workplace, and Policy on Diversity, Equity

ensured by Divisional/SBU Chief Executives, through 
members of the respective Management Committees of 
the respective Businesses.
5. Describe the internal mechanisms in place to 
redress grievances related to human rights issues.
ITC’s open-door practices encourage amicable resolution 
of grievances. Employees are encouraged to first discuss 
the grievance with their immediate reporting authority 
and attempt to arrive at a resolution. If grievances persist, 
employees can fill up the Grievance Redressal Form and 
submit to the concerned HR Manager. The process of 
registering a grievance is by filling up a grievance form 
and submitting it to the concerned HR Manager which is 
then evaluated and analysed and a resolution is arrived 
and communicated to the employee. The grievance 
redressal guidelines and necessary forms are available 
on the Company intranet where employees can access the 
same directly. The ITC Whistleblower Policy (the Policy) 
encourages Directors and employees of the Company to 
promptly bring to the Company’s attention, instances of 
illegal or unethical conduct, actual or suspected incidents 
of fraud, actions that affect the financial integrity of 
the Company, or actual or suspected instances of leak 
of unpublished price sensitive information, that could 
adversely impact the Company’s operations, business 
performance and/or reputation. The Company investigates 
such reported incidents in an impartial manner and takes 
appropriate action to ensure that the requisite standards 
of professional and ethical conduct are always upheld. The 
Policy is available at https://www.itcportal.com/about-

*** Waste re-used is reported under waste recycled
#Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste: There is an increase in C&D waste on account of multiple new Projects being 
executed across ITC. 
&Since ITC is a conglomerate with multiple businesses wherein physical output is reported in different units of measurement, 
hence the data for waste intensity in terms of physical output (tonnes of production) is reported only for PSPD which accounts 
for more than 80% of ITC’s total waste generation. For data of other Divisions, refer to ‘Towards Circularity’ section of ITC’s 
Sustainability Report 2024.
ITC’s waste data has been assured at the ‘Reasonable Level’ by an independent third-party assurance provider. 
In FY 2023-24, ITC continued to recycle over 99% of waste from its operations. In addition to this, the Company’s PSPD 
recycled over 89,000 tonnes of externally sourced waste paper, thereby creating a positive environmental footprint. 
The Company also collected and sustainably managed more than 100% of its post-consumer plastic packaging waste.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such waste 
The Company has initiated measures across Units to ensure waste minimisation, segregation of waste at 
source and recycling. During the year, the recycling level reached over 99%. In addition, over 89,000 tonnes of 
externally sourced waste paper was used as raw material during the year. 
ITC follows a proactive approach to manage hazardous chemicals by actively looking for alternatives, which 
not only helps keep its operations safe, but also ensures safest products for customers. This approach is 
demonstrated in pioneering practices implemented by ITC like Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching, and 
ozone bleaching technology in India in its Paper Business, and switching from solvent-based inks to water-
based ones in its Packaging and Printing Business.

at pre-determined intervals. 
6.	Disclose any significant adverse impact to the 
environment, arising from the value chain of the 
entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have 
been taken by the entity in this regard?
ITC has a Board approved Policy on ‘Sustainable 
Supply Chain and Responsible Sourcing’ and 
a ‘Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Service 
Providers’. The Code is shared and accepted by 
supply chain partners and service providers. ITC 
has a robust process of evaluating its Suppliers 
and Service Providers before engaging with them, 
proactively making them aware of its expectations/
requirements, and seeking commitment for 
compliance through contractual agreements. 
Additionally, ITC facilitates its value chain partners 
in handling any adverse impacts. For example, 
managing hazardous chemicals is not only important 
within ITC factories, but also in the supply chain. 
Within the supply chain, farmers working with 
hazardous pesticides is an area of special attention. 
ITC’s approach is to eliminate or reduce the use of 
hazardous pesticides. Intensive training is conducted 
on Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which helps 
adopt a holistic approach in reducing pesticide usage 
as well as substituting such pesticides with nature-
based solutions. The training programmes also 
cover the safe handling of pesticides used and the 
responsible management of waste generated.
7.	Percentage of value chain partners (by value of 
business done with such partners) that were assessed 
for environmental impacts.
Key value chain partners like third-party 
manufacturers are encouraged to adopt management 
practices detailed under International Standards 
such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ITC’s 
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. 
Contract manufacturing agreements also include 
aspects of EHS. Systems are in place for monitoring 
and reporting on key Third-Party Manufacturers’ 
(TPMs) environmental performance, including 
energy, water and waste management. ITC’s leading 
Agri value chains are assessed for certification 
standards such as Forest Stewardship Council® 
(FSC)®, Rainforest Alliance, Sustainable Tobacco 
Programme (STP 2.0), G.A.P., etc. These standards, 
among others, also include environmental criteria. 
Additionally, ITC conducts third-party assessment 
of its Critical Tier-1* suppliers on an ongoing 
basis, and this assessment covers key aspects 
on environmental compliance and management 
practices. 40% of ITC’s Critical Tier-1 suppliers have 
been assessed so far. 
*All ITC Businesses have identified Critical Tier-1 suppliers 
based on buy value, ESG risk exposure, importance to 
business continuity, among others. ITC’s Sustainable Supply 
Chain Programme is focussed on working closely with the 
set of identified Critical suppliers.

3.	Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress 
grievances of the community.
ITC’s Social Investments Programme (SIP) adopts a 
bottom-up approach by keeping community needs 
and priorities as the key driver of all its interventions. 
Detailed and structured community engagements 
are planned every 4-5 years to revisit the changing 
needs of the community and the emerging priorities 
which feed into designing of new interventions and 
re-designing of ongoing and new programmes. Further, 
regular community interactions are undertaken 
by the internal state level programme teams and 
the implementing partners to discuss, identify and 
address any issues, complaints and grievances of the 
community members pertaining to the interventions 
of Social Investments Programme. SIP has also 
formalised and internalised the process of undertaking 
and recording such community interactions in-line with 
the new SEBI requirements on Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Reporting. Such discussions not 
only focus on complaints and grievances, but also on 
providing resolution in a time bound manner. 
During 2023-24, 42 such community engagements were 
held across all major states where SIP programmes 
are implemented. 6 grievances (mainly as requests for 
further interventions and scope of improvement) were 
reported. Largely, requests and demands were raised 
during these meetings for further expansion of scope of 
existing programmes. The SIP state teams have taken 
cognisance of all the relevant concerns and applicable 
actions have been incorporated in plans for the 
upcoming year. Details on mechanisms to receive and 
redress grievances of the community are also provided

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). 
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
Other information 
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the Identified 
Sustainability Information and assurance report thereon). The Company’s Annual Report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this assurance report. 
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other 
information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our assurance on the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read 
the other information identified above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Identified Sustainability Information or our knowledge 
obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
Other matter 
The BRSR for the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 was not subject to limited/reasonable 
assurance engagement and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion/conclusion, or provide any assurance 
on such information. 
Our opinion/conclusion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
Intended use or purpose 
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the 
BRSR Core attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with 
reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
Responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI)  
The management of the Company acknowledge and understand their responsibility for:  
• 
designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;

• 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
• 
disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation of the ISI in the relevant report/statement;  
• 
preparing/properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria;  
• 
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation; 
• 
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such 
targets, goals and performance measures; 
• 
responsible for providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI 
disclosed in the report; 
• 
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts; 
• 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances;  
• 
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information 
subject to assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria;  
• 
preventing and detecting fraud; 
• 
selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand 
their information needs; 
• 
informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI; and 
• 
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI. 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI. 
Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI 
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy 
footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the 
uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.  
Our responsibilities 
We are responsible for: 
• 
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability 
disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above.  
• 
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained, and 
• 
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of ITC Limited.

Exclusions 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same: 
• 
Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.

Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.

Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion 
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected 
depended on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information 
subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of 
material misstatement through understanding the Information subject to reasonable assurance and the 
engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the 
information subject to reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls.  
In carrying out our engagement, we: 
• 
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the reasonable assurance 
information;  
• 
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the 
preparation of the information subject to reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates 
made by the Company;  
• 
performing substantive testing of data related to ISI, limited to 20 operational locations of the Company: 
and 
• 
evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to reasonable assurance.
