Water 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Water being a shared 
resource, it is essential 
for business to use it in a 
responsible way. These risks 
comprise conflicts with local 
communities and stakeholders 
over water rights and usage, 
potential water scarcity or 
quality issues due to over-
extraction or pollution, and 
regulatory constraints on 
water abstraction permits or 
discharge standards.
We have been investing 
in rainwater harvesting 
initiatives, restoring village 
ponds, construction of check 
dams, water conservation 
at closed mines and 
groundwater recharge for a 
long time to mitigate the risk 
of lack of water. As a result, 
the company is now water 
positive.

(Indicate

Opportunity- By 
demonstrating commitment to 
conserving water resources, 
we can build stronger 
relationships with local 
communities and government. 
This will help us in securing 
and maintaining social 
license to operate, especially 
in water-stressed regions. 
In future, the company may 
qualify for government 
incentives aimed at promoting 
water conservation and 
sustainability initiatives.
2
Air quality
Risk
Exposure to dust, SOx, NOx 
and other pollutants from 
cement plants can lead to 
respiratory issues among 
employees and nearby 
communities. This may lead 
to increased costs associated 
with healthcare for affected 
employees, and insurance 
premiums. The company may 
also face opposition, protests 
and even legal restrictions on 
its operations.
We focus on improving 
air emissions and the 
surrounding environment. 
We monitor the plants’ 
stack emissions through 
the Continuous Emission 
Monitoring System. We 
work on upgradation of 
electrostatic precipitations 
and replacement of damaged 
bags to control dust 
emissions.  We take primary 
and secondary measures to 
control NOx emissions.
Negative
3
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
Circular economy offers great 
opportunity to lower the use 
of natural resources and fossil 
fuels in cement production 
and reduces carbon emissions.
‑
Positive
4
Climate and 
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Climate change poses 
multiple physical risks like 
flooding, temperature rise, 
water stress etc. Emerging 
and potential regulations 
may introduce or escalate 
regulatory risks. These 
extreme weather events can 
cause infrastructure damage, 
may hinder the supply chain 
network affecting timely 
delivery of raw materials and 
finished products. It may also 
cause power outages and 
affect the manufacturing 
processes.
The Company has 
approximately 90% of 
products in its portfolio 
which are blended products 
with lower carbon footprint. 
Further, we are investing 
more and more in renewal 
energy and green energy 
from WHRS. In addition, we 
have set ambitious targets 
for Thermal Substitution 
Rates (TSR) by using 
alternate fuels.

Opportunity- Energy cost 
is a major cost in cement 
manufacturing. We 
continuously strive to reduce 
our specific thermal energy 
consumption and specific 
electrical energy consumption 
to optimise our energy costs. 
In addition, it is directly 
related to carbon emissions 
and by optimising energy 
consumption, we can lower 
our carbon emissions.
5
Biodiversity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Land disturbance and 
habitat fragmentation from 
operational activities can lead 
to biodiversity degradation. 
Opportunity- Restored 
ecosystems can provide 
long-term environmental 
benefits, including enhanced 
ecosystem services such 
as water filtration, carbon 
sequestration, and soil 
preservation. These benefits 
not only contribute to global 
environmental goals but also 
can have positive economic 
implications for the company 
and local communities in the 
long run.
We adhere to Indian 
national regulations 
and are a signatory to 
the India Business and 
Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) 
of the Confederation of 
Indian Industry (CII), and 
Deutsche Gesellschaft 
für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). 
We assess the impacts on 
biodiversity and ecosystem 
services through set KPIs. 
This helps in conservation of 
ecosystem.

Sustainable 
Construction
Opportunity
Intervention of sustainable 
practices and technologies 
such as substitute 
cementitious materials, 
CO2 capture in the built 
environment, and efficient 
concrete use help drive down 
carbon emissions from cement 
production and hence help to 
reduce the carbon footprint.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Employee diversity leads 
to increased creativity 
and innovation, improved 
communication and 
teamwork, and a greater 
understanding and 
appreciation of different 
cultures. Additionally, a 
diverse workforce can help to 
attract and retain top talent 
and can provide a competitive 
advantage for organisations.

9
Human Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Concerns related 
to child/forced labour, 
discrimination or any other 
human rights-related aspects 
within the workforce and 
value chain may lead to 
statutory violations which may 
negatively impact the brand 
image. 
Opportunity- Alignment with 
the human rights principles 
and procedures safeguard the 
employees and value chain 
partners and ensure zero 
incidents of non-compliance  
with regards to International 
and National Human Rights 
Standards and Regulations.
We are committed to 
respecting and promoting 
human rights across the 
value chain by inculcating 
a human rights policy. 
The policy is in line with 
The Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, Social 
Accountability 8000

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk- Failure to protect 
workers from occupational 
hazards can result in 
legal action, fines, and 
compensation claims against 
the company. These risks can 
lead to significant financial 
liabilities and damage the 
company's reputation. 
Also, potential employees 
may hesitate from joining 
the company, and current 
employees may leave if they 
perceive their health and 
safety are not adequately 
protected, leading to 
challenges in attracting and 
retaining a skilled workforce.
Opportunity- By prioritising 
the well-being of all 
employees and workers, the 
company can enhance its 
employer brand,  making it 
a more attractive place to 
work. Employees are more 
likely to join and stay with a 
company that prioritises their 
well-being, leading to lower 
turnover rates and higher 
employee satisfaction.
We have developed safety 
initiatives including 
competency development, 
training, audits, inspections, 
surveys, We Care initiatives, 
Critical Control Management 
to prevent unwanted 
events, and especial cross-
functional teams to drive 
process safety. Also, we  
conduct safety audits 
across our manufacturing 
sites to ensure that the 
actions are timely closed and 
implemented

Community 
Relations
Opportunity
Uplifting livelihood

improved customer experience 
and hence drive growth in

14
Risk 
Management
Opportunity
Enhanced Risk awareness 
and in-place emergency 
preparedness plans help 
to better foresee risks that 
may emerge due to climate 
change, regulations, and 
geopolitical developments. 
This helps to stay one step 
ahead and ensure business 
continuity and regulatory 
resilience.

15
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk- Improper usage of 
resources, human rights 
violations, non-compliance 
with Supplier Code of 
Conduct, zero adoption of 
sustainable practices by 
suppliers can adversely impact 
the environment, social 
well-being, value chain and 
brand image. Additionally, it 
might also lead to cases of 
regulatory non-compliances 
and fines.
Opportunity- The company 
can leverage suppliers near 
operations to reduce costs, 
for greater control, quicker 
response and helps in cutting 
down significant emissions 
related to transportation.
Supply chain and sourcing 
process has a direct impact 
on the environment and 
communities such as 
emissions, circular economy, 
water usage, biodiversity, 
material usage and human 
rights. We have taken 
measures to ensure an 
optimum supply chain with 
competent suppliers.

Information

Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk- Instances of information 
security breaches could lead 
to loss of sensitive data of 
customers including personal 
information. It could also 
lead to increased media 
scrutiny resulting in a loss of 
stakeholder trust, company 
reputation and regulatory 
fines or penalties.
Opportunity- In the ever-
evolving landscape of 
digitalisation and innovation, 
monitoring and analysis of 
data in real time would lead 
to quicker identification 
and resolution of issues. 
As a result, this will ensure 
management of systems and 
processes more effectively.
With increased digitisation, 
and heavy dependence 
on technology systems, it 
has become critical for us 
to ensure implementation 
of SOPs and policies, 
conduction periodic internal 
and external (third-party) 
audits and tests to check 
the resilience of the IT 
infrastructure from hackers, 
cyber-attacks, malware etc.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The successful involvement of our stakeholders is essential to the achievement of our strategic goals because 
it provides us with the opportunity to understand their expectations, respond to their concerns, and assist us 
in prioritising the areas in which we should be concentrating our efforts. Our mechanism for engaging with 
stakeholders is governed by our Stakeholder Engagement Policy (https://www.ambujacement.com/Upload/PDF/
Ambuja-Stakeholder-Engagement-policy-18-oct.pdf), which is further aligned with global best practises.
	
Ambuja identifies its stakeholders as groups and individuals, who can influence or/are impacted by our operations/ 
activities, change in technology, regulations, market and societal trends either directly or indirectly. Stakeholders 
comprise of communities, employees, supply chain partners, customers, investors, regulators, industrial 
organisations etc.
	
Against each group, the potential ways in which stakeholders will be affected as well as the magnitude of both 
the actual and perceived impacts have been determined. This assists the company in developing a bespoke plan 
for engaging with stakeholders, which can then be kept up to date as and when is necessary.
	
Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders by utilising a variety 
of channels of contact. The insights that we gain from these projects are tremendously helpful, because they 
allow us to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations. The process of engaging stakeholders also 
includes regular feedback and grievance redressal methods, both of which are vital components of the process.

Social Impact Assessment is a part of EIA for getting Environment Clearance for projects. All projects listed in 
Question No 12 of Principle 6 have SIA component in-built as part of the study carried out. In addition, assessing 
social impacts of the CSR projects is an ongoing process at ACF, that continues to assess social impacts using 
platforms such as Social Engagement Scorecard (SES), Community Advisory Panel (CAP) etc. Any social impacts 
emerging out of these platforms is seriously considered and factored into annual workplan and activities 
of Ambuja Cement Foundation. In FY 24, we measured Social Returns on Investment (SROI) for three of our 
livelihood interventions programmes in three blocks of Howrah District, West Bengal. The programmes are 1) 
Agriculture-based Livelihood (ABL) Program, which aims to double farmers' income by introducing innovative 
farming techniques 2) The Women Empowerment Program (WEP) focuses on economic empowerment and 
gender equality and 3) Skill & Entrepreneurship Development Institute (SEDI) that provides vocational training to 
underprivileged youth, enhancing their employability and fostering entrepreneurship. The period of the study was 
between 2019-20 to 2021-22. The SROI ratio for the ABL program is 9.87, WEP program is 3.99 and for the SEDI 
program is 6.35. The results of the analysis will be helpful to optimise value by including stakeholder voices. The 
SROI value helps to gauge the program effectiveness, improve program management, and enhance understanding
