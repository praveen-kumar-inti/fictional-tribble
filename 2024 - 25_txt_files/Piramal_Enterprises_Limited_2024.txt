c.	 A brief on types of 
customers
PEL holds a strong and diversified presence across retail lending, wholesale 
lending, alternatives and life insurance. It’s retail lending division offers a broad 
suite of financial solutions tailored to salaried, self-employed, and professional 
individuals including cash-salaried customers, and SMEs. A significant portion 
of the retail customer base is from Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. In addition 
to these segments, the Company also extends financial inclusion through 
a microfinance group loan scheme. Beyond retail lending, the Company’s 
wholesale and alternatives lending divisions cater to wide spectrum of High-
Net-Worth Individuals, Institutional Investors, and Corporate clients.
In Wholesale 2.0 lending, loans are sanctioned under new real estate (RE) and 
corporate mid-market loans (CMML). In RE, the Company offers customised 
and structured products to large and small developers with strong local 
presence and offers loans to mid-size corporates. The Small Developer 
Finance (SDF) business has been set up as a part of the growing wholesale 
credit franchise to focus on mid-market and affordable residential housing 
projects with less than H200 crore revenue in low penetrated markets in Tier 
1 outskirts and Tier 2&3 cities.
Through the CMML line of business, PEL offers credit solutions to non-
real estate clients. The team acts on sector-agnostic credit proposals and 
leverages its deep expertise in the lending business to offer customised 
solutions for financing needs. Since its inception, the segment has supported 
businesses across personal care, shipping, power, fintech, and logistic sectors, 
addressing their specific funding requirements that are inadequately met by 
existing products in the market.

Statement by Director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business 
responsibility 
report, 
highlighting 
ESG related challenges, 
targets, 
and 
achievements:
PEL is proud of the significant strides made in its ESG journey since its initiation in FY2023. 
Over the past year, the Company has strengthened its sustainability strategy and integrated 
it more deeply into the leadership agenda, reaffirming its commitment to responsible and 
inclusive growth. In the lending business, the Company continues to advance financial 
inclusion by supporting over 1.21 lakh women borrowers and facilitating 14 slum 
rehabilitation projects. Simultaneously, the wholesale portfolio is actively supporting 11 
green real estate developments.
To accelerate its sustainable finance ambitions, the Company has adopted a comprehensive 
framework and raised $550 million which has been deployed towards priority sectors such 
as Affordable housing, MSME lending, MFI’s and Personal loans. Aligned with its strong risk 
management approach, PEL has conducted a high-level climate risk assessment of its 
wholesale portfolio and proactively initiated its expansion across the entire loan book—
well ahead of regulatory expectations such as the Reserve Bank of India’s upcoming stress 
testing guidelines.
The Company remains committed to fostering a more equitable workplace, with women 
now comprising 12.71% of the total workforce and 10.98% in senior management. To 
enhance ESG awareness, 91.39% employees have completed mandatory training on ESG 
principles and human rights.
On the operational front, the Piramal Agastya office has achieved an IGBC certification. 
PEL is advancing its environmental goals through intelligent energy management, 
including the use of IoT-based metering, optimisation of sanctioned loads, and increased 
reliance on solar and green energy across office locations. Water reuse systems have been 
implemented, eco-friendly materials adopted, and sustainable procurement practices 
strengthened. As part of the waste management strategy, the Company launched the 
‘Padcare’ initiative to recycle sanitary pads collected from our lavatories processing 225.79 
kg of material and conserving 483 kg of carbon equivalents at the Padcare recycling 
station. Additionally, PEL launched ‘InfinityBox’, a one-stop solution for managing food 
serviceware in a more sustainable, hygienic, hassle-free, and cost-effective way. The 
initiative has contributed to over 3 million kgs of waste reduction and saved more than 
500 liters of water.
In addition, with ISO 45001 certification in place across 14 retail and wholesale offices 
and recognition as a Great Place to Work®, the Company continues to create long-term 
value through environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and strong governance.
Through its continued collaboration with the Piramal Foundation, the Company remains 
actively engaged in addressing societal needs across key sectors including health, education, 
digitisation, and tribal upliftment. The foundation has supported 109 aspirational districts. 
The Chairman has reimagined the Group’s entire portfolio of solutions into “Big Bets,” which 
are envisioned to accelerate India’s progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals by 2030.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
In compliance with regulatory requirements, PEL has instituted a comprehensive Whistle Blower 
Mechanism supported by a formal Whistle Blower Policy (Policy). This framework is designed to enable 
secure and responsible reporting of unethical practices and is rooted in the Company’s core philosophy 
of Knowledge, Action, and Care. The Policy reinforces its commitment to maintaining high standards of 
ethical conduct, financial integrity, transparency, and sound governance across all its operations.
	
The Policy empowers directors, employees, customers, and other stakeholders to raise concerns regarding 
unethical behaviour, suspected fraud, or violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct or policies. PEL 
encourages individuals to voice genuine concerns without fear of retaliation or unfair treatment. Recognising 
that certain violations may deter open dialogue, the mechanism provides an alternative communication 
channel beyond the regular management hierarchy, allowing employees at all levels to safely express 
their concerns.
	
The mechanism also incorporates safeguards against victimisation of whistle blowers and allows direct 
access to Investigating Officer/ Internal Audit/ Independent Firm appointed by the Committee. However, 
employees remain bound by their duty of confidentiality and the mechanism must not be misused for 
making malicious or frivolous complaints.
	
The scope of the Policy extends to all forms of malpractice, unethical conduct, or illegal activity, including 
but not limited to:
	y
Abuse of authority
	y
Negligence leading to health and safety risks
	y
Financial irregularities or fraud
	y
Criminal offenses
	y
Misuse of confidential or proprietary information
	y
Misappropriation of funds or assets
	y
Breaches of the Group’s Code of Conduct or policies
	
All protected disclosures are carefully documented and thoroughly investigated in a fair, unbiased, 
and objective manner. Investigations are fact-finding exercises conducted in line with applicable legal 
and professional standards. Upon completion, the Whistle Blower Committee submits a report for the 
Committee’s internal discussion to review the investigation findings and the emanating action(s) thereof. On 
a quarterly basis, a summary update on the number of complaints (received, closed and open) is provided 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. If an allegation raised in good faith is found unsubstantiated, no 
action is taken against the whistle blower.
	
In addition, the Company has adopted a robust Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy, aligned with the 
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The policy 
is applicable to all employees, including permanent, contractual, temporary, and trainees, and ensures 
the formation and functioning of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in accordance with statutory 
guidelines, for addressing and resolving complaints related to sexual harassment.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The Company’s primary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arise from electricity consumption (Scope 2) and 
fuel use in Company-owned vehicles and DG sets (Scope 1). To mitigate its environmental footprint, PEL 
has undertaken several measures such as: 
	y
The corporate office in Bangalore operates a 27.5 kW solar plant, partially meeting its energy demand 
through renewable sources and thereby reducing GHG emissions. Similarly, the Kurla (Mumbai) corporate 
office sources part of its electricity from renewable energy.
	y
Energy-efficient LED lighting and signage boards have been installed across facilities, and all new branches 
are equipped with inverter air-conditioning systems using R-22 refrigerant to minimise emissions. 
	y
The Company is also conducting internal assessments to explore the adoption of efficient equipment 
and alternative energy sources at its branch offices.
	y
To reduce emissions associated with business travel, PEL extensively uses video conferencing and is 
working with travel vendors to measure emissions from air travel. 
	y
Operational processes are being digitised wherever feasible to further support energy efficiency.
	y
Due to its environmentally responsible practices, the Piramal Finance office at the Agastya building in 
Kurla, Mumbai has received IGBC Platinum certification.
	
PEL continuously monitors energy consumption and emission patterns to identify areas for improvement 
and is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in line with the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi)
