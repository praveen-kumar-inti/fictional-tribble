(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a 
company’s non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social 
responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

Transition to Clean 
Energy &
GHG Emissions
By embracing renewable energy, 
Navneet not only reduces its carbon 
footprint but also reinforces its 
commitment to sustainability and 
environmental responsibility. This 
transition aligns with the growing 
environmental awareness among 
customers, strengthening Navneet’s 
position as a socially responsible 
and environmentally conscious 
organisation. At the same time, the 
Company’s continued reliance on 
conventional electricity grids, along 
with emissions generated from the 
physical distribution and delivery 
of books and stationery, remains 
a significant source of carbon 
emissions. A lack of alignment with 
global climate change goals could 
pose risks to the business, especially 
as several B2B export clients may 
increasingly expect Navneet to adopt 
carbon-neutral practices.
NA
2
Waste 
Management
During the production process, 
Navneet generates different 
categories of hazardous and non-
hazardous waste. Improper handling 
of non-regulated waste can lead to 
regulatory fines, as well as societal 
and environmental harm. Inadequate 
management of waste materials may 
cause contamination, legal liabilities, 
and reputational damage, which can 
undermine the Company’s long-term 
sustainability and profitability, while 
also affecting its competitiveness in 
the market.
Navneet engages authorised 
vendors for the proper 
handling of hazardous waste, 
including e-waste, ensuring 
compliance with regulations 
and responsible waste 
management practices by the 
Company.

`
Circular  
Economy
Navneet can benefit from embracing 
a circular economy, as it helps reduce 
waste, conserve resources, and 
lower production costs. By reusing 
materials and minimising waste, 
Navneet can enhance sustainability, 
strengthen its environmental 
reputation, and attract eco-conscious 
customers. Ultimately, this approach 
can drive increased profitability 
and improve the Company’s market 
competitiveness.
NA
4
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Water is a critical input in the 
manufacturing process for Navneet. 
Inefficient management of water 
and wastewater, especially the 
use of untreated water, can cause 
environmental violations, raise 
operational costs, and harm 
reputation. Regulatory fines, 
resource wastage, and pollution may 
result in decreased profitability, legal 
liabilities, and reputational damage, 
ultimately affecting the Company’s 
long-term market competitiveness.
Implementation of wastewater 
treatment plants to efficiently 
process water and mitigate 
environmental repercussions.
Integration of rainwater 
harvesting and storage 
systems in the Company’s 
primary manufacturing 
facilities.
5
Climate  
Change
The onset of climate change 
presents potential challenges for 
Navneet. With emerging physical 
risks, there is a heightened 
possibility of business disruptions. 
Additionally, transitional risks 
could lead to increased energy 
costs, supply chain interruptions, 
and stricter emissions regulations, 
resulting in higher operational 
expenses and reduced profitability 
for the Company.
Investing in solar power with a 
capacity of 724 kWp and wind 
power plants with a capacity of 
4,8 MW, offsetting close to 60% 
of our Scope 2 emissions.
Developing a green zone within 
the manufacturing locations. 
Currently, trees are absorbing 
460 tonnes of CO2 per year, 
offsetting close to 16% of our 
Scope 1 emissions.
Energy optimisation measures 
include periodic energy audits.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Navneet recognises that prioritising 
diversity and inclusion can 
significantly enhance creativity, 
problem-solving capabilities, 
and employee morale across the 
organisation. By broadening the 
pool of potential candidates, the 
Company’s inclusive policies help 
foster a positive workplace culture 
that attracts top talent and supports 
long-term success in an increasingly 
diverse and global market.
NA
7
Employee Welfare, 
Training and 
Transition
Navneet prioritises employee 
well-being, recognising that it not 
only enhances retention rates and 
productivity but also contributes 
to a supportive and engaging 
work environment. The Company 
understands that motivated 
employees who feel emotionally 
connected to the organisation 
deliver exceptional customer service, 
which drives business success and 
reduces turnover-related costs. 
Additionally, Navneet invests in 
effective training programmes to 
ensure employees are equipped with 
the necessary skills to meet evolving 
work demands, thereby fostering 
innovation and sustaining a 
competitive advantage. The absence 
of a structured transitional plan, 
however, may lead to reduced morale 
and efficiency, ultimately affecting 
the Company’s overall performance.
NA
8
Occupational 
Health and Safety
The nature of Navneet’s operations 
introduces a variety of potential 
hazards. Factory employees and 
workers are exposed to the risk of 
physical injuries, particularly those 
related to the handling of hazardous 
materials. Office-based teams 
within the Company may encounter 
ergonomic challenges and mental 
health concerns. Additionally, 
Navneet’s on-field sales teams travel 
long distances by road, which may 
lead to potential accidents.
The Company has 
implemented several 
control measures to ensure 
workplace safety, including 
Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA), 
Toolbox Talks, use of Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPEs), 
Permit-to-Work systems, 
regular testing and monitoring, 
workplace inspections, EHS 
trainings, and ride Safe 
training, among others.

Human rights
Human rights violations can result in 
serious consequences for Navneet, 
including legal penalties, reputational 
damage, and consumer boycotts. 
Exploitative labour practices or 
unsafe working conditions can lower 
employee morale, lead to lawsuits, 
and weaken trust, negatively 
impacting profitability and market 
competitiveness. Insufficient training 
and awareness of human rights 
among employees increase these 
risks, highlighting the importance 
of thorough education and strict 
compliance measures.
Conduct trainings on human 
rights periodically.
Carry out due diligence and 
third-party audits, including 
several export customer 
audits.
10
Sustainable 
Product, Innovation 
and Quality
In a competitive landscape like 
that of Navneet, innovation gives 
it a distinct edge. By introducing 
new, improved, and sustainable 
products, Navneet stays ahead 
and captures greater market share. 
Innovative companies are seen 
as dynamic and forward-thinking. 
Navneet’s B2C products, with a 
focus on sustainability, can attract 
eco-conscious customers, creating 
a competitive advantage in both 
domestic and export markets.
NA
11
Responsible 
Content
For Navneet’s publication business, 
particularly in educational books 
used by students and schools 
nationwide, focussing on producing 
responsible content is essential. 
Failure to uphold these content 
standards can have serious 
repercussions. It can harm the 
Company’s reputation, leading 
to a loss of trust among parents, 
schools, and the general public. 
Additionally, it may result in legal 
challenges, including lawsuits or 
fines for distributing inappropriate or 
inaccurate information.

Responsible 
Marketing and 
Selling Practices
Responsible marketing and selling 
practices are crucial for Navneet, 
especially in the stationery and 
publication business where 
dealings involve educational books, 
government agencies, and large 
export customers. False claims 
by the marketing team about 
product quality or features could 
lead to financial losses and harm 
the Company’s reputation. In the 
publication sector, aggressive sales 
tactics, particularly when targeting 
schools and influencing student 
purchases may create challenges 
and risk damaging relationships with 
educational institutions.
NA
13
Affordability & 
Inclusivity
Promoting affordability and 
inclusivity in stationery and 
publication products is a key 
focus for Navneet, especially in 
a country like India where many 
underprivileged students face 
challenges accessing quality 
education. By making educational 
materials more accessible and 
affordable, the Company empowers 
a broader segment of society to 
obtain essential learning resources, 
helping to level the playing field and 
support marginalised communities. 
Furthermore, by expanding reach 
and affordability, the Company can 
generate a meaningful community 
impact, uplifting entire communities 
and fostering positive social change.

Community 
Development
By consistently investing in CSR 
projects focussed on education, 
healthcare, and rural community 
development, Navneet makes a 
tangible difference in people’s 
lives. Through these efforts, the 
Company enhances access to 
quality education and healthcare 
services, empowering individuals 
to lead healthier and more 
productive lives. Additionally, the 
Company’s initiatives are aimed 
at rural community upliftment, 
fostering economic development, 
creating employment opportunities, 
and improving infrastructure in 
underserved areas.
NA
15
Sustainable 
Sourcing
Failing to adhere to sustainable 
sourcing practices, particularly 
in paper procurement, can have 
serious consequences for Navneet 
and the Company’s broader impact. 
Ignoring sustainable sourcing 
may cause environmental harm, 
including deforestation and 
habitat loss, which worsen climate 
change and biodiversity decline. 
Furthermore, procuring paper 
from unsustainable suppliers can 
damage the Company’s reputation, 
as customers and stakeholders 
increasingly value environmentally 
responsible practices. Additionally, 
failing to uphold ethical standards in 
the supply chain such as preventing 
human rights violations, child labour, 
and bribery can tarnish Navneet’s 
image and expose it to legal risks.
Adoption of a supplier Code of 
Conduct.
Declaration of acceptance of 
the Code of Conduct before 
onboarding.
Periodic supplier site 
assessments.
Document validation, including 
importance certifications 
such as FSC, and ISO, among 
others.
16
Corporate 
Governance
Poor governance can affect 
Navneet’s management, lead to 
ethical breaches, and cause financial 
scandals. It undermines investor 
confidence, invites legal challenges,

Data Protection 
and Privacy
Inadequate data protection and 
privacy measures could expose 
Navneet to data breaches, regulatory 
penalties, and reputational harm. 
Such breaches compromise 
sensitive information, damage 
customer trust, and lead to legal 
consequences, which can further 
disrupt the Company’s operations, 
erode consumer confidence, 
and impact long-term market 
competitiveness.
Implementation of a data 
protection policy that is shared 
with stakeholders.

Compliance and 
Business Ethics
Embracing ethical behaviour 
and strict compliance with laws 
and regulations fosters trust 
and credibility among Navneet’s 
stakeholders. By consistently 
adhering to ethical standards and 
legal requirements, the Company 
mitigates risks of reputational 
damage and legal liabilities, ensuring 
a strong market position. Conversely, 
failing to meet the expectations of 
export customers can significantly 
impact the business, potentially 
jeopardising future opportunities and 
harming the Company’s reputation in 
the international market.
Ensure compliance

Conduct periodic internal 
audits covering various 
businesses and functions.

Anti-corruption & 
Bribery
Implementing robust anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery measures within 
Navneet helps safeguard its 
integrity and reputation. With the 
need to manage numerous Pan-
India employees, vendors, business 
partners, global operations, and 
interactions with government 
agencies, there exists a potential risk 
of unethical practices in the sector. 
The Company remains vulnerable 
to legal penalties and reputational 
damage associated with corrupt 
activities.
Implementation of a strong 
ESG Policy, upholding ethical 
standards and providing clear 
guidelines. 
Grievance redressal 
mechanisms ensure prompt 
resolution of complaints, 
fostering transparency and 
accountability.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
Navneet is pleased to present its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for 2024–25, which highlights significant 
progress and initiatives undertaken over the past year. The Company’s firm commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) principles remains central to its strategy, recognising their crucial role in driving sustainable growth and resilience.
Navneet has established an ESG Board Committee and an ESG Working Committee, both responsible for steering sustainability 
efforts and ensuring alignment with business objectives. These committees operate under an ESG Charter that formalises the 
Company’s dedication to integrating ESG considerations throughout all operations.
To deepen understanding of key ESG risks and opportunities, Navneet completed a comprehensive materiality assessment in line 
with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. This assessment provided valuable insights into stakeholder priorities, guiding the 
development of targeted strategies to address these concerns effectively.
Demonstrating its ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability, Navneet has offset approximately 5,770.21 metric tonnes of 
CO2 equivalent (MTCO2e) through strategic investments in wind and solar energy and biodiversity projects. As a result, net emissions 
were reduced to 5,536.15 MTCO2e, with an overall carbon offset rate of 51%. Specifically, Scope 1 emissions were reduced by 19%, 
primarily through plantation efforts, while Scope 2 emissions declined by 60% due to proactive investments in renewable energy. 
These initiatives underscore Navneet’s dedication to advancing sustainable practices and reducing its carbon footprint. The company 
has also expanded emissions tracking to encompass Scope 3 emissions.
Furthermore, Navneet has thoroughly reviewed its training programmes, especially those focussing on human rights awareness and 
compliance. This review enabled the Company to identify areas for improvement and refine training initiatives to align with its core 
values. A comprehensive virtual training module covering all aspects of Social and Governance awareness has been developed for 
dissemination at all organisational levels.
As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts, Navneet has made a significant impact across sectors such as healthcare, 
education, community development, animal welfare, environmental initiatives, and sports programmes. Its CSR initiatives have 
benefited a total of 3,11,181 individuals, with a substantial proportion from vulnerable and marginalised groups, highlighting the 
Company’s commitment to inclusivity and holistic community development.
Recognising significant adverse environmental impacts within its value chain, Navneet has proactively implemented a robust 
Supplier Code of Conduct to uphold sustainability standards. Supplier self-assessment and self-declaration processes have been 
completed for critical vendors.
While proud of the progress made in advancing its sustainability agenda, Navneet acknowledges that the journey is ongoing. The 
Company remains committed to setting ambitious targets, innovating sustainable solutions, and collaborating with stakeholders to 
create lasting value for all.

Navneet has established a robust Employee Grievance Mechanism accessible at both factory and 
office levels through the Company’s web portal.
To identify and address employee concerns, the Company regularly conducts an Employee Survey. 
The feedback gathered helps identify key grievance areas, which are then thoroughly analysed to 
develop targeted improvement plans.
The Company follows an open-door policy, encouraging employees and workers to freely 
communicate their grievances to the HR Department at any time.
Additionally, a designated complaint and suggestion box is available and reviewed by HR weekly. 
All complaints and suggestions are recorded, and appropriate actions are taken to resolve them. If 
issues remain unresolved, they are escalated to the Department Head or Head of HR.
Employees are assured that raising grievances will not lead to any retaliation or adverse 
consequences.

Navneet has implemented several key initiatives to 
strengthen workplace safety and reduce risks related to 
machinery and operations. New machines are fitted with 
guards and sensors to prevent access to rotating and moving 
parts, ensuring employee safety. Additionally, mandatory 
Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) training is provided 
to all new employees, including contract workers and 
apprentices, to familiarise them with safety protocols. Strict 
supervision is maintained across all sites to uphold safety 
standards, and the consistent use of appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) is enforced.
	
The Company has also acquired advanced safety devices 
such as multi-gas detectors, electric panel locks and 
tags, and precautionary items like fire blankets to further 
protect its workforce. Regular mock drills are conducted 
to prepare employees for emergency situations, ensuring 
the organisation is well-equipped to respond effectively. 
A 
behaviour-based 
training 
programme 
has 
been 
introduced, alongside delegating EHS responsibilities to 
line management, empowering them to actively monitor 
and enforce safety practices. Workplace inspections, daily 
hazard observations, and corrective actions are integral 
to Navneet’s proactive safety culture. To motivate and

As part of Navneet’s persistent commitment to environmental sustainability, the Company has effectively offset approximately 5,770.21 
metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent (TCO2e) through strategic investments in wind and solar energy, along with biodiversity initiatives. As a 
result, Navneet’s net emissions have been reduced to 5,536.15 metric tonnes (MT) of CO2. Currently, Navneet’s overall carbon offset rate is 
51%. Specifically, the Company’s Scope 1 emissions have been reduced by 19%, primarily through plantation efforts. The Company’s solar 
power plant generated 2,521.41 GJ of energy, which was directly consumed in operations at the Company’s factory locations. Additionally, 
the Company’s wind power plant generated 23,762.99 GJ of energy, which was sold to the grid, leading to a 60% reduction in Navneet’s 
Scope 2 emissions. These initiatives underscore the Company’s dedication to advancing sustainable practices and reducing its carbon 
footprint.
8. 	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? (Yes/No)
YES
	
If yes, then provide details.
	
Navneet has undertaken several proactive steps to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, including the following initiatives:
	
Renewable Energy Generation
	
The Company has installed 724 KW of solar panels across two of its manufacturing facilities and established a wind power 
capacity of 4.8 MW, replacing conventional electricity consumption with renewable solar and wind energy. By utilising these 
renewable resources , the Company significantly reduces its dependence on fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
	
Solar Heaters for Canteen Operations
	
Navneet incorporates sustainable energy in daily operations by using solar heaters for water heating and cooking in its 
canteens, further demonstrating its commitment to renewable energy.
	
Carbon Emission Reduction
	
Navneet’s efforts to lower its carbon footprint have been recognised by its primary customer in their Gigaton project, awarding 
the Company the title of ‘Giga-guru’.
	
By integrating renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Navneet contributes meaningfully to global climate 
change mitigation efforts. The Company remains committed to exploring and adopting additional sustainable practices to 
further minimise its environmental impact.

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in 
your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
At Navneet, the safety of employees and the environment in 
handling solvent-based inks and PVC-based adhesives is 
a top priority. This commitment is reflected in the following 
measures:
	
1.	
Waste Management Procedures: A detailed procedure 
identifies all types of waste generated in the factories. 
It outlines in-house storage, collection, and disposal 
methods via scrap dealers and government-authorised 
agencies.
	
2.	
Effluent and Sewage Treatment: Each factory site is 
equipped with Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) and 
Sewage Treatment Plants (STP). All locations operate 
under Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) policies, with treated 
wastewater reused for gardening and irrigation.
	
3.	
Emission Control: Diesel Generator (DG) sets at factory 
locations have stack heights as permitted by local 
Pollution Control Boards. Quarterly stack monitoring 
ensures parameters like Particulate Matter, SOx, and 
NOx remain within permissible limits.
	
4.	
Regular 
Testing 
and 
Monitoring: 
Environmental 
parameters, including ambient air quality, drinking 
water, stack emissions, food safety, and treated water 
are routinely monitored to maintain a clean, hygienic 
workplace and avoid adverse impacts on surrounding 
communities.
	
5.	
Accidental Spill Prevention: Spill kits are provided in 
high-risk areas, and hazardous waste generated during 
spill control is disposed of in compliance with local 
Pollution Control Board guidelines.
	
6.	
Reusable Water-Based Ink Carboys: To reduce plastic 
waste, water-based ink carboys are lined with polybags 
for reuse by manufacturers, significantly lowering 
plastic consumption.
	
7.	
Waste Minimization Initiatives:
	
8.	
Wiro Product Packaging Return Programme: Customers 
are encouraged to return packaging materials such as 
boxes, rings, and cores for reuse, helping to reduce 
waste and conserve resources.
	
9.	
PET Strap Reuse: PET straps used for palletizing export 
and internal materials are reused to support a circular 
economy, reduce waste, and save costs.
	
10.	
Optimising Resource Use:
	
11.	
Improved Adhesive Carboy Design: Adhesive carboys 
have been redesigned with wider mouths and liners 
to maximise adhesive use and minimise waste. 
Switching from 50 kg to 5 kg carboys reduces waste by 
approximately 1 kg per carboy.
	
12.	
Reusable Antiskid Grip Sheets: Instead of single-use 
stretch wrap film, reusable antiskid grip sheets are used 
for moving finished goods and work-in-progress items, 
reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable 
packaging.
	
13.	
Higher-Micron Plastics: The Company is transitioning 
from lower-micron plastics like BOPP, PP bags, and 
shrink film to higher-micron alternatives to lower 
environmental risks linked to plastic use.
	
Navneet also demonstrates its commitment to responsible 
waste management beyond its facilities by registering under 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programme 
for imported plastics and implementing a comprehensive 
Plastic Waste Management plan.
	
These initiatives collectively showcase Navneet’s ongoing 
dedication to minimising its environmental footprint through 
responsible waste management and proactive reduction of 
hazardous chemicals in its products and processes.

Principle 9
Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner.
(This principle highlights the importance of responsible consumer engagement. Companies should provide safe, high-quality products and 
services, and ensure that they are marketed and sold ethically and responsibly. They should also be transparent about their products and 
services, and provide consumers with the information they need to make informed choices.)
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Navneet has established a comprehensive customer complaint handling process to ensure the timely and effective resolution of 
customer grievances. Complaints are categorised into major and minor types, with major complaints, including significant issues such 
as product recalls or delivery failures, while minor complaints pertain to issues like printing defects or service-related concerns.
178
Navneet Education Limited
	
Customers can register complaints through product-specific email addresses, SBU-specific mail IDs, or social media platforms, 
including e-commerce sites. Upon receipt, complaints are routed to the relevant department by the Sales and Marketing team for 
resolution. These complaints may relate to delivery, product quality, pricing, technical glitches, and content-related issues.
	
Each SBU is responsible for maintaining a complaint that tracks the status of each issue as ‘Open’, ‘In Progress’, or ‘Closed’. Based 
on the nature of the complaint, it is forwarded to the appropriate team: product-related issues go to the Quality & Compliance Team, 
service-related concerns to the Customer Support Team, and IT security issues to the IT Security Team. Complaints are marked as 
closed once a resolution is provided; however, if customer feedback reflects dissatisfaction, the complaint is reopened. If a customer’s 
request cannot be fulfilled, the complaint is closed after internal discussions, with the rationale documented. Repetitive complaints 
from the same customer are closed with departmental approval, while recurring issues from multiple customers prompt an internal 
investigation and the implementation of corrective measures. Designated personnel handle specific types of complaints, and defined 
timelines are followed to ensure prompt resolution. Once resolved, feedback is shared with the customer, ensuring transparency and 
reinforcing continuous improvement in service quality.
