In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate 
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications) 
1
Employee and 
workforce 
Health & 
Safety (EHS)
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Non-compliance to EHS 
standards and procedures 
resulting in health and safety 
issues to personnel, accidents, 
fines and penalties.
Opportunity: A comprehensive 
EHS management system 
includes Hazard Identification 
& Risk Assessment (HIRA) 
mitigation plans, root cause 
analysis of the reported 
incidents and corresponding 
corrective action plan which 
helps company to manage its 
EHS issues.
The Company has robust 
EHS management system 
& policies in place and 
undertakes EHS audits, event 
reporting & hazard reporting.
Internal/External audits for 
EHS covers inter alia the 
following:
• Personnel safety
• Process and fire safety
• Electrical safety
The Company also has a 
dedicated software that 
has been implemented 
in all facilities in India for 
reporting and monitoring 
EHS incidents.
Positive: 
Comprehensive
EHS management 
approach enables 
the Company to 
prevent occurrence 
of incidents.
Negative: 
Accidents during 
manufacturing 
operations may 
lead to loss of time 
and have financial 
implications.
2
Governance
Risk
Risk: Lack of establishment 
of effective internal financial 
controls for activities 
performed by service entity 
may lead to fraudulent 
activities and financial loss. 
Inconsistent communications 
among different investors/
sharing of information 
with analysts may lead to 
reputational damage.
• The Company has financial 
SOPs in place.
• Management testing is 
performed annually to 
assess internal controls 
and address deficiencies (if 
any).
• Sharing of the information 
is restricted to information

domain. Any exceptional 
communication requires 
prior approval of senior 
management.
• There are designated 
personnel for investor 
communication and the

Corporate Communication 
policy in place.
Positive: A well-
established internal 
financial control 
and governance 
system may avoid 
fraudulent activities 
and financial losses
3
Anti-
Corruption 
Compliance
Risk
The Company has  customers  
globally and needs to ensure 
that all contracts comply with 
national and international laws 
and regulations. 
This risk may arise from 
associations with supplier 
failure as well. Violations of 
national and international anti-
corruption laws can severely 
undermine a company's 
governance framework and 
erode stakeholder trust.
The Company has adopted 
following approach:
• Establishment of a 
company Anti-Bribery 
Anti-Corruption (ABAC) 
policy, applicable to both 
employees and suppliers.
• Mandatory training on 
ABAC, the code of conduct, 
and ethics for all employees 
and suppliers.

and regulatory 
implications.

a complex supply chain 
that demands specialized 
sourcing, timely deliveries,

whether local or global—can 
delay the procurement of 
raw materials, equipment,

compromising service delivery 
and the integrity of Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) 
standards.
The Company's 
comprehensive supply 
chain resilience program is

and ensure continuity

loss.
5
Environmental 
Performance
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Environmental risks 
are addressed to emphasise 
on the Company’s climate 
consciousness and its 
contribution towards 
managing adverse impact of 
climate change.
Opportunity: Comprehensive 
resource management plans in 
alignment with the Company’s 
environment Conservation 
strategy will highlight the 
Company’s contribution 
towards climate change 
mitigation action plans.
• The Company is focusing 
on waste management to 
attain net-zero impacts.
• The Company ensures ESG 
compliance through its 
comprehensive governance 
and review mechanisms.
Positive:

ESG specific 
initiatives enables 
the Company to 
effectively respond 
to rising stakeholder 
demands.
Negative: Lack 
of ESG initiatives 
and action plans 
to contribute

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
	
The Company is dedicated to fostering a workplace culture rooted in fairness, respect, and equality. To support this 
commitment, it leverages SEEK—a third-party Business Intelligence platform that enables employees to confidentially 
report grievances. The platform ensures complete anonymity, with employee identity protected by agreement with 
vendor. This confidentiality empowers employees to voice concerns without fear of retaliation, reinforcing a safe, 
transparent, and compliant organizational environment. This approach is also applied to complaints under the PoSH 
and Whistle Blower policies, with full compliance to applicable laws and internal safeguards to prevent identity 
disclosure.
