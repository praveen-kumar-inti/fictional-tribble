regulatory requirements and best industry practices. Hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally 
sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation. Hazardous waste (chemicals,

authorized third-party dealers.

Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap are sent to recyclers.
 
iii. 
 Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants 
for co-processing.

 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks.
 
 
 Yes, The Company uses the well-established Incident Management and Investigation System for fair and 
transparent reporting of work-related hazards and risks as unsafe acts/unsafe conditions, near misses, 
injuries and illness and serious incidents. This is followed by a comprehensive Root Cause Failure Analysis

subsequent closure. The outcome and learnings from these events and incidents are deployed horizontally 
across the Group through a systemic process of ‘Critical Vulnerable Factor’ (CVF) as a part of Safety 
Governance Process. The progress on CVF is reviewed during Adani Apex Group Safety Steering Council 
Meetings as well as during their Business Safety Council Meetings. To facilitate this, an advanced digital

 We recognize that consultation with the stakeholders is a continuous process and is led by Leadership from the
front through regular engagements at various platforms. We have a systematic stakeholder engagement process
in place. We seek interactions to respond to trends, global environment, and market requirements. This approach
enables us to proactively evaluate situations. We believe that stakeholders possess the ability to influence
APSEZL’s decisions and in turn, be influenced by the actions of the company.
 To guide our approach to stakeholder engagement, we have established Stakeholder Engagement Policy

enable two-way engagement between the organization and stakeholders. There is continuous dialogue with the
community stakeholders which is reviewed at Business Unit levels. Also, every two years through the thirdparty
engagement, impact, baseline and need assessment, feedback from the stakeholders is taken. In addition to this
through regular engagements at various platforms there is continuous dialogue with the stakeholders and the
same is also presented to the Board. Public consultations are part of the new project and expansion plans, where
feedback and views of the stakeholders is considered for project design.
 Board-level committee: Corporate Responsibility Committee and Stakeholder Relationship Committee is
responsible for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on Sustainability Strategy and long-term
goals & targets, also plays a key strategic role in all business decisions to ensure workplace safety, eliminating
any potential damage to the environment, enhancing a commitment towards stakeholders, and maintaining

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 APSEZL has zero tolerance towards discrimination, bullying, harassment and inappropriate or abusive conduct by 
its stakeholder groups. We have the following measures to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in 
discrimination and harassment cases.
 
 To keep an eye on any harassment and discrimination cases within our company, the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee ensures a strategic alignment of sustainability and human rights with the business. The Risk 
Management Committee oversees the potential and actual risk pertaining to human rights at every stage of 
the project including merger and acquisition through human rights due diligence. Ultimate oversight for human 
rights resides with the Board of Directors, which are briefed on a quarterly basis by the ESG Head.
 
 To make our stakeholders aware of relevant guidelines pertaining to human rights, we upload these on our 
Company website for easy access to all employees and stakeholders. Awareness and familiarization sessions for 
different sets of employee population are also conducted.
9. 
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
 
 Yes, all the suppliers and vendors are required to adhere to APSEZ’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights 
guidelines which provides comprehensive guiding principles and embodies our commitment to internationally

all our business partners is unambiguously conveyed at multiple levels of engagement. During the on-boarding 
process and later, the suppliers undergo third party audit of their operations for compliance with safe working 
condition requirements, avoidance of child and forced labour, environmental and social impacts, and human 
rights due diligence. The human rights aspects are also covered in-depth in our annual survey of the vendors 
and the training programs organized for them. In the survey, the suppliers are required to disclose their policy to 
avoid child labour, forced labour, workplace harassment, gender & ethnic discrimination and their human rights 
due diligence process. The suppliers are assessed on whether their policy is aligned with the requirements set by 
APSEZL for their suppliers and business partners.
 
 Human right due diligence is carried out for mergers and before acquisitions which includes due diligence of 
country reputation in term of respecting human rights, ongoing controversy pertaining to human rights violation

adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
 APSEZL, being in the service industry (i.e., provides services for cargo handling & logistics, operations & 
maintenance of port sector) does not produce any products using hazardous and toxic chemicals. As such, 
we don’t have potential to recycle generated waste in our operations. However, APSEZL complies with all the

been implemented in the handling and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at all operating 
port locations by focusing on 5R principles of waste management i.e., Reduce, Reuse, Reprocess, Recycle and 
Recover. Essential measures we take towards effective waste management:
 
a. 
 We have implemented a sustainable waste management practice by recycling bio-degradable waste and 
using it as manure.
 
b. 
Non-biodegradable waste such as paper, plastic, and scrap are sent to recyclers.
 
c. 
 Non-recyclable and non-recoverable dry waste (loose refused derived fuel) was sent to cement plants 
for co-processing.
 
d. 
STP sludge was used as soil conditioner/manure.
 
e. 
 APSEZL has successfully accomplished its objective of establishing a single-use plastic-free port across its 
sites as part of its commitment to the 5R’s principle.
 
f. 
 We continuously educate and train our employees on responsible waste disposal practices to ensure that 
they are aware of their roles in implementing sustainable waste management practices.
