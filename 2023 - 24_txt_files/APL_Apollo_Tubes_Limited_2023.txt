Corporate Overview  |  Statutory Reports  |  Financial Statements  
26. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Material concerns refer to those that directly or indirectly affect a company's operations, footprint, and its economic, 
environmental, and social value. APL Apollo recognizes that sustainable development involves not only addressing material 
challenges related to corporate governance, operations, and strategy, but also identifying and prioritizing its most important 
challenges based on stakeholder concerns. To understand stakeholders' perspectives, we first identified the relevant ESG 
topics for our industry by evaluating various standards and frameworks. Secondly, we conducted thorough stakeholder 
engagements using questionnaires and collected responses from various stakeholder groups. The issues identified are highly 
relevant to our success and are addressed in our stakeholder communications, internal strategic priorities, and corporate 
responsibility approach. During the reporting period, the list of significant topics underwent revalidation through internal 
stakeholder consultations. The insights gathered from these consultations were then assessed based on whether the material 
topic presents a risk or opportunity for the company, along with its associated financial implications.

1
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
By optimizing energy usage 
and investing in renewable 
energy sources, APL can reduce 
operational costs and improve 
efficiency. Implementing energy-
efficient technologies and 
processes not only reduces carbon 
footprint but also aligns with 
evolving consumer preferences for 
sustainable products. Additionally, 
it can enhance APL Apollo’s brand 
image and attract environmentally 
conscious investors and customers.
By the year 2025, APL Apollo 
aims to ensure that all its plants 
have access to renewable energy. 
Currently, 72% of the plants already 
have this access.
-
Positive
2
Water & 
Effluent 
Management
Risk
Inadequate water management 
practices could result in increased 
operational costs, regulatory fines 
for non-compliance with water 
quality standards, and reputational 
damage due to environmental 
impacts such as pollution or water 
resource depletion. Additionally, 
improper effluent management 
poses risks of contaminating local 
water sources, leading to legal 
liabilities and community backlash.
Optimize water use, treat 
effluents, and implement 
water recycling/reuse 
systems.
APL Apollo has taken a 
target to equip all its plant 
with Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) facilities by 2025. So 
far, 45% of the plants are 
equipped with ZLD.

Emissions 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk
Failure to control emissions 
can lead to regulatory fines 
and penalties, causing financial 
losses and reputational damage. 
Additionally increased stakeholder 
scrutiny, from customers, investors, 
and regulatory bodies, heightens 
the risk, potentially resulting in 
legal action against non-compliant 
companies.
Opportunity
By implementing emission 
reduction measures and adopting 
cleaner technologies, APL can 
enhance its environmental 
performance and reputation as a 
sustainable industry leader, this will 
in turn increase its access to both 
domestic and international markets.
Monitor emissions and 
comply with emission 
standards.
Additionally, APL Apollo 
has adopted a net-zero 
emissions target for 2050, 
aligning with the Science 
Based Targets Initiative.
Positive and 
Negative
4
Waste 
Management
Risk
Improper disposal of waste 
materials can lead to soil and 
water contamination, causing 
harm to ecosystems and local 
communities. Moreover, inefficient 
waste management may result in 
increased operational costs due to 
disposal fees and potential legal 
liabilities.
Reduce, reuse, and recycle 
waste; implement proper 
disposal methods.
At APL Apollo, majority 
of the waste are sold as 
scrap and the remainder 
is repurposed within 
the business operations. 
Additionally, any hazardous 
waste produced within the 
plant’s vicinity is disposed 
via authorized vendors.
Negative
5
Environmental 
Compliance
Risk
Non-compliance with 
environmental regulations can 
result in substantial financial 
penalties, legal liabilities, and 
reputational damage.
Stay updated with 
regulations, conduct 
regular compliance audits, 
and invest in training and 
awareness programs.

compensation claims, and loss 
of productivity.
2. 	 Reputational Damage: Poor 
health and safety practices 
can damage the company's 
reputation, leading to loss of 
customer trust, stakeholder 
confidence, and increase the 
company’s inability to attract 
and retain talent.
1. 	 Risk Assessment:

risks, and implement 
controls to mitigate 
them.
2. 	 Training and Awareness:

Compliance: Failure to uphold 
human rights, diversity, and 
equal opportunity principles 
can result in legal action, fines, 
and reputational damage.
2. 	 Reputation Damage: Violations

diversity and equal opportunity 
can lead to negative publicity, 
harming the company's 
reputation and brand image.
3. 	 Employee Relations: 
Discrimination or lack of 
diversity and equal opportunity 
can lead to employee 
dissatisfaction, low morale, and 
higher turnover rates.
1. 	 Develop and 
implement policies that 
promote human rights, 
diversity, and equal 
opportunity in the 
workplace.
2. 	 Raise awareness about 
the importance of 
human rights and

its commitment to 
upholding human 
rights.

regulations can result in fines, 
penalties, and legal action. 
Adverse labour relations can 
result in legal costs associated 
with resolving disputes.
3. 	 Employee Turnover: Poor labour 
relations can contribute to 
higher turnover rates, leading 
to recruitment and training

high attrition rates and limited 
development of human capital, 
can lead to business disruptions, a 
negative impact on reputation, and 
may impede the Company’s ability 
to achieve its business objectives.

more investors since investors 
often prefer companies with 
transparent and accountable 
governance structures.
Positive
12
Market 
presence
Opportunity
1.	  A strong market presence can 
enhance brand recognition for 
APL Apollo, making its products 
more easily identifiable and 
preferred by customers.
2. 	 A strong presence in existing 
markets can provide a platform 
for expanding into new 
markets, both domestically and 
internationally.

drive revenue growth through 
increased sales and market 
share.

Statement by director responsible for the

ESG related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility

ESG has emerged as an undeniable catalyst for organizational value 
enhancement, serving as a key indicator of productivity and resilience. By 
integrating ESG considerations into our governance and decision-making 
processes, we aim to enhance our ability to identify emerging opportunities 
and mitigate risks effectively. APL Apollo's commitment to excellence has

crucial ESG objectives, thereby contributing significantly to value creation for 
all stakeholders involved.
This year, APL Apollo proudly became a signatory of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC), underscoring our commitment to responsible business 
practices and sustainability. This signifies a significant step forward for the 
company, aligning us with global standards for corporate responsibility 
and emphasizing our dedication to ethical operations, environmental 
stewardship, and social progress. Additionally, APL Apollo has taken a target 
to become Net Zero by 2050 in alignment with the Science Based Target

engagement of the Company’s Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core Matrices (refer to annexure 1) 
for the FY23-24.
Reporting Criteria
The Report is prepared based on BRSR Core Framework 
(Annexure I of the SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/
CIR2023/122 dated July12, 2023 and “Guidance Note for Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Format” by Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
Management Responsibilities
The Company's Management is responsible for identification 
of key aspects,, content and presentation of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with 
the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility includes the 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core Matrices 
which are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the 
requirements of independence and quality assurance set out 
in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements and have 
fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance 
with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption 
that the data and information provided by the Company to 
us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and 
free from material misstatements. We were not involved in the 
preparation of any statements or data included in the report 
except for Assurance Statement.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance conclusion 
on the BRSR Core Matrices, based on the procedures we have 
performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted 
our engagement in accordance with the International Standard 
for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms 
of reference for this engagement as agreed with APL. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform our engagement 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material 
respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the 
Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of 
the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an 
assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance 
conclusions.
Basis of our Opinion
We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence 
we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance 
opinion and the process did not involve engagement with 
external stakeholders. We carried out one-to-one discussions, 
onsite and remote assessments.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of 
sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the disclosures 
presented within the Report and referenced information and 
sampled the disclosures and were reviewed through the APL’s 
customised sustainability information management system.
We undertook the following activities:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the BRSR core matrices ;
•	
Interviewed selected senior managers responsible for 
management of sustainability topics and reviewed 
selected evidences to support issues disclosed in 
208  |     Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
the Report. We were free to choose interviewees and 
interviewed those with overall responsibility to deliver 
APL’s Sustainability objectives;
•	
Reviewed processes and systems for aggregating site level 
sustainability information, that is, reviewed sustainability 
disclosures for selected sites as well as the overall data 
aggregated and consolidated at the Corporate level from 
the Company’s sustainability management system;
•	
Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating 
the selected performance data related to identified material 
topics and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation 
in context under the Principle of Completeness.
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the 
matrices may be materially misstated, determined the nature, 
timing and the extent of further procedures, reviewed records 
and performed testing including recalculation of sample data to 
establish an audit trail.
Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the company’s identified sustainability 
criteria as per BRSR core framework (refer to annexure 1) for the 
year ended 31st March 2024 are not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations
We have relied on the information, documents, records, data, 
and explanations provided to us by the Company for the 
purpose of our review. The assurance scope excludes:
•	
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the scope 
section above
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period
•	
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy 
and other related linkages expressed in the Report.
•	
The reported financial data are based on audited financial 
statements issued by the Company’s statutory auditors 
which is subject to a separate audit process. We were 
not involved in the review of financial data from the 
Annual Report.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe expression of 
opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking 
statements provided by the Company and assertions 
related to Intellectual Property Rights and other 
competitive issues.
•	
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other 
than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria above.
•	
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and extent 
of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
•	
The procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation 
or calculation of data within IT systems.
