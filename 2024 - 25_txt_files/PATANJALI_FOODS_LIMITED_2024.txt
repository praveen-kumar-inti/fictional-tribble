26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Material issue  
identified
Rationale for identifying  
the risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach to  
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Supply Chain 
Resilience
Supply chain disruptions and 
commodity price inflation may 
impact the availability and cost of 
raw materials, particularly due to our 
dependence on both domestic and 
international sourcing.
We aim to reduce import dependence 
by promoting domestic production of 
palm oil while simultaneously expanding 
our presence in international markets, 
enhancing supply chain resilience and 
supporting sustainable growth.
To address this risk, we are 
focusing on reducing import 
dependence by promoting 
domestic production of key raw 
materials. This includes capitalizing 
on domestic oil palm expansion 
programs to reduce import 
dependency and aggressively 
increasing the oil palm planted 
area. Additionally, we are 
enhancing supply chain resilience 
through strategic sourcing and 
fostering strong relationships with 
local suppliers.
Reducing import dependency in 
the supply chain and expanding 
global market yields long-term 
results.
Economic  
Stability
Slowdown in economic activity could 
impact the FMCG industry and sales. 
Volatility in interest rates may affect 
financial performance and lead to 
investment losses.
Align product portfolio with a mix 
of premium, mass, and economy 
segment products, manage interest 
rate risk, and maintain adequate 
liquidity.
Economic slowdown and interest 
rate volatility may impact financial 
performance.
Risk Identification 
& Mitigation
Foreign currency fluctuations and 
commodity price changes impact 
financial performance due to import 
dependency. Business disruption from 
geopolitical events may occur.
The Company aims to reduce import 
dependence through domestic 
production l. This initiative aligns with 
changing consumer preferences and 
global demand for sustainable products.
Minimize import dependency, 
expand domestic oil palm 
plantation, and increase exports to 
create a natural foreign currency 
hedge.
Reducing import dependency and 
increasing exports yield long-term 
results.
Effective 
Corporate 
Governance
Enhancing corporate governance 
improves business transformation and 
reputation.
Establish and implement internal 
policies and improve compliances.
Increase shareholders’ confidence 
and laying the foundation for sound 
financial practices for the short, 
medium and long term. 
Consumer 
Engagement & 
Innovation
Tracking consumer trends and 
strengthening dealer networks 
improve brand reach and cater to 
changing preferences.
Constantly analyse the market, 
selecting the best suppliers and 
venture into promising markets.
Diversified product portfolio leads 
to increased consumer satisfaction 
and sales.

renewable materials create a 
sustainable environment. Negative 
- Increased costs of recycling and 
packaging.
Climate 
Resilience  
& Adaptation
Climate change events impact business.
Opportunity lies in sourcing 
sustainability and developing local 
supply chains.
Sustainable sourcing, water-saving 
solutions, local supply chains, and 
oil palm plantation in India.
Reduced import dependencies 
and focus on water usage create 
resilience. Negative - Impact extent 
depends on the event.
Compliance 
& Regulatory 
Adherence
Non-compliance with laws damages 
reputation and affects business 
growth. Adverse changes in 
regulations could impact results.
Comply with State & Central laws, 
monitor and review compliance, 
and maintain vigil mechanisms.
No immediate financial implication, 
but potential costs in the long run.
Data Security & 
Privacy
Disruptions from cyberattacks and 
non-availability of critical information 
impact business operations and 
results.
Robust IT systems, firewalls, 
contingency measures, and 
employee training.
Implications depend on the 
effectiveness of the mitigation 
approach.

achieved several milestones:
	
Renewable energy: We generated 84.6 MW of wind energy, of which 18.6 MW (22%) was used for our own operations. We also 
completed the first year of operations at our Bhagwanpura solar power plant. Renewable energy now contributes 22% of our 
operations, supplemented by biomass as renewable fuel across several plants. Collectively, our green energy initiatives led to the 
sequestration of 87,336 tonnes of CO₂.
	
Energy efficiency: Targeted measures increased renewable fuel consumption by 23%, reduced non-renewable fuel consumption by 
7%, and lowered Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 7% compared to the previous year.
	
Oil palm expansion: Our oil palm plantations now span 89,546 hectares, all equipped with drip irrigation systems. We directly 
procured Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs) from 63,915 farmers. Supporting infrastructure includes 49 nurseries, 21 fertilizer godowns, 
173 collection centres, and partnerships with 202 Farmer Producer Organizations.
	
Community development: Rural India accounted for 6.77% of total jobs created. We invested H21.87 crore in Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives focused on health, education, and sports.
	
Environmental stewardship: We expanded Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities to seven sites and ensured all other locations 
operate advanced effluent treatment systems. Our nutraceutical business continues to promote organically grown products.
	
These achievements highlight our commitment to sustainability, operational excellence, and creating long-term value for the 
environment and society.

Environment, Health & Safety policy, the company lays down its commitment to safe and healthy working conditions. 
The policy is available on the company web site www.patanjalifoods.com. 
	
We have implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System that spans across all our operational 
units and offices. Our plants are ISO 45001 certified which covers the Health and Safety hazards with a commitment to 
continually improve our health and safety performance and prevention of injuries. We remain dedicated to conducting 
operations responsibly to safeguard our employees, the environment, and the communities in which we operate.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
	
We have adopted a comprehensive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks in order to maintain 
a safe working environment. Our multifaceted process incorporates periodic safety audits, inspections, and Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) techniques.
	
Our advanced safety management system allows us to identify potential workplace risks and hazards, enabling us to 
implement preventive measures and avoid incidents. One of our key tools in maintaining safety is our near-miss reporting. 
This encourages employees to report any potential incidents within our premises, allowing us to conduct thorough 
investigations, determine causes, and implement corrective actions.
	
Additionally, we have Environmental, Health, and Safety Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place to guide our 
operations and ensure the safety of our employees and workers. The primary goal of this control is to create a safe 
workplace free from harm, as well as to provide training and an awareness program on important workplace risks by 
using the techniques listed below:
	
1.	
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) is used for routine and non-routine activities, conducted yearly 
or as required by any process change.
	
2.	
Safety Audits are carried out periodically to identify hazards and the corresponding risks.
	
3.	
Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) is used for identifying hazards related to chemical processes.
	
Furthermore, we have a comprehensive Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy. The health and safety guidelines 
are applicable and followed across all operations. Some of the key processes for identifying work-related hazards and 
assessing risks on a routine and non-routine basis are given below:
	} Pre-start safety review (PSSR) is used and followed for new processes, post any changes/modification activities and 
Plant restart up after preventive maintenance.
	} The online work permit system implemented along with comprehensive JSEA   to control non-routine job hazards and 
implement control measures against identified risk.
	} Management of change (MOC) is implemented and followed for all changes including Man, Machine, and Material.
	} Apart from the above-mentioned measures, to promote effective implementation of control measures, workers are 
provided with regular ‘Safety talks & Tool Box Talk’ to communicate available control measures and ensure that all 
safety protocols are being followed. Through these consistent efforts, we achieved a significant 70% reduction in 
Lost Time Injury (LTI) accidents across group companies, with zero fatal accidents recorded.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes., we have established a comprehensive safety framework across all our business segments to ensure that our 
workers can promptly report work-related hazards and take necessary steps to safeguard themselves.
	
1.	
Direct Reporting: Workers can directly report any hazards or risks to their supervisors or the designated safety officer. 
16
INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25
	
2.	
Incident Reporting: We have a system in place where workers can document potential hazards through incident 
reporting. Furthermore, non-reporting or hiding of Incident reporting dealt with disciplinary action. This ensures 
transparency in system and enables us to take adequate CAPA in all the units.
	
3.	
Safety Committee Meetings: Regular safety committee meetings provide a platform for workers to report work-
related hazards and discuss mitigation plans. These meetings encourage open dialogue and collective problem-
solving.
	
4.	
Online Safety Observation Register: We maintain a safety observation register, allowing workers to document and 
report any unsafe conditions or acts. This approach aims to prevent minor issues from escalating into major accidents.
	
5.	
Incident Management System: Our incident management system enables workers to report incidents in a specified 
format, ensuring standardized and efficient documentation.
	
6.	
Regular Plant Rounds: Regular interaction with shop floor workers during daily plant rounds provides opportunities 
to address any work-related hazards and concerns directly. These multiple channels of communication foster a 
proactive reporting culture and contribute significantly to the safety and well- being of our workforce.
	
7.	
Online Platform (EHS Software): We implemented an online platform for incident reporting, allowing us to record 
all incidents from any given location. Based on these reports, we implement Corrective Action and Preventive 
Action (CAPA) measures and distribute an incident learning report to all related individuals. This process assists us 
in preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.
	
We remain committed to maintaining a safe working environment and ensuring the welfare of our workers. 
d.	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, all the manufacturing facilities have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services in accordance 
with the statutory requirements outlined in the Factories Act, 1948, including the provision of first aid boxes to address 
immediate medical needs at the workplace. Employees and workers have continuous access to medical treatment for 
non-occupational health issues. 
	
In addition, all units have established partnerships with reputable hospitals to ensure timely response to emergency 
medical needs across all levels of the workforce. To further safeguard employee well-being, we provide Employees’ State 
Insurance (ESI) coverage and Medical Insurance based on eligibility, covering both occupational and non-occupational 
healthcare service.

1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
We view our stakeholders as integral partners in shaping our strategy and driving sustainable growth. We identify 
stakeholders based on their relationship and proximity to our operations, their dependence on our business, their ability 
to influence decisions, and our financial, legal, or ethical responsibilities toward them. 
	
At the core are employees, farmers, suppliers, and customers, who are directly engaged in our value chain. At the next 
level are investors, governments bodies, and local communities who both influence and are impacted by our activities. 
In the wider ecosystem, we engage with industry bodies, NGOs, trade unions, and civil society organizations. We 
also recognize vulnerable groups, such as women, children, migrant workers, persons with disabilities, and Indigenous 
communities, who may be disproportionately affected and therefore require focused engagement.
	
We engage through two-way, inclusive communication channels such as consultations, investor meetings and earnings 
calls, employee engagement programs, structured feedback processes, and grievance mechanisms.

STATUTORY REPORTS
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
As part of our commitment to transparency and accountability, we have established strong internal mechanisms to address 
grievances related to human rights concerns. For employees and workers, we provide multiple accessible channels such as 
HR Konnect, the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Committee, and dedicated email support, through which concerns 
can be raised directly or anonymously. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Whistleblower Policy enable individuals across 
the organization to report issues, including those linked to human rights, without fear of retaliation.
	
Our grievance redressal framework extends beyond employees to include suppliers, farmers, local communities, and 
other stakeholders who may be affected by our operations. Dedicated feedback and grievance mechanisms are available 
at site level and through our community outreach programs, ensuring that concerns from external stakeholders are also 
heard and addressed.
	
We place special emphasis on vulnerable groups, such as women, children, migrant workers, and marginalized 
communities. Mechanisms are designed to remain accessible, confidential, and culturally appropriate, ensuring these 
groups can raise issues without barriers. For example, grievances can be submitted in local languages, and community-
level engagement channels provide safe spaces for vulnerable groups to express concerns.
	
All grievances are formally recorded, reviewed, and investigated by the Human Resources team under the oversight of 
the Chief Operating Officer (COO). Outcomes and corrective actions are communicated back to the concerned parties, 
except in cases where anonymity is chosen. 
	
Over time, we plan to implement ISO 26000 on Social Responsibility, establish robust mechanisms to adopt a 
comprehensive policy to uphold the rights of all stakeholders.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
	
We maintain a strict zero-tolerance approach toward any form of retaliation or adverse consequences faced by individuals 
who raise genuine concerns. Through regular interactions and clearly defined reporting mechanisms, we ensure that 
all concerns are heard, respected, and addressed with due diligence. To support this commitment, we have established 
and implemented:
	} A comprehensive Whistleblower Policy, enabling employees and stakeholders to report unethical behaviour, 
misconduct, or violations confidentially and without fear.
	} A robust Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Policy, ensuring a safe and respectful workplace for all.
	
All grievances are managed in accordance with the highest standards of fairness, confidentiality, and integrity, reflecting 
our commitment to ethical business practices and a culture of transparency and accountability.

Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
	
Yes, human rights requirements do form part of our business agreements and contracts, as outlined in our Human Rights 
Policy. Our policy is not limited to employees alone but extends to all stakeholders, including associates, customers, 
vendors, and contractors, making it applicable across our contractual and business relationships. We are committed to 
ensuring equal opportunities, prohibiting discrimination and harassment, fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, 
and strictly abolishing child labour and forced labour. 
	
In addition, we uphold the rights to freedom of association, opinion, and expression, while also guaranteeing fair wages, 
safe working conditions, and a healthy work environment. By explicitly including vendors and contractors within the scope 
of our Human Rights Policy, we ensure that these requirements are integrated into our supply chain and business dealings, 
thereby reinforcing that respect for human rights is an integral part of our agreements and contractual obligations.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Continuing our commitment to sustainable practices, we strictly adhere to government regulations for the safe and 
compliant disposal of hazardous waste. We are focused on minimizing waste generation and disposal by adopting the 
“5 R’s” principle: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle—wherever feasible across our operations.
	
A variety of initiatives support this waste reduction strategy:
	} In our Palm Plantation business, solid waste such as Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB), fibre, and shells is effectively utilized 
as organic fertilizer and fuel, promoting a closed-loop system.
	} Liquid waste, including Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), is sustainably managed to minimize environmental impact.
	} In the Oleo Chemicals business, byproducts from edible oil processing are used as primary feedstock, reinforcing our 
commitment to resource efficiency and circular economy practices.
	
These integrated waste management practices help us to reduce our environmental footprint and promote long-term 
resource sustainability.
