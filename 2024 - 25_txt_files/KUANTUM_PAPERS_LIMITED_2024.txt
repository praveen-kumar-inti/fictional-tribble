(Indicate

implications)
1
Wood 
availability
Risk
Risk: Wood pulp constitutes 
the major portion of the 
pulp furnish for the paper 
manufacturing in the 
Company. Availability of 
quality raw material i.e., 
wood, may be a risk due to a 
major gap between demand 
and supply. Further, price 
mismatches may be another 
big challenge, which is 
mainly due to demand for 
quality raw materials and 
acceptance of all types of 
wood by other wood-based 
Industries, i.e., MDF/Ply/
Peeling/ Particle Boards.
To mitigate supply risk associated 
with wood procurement for pulping 
and finally for manufacturing of 
paper, the Company has already 
taken major initiatives towards 
promotion of Social, Farm and 
Agroforestry programmes in and 
around the Mills within a radius 
of 150-200 KM with local farm 
communities to ensure consistent 
and regular supply of quality wood 
on sustained basis. 
The Company has its own well 
defined Plantation Development 
Strategy to increase massive 
plantation coverage with the help of 
marginal and progressive growers 
in the nearby districts of Punjab and 
adjoining states. The Company has 
also developed potential wood and 
bamboo suppliers for a sustained & 
uninterrupted supply of wood and 
bamboo, irrespective of seasons 
as they have sufficient potential to 
secure wood from farmers directly. 
Negative 
Implication 
2
Coal availability 
& energy cost
Risk / Opportunity
Risk: Consistent supply of 
coal is a challenge & higher 
usage of coal increases 
energy cost.
Opportunity: Since this 
opens up avenues to move 
towards non-fossil fuel-
based energy sources.
The Company has a well-defined 
strategy to reduce its dependency 
on Coal through renewable energy 
sources and Biomass fuels like Agro-
wood dust, bark, rice husk, etc. 
Negative 
Implication
3
Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) 
Emissions
Risk
Risk: The pulp and paper 
manufacturing process 
emits GHGs through the 
combustion of fossil fuels 
and biomass in boilers and 
processing units. Regulatory 
risks associated with 
emissions are rising. However, 
using carbon-neutral biomass 
can reduce both fuel costs 
and regulatory exposure. 
Companies that effectively 
manage emissions benefit 
from operational efficiency 
and reduced compliance 
costs.
The Company has adopted a 
multifaceted emission reduction 
strategy. This includes substituting 
fossil fuels with biofuels, maximizing 
efficiency in power generation 
units, and utilizing CO₂ emissions 
to produce value-added products 
like Precipitated Calcium Carbonate. 
Complementing these efforts is a 
large-scale Social, Farm & Agro 
Forestry programme, which is 
aimed at carbon sequestration and 
sustainable raw material sourcing.

4
Water 
Management
Risk
Risk: Water is a critical 
resource in pulp processing, 
cooling, and energy 
production. High water 
usage and resulting 
wastewater pose operational, 
environmental, and 
regulatory risks, especially 
under water-scarcity 
scenarios.
The Company has implemented 
comprehensive water conservation 
initiatives. These include recycling 
backwater and condensate, using 
treated water for non-process 
applications, upgrading equipment, 
and reducing per-unit water 
consumption significantly through 
3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) 
principles.
The Company has started using 
canal water in operation. 
Negative 
Implications
5
Unforeseen 
climatic 
conditions 
affecting 
the farming, 
thereby 
restricting the 
Supply of wheat 
straw
Risk
Risk: Since wheat straw 
is a key input material 
for Agro pulp for the 
Company, any unforeseen 
climatic conditions may 
affect its supply. Further, 
if Company faces its 
shortage, consequently the 
procurement cost increases 
and production may be 
delayed which can affect 
overall operations and 
profitability.
The Company has developed 
potential suppliers who can provide 
a sustainable and regular supply 
regardless of seasons, as they have 
sufficient storage capacity.
Negative 
Implication
6
Regulatory 
Issues and 
Compliance
Risk
Risk: Non-compliance may 
affect the brand image 
and customer trust, and 
engagement.
Adherence to the compliance 
monitoring system

Statutory Reports
 
 
Comprehensive Safety Training Programs and Awareness Campaigns conducted regularly for all workers and staff.
 
 
Functioning Safety Committees comprising representatives from both management and workforce, which meet 
periodically to review safety performance, address concerns, and recommend improvements.
 
 
Internal and External Audits are carried out routinely to evaluate compliance with safety standards and to drive 
continuous improvement.
	
	
Through these integrated practices, Kuantum Papers ensures a culture of safety, prevention, and accountability, thereby 
strengthening operational excellence and workforce morale.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Yes, the Company has a well-defined and proactive framework for identifying work-related hazards and assessing risks, both 
for routine and non-routine activities. Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) risk management is deeply integrated into the 
Company’s operational strategy, forming the foundation of a strong safety culture across all facilities.
	
	
Processes for Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment:
 
 
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): All activities—routine, non-routine, and emergency are subject to 
systematic HIRA to evaluate potential risks and define appropriate control measures.
 
 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA): Conducted prior to the initiation of high-risk tasks to break down job steps, identify associated 
hazards, and assign preventive actions accordingly.
 
 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Each process is governed by SOPs that embed safety protocols and are strictly 
followed by trained personnel. SOPs are reviewed periodically for relevance and updated as necessary.
 
 
Employee Participation: Workers and staff are actively engaged through hazard identification tours, safety suggestion 
schemes, near-miss reporting, and toolbox talks, creating a culture of shared responsibility for safety.
 
 
Hierarchy of Controls: The Company applies the hierarchy of controls—elimination, substitution, engineering controls, 
administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE)—to mitigate identified risks effectively.
 
 
Handling of Hazardous Substances: Special risk assessments and control plans are in place for handling hazardous 
chemicals, with clear labeling, storage protocols, and emergency response plans.
 
 
Training and Competency Development: Regular safety training programs, mock drills, and awareness sessions ensure 
that all employees and contractors are well-versed in safe work practices and emergency preparedness.
 
 
Safety Committees: Each operational site has a functional Safety Committee comprising representatives from both 
management and the workforce. These committees meet regularly to review incident reports, near-misses, audit findings, 
and to recommend corrective actions.
 
 
Audit and Continuous Improvement: Internal and third-party audits are conducted at planned intervals. Findings are 
used to drive continuous improvement through corrective and preventive action plans.
	
	
Through this comprehensive and dynamic approach, Kuantum Papers ensures a safe and resilient work environment 
while continuously enhancing its occupational risk management practices in line with industry best standards and 
statutory requirements.

regulatory compliance and responsible reuse. Treated effluent is safely utilized for irrigation across approximately 2,050 acres 
of agricultural land through a dedicated pipeline network in nearby villages. This approach aligns with best practices and sectoral 
assessments, including findings from the Central Pulp & Paper Research Institute (CPPRI), which confirm that ZLD is not a feasible 
solution for such processes. The Company remains committed to water conservation and continuously invests in optimizing 
wastewater treatment and resource efficiency.

Yes, the Company has a Fibre Sourcing Policy that promotes inclusive growth by giving preference to suppliers from 
marginalized and vulnerable groups. This includes encouraging small and marginal farmers to participate in the wood supply 
chain. The Company ensures equal opportunity by directly procuring wood from these farmers and supporting them through 
the provision of high-yielding clonal saplings with shorter rotation cycles. This approach not only strengthens rural livelihoods 
but also aligns with the Company’s commitment to equitable and sustainable development.

growing clonal saplings at subsidized rates and promoting intercropping practices on small landholdings to enhance their 
income. A structured buyback arrangement ensures market access and income security for these growers.
	
	
Additionally, the Company fosters the development of local vendors, particularly micro, small, and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs), by building their capabilities and integrating them into its supply chain. These efforts align with national initiatives 
like ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat,’ promoting self-reliance, inclusive economic development, and social equity across 
the communities it operates in.
