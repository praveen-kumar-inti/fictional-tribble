1. 	
LPG in HTF (capex-0.88%): PNG is being used in heat treatment furnaces, 
but due to Ukraine & Russia war & geopolitical conditions , availability of PNG 
is hampered leading to high rate /cost. Thus, rather than selecting LDO/FO, 
we chose LPG as a clean fuel because, harmful emission such as oxides 
of sulphur, carbon dioxide, suspended particulate matter and nitrogen are 
significantly lower. Hence, we installed LPG Manifold Project for the Heat 
Treatment Furnace.
2. 	
RENEWABLE ENERGY (capex-25.79%): Hybrid Project (4.2 MW Windmill + 
3.78 MWp solar at Village Dedan Gujarat. AIA has developed a long-term 
strategy to address emissions by investing in a systemic increase in the 
percentage of renewable energy out of the total energy consumed by the 
Company. Company already has installed wind energy turbine at Gujarat 
with installed capacity 24.3 MW of Renewable Energy upto F.Y. 2021-22. 
Further company increased share by installing two set of Hybrid project (4.2 
MW Windmill+ 3.78 MWp Solar) in Gujarat in F.Y. 2022-23. Hybrid solar wind 
systems are the best choice to invest in renewable energy sources to ensure 
sustainability. 
3.	
LED Lighting (capex- 0.03)Replacing conventional sodium vapour light with 
LED light, LED lights are energy-efficient, long-lasting, emit less heat and offer

to approach the factory manager or HR manager as convenient; these 
managers also make themselves available at the plant and on the shop 
floor on a regular basis. b. The worker submits a complaint (written / verbal) 
to shift / department supervisor, who in turn reports it to his functional head, 
this is reported to the factory manager and HR. c. Complaints are addressed 
and resolved on priority within a month. d. However, if complaints relate to 
financial implications and require policy changes, then the same will have to 
be placed before the grievance redressal committee meeting, which meets 
quarterly. e. For sexual harassment, the Company has in place the said 
policy and required procedures and a committee has been constituted to 
address any such issues.

yes, name of the external agency.- NO
	
EI-9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.- Our goal is to reduce the amount of waste we produce and make sure that it is reused or 
recycled for the same or a different purpose. A ‘waste hierarchical approach’ is applied, to reduce, reuse, recycle and recover 
waste products in preference to disposal of waste in alignment with the circular economy. Where possible, we explore 
opportunities for the use of recycled materials and reuse of waste by us or other companies through co-processing of 
foundry waste and other waste as alternative raw material or fuel. It presents opportunities for environmental stewardship 
and helps us manage raw material price-related risks. The Company takes waste management seriously and works towards 
reducing, reusing, and recycling its waste wherever possible. We optimise the use of key resources including minerals and 
ensure waste minimisation at sources and facilitate recovery, and recycling. We follow waste management standards that 
meet or exceed applicable legal requirements and we incorporate industry best practices into our operations and services. 
We recognise the negative impact of improper waste disposal on the environment and as a result, put in place strong 
mechanisms to treat and dispose of the generated waste. We ensure that all waste we generate from our activities is re-
melted into the furnace or recycled through authorised recyclers and vendors applying the Principles of Circular Economy.

Eco-friendly Bricks/Paver blocks making –Reusing of Foundry – Sand & Plastic. AIA has invested ` 0.5 Crores to erect 
a captive brick-making plant that can produce 200 Bricks/Paver blocks per day by using in-house waste material. Paver 
blocks and bricks are manufactured by using foundry dust, sand, and plastic waste. This is a good way to use industrial 
waste like sand waste (80%), shredded plastic waste (20%) from pp. bags), to make ‘Eco-friendly - Silica Plastic Blocks/
Bricks’ - a sustainable building material. For F.Y. 2022-23, Estimated 150 MT waste materials (sand & plastic bags) 
were used, and more than 50000 bricks & paver blocks were produced. These bricks have more strength than the 
conventional red bricks and can be used to construct footpath/pedestal ways, compound walls, sanitary facilities like 
toilets & washrooms, and decorative structures in schools, penchant, and personal buildings. The paver blocks have 
a strength equivalent to M 35 of cement paver blocks and can be used for road construction for heavy commercial 
vehicle usage. 
2.	
Co-processing - Reuse of Foundry Sand in Cement Kiln Waste generation is an inadvertent outcome of foundry 
operations, so it becomes necessary to deal with its repercussions. The Company has signed an MOU with Ambuja 
Cement Limited (Adani Group Co.) to provide a sustainable business solution for the waste sand generated by moulding 
process in the foundries is a solid waste. The waste discarded sand is used in cement kiln technology (co-processing) 
in a manner that ensures regulatory compliance, clubbed with the highest standards in OH&S. Ambuja cement is 
consuming waste generated by AIA safely in its cement kilns at the plant located at Kodinar, Dist. Gir Somnath, Gujarat. 
For F.Y. 2022-23 Total : 14457 tonnes of waste silica sand were used in Co- Processing at Ambuja Cement Limited 
Sustainable waste Disposal & Certificate: For each consignment of waste co-processed at Ambuja Cement Limited 
(Now Adani group co.), they provide a certificate of disposal, mentioning the quantity of waste consumed by them. 
3. 	 Effective utilisation of Kitchen /Canteen waste Unit has processed 6.179 MT Canteen –Kitchen – scraped food and 
waste into Organic manure through in house bioneer – organic waste converter machine and generated finished 
organic manure estimated 2.665 MT used as soil admixture. Similarly 64.260 MT wet waste generated at the premise 
is composted through start up agency M/s. Duro Green Waste Management Private Limited. These ways effective 
utilisation of Kitchen /Canteen waste estimated in total: 70 MT. Hazardous Waste Hazardous waste is being disposed 
of by following the hierarchy of disposal to create wealth from waste to promote a circular economy. To ensure material 
conservation, the top priority is given to Co-processing and/or recycling facility rather than TSDF/INC for hazardous 
waste disposal.

Non-hazardous Waste Sand - The Company has integrated mechanical and thermal reclaimer to recycle its moulding 
sand. This has helped reduce the requirement for silica sand by 80%. The waste sand generated is used in co-processing 
in the cement kiln / Bricks & Paver block making. For F.Y. 2022-23 Total : 14457 tonnes of waste silica sand were used in 
Co- Processing at Ambuja Cement Limited For Year: 2022-23 Estimated 150 MT waste materials (sand & plastic bags) were 
used, and more than 50000 bricks & paver blocks were produced. Slag - Slag is reprocessed in our captive slag processing 
plant for metal recovery and recovered metal is reused as raw material in foundry operations. Year 2022-23: Total 7863 
Ton slag is processed in Slag Processing Plant and Total 900 tonnes of metal is recovered which is reused in our plant for 
casting production. Runner and raiser - generated in the manufacturing of grinding media are being reused as raw material

Direct Energy is used in the heat treatment process at all our foundry 
units. We have switched to Piped Natural Gas (PNG) & Liquid 
petroleum Gas (LPG) from Light Diesel Oil and C9 to reduce our 
Scope 1 emissions. We have also installed flue gas recuperates on 
all the gas (PNG) fired Heat Treatment Furnaces. It helps to improve 
furnace efficiency and recover heat from the flue gases. The waste 
heat recovered is used in preheating the combustion air supply to the 
burners.

Reuse of Foundry Sand in Cement Kiln - Co-processing Waste 
generation is an inadvertent outcome of foundry operations, so 
it becomes necessary to deal with its repercussions. Discarded 
moulding sand from the foundries is a solid waste and a by-product 
of the production process. We have signed an MOU with Ambuja 
Cement Limited (Adani Group Co.) to provide a sustainable business 
solution for the sand waste generated. The waste discarded sand 
is used in cement kiln technology (co-processing) in a manner that 
ensures regulatory compliance, clubbed with the highest standards 
in OH&S. Ambuja cement is consuming waste generated by AIA‘s 
safely in its cement kilns at the plant located at Kodinar, Dist. Gir 
Somnath, Gujarat. Sustainable waste Disposal & Certificate: For each 
consignment of waste co-processed at Ambuja Cement /Geocycle, 
they provide a certificate of disposal mentioning the quantity of waste 
consumed by them. Total: 14457 Ton waste sand from foundry was 
used for Co- Processing at Ambuja Cement Limited

LI-7. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.- Yes, an 
onsite emergency plan is prepared with the primary aim to protect all employees, persons in the vicinity and Company property, 
against fire, explosion or other major accidents that might occur due to natural or man-made disaster. The success of this 
plan depends largely on each individual carrying out his designated duties effectively and promptly. Considering the number 
of employees, material, process, and availability of resources, location of the site, and the plan is prepared. Objectives of the 
emergency planning are as follows:
(a)	 To define and to assess emergencies, including risk and environmental impact assessment.
(b)	 To prevent the emergency turning into a disaster. 
(c)	
To safeguard employees and people in vicinity. 
(d)	 To minimise damage to property or/and the environment. 
(e)	
To inform employees, the general public and the authority about the hazards/risks assessed, safeguards provided, residual 
risk if any and the role to be played by them in the event of emergency. 
(f)	
To be ready for ‘Mutual Aid’ if need arises to help neighbouring unit. 
(g)	 To inform authorities and mutual-aid centre to come for help. 
(h)	 Effective rescue and treatment of casualties. 
(i)	
To identify and list any dead injury. 
(j)	
To inform and help relatives. 
(k)	
To secure the safe rehabilitation of affected areas and to restore normalcy. 
(l)	
To provide authoritative information to the new media. 
(m)	 To preserve records, equipment etc. and to organise investigation into the cause of the emergency and preventive measures 
to stop its reoccurrence. 
(n)	 To ensure safety of the works before personnel re-enter and resume work. 
(o)	 To work out a plan with all provisions to handle emergencies and to provide for emergency preparedness and the periodical 
rehearsal of the plan. For Example: Disaster Management Plan for Information Technology (IT): Current global environment 
is having severe threat to cyber security in different nature like Ransomware, Hacking, Malware, Spoofin etc. The Company 
has carried out various mitigation programmes but development of various other techniques of threat to cyber security 
would always be a concern. However, it would not be possible to fully secure the system with limitation of knowledge about 
new viruses and techniques of breach of cyber security. The Company mitigates the risk to possible extent. The Company 
has set up disaster recovery mechanism so it is possible to divert the traffic on disaster recovery server (Secondary server) 
and our operation will not be disturbed. Every quarter, the IT team conducts a DR drill, and the results are satisfactory.

Essential Indicators
EI-1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.- Customer Feedback 
Management Continuous and ongoing feedback from customers is used to align with the requirements of the customers. We 
have a process in place for handling customer complaints related to products and services. A complaint is normally received 
by the concerned field engineer, who forwards it to Controller QA for further investigation. Wherever practicable, samples are 
collected and analysed to understand the reasons for failure. For all serious and not serious complaints, a root cause analysis is 
carried out and appropriate corrective actions are taken. All complaints are resolved to the satisfaction of customers and the same 
is communicated to the customer through field engineers. Measuring Customer Satisfaction, We have a system for monitoring 
information relating to customer perceptions of the products. Feedback is obtained from customers to represent the spectrum of 
activities. The attributes assessed are delivery, performance of the product, and after-sales service. The performance is graded 
on a scale of 1 to 4. Based on feedback received, the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) is worked out every year based on the 
weighted average method. In the reporting year, the CSI score was 97%.
