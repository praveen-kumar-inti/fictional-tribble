Risk 
Management 
(Including 
ESG risks)
Opportunity ABCL and its subsidiaries have  identified 
effective risk management as an 
enabler for meeting business objectives 
and delivering long-term value for all 
stakeholders.
The Company and  its subsidiaries 
continue to face various types of risks, 
such as market risk. Additionally, we 
continue to face multidimensional ESG-
linked risks, including those related to 
climate change. To mitigate these risks, 
the Company follows a data-driven risk 
management approach, and has in place a 
robust, Board-approved Risk Management 
Framework.
There exists an opportunity for the 
Company to build on its momentum 
of ESG integration, and to continue 
to innovate on its risk management 
framework to adapt to emerging risks, 
including those linked to ESG, climate 
change, and the rapidly changing 
regulatory landscape of the financial 
services industry.
In line with regulatory requirements, the 
Board has formed a Risk Management 
Committee (RMC), which oversees all 
key and operational aspects of risk 
management.
Our existing Risk Management Framework 
is designed to help identify, address, 
and mitigate emerging risks in a timely 
and efficient manner. Key and guiding 
objectives of this framework include 
enabling oversight and monitoring, 
facilitating strategic and data-driven 
decision-making, and ensuring effective 
checks and balances.
Through this robust framework, we have 
created an ecosystem of policies and 
practices to effectively mitigate any 
emerging risks. The RMC drives and 
oversees the ESG and ESG-linked risk 
monitoring agenda at the Company.
As a result, we have created an enabling 
environment to mitigate and adapt to 
emerging risks of varying nature.
Positive:
Our robust risk management 
framework and the effective 
oversight of risks ensured by 
the Committee has enabled 
the Company to effectively 
adapt to emerging risks, such 
as those arising from the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Through multiple initiatives, 
we aim to further strengthen 
our performance on financial 
and sustainability parameters.
Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
Increasing digitization in the financial 
services industry and the way companies 
operate bring with it associated risks, 
especially concerning data security and 
privacy. Given the increasingly complex 
digitization landscape in the financial 
services industry, we see cybersecurity-
related risk management and customer 
data privacy protection as key  
imperatives.
Given the nature of the business and its 
focus on customer centricity, the company 
sees the following as significant risks 
related to data privacy and security:
1.	 Phishing threats (Customers)
2.	 Ransomware (Company-level)
3.	 Loss or negative impact on proprietary 
data (Customers’ personal data and 
Company data)
4.	 Negative impact or cyber-attacks on 
the Company’s IT infrastructure
We view these risks as having the 
potential to impact ABCL’s core IT 
systems, its internal and external 
databases, its customers’ finances, and 
consequently its reputation and credibility 
in the market. 
We are committed to safeguarding our 
employees’ and customers’ data privacy 
and have actively taken steps to address 
emerging risks related to the same.
We have a centralized strategy to achieve 
compliance on data privacy, and applied 
it to all; subsidiaries . Specifically, to 
safely manage and protect customers’ 
data, ABCL has a defined set of principles 
and protocols in place, in line with 
regulatory requirements. Additionally, 
with a robust and comprehensive Cyber 
Security framework, we have put in place 
safeguards to ensure data privacy and 
security.
To address risks such as data theft or 
cyber attacks, we have a robust reporting 
and resolution mechanism in place – for 
customers and employees alike.
We have also implemented and 
consistently strengthened  Data Loss 
Prevention (DLP) policies.
As a result of such efforts, as of FY 23, 
no security breaches or data loss was 
reported.
Negative:
The potential additional or 
increased costs incurred to 
manage timely, frequent and 
customized updates to:
1.	 Internal IT infrastructure 
and architecture
2.	 Software purchases
3.	 IT Hardware 
4.	 Changes as a result 
of sector-specific or 
theme-specific regulatory 
requirements

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Within corporate governance, business 
ethics and integrity, responsible business 
conduct, and compliance with changing 
regulatory requirements and disclosures 
are some of the high priority issues for 
ABCL and its subsidiaries.
Ongoing and rapid changes in the 
markets, regulatory landscape in the 
industry, and in regulations pertaining to 
product offerings can pose multiple risks. 
This includes the risk of inadequate or 
non-timely adaptation in processes and 
in responses by ABCL to such changes or 
regulatory requirements.
Additionally, changes in regulatory 
requirements and disclosures on ESG 
present ESG-related risks that the 
Company would need to address in a 
timely and appropriate manner.
ABCL and its subsidiaries have and 
continue to promote ethical business 
conduct,and adopt corporate governance 
best practices. By following a values-
based approach, we have built an ethical 
and transparent organization.
To this end, ABCL and its subsidiaries 
have developed robust frameworks and 
policies, including:
1.	 Comprehensive corporate governance 
framework
2.	 Governance philosophy
3.	 Whistle-blower policy
4.	 Expansive Code of Conduct, covering 
issues including anti-corruption and 
prevention of insider trading
At ABCL, the Board takes keen interest in 
managing ESG-related risks, opportunities 
and ensuring robust governance of the 
same across all its subsidiaries.
We also provide trainings to key employee 
groups on these topics at regular intervals.
Negative:
Issues or limitations in 
oversight and monitoring of 
ABCL’s governance practices 
and record on compliance or 
regulatory requirements can 
have a negative impact on the 
Company’s:
1.	 ESG ratings
2.	 Reputation in the market
3.	 Potential to attract 
investment from 
responsible or ESG-aware 
investors
Climate 
Strategy
Opportunity ABCL and its subsidiaries consistently take 
efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and 
adapt to the emerging impacts and risks 
stemming from climate change.
We see our efforts in the areas of 
GHG emission management, energy 
management, water management, and 
waste management as an opportunity 
to create a positive impact on the 
environment.
Additionally, we see this as an opportunity 
to engage and communicate with various 
stakeholders on ESG, and maintain the 
Company’s reputation as an ESG-aware 
and socially conscious organization.
The Company and its subsidiaries see 
its efforts to address the impact of 
climate change as an enabler for creating 
long-term value for its stakeholders, and 
lasting, positive impact on our natural 
environment.
To this end, ABCL and its subsidiaries 
are ensuring efficient and safe waste 
management and disposal, in partnership 
with authorized vendors, and has initiated 
the practice of waste composting at its 
Mumbai offices. We have moved from the 
use of incandescent lights to energy-
efficient LED lights in our offices, and are 
installing solar panels at select offices to 
become more energy efficient.
We have also installed water-saving 
devices across our offices’ common areas, 
resulting in a significant reduction in water 
wastage.
Positive:
The Company’s consistent 
focus on adapting to climate 
change and its impact can 
have a positive impact 
on the Company’s and its 
subsidiaries’:
1.	 ESG ratings
2.	 Reputation in the market
3.	 Potential to attract 
additional investment 
from responsible or ESG-
aware investors

Employee 
well-being
Opportunity ABCL is dedicated to ensuring the holistic 
well-being of all its employees. It views 
this as an opportunity to further promote a 
culture of innovation and people-centricity.
We consider employees as the most 
valued asset of the Company, and thus 
view ensuring their wellbeing as a priority.
ABCL has actively taken steps to ensure 
the holistic well-being of its workforce. 
This includes promoting active health 
management through the ABCL ‘Multiply’ 
health app, and offering employees 
a discount on the Company’s health 
insurance products (select products).
Through such initiatives, we view this as 
an opportunity to enable our employees to 
actively manage their health, and be their 
best selves.
Positive:
Promoting a culture of holistic 
well-being can help ABCL 
strengthen:
1.	 Efforts to aid employees’ 
personal development
2.	 Attract and retain top talent
3.	 Maintain its reputation as 
a top employer offering 
engaging opportunities and 
a healthy work-life balance
Diversity, 
Equality, and 
Inclusion
Opportunity ABCL has and continues to advocate for 
equality, diversity and inclusion across the 
organization. Diversity and providing equal 
opportunity remains a key priority for the 
Company. It also presents the Company 
with the opportunity to draw from the 
insights and experience of a diverse pool 
of professionals, and leverage these 
insights to meet both, organizational as 
well as employees’ development goals.
We value the varying and rich experiences 
and insights that our diverse workforces 
brings in.
ABCL sees diversity and providing 
equal opportunity as a strength and 
key component of the Company’s core 
philosophy.
We are committed to further improving 
women’s representation in the workforce, 
across levels.
Positive:
ABCL views achieving 
workforce diversity as an 
enabler for meeting long-
term business goals and 
ensuring sustainable growth 
for the organization and its 
employees alike.
Additionally, we see workforce 
diversity as a value-add in 
our efforts to attract and 
retain top talent and maintain 
our reputation as a leading 
financial service provider in 
India.
Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity ABCL and its subsidiaries see the growing 
importance of enabling access and usage 
of financial services by underserved 
segments as an opportunity to contribute 
to India’s growth story.
Given ABCL’s and its subsidiaries’ 
expansive offerings in the affordable 
category across micro-insurance, lending 
and investment, we see financial inclusion 
as an opportunity in two ways:
1.	 An opportunity to contribute to the 
larger national mission to ensure 
financial inclusion of segments 
including rural-based populations, 
women, MSMEs and youth
2.	 Create economic value for the 
Company by expanding and 
diversifying its customer base, product 
reach, and revenue streams
Within financial inclusion and related 
business activities, to mitigate risks 
associated with themes such as lack of 
information, customer protection, and 
inconsistencies in selling practices, we 
have taken the following steps:
1.	 Clearly identifying priority target 
segments and understanding their 
financial needs
2.	 Creating value-add products based on 
a needs assessment and principles of 
responsible pricing
3.	 Following the highest standard 
of ethics and responsible selling 
by training its staff on ethical and 
responsible selling and marketing
4.	 Ensuring fact-checking of any 
information published on its product 
offerings
To this end, the Company is in the process 
of adopting targets on expanding its 
offerings in affordable lending, micro-
insurance, investor education, and financial 
literacy.
Positive:
Further enhancing the 
company’s focus on financial 
inclusion will contribute 
positively to ABCL’s 
reputation as an inclusive 
financial services provider, 
and as a contributor to India’s 
national mission and goals on 
enhancing financial inclusion.

Digitalization
Opportunity Rapid and ongoing digitalization of 
operational processes including customer 
experience and service can give ABCL and 
its subsidiaries an opportunity to:
1.	 Leverage technology and integrate 
data systems across ABCL to enable 
seamless expansion of customer base
2.	 Optimize and enhance the efficiency, 
and quality of service delivery for last-
mile solutions
3.	 Transition to a paper-less processing 
cycle in its operations
ABCL and its subsidiaries have 
implemented robust monitoring and 
verification systems to mitigate any 
risks associated with the transition to 
digitalization, across its subsidiaries.
This includes DigiLocker-based KYC, 
eSign, and using analytics-based models 
to make data-driven decisions for lending, 
investment and insurance.
Altogether, such processes have helped us 
monitor and mitigate any emerging risks, 
enable contactless customer acquisition, 
reduce TAT, and reduce dependence on 
paper-based documentation.
Through digitalization, ABCL sees the 
opportunity to offer a seamless experience 
to its customers, offer improved efficiency 
in its operational outcomes, and ensure a 
transition from paper to digital to promote 
environmental sustainability
Negative:
Potential issues arising 
in managing process 
digitalization can create 
a negative impact on the 
levels of customer trust, 
satisfaction, and thus ABCL’s 
reputation.
This has the potential to 
impact the Company’s 
existing customer base, and 
its efforts to expand the base.
Customer 
Satisfaction 
and 
Relationship 
Management
Opportunity Given ABCL and its subsidiaries’  diverse 
customer segments, a negative impact 
on the level of customer satisfaction, 
customer experience, and customer 
service overall can directly affect the 
Company’s:
1.	 Brand, and reputation in the market
2.	 Customer acquisition and any 
expansion plans
3.	 Existing customer base
This could include a negative effect on 
customer satisfaction caused by issues in 
or complaints on:
1.	 Following responsible and ethical 
practices in selling
2.	 Cross-selling
3.	 Data privacy management
4.	 Marketing and information disclosure 
on its products, and
5.	 Channel management
To address risks such as grievances from 
customers, ABCL and its subsidiaries have 
robust systems and resolution channels 
in place. This includes grievance redressal 
systems available in-person and through 
online channels, and an escalation matrix 
for unresolved grievances.
ABCL also consistently trains its staff 
on ethical and responsible behavior, 
especially in the marketing and selling 
practices followed by representatives. 
This is in line with the core values that 
the Company and the Aditya Birla Group 
(ABG) espouse. We ensure that all our 
representatives follow ethical marketing 
and selling practices.
We are dedicated to espousing 
customer-centricity in all our practices 
and processes, and ensuring a positive 
experience for our customers.
Negative:
Negative levels of customer 
satisfaction or any roadblocks 
to ensuring a positive 
experience for customers can 
directly affect our customer 
base, and its reputation in the 
market.

Reputation 
Management
Opportunity Given the Company’s focus on customer 
centricity, it views effective reputation 
management as an opportunity to 
maintain its position as a leading provider 
of financial services in India.
ABCL and its subsidiaries are consistently 
taking steps to maintain our brand and 
reputation as a responsible, ethical and 
people-first Company.
We see this as an opportunity for us 
to build on our existing pan-India 
network and establish our position as a 
leading ESG-aware financial institution. 
Additionally, the growing importance 
of ESG in India and the Indian financial 
services industry presents the Company 
and its subsidiairies with an opportunity 
to create and expand its ESG-aligned 
product offerings and initiatives.
ABCL is continuing to engage with 
its stakeholders on sustainability and 
is actively take steps to maintain its 
reputation as a progressive and ESG-
aware organization.
To mitigate associated risks, such 
as greenwashing or misstating or 
overstating the Company’s performance 
on ESG parameters, ABCL and its 
subsidiaries have ensured that all of our 
communications on sustainability are 
verified, and in alignment with actual 
progress made in all areas.
Our priority is to ensure that we guide and 
lead our stakeholders with complete and 
substantiated information and updates 
on our progress. The Company is keen to 
maintain its reputation as a leading ESG-
aware organization.
Positive:
By allocating dedicated 
resources to prioritize 
reputation management and 
realize its strategy, ABCL and 
its subsidiaries can further 
strengthen their  reputation 
as a responsible financial 
services provider. This can 
continue to add value to the 
company’s growth.
Community 
development
Opportunity Enabling stronger communities forms the 
foundation of the Company’s approach to 
community development.
ABCL and its subsidiaries contribute to 
the upliftment of communities through 
CSR activities, carried out under the aegis 
of ‘The Aditya Birla Centre for Community 
Initiatives and Rural Development’.
We view community development as an 
opportunity to engage with and empower 
communities across India. This includes 
engagements on education, healthcare, 
sustainable livelihoods, financial inclusion, 
and women’s empowerment.
Additionally, we view community 
development as an opportunity to promote 
equity and socio-economic development, 
at scale, in the country.
To address and mitigate potential 
associated risks or grievances that may 
arise in engaging with stakeholders as 
part of its CSR activities, ABCL and its 
subsidiaries have a grievance resolution 
mechanism.
We engage with our implementation 
partners (NGO) at regular intervals to 
address and understand grievances, if any, 
from beneficiaries of our CSR projects.
Negative:
Gaps in the management 
of community development 
programs and stakeholder 
engagement practices 
can negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation. 
Mitigating such gaps, if and 
as they may arise, is key 
to ensure long-term value 
creation.

multiple groups as key stakeholders 
and partners, including but not limited 
to employees, customers, vendors, 
and partners such as NGO partners for 
implementing CSR projects. In interactions

For each stakeholder group, we follow 
due process and have a protocol for 
interactions at each stage, including 
grievance redressal mechanisms.
To address and mitigate potential 
associated risks or grievances that may 
arise in engaging with stakeholders, ABCL 
and its subsidiaries have comprehensive 
systems in place.
For example, we have a Business 
Continuity Plan, which includes due 
process for managing disruptions in 
services provided to customers – a 
key stakeholder group. We also have a 
grievance redressal system for registering 
and managing customer complaints, 
which provides resolution within a 
reasonable Turnaround time (TAT) and to 
the satisfaction of customers.
ABCL also engages with NGO partners 
at regular intervals to address and

beneficiaries of its CSR projects – another 
key stakeholder group.

goal, and targets along with reasons in case the same are not

ABCL and its subsidiaries have made consistent progress on our

stakeholders. This is demonstrated through our initiatives, as follows:

At our Pune, Bengaluru, and Noida branches, we have installed solar  
panels of 20kW, 12kW and 41kW capacity respectively, to reduce 
our dependence on fossil fuels and emissions generated

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, and 
achievements
As one of India’s leading financial service providers, the Company has and 
continues to prioritize Sustainability as a core value, key to the Company’s 
long-term growth. The Company sees the integration of sustainability, 
ESG, and its elements as an opportunity to create long-term value for all 
its key stakeholders. We are guided in this journey by the values of the 
Aditya Birla Group (ABG), the ABG ‘Sustain-ability Journey 2.0’ framework, 
and to this end, attempt to leverage our OneABC initiative as well.
Our focus is on integrating and mainstreaming ESG and sustainability 
in core processes, practices, policies, and decision-making processes 
followed at the Company. To this end, we are actively taking steps to 
reduce our carbon footprint, accelerating financial inclusion and inclusive 
growth, and contributing to the holistic well-being of our key stakeholders, 
including our employees and local communities.
In the past year, the Company has achieved significant progress in 
integrating ESG across its operations and businesses, and related 
disclosures. For example, the Company has partnered with a vendor, 
ViaGreen, for its in-house waste management initiatives. Through such 
partnerships, as of FY23, we have achieved significant milestones. This 
includes the recycling of dry waste to the tune of 53903 kgs, creating the 
potential to offset or avoid GHG emissions equivalent to 177.05 MtCO2e. 
Additionally, in our quest to harness the power of renewable energy, in 
our Pune branch, we have installed solar panels. In a period of 5 months, 
we have achieved a saving of INR 1.31 Lakh in electricity costs, alongside 
a potential reduction in our carbon footprint. Through our partnership 
with ViaGreen for waste collection and recycling, we have also earned 
redeemable Swachh Bharat Points (SBPs). In FY 2023-23, ABCL and 
its subsidiaries earned 229071 SBP, which was used for providing our 
employees with recycled office stationery.
Through collective efforts, we have created an enabling ecosystem to 
ensure the safety, well-being, and equitable representation of our key 
stakeholder groups, including employees. With this in mind, ABCL sees 
diversity and promoting inclusion in the workforce as a key focus area. 
To this end, as of FY 23, we have reached a milestone of more equitable 
women’s representation across our companies. For example, at ABSLAMC, 
women’s representation stands at 27% of the total number of permanent 
employees, and at 33% at the Key Management Personnel level. (C-suite 
executives, Directors, etc.)
Across all our companies, women’s representation stands at 29% of the 
total workforce.
Altogether, through such initiatives, we aim to contribute to India’s growth 
story, and help create a brighter and greener future – for the planet and its 
people. The Company remains steadfast in its commitment towards ESG 
and robust governance, and in turn maintaining its reputation as a leading 
practitioner of responsible finance in India.

ABCL is committed to ensuring that it provides a safe and healthy workplace, enabling its employees to deliver their best, 
empower them, and foster creativity and productivity.
	
We have prioritized respecting and protecting the rights of our employees and following health and safety practices in line 
with regulatory standards, as applicable. We are dedicated to understanding the health and safety-related concerns of our 
employees and key stakeholders and do everything in our power to address these concerns.
	
We have consistently focused on protecting the rights of our employees, and regularly train and communicate with employees 
at all levels about human rights. To this end, we strictly prohibit all forms of forced labour, discrimination, and harassment, 
and do not interfere with employees’ collective bargaining power or ability to join an employee union.

our success and growth. We encourage our employees to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and to support their journey, we have 
taken initiatives such as providing access to de-stressing fitness sessions, medical consultations, and a discount on select 
products offered by Aditya Birla Health Insurance Co. Limited (ABHI), an associate of the Company. Across all our companies, 
we have taken multiple initiatives to ensure holistic physical and mental well-being of our employees. For example, for our 
employees at ABHI, we ran the #HealthfromHome campaign, where we brought together yoga, nutrition and health experts 
in a Facebook live series campaign to offer live consultations and guided workouts. This allowed our employees to be able 
to access such wellness-oriented content remotely, from the comfort of their homes.

Outcome of the initiative
2
ABCL is the first one within the 
ABG Group to adopt the recycling 
of hygiene pads through the only 
menstrual hygiene management 
company that recycles pads through 
their patented innovation called 
‘PadCareX’ in our major Mumbai 
offices.
In the past, the Company would dispose its 
sanitary waste through a waste management 
company that would incinerate the collected pads, 
releasing asphyxiants and toxic dioxins via smoke 
in the atmosphere. In order to switch to a more 
sustainable solution, the Company has tied up 
with Padcare Labs that helps with the recycling of 
sanitary hygiene pads, preventing landfill pollution 
and incineration that causes air pollution.
At our 4 major sites of Mumbai alone, we trash 
over 500 pads every month. Each pad would take 
800 years to decompose and would lead to a big 
climate disaster. 
We have made a huge impact by recycling around 
21472 pads and saving 10738 liters of landfill 
waste and 113807 kg of carbon credits.

Harnessing Solar energy
In the Pune branch, we have installed 20kW Solar.
Our Noida branch received a 48 KW Solar.
	
−
In the Pune branch, we have installed 20kW 
Solar with capex of ₹9.85 Lakh, and in a 
period of 5 months, we saved `1.31 Lakh in 
electricity cost, granting us an ROI of 26%.
	
−
Our Noida branch received a 40 KW Solar with 
capex of `17.50 Lakh, and, in two months, we 
saw a saving of `1.03 Lakh in electricity costs.
	
−
We plan to have more of Solar Panels installed 
at larger office areas which have the possibility 
of using the renewable resources and 
conserving even more energy.
4
Composting food waste
At our Mumbai offices, the WET waste especially 
the food waste from the cafeteria has been 
composted by the property team and has been 
composted by the Organic Waste Compost 
Machine (OWC).
The manure generated from the Organic Waste 
Machine is used for the plantations and horticulture 
of the property. Thus, the wet waste is totally 
recycled and used in the form of compost.
5
Auto Power Generated and 
Conserved System (APGC) has 
been installed in urinals replacing 
old battery-powered sensors.
APGC is an innovative solution where the power 
required to operate an automatic urinal flushing 
system is auto generated by the flushing system 
itself.
	
−
It helps save water and power into urinals for 
touch-free and hygienic flushing. 
	
−
This saves heavy battery consumption as well 
as external electric power consumption. 
	
−
APGC conserves power through advanced 
micro-chip technology that enables the 
system to function 24x7 with continuous and 
steady power supply.
6
Introduced centralized bins across 
our branches
Differently labelled bins have been placed in our 
offices, to segregate waste generated by category 
(dry waste, wet waste)
	
−
Increases company recycling levels and 
removes the option of dropping otherwise 
recyclable items into desk bins
	
−
Saving the man hours to collect the waste 
from individual desk and utilizing them to 
other cleaning activities

Stops scraps of food / wet waste ending up 
under desks when they are thrown towards 
individual bins. Further reduction in pest
