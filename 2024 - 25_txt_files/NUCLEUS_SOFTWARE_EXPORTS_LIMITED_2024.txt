Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
	
We prioritize business continuity risk to ensure our clients experience consistent and reliable service, even in 
challenging circumstances. We are advancing our strategy and approach in an effective Business Continuity Plan 
(BCP) to ensure the maintenance or recovery of operations, including service delivery to our customer, when 
confronted with adverse events such as a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a Fire, 
major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event which could cause 
delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. A significant portion 
of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in Noida, India 
(our corporate headquarters) which is adjacent to the national capital of India, Delhi. Here it may be worthwhile to 
mention that, according to a seismic zoning map issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards and quoted in the National 
Disaster Management (NDM) report, Delhi belongs to Zone IV, a severe intensity seismic zone. Any catastrophic 
event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems 
could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations.
	
To counter this risk, we have setup an Online disaster recovery site to replicate our IPR (Source code) in different 
seismic zone and backup copy on tape. In addition to this we are also having Disaster Recovery setup for few 
customers in different seismic zone who has agreement with Nucleus for business continuity and uninterrupted 
support though this facility is not in place for all the customers. The Company is continuously investing in security of 
its operations & processes and evaluating the risks on periodic basis. We are an ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (ISMS) certified 
along with SOC2 Type II report organization, which reflects our focus and commitment to increase adherence to 
secure practices. More so for business continuity, the growth of any product business is directly linked to the install 
base and the feedback of existing customers. These two factors are key for the purchase decisions of prospective 
customers.
	
Hence a large negative impact on Company’s reputation can be a big setback. The Company enjoys is well recognized 
to offer great business values to our customers enabled by our business platforms. 
164  Nucleus Software Exports Limited | Annual Report 2024-25
 
On the security front, we have adopted a Defense-in-Depth model to ensure multilayered protection across our 
infrastructure—spanning physical, network, endpoint, application, and data security layers. This strategic approach 
ensures that if one layer is compromised, multiple other controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access or data 
loss. 
	
Physical security is enforced through strict procedures governing access to data centers and sensitive operational 
areas. Entry is restricted using biometric authentication and proximity card access systems, ensuring that only vetted 
and authorized personnel can access critical environments.
	
At the infrastructure level, the company has invested significantly in state-of-the-art, high-availability network 
architecture, including redundant high-speed links to overseas locations. This infrastructure not only supports 
uninterrupted operations but also provides built-in resilience against network disruptions and cyber threats.
	
In line with the principles of Security by Design and by Default, internet access is tightly governed through advanced 
web filtering technologies, both on-premises and across remote endpoints. These controls are configured to block 
non-business use, reduce threat surface exposure, and enforce browsing policies aligned with corporate governance.
	
To protect the organization’s intellectual property and sensitive information, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls 
are implemented at key egress points, including the email gateway and on end-user devices such as laptops. These 
solutions monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized transmission of confidential data in real time.
	
Security governance is a core pillar of our cybersecurity program. We follow a Security by Governance approach, 
embedding risk-based policies, compliance requirements, and oversight mechanisms across all operational layers. 
Regular audits, role-based access controls, continuous monitoring, and incident response readiness ensure that our 
security framework remains resilient, compliant, and aligned with industry best practices.
