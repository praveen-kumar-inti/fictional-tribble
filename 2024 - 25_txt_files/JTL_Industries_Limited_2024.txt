profitability
R
The steel industry, like most capital-
intensive 
commodity 
industries, 
is cyclical in nature. The operating 
margins are affected by the sales 
realisation of steel products and 
fluctuations in demand and supply 
of steel products.
The Company carries out

10. Supply Chain
R
Supply chain disruptions, such 
as natural disasters, geopolitical 
conflicts, 
or 
supplier 
failures, 
can lead to inventory shortages, 
production delays, and revenue loss. 
Lack of visibility and resilience in the 
supply chain can expose company 
to increased costs, reputational 
damage, and loss of market share.
By Conducting regular risk 
assessments, developing 
contingency plans

mitigate the risk. Further, 
fostering strong supplier 
relationships is also key 
to minimise the supply 
chain disruption risk. These

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board?
	
Ans: JTL Industries Limited reaffirms its unwavering commitment to ethical governance through robust mechanisms 
for managing conflicts of interest at the Board level. From the outset, directors are required to disclose their interests 
transparently—a practice consistently upheld throughout the financial year. This proactive disclosure fosters accountability 
and reinforces transparency, both of which are foundational to effective corporate governance.
	
To further mitigate potential conflicts, especially those arising from external engagements of directors, the Company 
has implemented a comprehensive policy for identifying and reviewing Material Related Party Transactions. These 
transactions are meticulously scrutinised under the oversight of the Audit Committee to ensure full compliance with 
applicable laws, internal policies, and industry best practices.
	
In line with statutory obligations, Independent Directors formally declare their independence pursuant to Section 149(7) 
of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 16(1)(b) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015. These declarations are substantiated through annual performance evaluations, reaffirming their ability 
to act impartially and independently in the best interest of stakeholders.
	
By upholding these stringent standards, JTL Industries Limited exemplifies a culture of integrity, accountability, and 
responsible governance—further enhancing stakeholder trust and corporate credibility.

Permanent 
and Other 
than 
Permanent 
Workers
As part of our inclusive and transparent workplace practices, our grievance redressal mechanism is designed 
to address the concerns of both permanent and non-permanent (contractual) workers effectively.
Permanent Workers
For permanent workers, the grievance mechanism allows individuals to raise concerns through their 
respective supervisors. These grievances are formally communicated to the Company for appropriate action. 
Each grievance is reviewed with due diligence, and the Company provides timely feedback to the concerned 
workers regarding the status and resolution of their issues, ensuring transparency and trust in the process.
Contractual Workers
The Company has implemented a dedicated grievance redressal framework for workers employed through 
contractors. Under this system, contractors are empowered to raise grievances on behalf of their workers, 
ensuring that their voices are heard and acted upon. This mechanism ensures that the concerns of all 
workers, regardless of their employment status, are addressed promptly and fairly.

spillage, zinc dust exposure, hot metal spillage, earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and tsunamis. Its primary objective is 
to ensure the safety of life, protect the environment, and safeguard critical installations and production facilities. The 
plan is widely communicated across the organisation, with regular training, rehearsals, and mock drills conducted by 
both internal and external agencies to maintain a high level of preparedness. By equipping our personnel with the skills 
and knowledge to respond swiftly and effectively to emergencies, we aim to minimise human and material losses while
