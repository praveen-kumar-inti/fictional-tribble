Workplace 
Health & 
Safety
Risk 
As 
a 
Company 
in 
industrial 
machinery 
manufacturing 
sector 
inherently involves exposure to heavy 
machinery, electrical hazards, and 
moving equipment, which present 
significant health and safety risks. 
Failure to mitigate these risks can 
result in workplace incidents, legal 
liabilities, and operational disruptions, 
directly impacting financial stability 
and company reputation. To address 
this, a robust safety management 
system, including incident reporting, 
risk 
assessment, 
and 
safety 
training, must be implemented and 
maintained. 
Prioritizing 
workforce 
health and safety not only aligns with 
international regulatory standards but 
also enhances employee well-being, 
reduces healthcare costs, and fosters 
productivity, contributing to long-term 
organizational resilience.
At Technocraft Industries (India) Ltd., 
ensuring a safe work environment 
is a top priority, given the nature 
of its operations. The company 
operates in a setting where workers 
regularly 
interact 
with 
complex 
equipment and machinery, making 
proactive safety measures essential. 
To create a culture of safety, the 
company has introduced structured 
systems for monitoring risks, training 
employees, and responding quickly 
to any incidents. These efforts not 
only protect the workforce but also 
help avoid operational delays and 
legal issues. By investing in health 
and safety, Technocraft supports 
employee 
morale, 
meets 
global 
standards, and strengthens its long-
term business performance.

Materials 
Sourcing 
Risk
For Technocraft Industries (India) 
Ltd., material sourcing presents a 
significant risk due to dependency 
on critical raw materials with limited 
global 
sources. 
The 
industrial 
machinery sector heavily relies on 
specific materials that often lack 
substitutes and are sourced from 
geopolitically sensitive regions. This 
dependency exposes the company 
to supply chain disruptions, price 
volatility, and competitive pressures 
driven by increasing global demand.
The Company is committed to 
reducing its reliance on critical 
raw materials by actively exploring 
alternative inputs and diversifying 
its supplier base. By creating a 
more resilient and adaptive supply 
chain, it seeks to minimise the risk of 
disruptions and manage exposure to 
price volatility.

Remanufac­
turing design 
and services 
Opportu­
nity
The adoption of remanufacturing 
design 
and 
services 
presents 
a 
substantial 
opportunity 
for 
sustainable growth and resource 
efficiency. Remanufacturing allows 
for the reuse of industrial machinery 
components, significantly reducing 
the need for raw materials like steel, 
iron, aluminum, and plastics. This 
approach contributes to material 
efficiency 
and 
cost 
reduction, 
thereby mitigating materiality risks 
associated with raw material scarcity 
and volatile prices. Furthermore, 
remanufactured 
products 
open 
new sales channels and extend 
product lifecycles, supporting circular 
economy principles. By integrating 
remanufacturing in its operations, 
the 
Company 
can 
enhance 
its 
environmental 
performance 
while 
driving 
economic 
benefits 
and 
aligning with global sustainability 
practices.

Specific commitments, goals 
and targets set by the entity with 
defined timelines, if any.
As a responsible corporate entity and global citizen, the Company 
acknowledges the critical importance of embracing innovative and 
forward-looking approaches to drive sustainable progress. We 
understand that sustainability is not only essential to the long-term 
resilience and growth of our business, but also integral to the well-being 
of our planet.
Recognizing the influence and scale of our operations, we are committed 
to leveraging our position to foster positive environmental and social 
impact. Our approach is anchored in a clear vision to set ambitious, 
measurable targets and consistently deliver on them as part of our 
continued journey toward excellence in Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) performance.
Through this commitment, we aim to create lasting value for our 
stakeholders while contributing meaningfully to a more sustainable and 
equitable future.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements
The evolving transition toward more sustainable lifestyles is significantly influencing consumer behavior and 
reshaping industry dynamics—including our own. In today’s competitive landscape, the inclusion of innovative 
products calls for continuous improvement in quality, alongside a strong emphasis on reducing carbon footprints. 
While financial performance remains important, non-financial dimensions such as environmental responsibility 
and social impact have become equally vital in achieving holistic and sustainable business growth.
This shift highlights the growing need to formally integrate and adhere to Environment, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) best practices, ensuring that sustainability is embedded across all facets of business strategy.
Looking ahead, the Company is committed to strengthening its sustainability agenda by actively working 
to reduce emissions, enhance resource efficiency, optimize operational processes, and prioritize energy 
conservation. In parallel, a comprehensive digital transformation will be adopted to augment existing practices 
and drive long-term value creation through innovation and responsibility.

Yes, Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) strategies have been effectively 
implemented across various divisions including Drum, Textile, and Pipe. 
This initiative underscores the company’s commitment to sustainable 
practices and environmental stewardship.
Moreover, the company has strategically deployed a range of cutting-edge 
treatment technologies including RO-1, RO-2, RO-3, Nano, STP, ETP, and 
MEE Plant. These installations represent a comprehensive approach to 
wastewater management, reflecting the organization’s proactive stance 
towards resource conservation and pollution mitigation.
In particular, our provision of a comprehensive Effluent Treatment Plant 
(ETP) for the treatment of industrial effluents encompasses primary, 
secondary, and tertiary treatment processes, augmented by ultra-filtration 
and a sophisticated 4-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The utilization 
of Reverse Osmosis permeate for utility purposes marks a pivotal 
achievement in realizing ZLD objectives within the industry. Notably, RO 
39
 
rejects undergo further treatment through Advanced Thermal Fluidized Bed Dryer (ATFD) and Mechanical Vapor 
Recompression (MVR) Evaporator (MEE) plants, ensuring minimal waste and maximizing resource recovery.
Additionally, our implementation of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) for domestic effluent treatment demonstrates 
a holistic approach to water management. The treated water from these plants finds purposeful reuse in land 
irrigation, contributing to sustainable landscaping practices and reducing reliance on freshwater resources.
In summary, the integration of advanced treatment technologies and holistic wastewater management strategies 
exemplify the company’s proactive efforts towards achieving environmental sustainability and regulatory compliance 
across its operations.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide 
details.
●	
Modification of the 8 T boiler furnace: By resizing the burner and combustion 
chamber to match the actual steam load (4,500 kg/h), coal use dropped by 
570 kg/day and auxiliary power by 40 kWh/day—cutting year-round CO2 
emissions in proportion to those fuel and electricity savings.
●	
Air-compressor flow control retrofit: Installing a 24 VDC solenoid valve 
to isolate the photo-cell cleaning line when idle eliminated continuous 
free-air purge, saving 3,162 kWh/month of compressed-air energy and 
correspondingly reducing CO2 emissions from power generation.
●	
VFD on the 4 T boiler induced-draft fan: Replacing uncontrolled full-speed 
fan operation with a variable-frequency drive reduced fan power draw 
from 575 kWh/day to 380 kWh/day, cutting annual electricity-related CO2 
emissions by over 60,000 kWh’s worth.
●	
VFD installation in the humidification plant: Fitting variable-frequency drives on humidifier blowers delivered 
5,11,000 kWh of annual power savings, avoiding roughly 419 tons of CO2 emissions.
●	
Automatic flush-valve in the comber machine: Automating the comber’s suction-pressure valve prevented 
unnecessary purge air, saving 73,000 kWh per year and cutting about 60 tons of CO2.

Sr. 
No.
Initiative 
undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, 
if any, may be provided along-with 
summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Boiler furnace 
modification (8 T)
Modified the furnace of the 8 T steam 
boiler to match actual maximum steam 
demand (4,500 kg/h) by resizing burner 
and chamber geometry.
As a result of the modification, coal 
consumption decreased by 1,77,840 kg 
annually and power usage fell by 12,480 
kWh per year. 
2
Air-compressor 
flow control
Installed a 24 VDC solenoid valve to 
isolate air supply to the photo-cell cleaning 
line when equipment is offline, replacing 
the previous continuous purge.
Following installation, air wastage dropped 
by approximately 15,811 cfm each month, 
equivalent to 3,162 kWh of compressed-
air energy per month (37,944 kWh per 
year).
3
VFD on 4 T boiler 
ID-fan
Fitted a variable-frequency drive to the 
induced-draft fan of the 4 T boiler, enabling 
the fan to modulate speed to actual flue-
gas flow instead of running at full speed 
continuously.
After commissioning the VFD, daily power 
consumption of the ID fan dropped from 
575 kWh to 380 kWh. Over a year, this 
reduction of 195 kWh per day amounts 
to 60,840 kWh saved, corresponding to 
annual cost savings of ₹5,31,741 at the 
prevailing rate of ₹8.74/kWh.
4
Magnetic seam-
locator on 
inspection station
Fitted a magnetic-seam detector at 
the fabric-inspection station to guide 
operators directly to the sample-cut 
location, preventing random cuts that 
previously created multiple holes.
The seam-locator has cut inspection 
setup time by roughly 40 %, saving each 
operator an average of five minutes 
per sample, and has reduced material 
wastage by eliminating unnecessary 
cuts. This has improved throughput and 
lowered scrap rates by 8 %.
5
Controlled moisture 
addition post-
compaction
Relocated the WEKO moisture-addition 
unit to the delivery end of the compactor, 
enabling a controlled 5–10 % moisture 
pickup in the fabric instead of the previous 
zero-moisture condition.
After repositioning the moisture-addition 
unit, fabric weight remained within ±0.5 
% of target, reducing off-grade rejects 
by 15 % and cutting scrap generation 
accordingly, 
thereby 
conserving 
raw 
materials, minimizing energy and water 
use for reprocessing, and reducing 
landfill-bound textile waste.
6
VFD installation in 
humidification plant
Installed a Variable Frequency Drive 
on the humidification plant’s blower to 
optimise motor speed according to actual 
humidity requirements.
The VFD installation delivered annual 
energy savings of 5,11,000 kWh, cost 
savings of ₹30.66 lakhs, and avoided 
approximately 
419.02 
tons 
of 
CO2 
emissions, strengthening the Company's 
greenhouse-gas reduction efforts.

7
Automatic flush-
valve in comber 
machine
Fitted an automatic timed-flush valve 
on the comber machine suction line to 
control cleaning cycles, replacing manual 
flush procedures.
This 
measure 
saved 
73,000 
kWh 
annually and prevented 59.86 tons of 
CO2 emissions, while improving machine 
uptime and suction consistency.
8
Roving stop-motion 
provision in ring-
frame machines
Installed roving stop-motion sensors on 
ring-frame machines to automatically 
halt production on sliver break, reducing 
waste and ring repairs.
Waste yarn was reduced by 54,750 kWh 
worth of energy per year, and 44.895 tons 
of CO2 emissions were avoided, delivering 
both quality and environmental benefits.
9
UKG reduction 
from 3.2 to 3.0
Optimised ring-frame settings and drafting 
parameters to lower yarn Uster Class 
(UKG) from 3.2 to 3.0.
The reduction yielded annual energy 
savings of 2,35,420 kWh and avoided 193 
tons of CO2 emissions, while enhancing 
yarn uniformity and reducing downstream 
downtime.
10
150 kW solar 
rooftop installation
Commissioned 
a 
150 
kW 
grid-tied 
solar photovoltaic rooftop system at the 
Amravati facility.
The solar installation generates 2,03,081 
kWh per year while avoiding 166 tons of 
CO2 emissions.
