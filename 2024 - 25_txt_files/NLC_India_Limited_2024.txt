atmosphere where employees feel comfortable voicing their concerns to their business heads, the HR 
department, or members of the senior management. The Company adheres to an open-door policy, ensuring 
that employees at all levels have the opportunity to engage with the senior management team. Furthermore,

Additionally, NLCIL has established a thorough policy for the prevention, prohibition, and resolution 
of sexual harassment against women in the workplace, adhering to the Sexual Harassment of Women at

training sessions, and awareness campaigns to educate employees about preventing sexual harassment at 
work, ensuring consistent and proactive involvement in addressing this crucial issue.
The steps for the grievance redressal mechanism are outlined as follows:
•	 Employees are required to lodge their grievances promptly using the specified format, and this should be 
done immediately or at most within three months from the date of the incident.
•	 To ensure swift, accurate and efficient resolution of grievances, employees are classified into three distinct 
groups: (a) Workmen and Staff (b) Supervisors and Executives and (c) Executives at the level of General 
Manager and above. A dedicated Corporate Level Redressal Committee has been established for each 
category of employees.
The grievance handling process is divided into two stages:
I. 
Stage-I involves the employee presenting their grievance directly to the head of their Department/
Unit using the designated FORM-I, following the proper channels. Upon receiving the grievance, the 
Department/Unit Head will engage with the employee to address the issue and will return FORM-I with 
comments or actions to be taken, within a 15-day period from the date of receipt of grievance.
II. Stage-II allows for an appeal process. If the employee is dissatisfied with the outcome or response 
received at Stage-I, they may appeal to the respective Corporate Level Grievance Redressal Committee 
using FORM-II. Appeals must be submitted in duplicate to the Committee’s Secretary and must include 
a copy of FORM-I, which contains the Department/Unit Head’s remarks or proposed resolution.

Outcome of the initiative
1.
Green 
Hydrogen
Hydrogen that is generated using electrolysis powered by renewable 
energy sources, resulting in zero emissions, is referred to as green 
hydrogen. This production process does not release any greenhouse gases, 
contributing to the decarbonization of multiple industries.
Establishment of 4 MW Proton 
Exchange Membrane (PEM) 
electrolyzer-based green 
hydrogen demonstration facility 
in Neyveli.
2.
Activated 
carbon 
development 
using lignite – 
HA sludge
The creation of activated carbon from lignite and Humic Acid (HA) sludge 
is an important advancement in utilizing waste effectively and supporting 
environmental well-being. When humic acid is extracted, the leftover HA 
sludge is high in carbon.
The idea is to convert this carbon-dense substance into activated carbon 
using a suitable method. Activated carbon is sought after for its extensive 
porosity and large surface area, which makes it excellent for absorbing 
impurities, thus making it valuable for water and air purification.
This initiative repurposes 
HA sludge, giving waste 
byproducts a valuable new 
use and diminishing their 
environmental impact. It offers 
a cost-effective and sustainable 
method for creating activated 
carbon, improving green waste 
management practices and 
conserving resources.
3.
Development 
of ecofriendly 
geo-polymer 
ash based 
green bricks 
using solar 
heating.
The creation of environmentally friendly geo-polymer bricks made from 
ash and cured with solar energy presents a sustainable method for brick 
production. These bricks incorporate fly ash, a byproduct of thermal 
power stations, significantly decreasing their ecological footprint. By 
substituting traditional kiln firing with solar heating, the process cuts 
down on energy use and carbon output. This inventive method not only 
lessens the carbon footprint but also enhances the effective use of waste. 
These green bricks, which demand less water and raw materials, offer a 
more eco-conscious choice for building, aiding in the advancement of a 
more sustainable tomorrow.
Fly ash generated is utilized 
thereby ensuring waste 
management and environmental 
sustainability.
4.
Restoration 
of marine 
ecosystem 
in Gulf of 
Mannar.
NTPL (NLC Tamil Nadu Power Limited) has actively contributed to 
the conservation of the Gulf of Mannar through its Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) projects. Its efforts have primarily focused on water 
conservation and the revival of local ecosystems.
NTPL has undertaken various initiatives to preserve the Gulf of Mannar 
Biosphere Reserve (GoMMBR), a region of rich marine biodiversity. The 
company's projects include the desilting of lakes and the revival of other 
water bodies in the Thoothukudi district, where its power plant is located. 
By conserving freshwater sources, NTPL indirectly reduces pressure on 
the fragile marine ecosystem. 
A significant aspect of NTPL's approach is its use of seawater for its power 
plant operations. It's a 100% seawater-based unit, using a desalination 
plant to meet all its water needs, from industrial processes to the 
requirements of its residential colony. This practice conserves a substantial 
volume of freshwater that would otherwise be drawn from local resources. 
NTPL was even recognized for this effort, receiving the 'GEEF Global 
WaterTech Award' for its "Water Conservation Project of the Year.
Conservation of freshwater 
sources and preservation of Gulf

mining, and the installation of pollution control systems like dust suppression mechanisms, bag filters and water jets/sprinklers.
 
The Company conducts regular assessments to monitor the effectiveness of these green initiatives in reducing environmental 
stress. The results of these assessments are communicated to regulatory bodies through various reports such as Environmental 
Statements, Compliance reports, etc.
 
NLCIL is actively contributing to the resolution of global environmental challenges by undertaking numerous projects. A 
key focus is expanding the renewable energy capacity to significantly cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. NLCIL has 
made strides in this area by installing 1,380.06 MW of solar power capacity and 51 MW of wind power capacity, thereby 
reinforcing its commitment to renewable energy.
	
To address pollution from its thermal power projects, NLCIL has introduced environmental safeguards such as high stacks for 
the dispersion of gaseous and particulate emissions, electrostatic precipitators for dust management and the commencement 
of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) processes to limit sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions.
	
In the mining operations, NLCIL has adopted environmental protection measures like water sprinklers for dust suppression 
and the creation of lush green belts along the roads within and surrounding the mining areas.
	
NLCIL also prioritizes environmental education and has organized various programs on topics like environmental and 
pollution control, energy saving, co-generation methods, mining mitigation and environmental impact assessment.
	
Through these comprehensive measures and initiatives, NLCIL is diligently pursuing environmental sustainability and 
fostering responsible practices in all its operational activities.

Independent Assurance Practitioners’ Statement
To,
NLC India Limited (NLCIL)
No. 135, EVR Periyar High Road, Kilpauk,
Chennai - 600010, Tamil Nadu, India
JointValues ESG Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JointValues”) was appointed and engaged by the management of 
NLC India Limited (NLCIL) (hereinafter referred as “the Company”) for performing an independent assurance of the nine core 
attributes as mentioned in SEBI’s BRSR Core1 format2 for information pertaining to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
performance disclosed by the NLC India Limited (NLCIL) in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) 
for the ‘reporting period’ April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 considering related regulation3, 4, 5, 6 for listed entities issued by SEBI.
JointValues performed the engagement through a multidisciplinary team of experienced professionals and subject-matter specialists, 
on attributes pertaining to Environmental, Social, and Governance performance of the Company reported through BRSR Core, 
to obtain sufficient evidences to support the professional judgement, and provide the basis for conducting reasonable assurance 
within the defined scope and boundary of the engagement.
The Assurance team applied professional judgement, skills, and techniques with professional scepticism in a systematic engagement 
process to arrive at an independent opinion about the subject matters within the scope and boundary of the engagement.
Methodology, Scope and Boundary of Assurance
JointValues conducted this reasonable assurance of the Company in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
JointValues conducted the engagement process with adherence to ethical requirements, professional standards, and compliance 
with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in line with the International Standards on Quality Management (ISQM), 
Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagement issued by IAASB.
During the engagement, the assurance team complied with the JointValues’s Code of Conduct, that defines independence and other 
ethical requirements and aligns with the best practices and the International Code of Ethics (ICE) for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).
The scope of this engagement, as agreed upon by JointValues and the Company, was to provide Reasonable assurance on the 
non-financial sustainability disclosure covered under nine core attributes of the BRSR Core format, as provided by the Company 
to JointValues in the BRSR format. The values related to the nine core attributes of BRSR Core as provided by the Company are 
mentioned in Annexure-I to the assurance statement.
The reporting boundary of the Company’s BRSR is “consolidated basis” as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the SEBI’s 
BRSR format for the reporting period from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025.
Limitations and Exclusions
•	
Preparing the Company's BRSR information requires management to set the criteria, decide what information is relevant to 
include, and make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported information.
•	
Reducing engagement risk to zero is rarely attainable; therefore, “reasonable assurance” is less than absolute assurance.
•	
Calculating and measuring certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, such as GHG emissions, water, waste and energy 
footprint, involves assumptions/estimations and inherent measurement uncertainty. Even though we obtain sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion, it does not eliminate the uncertainty in these amounts and metrics.
•	
Evaluation, verification and assessment of any Company's financial performance and data have been out of the scope of this 
engagement, except relying on the Company's third-party audited financial reports as provided to us during the course of 
engagement, wherever materially required concerning the nine core attributes of the BRSR core. The assurance does not cover the 
Company's statements that express opinions, claims, beliefs, aspirations, expectations, aims, or future intentions. Additionally, 
assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues are beyond the scope of this assurance.
•	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data and information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
The engagement does not include a review of the Company's strategy or other related linkages expressed in the Report. These 
aspects are not within the scope of the assurance engagement.
•	
The assurance does not extend to mapping the BRSR with reporting frameworks other than those specifically mentioned. 
This engagement does not consider assessments or comparisons with frameworks beyond the specified ones.
•	
Compliance with any Environmental, Social, and legal issues related to the regulatory authority.
•	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.
•	
Activities and practices followed outside the defined assurance period stated herein above.
Procedures Followed
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we have:
•	
Interacted with relevant personnel of Company’s management responsible for Sustainability, Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) and their team through a combination of virtual and physical meeting interactions at NLCIL corporate 
head office for understanding the process of collecting, collating the subject matter as per SEBI Circular for BRSR Core.
•	
Assessed the appropriateness of various assumptions, estimations and materiality thresholds used by the Company for 
data analysis.
•	
Performed analytical procedures to analyse trends in the historical data and accordingly ascertain the reasonableness of the 
data reported in the current year.
•	
Performed substantive testing on a sample basis of the identified sustainability indicators, to verify that the data had been 
appropriately measured with the underlying documents recorded, collated and reported, including returns and internal 
monitoring reports filed to various authorities by the Company and relied upon by us. This includes assessing records and 
performing testing, including recalculation of sample data.

Other Information
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the information for the period April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 only and 
not on any other elements included in the BRSR or any report linked to BRSR and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.

JointValues is independent of the Company and has not been involved in any non-audit, non-assurance or non-assessment nature of 
engagement during the financial year 2024-25 for which JointValues has conducted independent assurance of BRSR core for the Company.
The independent assurance opinion statement has been prepared for the stakeholders of the Company only for the purpose of

the BRSR Core, as disclosed by the Company through the BRSR format, are reasonably assured for the reporting 
boundary mentioned above.

deviation comes to the attention, JointValues may bring it to the notice of NLCIL and, if considered necessary in the context of 
regulatory expectations, also communicate the same to relevant stakeholders and authority concerned.
In sections where BRSR has specific requirements to indicate if any independent assessment / evaluation / assurance has been 
carried out by any external agency and if any reference has been made to JointValues, such should be interpreted as reasonable 
assurance provided by JointValues, if such requirements, form a part of BRSR Core only on which JointValues has given its opinion.
