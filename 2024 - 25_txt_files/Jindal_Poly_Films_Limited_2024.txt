driving sustainable business practices. As a part of our commitment to responsible business operations, we have integrated 
ESG considerations into our overall strategy and operations, ensuring that we are accountable for the impact we have on the

Social responsibility is another fundamental aspect of our business. We strive to create a safe and inclusive workplace where 
diversity is celebrated, and all employees are treated with respect and fairness. We are dedicated to fostering a culture 
that promotes employee well-being, health, and safety. Our ongoing initiatives include providing training and development 
opportunities, implementing fair labor practices and ensuring effective health and safety measures across our operations.
 
In terms of Governance, we uphold ethical standards and value transparency and accountability. We have implemented 
corporate governance practices that promote integrity and responsible decision-making throughout our organization. As a 
part of our governance framework, we regularly engage with our stakeholders, to understand their expectations and address 
their concerns.
 
Looking forward to the future, we are committed to have various sustainability goals that align with international standards
