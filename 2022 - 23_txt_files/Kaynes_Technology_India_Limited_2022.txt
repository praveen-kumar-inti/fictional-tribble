Waste 
management
Risk
Inadequate waste management 
poses risks to electronics 
manufacturing companies, 
including regulatory non-
compliance, reputational 
damage, increased operational 
costs and environmental impact. 
Improper handling and disposal 
of waste materials can lead to 
pollution, legal liabilities and 
negative public health, impacting 
the Company's performance and 
sustainability.
To effectively manage 
waste and hazardous 
materials, we implement 
measures to address 
present and future risks, 
mitigating environmental 
impact through proper 
disposal and containment. 
We also adopt eco-friendly 
materials, optimise 
consumption and closely 
monitor usage for a 
sustainable approach.

Community 
wellbeing
Opportunity
Community well-being presents 
an opportunity for electronics 
manufacturing companies 
to build strong relationships, 
enhance brand reputation and 
foster long-term sustainability. 
Engaging in initiatives that 
support local communities, such 
as education, job creation and 
social welfare programmes, can 
create positive social impact and 
contribute to a thriving business 
ecosystem.
Positive
3
Business 
Ethics and 
governance
Risk
Lack of business ethics, 
integrity and proper governance 
poses risks to electronics 
manufacturing companies, 
including damage to reputation, 
legal consequences, loss of 
stakeholder trust and onancial 
losses. Engaging in unethical 
practices, such as bribery or 
fraud, can lead to legal disputes, 
regulatory penalties and erosion 
of the Company's credibility and 
long-term viability.
At Kaynes Technology, 
we place a paramount 
emphasis on business 
ethics and governance, 
recognising its crucial 
role in driving sustainable 
business performance and 
promoting transparency. 
To uphold these values, we 
have implemented several 
mechanisms and policies, 
such as the code of 
conduct, risk management 
policy, Board Diversity 
policy and Related Party 
Transactions policy. These 
policies work together to 
govern and ensure ethical 
practices throughout the 
Company, fostering a 
culture of integrity and 
responsible decision-
making.
Negative
4
Material 
sourcing 
efociency
Risk
Inefocient material sourcing 
poses risks to electronics 
manufacturing companies, 
including supply chain 
disruptions, increased costs, 
reputational damage and 
environmental impact. Reliance 
on non-sustainable or unreliable 
sources can result in material 
shortages, price nuctuations, 
ethical concerns and failure to 
meet stakeholder expectations 
for responsible sourcing, 
affecting the Company's 
operations and competitiveness.
The rationale behind 
material sourcing 
efociency and building 
an efocient supply chain 
is to ensure a smooth 
production function and 
meet customer demands 
effectively. These efforts 
have a signiocant impact 
on the overall business, as 
they lead to streamlined 
operations, reduced costs 
and enhanced customer 
satisfaction, ultimately 
contributing to the 
Company's success and 
growth.

Product design 
and Lifecycle 
management
Risk
Inadequate product design and 
lifecycle management pose risks 
to electronics manufacturing 
companies, including product 
failures, market rejection, 
legal liabilities and negative 
environmental impact. Poorly 
designed products, insufocient 
quality control and lack of 
end-of-life planning can lead 
to safety issues, customer 
dissatisfaction and non-
compliance with regulations, 
jeopardising the Company's 
reputation and onancial success.
To effectively manage use 
of hazardous materials, 
we implement measures 
to address present and 
future risks, mitigating 
environmental impact 
through gradually adopting 
eco-friendly materials, 
optimising consumption 
and closely monitoring 
usage for a sustainable 
approach.
Negative

Data 
Privacy and 
Cybersecurity
Risk
Inadequate IT security 
infrastructure and procedures 
can result in data security and 
integrity issues. However, we 
closely monitor critical aspects 
like access controls, physical 
security and logical security 
to ensure comprehensive 
protection.
As per the risk 
management roadmap, 
necessary actions are 
implemented to mitigate 
the adverse effects of 
actual or potential threats.
Negative
7
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity 
The signiocance of customer 
satisfaction lies in elevating 
our Net Promoter Score (NPS), 
which directly correlates with 
improved customer loyalty 
and advocacy. By prioritising 
customer satisfaction, we 
cultivate a loyal customer 
base who are more likely to 
recommend our products and 
services to others.
