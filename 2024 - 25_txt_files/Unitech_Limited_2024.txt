BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024-25 
SECTION 
- A: GENERAL DISCLOSURES 
Introduction: 
(a) 
54 
Unitech 
Limited 
(Unitech 
or 
the 
Company), 
was 
incorporated 
on 
09" 
February, 
1971 
under 
the 
Companies Act, 1956, and commenced its operations. 
It has been one of the leading real estate companies 
in India, with a well-diversified presence in real estate 
business comprising 
of commercial complexes and 
integrated 
residential development, Schools, Hotels, 
Malls and infrastructure projects. Unitech has projects 
across the price spectrum and several states in India. 
The 
Company 
went 
through 
challenging 
times 
sometime around 2012-13 onwards due to various 
factors which led to a situation that it was not able to 
honour the commitments made to customers for timely 
delivery of the residential and commercial units sold to 
them. Due to numerous litigations by a large number 
of homebuyers and other stakeholders, the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court directed the Union Government vide its 
Order dated 18.12.2019 to propose the appointment of 
an independent Board of Directors of Unitech Limited. 
In 
compliance 
thereto, 
the 
Central 
Government 
proposed the constitution of a new Board of Directors, 
which was approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
vide its Order dated 20.01.2020 passed in the matter 
of Bhupinder Singh Vs. Unitech Limited in Civil Appeal 
No. 
10856/2016. 
The Hon'ble Supreme 
Court was 
pleased 
to direct the supersession 
of the erstwhile 
Management of Unitech Limited with the appointment 
of 
a new Board 
of Directors constituted under the 
chairmanship of Mr. Y. S. Malik, IAS (Retd.), formerly 
Secretary to Government of India. 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court's order dated 20.01.2020 
inter alia, stated that - 
“The existing Board of Directors of Unitech Limited 
is superseded with immediate effect in order to 
facilitate the taking over of management by the 
new Board of Directors constituted in terms of the 
proposal submitted by the Union Government.” 
In compliance of the order ibid, the new Management, 
as 
directed, prepared 
and 
submitted 
a 
Resolution 
Framework 
(RF) before the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
on 16.07.2020, followed by updated versions filed on 
05.02.2021 and 08.08.2022, wherein a comprehensive 
approach for (i) completion of all incomplete projects, 
(ii) 
settlement 
of 
all 
other 
stakeholders 
has 
been 
proposed. The said RF is under consideration of the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court had requested 
Justice 
(Retd.) 
A. 
M. 
Sapre, 
vide 
its 
order 
dated 
20.04.2022, 
to 
assist the Board 
of Management 
in 
monetization of the land assets under the auspices of 
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25 
the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court. Subsequently, 
vide order dated 18.05.2022, Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre 
was 
also associated with every stage 
of tendering 
process and the same was to be carried out under his 
supervision. 
It is pertinent to note that in view of the legacy issues 
confronting 
Unitech 
Group 
of 
Companies, 
several 
of Unitech’s 
Projects 
had 
been 
lying 
stalled 
since 
even 
before June 2017 when 
the promoters were 
imprisoned. 
Based 
on the ground-work done 
by PMCs, 
it was 
estimated 
that 
about 
130-135 
Tenders 
would 
be 
required 
to be floated for completion 
of 
all the 74 
residential and 12 commercial projects. Since, 
it was 
practically not possible to float all the Tenders in one 
go, the Management decided to float these Tenders 
in four to five Lots, each Lot comprising about 30-35 
Tenders, as also submitted before the Hon'ble Supreme: 
court 
vide 
Action 
Taken 
Repot 
(ATR)-IV. 
As 
the 
Members are already aware, the Unitech Management 
after seeking the approval of the Board of Directors 
(BoD) and Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre in the month of 
December 2022, floated a total of 35 Tenders as part 
of Lot-1 
on 02.01.2023. After the completion 
of Bid 
Management process and approval of BoD and Justice 
Sapre, 
a total 
of 15 Tenders were submitted 
to the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court seeking directions for award 
of Contracts. Further, after the approval 
of BoD and 
Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre, the Management floated 
another set of 51 Tenders as part of Lot-2 on its website 
on 08.05.2023 and 09.05.2023. After the completion 
of 
Bid 
Management 
Process 
for 
Lot-2 
Tenders, 
a 
total of 34 Tenders were approved by the BoD and 
Justice 
Sapre 
on 
18.08.2023, 
and 
the same were 
submitted in the Hon'ble Supreme Court for seeking 
approval 
for awarding 
the 
Contracts 
to 
successful 
Bidders. The Hon'ble Supreme Court permitted the 
Unitech Management to award contracts in respect of 
49 (15+34) Tenders qua Lot-1 
& Lot-2 vide its orders 
dated 03.11.2023. In furtherance to the aforesaid order 
dated 03.11.2023, the Management uploaded the list of 
these approved 49 Tenders at the Company’s website 
on 04.11.2023 and issued Letters of Intent (Lols) to all 
the 23 Contractors to whom 49 Tenders of 39 Projects 
were awarded to comply with the requisite formalities 
for signing the Contract Agreements. Simultaneously, 
after seeking the approval of the BoD in 
its meeting 
held on 26.10.2023, the company floated another set of 
55 Tenders as part of Lot-3 on 07.11.2023/ 08.11.2023. 
After the completion of Bid Management Process for 
Lot-3 Tenders, a total of 38 Tenders were approved by 
BoD and Justice Sapre on 16.02.2024 and the same 
were submitted 
in the Hon’ble Supreme Court for 
approval for award of Contracts to successful Bidders, 
which was allowed by the Hon'ble Court vide its orders
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024-25 
dated 
26.04.2024. 
Similarly, 
the Management, 
after 
getting the approval 
of the BoD 
in 
its meeting held 
on 25.04.2024, floated 
31 Tenders on 10.06.2024 as 
part of Lot-4 Tenders. After the approval of the BoD 
on 13.11.2024, followed by the recommendations 
of 
Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre on 28.11.2024, a total of 23 
Tenders were awarded to successful 
L-1 
bidders 
in 
December, 2024 pursuant to the order dated 04.12.2024 
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Also, 17 Tenders were 
floated as part on Lot-5 Tenders on 30.12.2024. A set 
of 10 Tenders were finalized/ approved for award of 
contracts out of 17 tenders invited as part of Lot-5 in 
the meeting 
of the BoD held on 03.04.2025 subject 
to approval by Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre and the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Justice (Retd.) A.M. Sapre 
recommended/ the award of the aforesaid Tenders and 
gave his consent on 19.04.2025. The approval from the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in this respect is still awaited. 
Keeping in view that the works on various structures of 
buildings leftincomplete by the erstwhile management 
had been lying stalled for a number of years, 
it was 
decided 
to 
get the Health Safety Audit of 
all these 
buildings carried out from institutes of eminence. The 
Hon’ble Supreme Court was also apprised about the 
same through Action Taken Report — lll. 
Services of 
IIT Roorkee were availed for this purpose for all the 
under-construction 
buildings 
within 
NCR 
area, 
IIT 
Madras for the projects at Bangalore and Chennai, and 
Jadhavpur University for Kolkata based projects. In the 
process, the Heath Safety Audit and proof-checking 
of structure designs of a total of 179 Towers and 13 
basements were carried out in respect of 27 Projects. 
While the buildings have been found largely safe, the 
experts have pointed out the need for carrying out 
Retrofitting works to address the deficiencies observed 
during their tests. Reports of the concerned institutes 
have also been uploaded on the Company’s website. 
Accordingly, 
a total 
of 28 Tenders were floated for 
the Retrofitting Works along with the general Lot-3 
Tenders. Contracts have been awarded in case of 25 
Tenders pursuant to the approval of the BoD, Justice 
Sapre and the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Further Lot-4 
Tenders, which comprised of 31 main and 07 Tenders 
for 
retrofitting works 
were 
floated 
on 
10.06.2024. 
However, no retrofitting Tender was awarded as part 
of 
Lot-4. 
Subsequently, 
Lot-5 Tenders 
comprising 
of 16 main and 01 Tender of retrofitting works were 
floated 
on 30.12.2024 and 
after completion 
of the 
Bid Management process, 
10 Tenders (including 01 
Retrofitting Tender of Cascades- Kolkata) of Lot-5 were 
approved by BoD in its meeting held on 03.04.2025. 
After the approval 
of the BoD, Justice (Retd.) A.M. 
Sapre submitted 
his recommendations for the same 
on 19.04.2025. The approval from Hon'ble Supreme 
Court for award of contracts in case of 10 Tenders of 
Lot-5 is still awaited. The matter is likely to be taken up 
on the next date of hearing scheduled to be held on 
17.09.2025. 
Award of contracts for commencement of construction 
is only one of the important milestones in the process 
of completion of projects. There are numerous other 
statutory obligations like Renewal of Licenses (in case 
of Haryana 
and 
Punjab based 
projects), 
obtaining 
Fire NOCs, NOCs from the Airport Authority of India 
(wherever applicable), Revalidation and approval 
of 
the Building Plans, preparation of cases for obtaining 
Environmental 
Clearances 
and 
thereafter 
obtaining 
the Consents to Establish (CTEs) from the concerned 
statutory authorities are equally onerous tasks. The 
new management has been working on obtaining 
all 
these statutory approvals in parallel and succeeded to 
a considerable extent. There are still projects where the 
Contracts have been awarded but the works on ground 
have not been commenced on account of pendency of 
some of these statutory approvals. The management is 
aggressively working on all these fronts. 
The new management, working 
under 
the 
overall 
guidance and supervision 
of the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court, 
is 
committed 
to 
fulfilling 
the 
statutory 
and 
contractual obligations of the Company to adhere to 
the Sustainability and Economic 
Responsibilities 
of 
the Company’s business for Environmental, Social and 
Governance aspects. 
The revised format for BRSR 
is very exhaustive and 
requires 
details/ information which 
are 
not part 
of 
the normal data collection and reporting systems at 
the corporate level. Thus, the new format of BRSR 
necessitates 
 establishing 
rigorous 
documentation 
processes and comprehensive data collection system 
across 
all the sites and Departments/ Divisions of the 
Company, to ensure seamless compilation and flow 
of details for effective and accurate reporting. 
It also 
requires exhaustive training to employees at all levels 
of hierarchy, for 
a comprehensive understanding of the 
ESG objectives. 
It 
is pertinent to note that the proposed Resolution 
Framework 
(RF) 
is pending adjudication before the 
Hon'ble 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
India. 
The 
Company 
endeavours to take the required measures to upgrade 
the 
reporting 
system 
in 
line 
with 
the 
proposals 
submitted in the Resolution Framework and directions 
of the Hon'ble Supreme Court from time to time, so 
that the gaps in reporting under the new framework of 
BRSR, may be effectively bridged. All efforts have been 
ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25

unitech

made to compile the BRSR with the data available, 
which itself remains 
a challenge in view of complete 
change of management, and 
a large number of old 
employees having left the company. 
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
('BRSR’) of the Company describes the efforts of the 
Company towards adhering to implementation of the

Unitech’s stakeholders include Investors, FD holders, Shareholders, Customers, Employees, Vendors/ Partners, 
Community and Government. The Company has 
a comprehensive set of policies based on the principles of 
accountability and transparency. 
A Vigil Mechanism/ Whistle Blower policy is available on the website of the Company. This mechanism applies 
to all Directors, employees and other key stakeholders. It provides an anonymous platform for the reporting of 
any incidents of code violations and discriminations. 
The Code of Conduct is available on the website of the Company, which is applicable 
to Board of Directors as well 
as Senior Management. 
Homebuyers, Fixed Deposit Holders and others have filed Legal cases against the Company at various judicial 
forums including Consumer Forums and Courts (besides those pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court). 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court had vide its Order dated 08.09.2017 appointed an Amicus Curiae with directions 
to create a web portal wherein the homebuyers were required to register themselves on the portal and indicate 
their option for (i) refund of money they have paid to the Company/ Companies within the Group for purchasing 
residential units, or (i) possession of the allotted Unit. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed vide its 
order dated 27.07.2022 that the said portal would henceforth be managed by the new Management of Unitech. 
Any refunds to the Homebuyers and the FD holders are made only under the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court, be it on the grounds of Medical Exigencies or on account of advanced age factor, following the process 
laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. 
The unresolved complaints at the close of financial year 2024-25 relate to the Refund Seeking Homebuyers and 
the Fixed Deposit Holders. 
A total of 35 customer complaints pending at the close of FY 2023-24 were resolved during the FY 2024-25.

The biggest concern of more than 16,000 Homebuyers, who had invested their money in the hope of getting their 
dream homes since more than a decade, is to know about the status of commencement of works and schedule of 
completion of their homes. The Company is uploading all information about the status of projects and contracts 
awarded, status of projects awarded etc. on the website from time to time. 
< 
All queries regarding mode and manner of payment of balance dues, as per the Revised Payment Plan approved 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, are responded through updates on the website of the company. The Homebuyers 
have been given access to their individual accounts ledgers as soon as the demand for payment of balance dues 
is raised. The customers, who had initially opted for refunds, were given multiple opportunities to change their 
options from Refund to possession as per directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Management received 
representations from a considerable number of Homebuyers requesting one final opportunity to change their 
option from Refund to Possession. Considering these requests, the Board of Directors decided to grant one last 
and final opportunity to such Homebuyers. A Public Notice to this effect was uploaded on the Company’s website 
on 18.11.2024. The Notice was also published in various leading newspapers on 01.12.2024, including The Times of

Deccan Chronicle (Chennai edition), and Bangalore Mirror (Bangalore edition). The Homebuyers were given 
time up to 31.12.2024 to exercise this option. After scrutiny of all the e-mails received on the designated Email 
ID (refundtopossession@unitechgroup.com) up to 2400 hrs. on 31.12.2024, the Management was left with a total 
of 1065 refund seeking Homebuyers. This list was published on the Unitech portal on 07.02.2025. Subsequently, 
representations from 15 Homebuyers providing adequate documentary evidence were submitted supporting their 
change of option from refund to possession. This leaves 
a total of 1050 Homebuyers in refund category. The 
Homebuyers have been requested to update their contact details directly on the website using the online facility. 
Project-wise group emails and WhatsApp groups have been created/ developed to enable regular communication 
through emails and messages. 
Efforts are being made to respond to individual emails, and queries through digital communication platforms. 
Allrelevant information and advisories to Homebuyers are uploaded on the website through Public Notices on the 
Company'’s website. 
All the Refund-seeking Homebuyers of the Unitech Group, who are super senior citizens (above 75 years of age), 
were informed about the directions dated 06.02.2025 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court to apply for refund of the 
principal amount. Accordingly, applications were invited from such Refund-seeking Homebuyers who meet the 
following eligibility criteria: 
(i) 
The applicant must be included in the list of Refund-seeking Homebuyers. 
(i) 
The applicant must be a senior citizen aged 75 years or above as on the date of submission of the application. 
In this respect, a portal has been created and the Company received five (05) applications till 31.03.2025 and 
another 05 after 31.03.2025, which have been submitted in the Hon'ble Court for approval.
