Human 
Capital 
Development
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Our 
skilled employee 
base is instrumental 
towards the Company’s 
leadership position in the 
automotive marketplace 
space. A motivated 
talent pool with strong 
business and technical 
expertise helps deliver 
high quality products/
services and innovation. 
We consistently invest 
in the growth and 
development of our 
employees to harmonise 
the expectations of our 
human capital with those 
of the Company’s growth 
strategy. 
Risk: Constant upskilling 
of the workforce is critical 
to build capabilities to 
navigate the evolving 
technological and 
business landscape. 
Inadequate human capital 
development and lack 
of skillset can lead to 
business disruption in 
such cases. Additionally, 
there exists strong market 
demand for skilled and 
experienced talent which 
poses a risk of high 
attrition and flight of talent.
We have put in place 
a robust mechanism to 
identify and recruit talent 
with required skills from 
leading engineering 
institutions and business 
schools as well as through 
internal employee referrals 
and independent external 
agencies.
We have adopted 
competitive compensation 
framework and we 
benchmark our employee 
benefits and salary to 
ensure that our practices 
are in line with best industry 
standards. 
Our Learning and 
Development (L&D) 
programme is aimed at 
promoting career growth, 
leadership development, 
and gaining technical as 
well as soft skills through 
regular workshops and 
training sessions.
We have an equal 
opportunity culture that 
fosters diversity and 
inclusion within our 
workforce. We also have 
a transparent grievance 
redressal mechanism 
for managing employee 
concerns.
We also engage with our 
employees at regular 
intervals to seek their 
feedback on HR policies 
and practices and take 
corrective actions, wherever 
necessary.  
Positive: 
Development and 
retention of skilled 
talent helps business 
growth, productivity 
and innovation. 
Negative: High 
attrition can impact 
productivity, 
efficiency and 
innovation which 
leads to business 
disruption and 
negative financial 
impact.

2
Consumer  
satisfaction
Opportunity
Opportunity: Consumers lie 
at the heart of any business 
strategy, thus incorporating 
consumer centricity is the 
only viable approach to 
achieve growth.
We have incorporated 
Consumer centricity within 
all our policies, practices, 
and strategies. We stress 
extensively on engagement 
with consumer and seek 
feedback to redefine  our 
offerings. We ensure that 
the Consumer facing em-
ployees are well trained 
to effectively handle the 
needs and concerns of our 
Consumers and ensure 
their satisfac-tion with our 
products and services.
Positive: High 
Consumer satisfaction 
can lead to strong 
business growth. It 
can also help create 
a strong brand 
reputation and a loyal 
Consumer base who 
could be potential 
market for Company’s 
other existing/ 
new products and 
services.
3
Data privacy & 
Cybersecurity
Risk
Risk: Cyber-attacks 
and data breaches 
are becoming major 
risks due to increasing 
digitisation and large-
scale use of technology 
and its integration across 
platforms. Vulnerable 
systems can compromise 
the security of intellectual 
property or critical data 
as well as confidential 
information of stakeholders, 
including personally 
identifiable information 
(PII) which could damage 
Company’s trust and 
reputation. 
We are constantly in the 
process of strengthening our 
digital infrastructure in terms 
of technical safeguards and 
ongoing monitoring of new 
and existing threats. 
We have adopted a robust 
cybersecurity and data 
management framework 
and controls which is 
supervised by the Board and 
the senior management. 
We also regularly review 
our data and IT security 
policies and procedures 
and also conduct training 
and awareness sessions for 
our stakeholders to better 
equip them in dealing with 
instances of cyber-attacks 
and data breaches.
We design our platforms, 
offerings, and policies 
to facilitate compliance 
with evolving privacy and 
data security laws and 
regulations. Additionally, we 
have also procured a Cyber 
Insurance Policy for our 
system.
Negative: Weak 
data governance 
can result in data 
breaches which can 
damage reputation 
and impact business 
growth. It could also 
lead to legal liabilities 
which could result in 
additional financial 
burden. Investments 
in technology and 
digital infrastructure to 
strengthen IT systems 
will result in increased 
operational costs.

Technology/ 
Digital 
adoption
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Opportunity: State-of-
the-art technological 
infrastructure helps the 
business stay ahead of the 
curve. 
Risk: Rapid technological 
change, changes in user 
and customer requirements 
and preferences, frequent 
introduction of new services 
and products embodying 
new technologies, 
including apps, and the 
emergence of new industry 
standards and practices 
that could render our 
existing websites, apps and 
technology obsolete.
We have invested heavily in 
our technological capabilities 
across our platforms. We 
have an advanced and 
sophisticated technology 
platform. Our technology 
platforms are both scalable 
and vertically integrated 
across the entire value 
chain, which allows us to 
address each step of the 
vehicle life cycle. The end-
to-end technology platforms 
largely developed by our 
in-house team allow us to 
offer a seamless solution to 
our customers.
Positive: 
Sophisticated 
technology helps 
improve efficiency 
levels and scaling up 
of business thereby 
helping growth. It 
also helps us provide 
a better experience 
and more value to our 
customers.
Negative: Lack 
of adequate 
technological 
infrastructure 
can result in 
business becoming 
uncompetitive
5
Energy 
management
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Opportunity: Improvement 
in energy efficiency levels 
helps reduce carbon 
footprint and reduces 
operational costs. 
Risk: Energy management 
has assumed paramount 
importance considering 
the concerns surrounding 
increasing carbon 
emissions and climate 
change. Recognition of 
this risk has also meant 
evolution of stringent 
climate and environment 
related regulations which 
need to be adhered to.
Even though our business 
operations are not energy 
intensive in nature, we are 
committed to curtail energy 
consumption and improve 
energy efficiency levels 
within our operations. We 
are exploring initiatives like 
sensor-based lighting, green 
building certification, etc. to 
reduce consumption within 
our office spaces and also 
considering other avenues.
Positive: Energy 
efficiency and cost 
savings in the longer 
run, leading to more 
profitability
Negative: Upfront 
cost to be expended 
towards efficiency 
initiatives in the short 
term
6
Circular 
Economy and 
promotion 
of reuse/ 
refurbishment
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Resale of used vehicles 
is one of business 
segments of the 
Company. Wider adoption 
of circular economy 
fosters  innovation and 
design of products 
(vehicles) designed for 
extended use through 
repair, refurbishment, or 
remanufacturing.
The Company is committed 
to create an environment 
of trust through our 
infrastructure, processes, 
and 4S (Sure, Secure, Safe, 
Smart) promise to guarantee 
quality of used vehicles 
sold on our platforms. The 
Company also promotes the 
used vehicles through strong 
focus on advertisement and 
marketing. 
Positive: Encouraging 
circular economy 
initiatives can lead to 
expansion of market 
opportunities for 
reused vehicles
7
Community 
engagement
Opportunity
Opportunity:
We look at community 
engagement through 
corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) as 
an opportunity for the 
Company to partake in the 
country’s socio-economic 
development.
The Company is 
committed to implement 
a comprehensive CSR 
programme which benefits 
the community on multiple 
fronts and adequately 
disclose the impact 
generated by our projects 
as required by law. We 
also plan to put in place 
a mechanism to gather 
feedback basis which 
corrective actions can be 
taken, if any.
Positive: 
Implementing an 
effective CSR 
programme will 
help us build brand 
reputation and trust 
as we fulfil our social 
obligation.

7.   Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets, and achievements
      For the Company sustainability is not just a business imperative, but is at the core of our business model.  We empower Indian, smaller businesses such 
as vehicle dealers, most of whom are local in terms of size and reach, to access a pan-India ecosystem. By bringing transparency, liquidity, and simplicity 
to the Indian vehicle market, we make this market accessible for everyone. Consumers use our portals to research their used or new vehicle purchase 
online, reducing the need to visit dealerships and thus carbon footprint created during the vehicle buying process. We also educate consumers on the fuel 
efficiency and provide information on fuel efficient options for the vehicles that they are interested in purchasing.
      We have a highly qualified and diversified Board and the CSR Committee of the Board which oversees the Company’s ESG journey. During the year 
we further advanced our focus on integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles into our day-to-day operations. In line with our 
commitment to transparent and ethical business conduct, we took steps to strengthen our policies, practices and management systems to strengthen our 
commitments towards sustainability. We conducted an ESG materiality assessment to identify topics material to the Company and sector to help us outline 
our priorities for the future and devise a roadmap to achieve the targets set. We also carried out a baseline assessment of our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions (Scope 1 & Scope 2). 
      Going forward, we plan to integrate ESG risks into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. We are also committed to build on the current 
achievements by setting time-bound aspirational targets on various social and environmental parameters to continue to create value for all our stakeholders. 
We will further our commitment to adhere to the principle of providing quality service to our customers. We are focused on development and growth of 
our employees with strong emphasis on refining policies and practices related to Learning & Development, Compensation, Employee Wellbeing, and 
Employee Engagement.
      Reference should also be made to our Sustainability report which carries an exhaustive list of our ESG related challenges, targets and achievements.
