Safety
Risk
Occupational Health and 
Safety involves safety for not

for companies to make their 
operations safe and prevent 
any harm to the people and 
environment. Any mishandling 
of safety-related parameters 
can lead to a negative on the 
health and environment.
To address the risks associ-
ated with employee health 
and safety, the company is 
implementing the following 
approach:
Safety Training and Educa-
tion: 
Providing comprehensive 
safety training programs 
to employees to ensure 
they have the necessary 
knowledge and skills to 
perform their tasks safely. 
This includes regular safety 
briefings, hazard identifica-
tion, emergency response 
training, and to achieve an 
organizational goal of zero 
accidents.

tive gear, and infrastructure

cidents and injuries. This in-
cludes regular maintenance

ery and equipment to ensure 
they are in safe working 
condition.
Risk Assessments and Con-
trols: Conducting regular 
risk assessments to identify 
potential hazards and imple-
menting controls to mitigate 
them. This may involve im-
plementing engineering con-
trols, and establishing safety 
protocols and procedures.

sequences and damage the 
reputation and brand image of 
the company.
The company is committed 
to cultivating an empa-
thetic positive culture. This 
dedication is reflected in the 
company’s various corporate 
policies, which include the 
Whistle Blower Policy, policy

ness Conduct and ethics.
