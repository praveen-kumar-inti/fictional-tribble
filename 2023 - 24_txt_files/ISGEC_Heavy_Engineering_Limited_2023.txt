Corporate 
Governance 
and Code of 
Conduct
Opportunity
At ISGEC, Corporate Governance 
transcends compliance, serving 
as a pathway for progress. 
Beyond regulatory mandates, 
the Company’s values emphasise 
a 
robust 
commitment 
to 
ethics, transparency, and the 
enhancement of shareholder 
value. The Board of Directors

and Exchange Board of India’s 
(SEBI’s) 
best 
practices, 
are 
diligently submitted, reinforcing 
the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
openness. 
From 
the 
boardroom to the factory floor, a 
comprehensive Code of Conduct 
steers every decision outlining 
ethical principle and expected 
behaviour 
for 
employees/
directors, 
guiding 
decision-
making processes. 
-
Positive 
Implication: 
By 
upholding 
transparency 
and accountability, ISGEC 
garners 
investor 
trust, 
mitigates 
financial 
risks, 
and amplifies shareholder 
value.

2
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: ISGEC employs a significant 
number 
of 
employees 
and 
workers 
across 
its 
various 
offices, 
factories, 
and 
sites. 
Consequently, 
the 
Company 
places paramount importance 
on ensuring the safety of its 
employees, workers and contract 
workers. In the event of any lapses 
in the Company’s safety -related 
processes, 
the 
government 
may issue a prohibition order, 
potentially resulting in the partial 
shutdown of the manufacturing 
unit 
/sites. 
Safety 
incidents 
also have detrimental effects 
on the physical and mental 
health, as well as the overall 
morale 
of 
the 
workforce. 
Opportunity: ISGEC is dedicated 
to ensure the health and safety 
of its entire workforce, including 
employees 
and 
workers. 
Numerous 
initiatives 
have 
been implemented throughout 
the 
business 
operations, 
encompassing both Project and 
Manufacturing service lines, to 
establish a resilient health and 
safety management system. The 
ongoing efforts aim to cultivate a 
“Zero Accident Culture” across all 
operations.
ISGEC has a steadfast 
commitment to ensuring 
a secure and healthy 
workplace for its entire 
workforce, 
aspiring 
towards a target of zero 
accidents. The Company 
has 
instituted 
robust 
processes and systems at 
all its locations and proudly 
holds 
the 
certification 
of ISO 45001:2018 for 
Occupational 
Health 
and Safety Management 
Systems. 
ISGEC conducts regular 
internal 
and 
external 
audits to evaluate the 
effectiveness of its health 
management 
practices, 
aiming 
to 
establish 
a 
secure 
and 
healthy 
workplace. 
Additionally, 
the Company performs 
health and safety risk 
analysis at various sites 
and projects. 
Further, 
at 
a 
regular 
frequency and across the 
Company, ISGEC conducts 
multiple health check-up 
camps and webinars with 
Doctors and Consultants. 
Negative Implication:  A 
significant negative financial 
implication of not ensuring 
compliance 
with 
health 
and safety regulations is 
the potential restrictions 
of the manufacturing unit 
following any government 
order. This can lead to 
substantial financial losses 
due to halted production, 
disrupted operations, and 
the associated costs of 
addressing and rectifying 
safety issues. Additionally, 
there 
may 
be 
legal 
penalties and reputational 
damage, further impacting 
the 
Company’s 
financial 
standing. 
In 
the 
event 
of accidents or injuries, 
legal costs and potential 
settlements 
can 
be 
financially burdensome.
Positive 
Implication: 
A 
healthy and safe workplace 
fosters a positive work 
environment, 
enhancing 
employee 
morale 
and 
engagement. This, in turn, 
can lead to overall improved 
operational 
efficiency, 
building 
a 
positive 
reputation both internally 
and externally.

Emission 
Reduction 
& Emission 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The Company is proactively 
working to meet and exceed 
regulatory 
standards 
while 
reducing its carbon footprint. 
By investing in emission control 
technologies, ISGEC not only 
demonstrates its commitment to 
sustainability but also positions 
itself as a leader in environmental 
responsibility. 
Through 
these efforts, ISGEC aims to 
enhance its reputation among 
stakeholders 
who 
prioritize 
eco-friendly practices. ISGEC is 
confident in its ability to navigate 
the 
evolving 
environmental 
landscape while maintaining its 
competitiveness and esteemed 
reputation 
in 
the 
market. 
Opportunity: 
For 
ISGEC, 
emission reduction is more than 
a challenge; it is an opportunity 
ripe for the taking. With 1750 KW 
Solar Power Plants operational in 
its factories, ISGEC demonstrates 
that sustainability is not just 
environmentally responsible but 
financially rewarding, generating 
20.78 lakh units of solar power 
valued at Rs. 1.56 crores. By 
replacing 
air 
conditioners, 
upgrading equipment for lower 
energy 
consumption, 
and 
incorporating RLNG fuel for 
crucial operations, the Company 
is not merely reducing emissions 
but spearheading the transition 
towards a more sustainable and 
eco-friendly future.
ISGEC tackles emission 
reduction 
challenges 
through
strategic 
initiatives. From investing 
in 1750 KW Solar Power 
Plants to upgrading air 
conditioning 
systems 
and
embracing 
alternative 
fuels 
like 
RLNG, its commitment to 
sustainability is persistent. 
ISGEC proudly holds the 
ISO 14001 certification, 
solidifying its stance on 
environmental
responsibility. 
With 
a 
strong 
determination
to 
minimise
its 
environmental footprint, 
the 
Company 
remains 
steadfast in its pursuit of 
continuous improvement.
Positive 
Implication: 
Embracing 
emission 
reduction 
measures
fosters 
innovation 
and 
collaboration, 
making 
ISGEC 
an 
appealing 
partner for investors and 
stakeholders aligned with 
sustainability goals. ISGEC’s 
commitment to emission 
reduction 
represents 
a 
strategic 
investment 
in 
long-term 
resilience, 
competitiveness, 
and 
environmental stewardship. 
Negative 
Implication: 
Implementing 
necessary 
emission control measures 
demands 
upfront
investments in technology 
and infrastructure, exerting 
pressure on the Company’s 
financial 
reserves 
and 
limiting its ability to allocate 
resources 
elsewhere. 
Operational costs, including 
ongoing 
maintenance 
and staff training are also 
required.

Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Entities face growing demands 
from 
stakeholders 
such 
as 
investors, 
customers, 
and 
regulatory 
bodies 
to 
alleviate
environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) 
risks 
embedded 
in 
their 
supply 
networks. 
Inadequate 
implementation of sustainable 
supply 
chain 
management 
methods 
may 
subject 
a 
corporation 
to 
heightened 
vulnerabilities, 
encompassing 
disturbances in labour, incidents 
related 
to 
workforce 
health 
and safety, concerns regarding 
human rights, and scarcities 
in 
essential 
raw 
materials. 
Recognising this as a strategic 
opportunity, 
ISGEC 
has 
established 
a 
robust 
and 
adaptable 
supply 
chain 
management
system,
engaging a diverse array of 
suppliers, encompassing both 
large and small enterprises. 
Prior 
to 
onboarding 
any 
suppliers, 
the 
Company 
conducts thorough assessments 
of potential suppliers or vendors. 
This evaluation ensures that 
there are no associated risks 
with the prospective supplier, 
particularly in terms of financial 
and legal compliances, as well as 
adherence to robust health and 
safety measures.

Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
ISGEC confronts the substantial 
risk of data security and privacy, 
given the rising tide of cyber 
threats. An array of predatory 
entities, 
including 
hackers 
and cybercriminal syndicates, 
persistently 
endeavours 
to 
breach any Company’s digital 
defences, seeking unauthorised 
access to its confidential data 
repositories. These incursions 
are not haphazard but calculated 
efforts 
driven 
by 
motives 
ranging from financial gain to 
industrial deception and outright 
sabotage. As ISGEC manoeuvres 
through the digital landscape, 
safeguarding 
its 
sensitive 
information becomes essential 
to shield against the ever-present 
threats 
posed 
by 
malicious 
individuals operating online.
Recognising the critical 
importance 
of 
data 
security, ISGEC has taken 
proactive 
measures 
to 
fortify its defences. The 
Company 
has 
a 
data 
security 
policy 
which 
is 
in 
line 
with 
ITGC 
(Information Technology 
General 
Controls) 
and 
ensures 
data 
security 
and 
controlled 
access. 
Through 
collaborative 
efforts 
with 
external 
experts, 
the 
Company 
has implemented robust 
measures 
such 
as 
firewall setups, advanced 
software solutions, and 
strict 
authentication 
protocols. 
However, 
there 
remains 
ample 
scope for improvement 
in continually refining and 
updating these measures 
to address emerging cyber 
threats effectively. 
Isgec generally conducts 
IT security audits such as 
“Vulnerability Assessment 
& 
Penetration 
Testing” 
through 
external
agencies   Isgec employs 
cyber 
security 
experts 
in-house in its IT team 
and conducts extensive 
use of awareness and 
training 
programs 
on 
cyber security using in-
house resources as well as 
external resources from 
time to time.
Recognising 
that 
not 
all risks can be fully 
protected, Isgec has taken 
Cyber Security & Criminal 
Liability Insurance Policy 
to cover the risks.
Negative Implication: In 
the network of data security 
and privacy, the financial 
toll of risks is substantial. 
Remediation 
costs, 
legal 
battles, 
and 
regulatory 
fines can drain resources 
and 
strain 
budgets. 
Operational 
disruptions 
hamper productivity and 
stifle growth. Meanwhile, 
reputational 
damage 
erodes trust and investor 
confidence.

Human 
Rights, 
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Possible occurrences of 
breaches in human rights or 
failure to adhere to legal standards 
may result in negative financial 
and reputational consequences. 
Opportunity: ISGEC holds the 
belief that championing human 
rights and promoting equity, 
diversity, and inclusion fortifies 
the 
Company’s 
business. 
A 
workforce 
characterised 
by 
diversity 
and 
inclusivity 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
enhance 
performance 
and 
innovation. 
Upholding human rights allows 
the Company to foster shared 
values and maintain a positive 
workplace. 
This 
commitment 
contributes to the creation of 
a more equitable world and, at 
the same time, strengthens the 
business.
The Company prioritises 
safeguarding the human 
rights of its employees 
and 
workers. 
This 
commitment is evident in 
various policies, including 
the Human Resource (HR) 
policy, 
which 
explicitly 
states that no individual 
shall face discrimination 
by the Company or their 
peers. In addition, the 
Company is dedicated to 
being an equal opportunity 
employer 
and 
has 
a 
standalone 
Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment at 
Workplace (POSH) policy. 
Through 
the 
implementation of human 
rights 
due 
diligence 
processes, engaging with 
suppliers and stakeholders 
on 
human 
rights 
issues, 
and 
promoting 
awareness and training 
among employees, the 
Company actively fosters 
a commitment to human 
rights. This comprehensive 
approach underscores the 
Company’s commitment 
to 
fostering 
a 
safe, 
respectful, and inclusive 
work environment.
The Company conducted 
a survey to measure the 
pulse of Employees on 
work 
environment 
& 
various initiatives being 
implemented to improve 
the morale, team framing 
and 
overall, 
Company 
Culture.
Negative 
Implication: 
Discrimination or human 
rights 
violations 
can 
lead 
to 
legal 
actions, 
investigations, and fines, 
resulting 
in 
significant 
financial liabilities for the 
Company. This can cause 
reputation damage, talent 
drain and even potential 
customer
boycotts,
negatively 
impacting 
sales 
and 
revenue. 
Positive 
Implication: 
Companies that prioritise 
human rights and create 
an inclusive environment 
are more likely to attract 
and 
retain 
top 
talent. 
This reduces recruitment 
and 
training 
costs 
and 
contributes 
to 
higher 
employee 
morale 
and 
productivity.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Amidst 
tightening 
environmental regulations and 
heightened 
public 
awareness 
of waste disposal, ISGEC faces 
a critical imperative: to uphold 
exemplary practices and secure 
public trust. In this pivotal moment, 
ISGEC must rise to the challenge, 
navigating the complexities of 
waste management, in order 
to solidify its reputation as a 
responsible corporate citizen in an 
environmentally conscious world. 
Opportunity: 
Waste 
management presents a prime 
opportunity for ISGEC to showcase 
its commitment to sustainability. 
By adhering to the 3-R principle 
and minimising plastic usage, 
ISGEC underscores its dedication 
to curbing waste generation. 
Additionally, 
its 
proactive 
approach to e-waste management 
and water conservation further 
solidifies its reputation as a leader 
in sustainable business practices. 
While ISGEC has made strides in 
waste management, the Company 
remains open to adopting new 
technologies for further waste 
minimisation, 
demonstrating 
its commitment to continuous 
improvement in environmental 
stewardship.
The Company has been 
actively working to reduce 
waste generated from its 
operations. 
Additionally, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented initiatives to 
repurpose scrap materials 
within 
its 
operations, 
ensuring 
that 
valuable 
resources are not wasted. 
Furthermore, ISGEC has 
invested in an ETP-cum-
STP plant to manage liquid 
waste 
efficiently. 
This 
plant plays a crucial role 
in treating and recycling 
liquid waste, minimising 
environmental impact and 
promoting 
sustainability 
across its operations.
Positive 
Implication: 
Efficient 
waste 
management 
presents 
financial opportunities for 
ISGEC. By reducing waste 
and recycling, the Company 
cuts disposal costs and 
saves 
on 
raw 
material 
expenses by reusing scrap 
materials. These practices 
enhance ISGEC’s reputation, 
attracting environmentally 
conscious 
customers 
and 
investors 
while 
mitigating regulatory risks. 
Negative 
Implication: 
Inadequate
waste
management
poses
substantial financial risks 
for ISGEC. Failure to comply 
with 
regulations 
may 
lead to significant fines, 
while inefficient processes 
inflate operational costs, 
diminishing profit margins. 
Poor practices can also 
damage 
the 
Company’s 
reputation, eroding investor 
confidence and potentially 
lowering market value.

Water 
Management
Opportunity
Water management presents 
a 
strategic 
opportunity 
for 
ISGEC rooted in environmental 
responsibility, 
operational 
efficiency, 
and 
long-term 
sustainability. 
The 
Company 
acknowledges 
water 
as 
a 
critical natural resource, the 
commitment to judicious water 
usage 
aligns 
with 
emerging 
global trends and regulatory 
expectations. 
Implementing 
robust 
water 
management 
practices positions ISGEC to 
mitigate 
operational 
risks 
associated with water scarcity 
and 
contamination, 
ensuring 
continuity 
and 
resilience. 
The Company actively takes 
measures to decrease overall 
water consumption in all its 
operations
-
Positive 
Implication: 
ISGEC’s strategic focus on 
water 
management 
also 
translates 
into 
tangible 
financial 
benefits. 
By 
actively 
reducing 
overall 
water 
consumption 
and 
implementing initiatives to 
enhance water recyclability, 
the Company can achieve 
operational 
cost 
savings. 
Additionally, the adoption of 
water-efficient technologies 
and 
practices 
not 
only 
aligns with environmental 
stewardship 
but 
also 
positions 
ISGEC 
as 
an 
innovative industry leader. 
This, in turn, creates a 
competitive 
advantage, 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers and 
investors while contributing 
to the Company’s long-term 
viability and profitability.

culture. Through robust Learning 
and 
Development 
(L&D)

Economic 
Performance 
and Market 
Share
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Operating in the engineering 
sector, ISGEC is susceptible to 
economic fluctuations, rendering 
it vulnerable to downturns and 
market uncertainties. Economic 
downturns 
can 
negatively 
influence 
the 
demand 
for 
the 
products 
and 
services. 
Intense 
competition 
requires 
constant 
innovation 
and 
adaptation 
to 
changing 
market dynamics. The risk is 
heightened in the context of 
emerging 
technologies 
and 
evolving customer preferences. 
A 
proactive 
approach 
to 
market 
intelligence, 
product 
development, 
and 
strategic 
partnerships becomes essential 
to not only protect but also 
enhance ISGEC’s market share. 
Opportunity: 
Economic 
performance 
and 
market 
share 
serve 
as 
strategic 
opportunities 
for 
ISGEC. 
In 
favourable economic conditions, 
the Company can maximise 
revenue and profitability, using 
the financial strength to invest 
in innovation and sustainability. 
Simultaneously, 
an 
increased 
market share positions ISGEC 
as an industry leader, providing 
economies of scale, enhanced 
operational 
efficiency, 
and 
greater negotiating power.
ISGEC
maintains 
a
commitment 
to
strengthening 
relationships 
with 
its 
stakeholders 
while 
focusing 
on 
enhancing 
the quality, technology, 
and competitiveness of 
its products. ISGEC has 
curated a diverse portfolio 
comprising heavy capital 
goods 
machinery 
and 
equipment, 
showcasing 
extensive capabilities in 
engineering procurement 
and construction across 
various 
industries. 
In 
numerous product lines, 
the Company holds a 
prominent 
position, 
ranking either as the top 
or second in the Indian 
market. ISGEC’s strategic 
approach 
includes 
establishing 
technical 
tie-ups 
with 
reputable 
companies, 
particularly 
in specialised fields such 
as Air Pollution Control, 
Process Plant Equipment, 
Boilers, and Presses. These 
collaborations 
empower 
ISGEC to provide optimal 
technical solutions and 
high-quality products to 
customers 
both 
within 
India and internationally.
Negative 
Implication: 
Economic downturns and 
a decrease in market share 
may 
lead 
to 
increased 
competition and can limit 
the Company’s ability to 
invest 
in 
research 
and 
development, 
hindering 
long-term growth. Financial 
challenges may lead to 
cost-cutting 
measures, 
potentially
resulting
in 
layoffs 
or 
reduced 
employee 
benefits, 
impacting 
workforce 
morale and productivity. 
Positive 
Implication: 
A 
larger 
market 
share 
and 
robust 
economic 
performance 
often
contribute 
to 
improved 
pricing power, expansion 
opportunities, stakeholder 
confidence 
and 
overall 
enhanced profitability for 
the Company.

Customer 
Relationship 
Management
Opportunity
Customer 
Relationship 
Management 
(CRM) 
offers 
ISGEC a prime chance to hold 
up its standing in the market 
and strengthen ties with clients. 
In today’s cutthroat competitive 
environment, nurturing enduring 
relationships with customers can 
make or break the Company’s 
fortunes. 
Through 
effective 
utilisation of CRM tools, ISGEC can 
unlock invaluable perspectives, 
boost customer interaction, and 
customise its solutions to keep 
pace with changing needs. This 
approach not only reinforces 
customer allegiance but also 
boosts 
brand 
endorsement, 
charting a course for enduring 
expansion and financial viability 
down the line.
-
Positive Implication: By 
leveraging CRM data and 
insights, ISGEC can identify 
upselling and cross-selling 
opportunities, 
thereby 
boosting sales and revenue 
generation. 
Additionally, 
improved
customer
relationships 
fostered 
through CRM can result 
in positive word-of-mouth 
referrals 
and 
enhanced 
brand reputation, attracting 
new customers and further 
driving financial growth.
ISGEC 
also 
conducts 
Customer 
satisfaction 
surveys from time to time 
to engage with Customers.

Biodiversity 
Management 
and Land Use
Opportunity
ISGEC recognises an opportunity 
in 
biodiversity 
management 
and 
land-use 
as 
strategic 
imperatives by acknowledging 
the 
fundamental 
importance 
of preserving biodiversity for 
a 
balanced 
ecosystem. 
By 
exclusively 
operating 
outside 
protected or restricted areas, 
the Company emphasises its 
dedication to minimising any 
adverse impact on biodiversity. 
-
Positive Implication: The 
dedication to biodiversity 
preservation ensures long-
term 
sustainability 
and 
distinguishes the Company 
from its competitors. ISGEC’s 
appeal to environmentally 
conscious consumers and 
businesses not only sets it 
apart but also reduces the 
legal challenges faced by 
companies operating in the 
engineering sector.
13
Corporate 
Citizenship 
and Charity
Opportunity
With a strong CSR policy in place, 
ISGEC channels its resources 
into initiatives aimed at uplifting 
marginalised 
communities 
surrounding its plants. From 
installing rainwater harvesting 
systems 
to 
providing 
solar 
energy in schools, the Company’s 
commitment to environmental 
sustainability 
and 
social 
development shines through. By 
investing in skills development 
and rural projects, ISGEC not only 
enriches lives but also fortifies 
its position as a responsible 
corporate entity dedicated to 
societal progress.
-
Positive Implication: By 
investing in the well-being of 
marginalised communities 
and promoting sustainable 
development, 
ISGEC 
strengthens 
its 
social 
license to operate. This, 
in turn, enhances brand 
reputation and customer 
loyalty, potentially leading 
to 
increased 
sales 
and 
market share. Moreover, 
participating 
in 
CSR 
activities can attract socially 
conscious 
investors 
and 
partners, expanding access 
to capital and fostering 
long-term financial stability.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
10. a.	Whether an occupational health and safety
management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes. ISGEC is an ISO 45001: 2018 certified Company. A 
periodic third-party assessment is done to assess its 
robustness and efficacy. During the assessment process, 
feedback from workers, employees and supervisors is 
taken and is incorporated in the corrective action plan 
formulated for ensuring robustness of the management 
system. The independent/third-party assessment is 
undertaken by DNV GL Business Assurance for the 
manufacturing business and for Project business it is 
done by Lloyds Register of Quality Assurance. 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and
non-routine basis by the entity?
The Company identifies and assesses work-related
hazards through a combination of routine and non-
routine methods. Routine activities include Hazard
Identification and Risk Analysis, Job Safety Analysis,
and Routine Safety Inspections, alongside non-
routine measures such as Inter-shop Safety Patrols
and Internal Safety audits aligned with ISO standard.
Additionally, the implementation of a robust work
permit system adds an extra layer of precaution,
ensuring that every task is performed with due
diligence and adherence to safety regulations.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to
report the work-related hazards and to remove
themselves from such risks. (Yes/No)
Yes. All workers are permitted to work only after

in place for workers to report on the work-related 
hazards. All the facilities and plants are categorized 
into two zones- high risk and low risk. Based on the 
categorization, effective measures are undertaken. 
For example, at high-risk zone one safety officer is 
deputed for every 50 people whereas in the low-risk 
zone, the number goes up to 200 persons. 
Workers may report on the issues to internal supervisors 
initially. Further, there is a hierarchy of personnel 
responsible for addressing any health and safety 
related issues that may arise. For example, the first 
point of contact is internal supervisor who is followed 
by Site In-charge, Resident Construction Manager, 
Safety Manager, Safety Officer and Site Manager. The 
emergency contact number is put up on display along 
with the contact numbers of persons mentioned above, 
responsible for prevention and management health 
related risks. Most of the Company’s plants and sites 
have ambulances on standby.

recognized hospitals such as Apollo, HCL Healthcare,
ICARE, Multi-Specialty Clinic etc. Under this, health
check-up packages are provided to its employees at
