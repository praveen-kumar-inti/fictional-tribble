 A major portion of the Company’s products are built-to-print, where the product design—including material selection and end-of-
life specifications—is finalized by the customers. As a result, there is currently limited opportunity for the Company to conduct a 
meaningful Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).
 
 However, to remain future-ready, the Company has begun building internal capabilities to carry out such assessments in the 
coming years. While no LCA has been conducted at the Company level yet, the knowledge and methodologies developed by 
SAMIL and support from Sumitomo Wiring Systems Limited will be leveraged to develop relevant expertise.
 
 To further enhance preparedness, the organization is planning to raise awareness on Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) among sales, 
design, and purchase teams during FY 2026.

 MSWIL has established a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism that encompasses various channels for receiving and 
addressing grievances. These mechanisms are designed to provide employees with multiple avenues to express their concerns 
and suggestions. Various working groups, such as employee consultative committees, union-management committees, health 
and safety committees, canteen committees, and welfare committees, have been established to address specific employee 
matters. These committees facilitate discussions and provide platforms for employee input. The human resources function within 
MSWIL plays a crucial role in impartially investigating and fact-finding with regard to any employee grievances, acting as an internal 
due diligence mechanism. Additionally, there are mechanisms in place to facilitate anonymous or private submissions through 
designated email addresses and/or telephone numbers. Furthermore, MSWIL has a dedicated Whistle-Blower Policy that serves 
as a formal platform for confidentially reporting and investigating grievances. This policy ensures that employees have a secure 
channel to raise concerns without fear of reprisal.
 
 Lastly, MSWIL has a comprehensive policy on the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace. 
In compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, many 
of Motherson's Indian units have Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) responsible for conducting inquiries related to such 
complaints. These committees play a crucial role in ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment.
 
 Overall, grievance redressal mechanisms provide employees with various avenues to raise concerns, seek resolution, and 
contribute to a positive and respectful work culture.

 For non-routine activities, the Company implements a work permit system which serves as a Hazard Prediction Procedure. 
This system includes a format for identifying hazards and recommending necessary control measures. Additionally, hazard 
identification is conducted through audits by internal auditors, COSA auditors, following ISO 45001:2018  annually, along 
with daily safety audits performed by safety professionals.

 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
 
 At MSWIL, safety is embedded into our daily operations through a robust and structured framework. Weekly safety committee 
meetings are conducted to monitor and drive continuous improvement. Both planned and surprise safety audits are carried out by 
internal safety committee members and the COSA safety team, while fire risk assessments are conducted by approved third-party 
experts. A well-defined system for hazard identification and risk assessment is in place, ensuring potential risks are proactively 
addressed. We routinely identify and assess work-related hazards through monthly and quarterly audits, along with regular reviews 
of Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) processes. All machines undergo risk assessments and are equipped with 
safety devices and clear safety labels. Preventive steps such as thermal imaging of electrical panels and equipment are conducted 
monthly, and a robust Work Permit System governs high-risk tasks like hot work, working at height, and excavation. Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided wherever required to minimize risk exposure. Our Emergency Response Team (ERT) is 
trained to handle crisis situations, supported by frequent mock drills for scenarios such as fire and earthquakes.
 
 Safety training is regularly conducted on topics like fire extinguishing, first aid, and material handling equipment, and is further 
enhanced through digital tools and awareness activities such as safety posters, quizzes, and safety competitions. Safety Officers 
are deployed across unit to reinforce safe practices. Incidents and near-misses are analyzed in detail to ensure continuous learning 
and improvement, with corrective actions implemented promptly.To foster a culture of safety, we organize regular promotional 
activities such as National Safety Week, Road Safety Week, Fire Safety Day, safety quizzes, slogan writing, and suggestion 
campaigns. Units are evaluated quarterly under a Safety Award System to recognize the best-performing sites. Additionally, we 
emphasize continuous improvement through safety-related kaizens and have implemented the LOTO (Lock Out–Tag Out) system 
to ensure safe equipment handling.

 Provide details of any  corrective  action  taken  or  underway  to  address  safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / 
concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions. 
 
 At MSWIL, we have implemented a series of robust corrective measures to address safety-related incidents and proactively 
mitigate risks in the workplace. A key initiative includes the installation of safety covers and sensors on all machines, significantly 
reducing operational hazards. Specific enhancements have also been made to the safety covers of our C&C machines to further 
improve their protective effectiveness and minimize associated risks.
 
 To ensure employee safety during maintenance or repair activities, we have adopted the Lockout-Tagout (LOTO) system, which 
ensures machines and electrical panels are fully de-energized before any such work begins. This greatly reduces the risk of 
electrical accidents and creates a safer environment for maintenance teams.
 
 Fire prevention is another critical focus. We conduct thermal imaging on 100% of our machines and electrical panels to detect 
abnormal heat patterns that could signal potential fire hazards. This early detection enables timely corrective action, reducing the 
likelihood of fire-related incidents.

perceived as discriminatory. We expect all employees and associates to treat one another with dignity, fairness, and mutual 
respect, and to promote a culture of personal responsibility and ethical behavior.
Our commitment is reinforced through the Motherson Prevention of Harassment Policy, which mandates:
Establishment of Complaints Committees in each entity to handle grievances related to harassment.
Thorough and confidential investigation and resolution procedures.
Strict prohibition of retaliation or victimization against any aggrieved individual.
 This group-wide policy is further supported by local legal frameworks to ensure robust and compliant grievance handling 
across all our operations.

 Regular trainings and communications across the organization reinforce employee rights, the grievance mechanism, and the 
zero-tolerance stance on retaliation.

 Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising from the assessments at 
Question 9 above 
 While no specific claim on its own is deemed to be significant, local management continually assesses its internal processes. 
Some modifications that have been implemented by certain companies over the reporting period of this BRSR include firming
up employment separation procedures to communicate the process more clearly to the employee, improving employee training
as to their rights and obligations related to employment in their respective jurisdictions, and analysis of employment contracts to 
ensure continued compliance with local regulations.
 
 To support this commitment, regional corporate (Chairman's) offices are entrusted with the implementation and administration 
of grievances related to human rights concerns. These responsibilities are aligned with the guidance set forth in our Code of 
Conduct.
 
 To ensure a robust and transparent grievance mechanism, we have instituted a Whistle-Blower Policy supported by:
Engagement of an independent third party for initial contact, investigation, and facilitation of resolution.
Anonymous channels that empower employees and stakeholders to report concerns safely and confidentially.
 
 This multi-layered approach ensures that all concerns are addressed fairly and effectively, reinforcing our commitment to creating 
a safe, respectful, and accountable work environment across all our operations.
5.
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
 Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited is committed to upholding internationally recognized human rights principles and has
embedded a structured human rights due diligence process within its operations. This process is integral to fulfilling our duty of 
care and involves:
Assessing actual and potential human rights impacts, both internally and across our value chain.
Engaging with potentially affected groups and stakeholders to ensure meaningful consultation.
 Integrating human rights considerations into the existing risk assessment systems, enabling proactive identification and
management of human rights risks.
Taking action based on assessment findings, through relevant internal functions to prevent, mitigate, or remediate impacts.
Monitoring responses using appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators.
Ensuring transparency through external communication on how human rights impacts are being addressed.
 At MSWIL, we are firmly committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all employees, business partners, 
and stakeholders. We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination, intimidation, exploitation, or harassment.

Below are the initiatives:
 
 Transitioning to Cleaner Fuels- In our endeavour to reduce pollution and optimize operational costs, we have replaced diesel as a 
fuel source in generators with cleaner alternatives such as Piped Natural Gas (PNG). This transition not only helps us save on diesel 
costs but also significantly reduces our carbon emissions, contributing to a healthier environment. We are procuring new Diesel 
gensets based on latest CPCB IV norms . This will help in reducing the carbon emissions and to achieve in carbon net zero goals 
To diversify our energy procurement and reduce our carbon footprint, we have initiated power purchase agreements with private 
sources, including wind power providers in addition to installing roof solar plants.In our ongoing quest for innovative renewable 
energy solutions, we are striving to use cutting-edge technologies such as windmills and solar power. These installations harness 
the power of nature to supplement our energy needs, resulting in reduced reliance on conventional energy sources

Water withdrawal, consumption and discharge in areas of water stress (in kilolitres): 
 
 Wiring Harness facility does not uses water in our production processes. MSWIL units are applying Rain Water Harvesting 
solutions that also percolate rainwater into groundwater to maintain groundwater levels. To reduce the dependency on 
ground water, we have started to collect the rainwater by creating the dedicated pond. By the use of smart automation, 
we have achieved to add this in on our reservoir results reducing the dependency on ground water.
For each facility / plant located in areas of water stress, provide the following information:
(i)
Name of the area
Facility name

The water stress areas have been identified based on “Central ground water 
Board ministry of Jal Shakti Government of India. According to this report, 
our Noida locations are classified as semi critical and, Faridabad, Gurgaon, 
Pathredi, Pithampur locations has been classified as ‘Over-Exploited’, while

 Yes, we do have business continuity and disaster management policy in place. Presence in multiple locations and standardized 
processes is essential for de-risking operations. By diversifying risk across several sites, we ensure that even a single catastrophic 
event, such as a natural disaster or political upheaval, does not incapacitate the entire operation. Furthermore, implementing 
a standardized shop floor layout across all locations ensures uniformity in processes, which simplifies training, enhances 
efficiency, and maintains consistent quality. Standardized procedures also facilitate quicker recovery and continuity during a 
disaster, as personnel can seamlessly transition between sites without a learning curve.

Sustainability Information” paragraph below in accordance with the criteria stated in the “Criteria” paragraph below. The 
identified Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility And Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of the Company 
for the year ended March 31, 2025 pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India’s (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”). This 
engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, and specialists.
Identified Sustainability Information
2. 
 The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended March 31, 2025 is BRSR Core (subset of BRSR), the attributes of 
which are summarised in Appendix 1 to this report. The Reporting Boundary for BRSR as disclosed under Question No.13 of 
Section A: General Disclosures of the BRSR.
3. 
 Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information only and we have not 
performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR (i.e. non- BRSR Core 
attributes) and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
Criteria
4.
The Criteria used by the company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
i. 
 Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;
ii. 
 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/
CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, and Industry Standard on Reporting BRSR Core per SEBI Circular No. 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated December 20, 2024.
Management’s Responsibility
5. 
 The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of BRSR, disclosing environmental information basis operational 
control approach, taking into account applicable laws and regulations including the SEBI circular, related to reporting on the 
Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Management and the 
Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s compliance with the requirements of 
LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the BRSR Core.
Inherent limitations
6. 
 The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities.
7. 
 Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to inherent measurement 
uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint, embracing circularity (waste management). 
Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and attributes. 
Our Independence and Quality Control
8. 
 We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 
2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
9. 
 We apply Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our Responsibility
10. 
 Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix 1 
based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
11. 
 We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, 
“Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information summarised in Appendix 1 are prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of 
material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed 
risks as necessary in the circumstances.
12. 
 The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Below is the informative summary of the procedures performed by us:
 

obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures.
 
 
 obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
 
 
 made inquiries of Company’s management, including those responsible for preparing the BRSR report, finance team, 
human resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for managing the Company’s BRSR.
 
 
 obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key processes and controls for recording, 
processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information on sample basis of different offices. This included 
evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented 
by performing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of internal controls.
 
 
 based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures.
 
 
 at each site visited, performed substantive testing on a sample basis of the Identified Sustainability Information to verify 
that the data had been appropriately measured with the underlying documents recorded, collated and reported. This 
includes reconciling the Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records and recalculation on a sample 
basis.
 
 
 where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the information in the 
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended for the year ended March 31, 2025 and the 
underlying records.
 
 
 evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements made by the management in 
the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information.
 
 
 obtained representations from Company’s management. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.
