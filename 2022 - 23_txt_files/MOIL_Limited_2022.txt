Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 2022-23
A step towards ESG Alignment
In recent years, there has been a significant shift in 
the business world towards embracing environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) principles. ESG 
represents a framework that encourages companies 
to consider their impact on the environment, 
their relationships with stakeholders, and the 
overall governance and ethical practices within the 
organization. This growing awareness has prompted 
MOIL to take concrete steps towards implementing 
ESG strategies. We are now placing greater emphasis 
on sustainable practices, such as reducing carbon 
emissions, implementing renewable energy sources, 
and optimizing resource consumption. Additionally, 
we are increasingly focusing on fostering inclusive and 
diverse workplaces, ensuring fair labour practices, and 
promoting community engagement and improving 
governance structures, with transparent reporting and 
accountability mechanisms being put in place. These 
steps towards ESG reflect a broader recognition of the 
interconnectedness between business success and 
environmental and social well-being.

lead to workplace accidents, 
injuries, and occupational 
health problems, resulting in

productivity, and potential legal 
liabilities.
The company invests in robust 
safety protocols, training, 
and preventive measures to

likely to pose safety hazards for 
workers working in those mines.
MOIL ensures proper safety 
norms to avoid any kind of 
accident and carry out fire 
safety Audit of all mines and 
plants.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including

MOIL Limited, being a mining company, is engaged in the exploration, extraction, and production of manganese ore, Manganese Ore, 
Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide and Ferro Manganese. Given the nature of mining operations, where ore is extracted and processed to obtain 
valuable minerals, there are limited opportunities for reclaiming products for reusing, recycling, or disposal at the end of their life cycle. Unlike 
certain manufacturing sectors that can recycle or repurpose their products, mining processes often involve the extraction of non-renewable 
resources, making it challenging to recover and recycle the materials at the end of their useful life. However, MOIL remains dedicated to 
implementing sustainable practices in its operations, minimizing environmental impacts, and adhering to responsible mining standards to 
ensure long-term ecological balance and conservation of natural resources.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	 Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been   implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage 
such system? 
	
	
MOIL places a high priority on the health and safety of its employees and workers, as evident from its comprehensive health camp for 
occupational disease checkup. This initiative ensures that the workforce undergoes regular health assessments to identify and address 
any potential occupational health issues proactively. The program includes both Initial Medical Examination (IME) and Periodical Medical 
Examination (PME), with a frequency of 5 years for individuals aged below 45 and 3 years for those aged above 45. 
	
	
Furthermore, the company demonstrates its commitment to the well-being of workers operating heavy vehicles by conducting annual 
eye checkups for them. Additionally, MOIL is dedicated to equipping its workers with essential life-saving skills through comprehensive 
training programs. All workers receive training on how to rescue an injured co-worker during emergencies, ensuring they are well-
prepared to provide immediate assistance when required. Moreover, workers are trained to respond effectively to critical situations such 
as fires and roof falls, promoting a culture of safety and preparedness across all mining operations.
	
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
The company prioritizes the reliability and efficiency of its machinery and equipment through diligent maintenance practices. The 
company conducts periodic maintenance on its machines to ensure they are in optimal working condition, reducing the risk of unexpected 
breakdowns and minimizing operational disruptions. Immediate repair of broken-down machines is a top priority, as it ensures swift 
resumption of operations and avoids potential delays and productivity losses.
	
	
To maintain the integrity and safety of such zones, the company performs pressure tests regularly to assess the structural strength of 
equipment and pipelines. This preventive measure helps identify potential leaks or weaknesses before they escalate into safety hazards.
	
	
Moreover, the company employs Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for its critical equipment. NDT is a valuable inspection technique that 
allows the company to assess the condition of vital equipment without causing damage. Through NDT tests, MOIL can detect any defects 
or abnormalities in important machinery and make informed decisions about repairs or replacements, ensuring the continuous and safe 
operation of its mining processes.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Every mine has a telephone in the communication sector. In the event of an injury or emergency, the workers are trained to immediately 
report the incident to the senior-most manager of the mine or the mine manager. Alternatively, they can reach out to any available 
supervisor on duty.
	
	
Upon receiving the report, the mine manager takes charge of the situation and communicates the incident to the concerned officer 
designated for emergency response. The concerned officer then follows the established SOP (Safe Operating Procedure) to assess the 
situation and determine the appropriate course of action for rescuing the injured worker safely and efficiently.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
The company provides medical facilities on-site that allows for immediate response and treatment in case of minor injuries or medical 
emergencies that can be addressed within the mine premises.
	
	
However, in the event of a major medical incident or if specialized medical care beyond the capabilities of the on-site facility is required, 
MOIL takes the responsible approach of referring the affected individual to a hospital located outside the mine and the expense is borne 
by the company.
