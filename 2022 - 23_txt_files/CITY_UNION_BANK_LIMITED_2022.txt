As the Director responsible for business responsibility, the Bank has 
made significant progress in addressing key Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) challenges. Our focus on sustainability has 
significantly improved the overall impact of our operations on the 
environment, our stakeholders, and the communities we serve. The Bank 
continues to reduce  carbon footprint, increasing  its engagement and 
investing in local communities through various social initiatives.
We are committed to continuously improving our ESG performance.
In terms of environmental conservation, CUB has been progressively 
investing in protecting water bodies in and around its headquarters at 
Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, and in various other districts such as 
Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam. We have undertaken several projects for 
the rejuvenation of lakes and large water bodies, resulting in higher 
groundwater tables that have helped farmers. Since the financial year 
2017-18, CUB has strengthened and protected the river and canal banks 
to a stretch of 58 kms, desilted and rejuvenated lakes to the spread of 594 
acres, benefitting about 45,000 acres of cultivable land. These activities 
covered over 70 villages and benefitted around 1.5 lakh people.
CUB's banking operations are assisted by a matured Information 
Technology platform that encourages paperless banking, reducing our 
carbon footprint. We are driving energy efficiency across all our offices 
subject to feasibility.
In terms of social initiatives, CUB has been substantially contributing 
towards community development, particularly towards raising the 
standards of the underprivileged sections for many years by bringing 
them under the ambit of Financial Inclusion Programs.
We have also offered many training programs across various levels to 
raise employees' functional value, including management education, 
leadership development, and IT skills. During the year 2022-23, 4,478 
employees were imparted training which comprises to 74% of the total 
employee strength of the Bank.
While customers - retail and corporate - are the key stakeholders for the 
bank's growth in business, other key stakeholders include the 
government, the regulator, shareholders, business enablers like the 
NPCI, technology service providers, employees, and the community who 
support the Bank's business. CUB recognizes the fact that it is the active

Considering the nature of the Bank's

section primarily applies to the Bank's 
information technology (IT) capital 
expenditures. The Bank's increased 
utilization of digital platforms has led to 
enhanced operational efficiencies and 
significantly reduced reliance on paper-based 
processes.

leverage technology to drive operational excellence 
and enhance customer experiences.

Sustainable sourcing:

If yes, what percentage of inputs were

The Bank maintains a positive working relationship 
with its vendors, depositors, and other service 
providers, and incorporates them into its business 
practices.
Moreover, as an organization operating within the 
Financial Services sector, the significance of 
material purchases for operational purposes is 
paper, computer, laptops, air conditioners etc. 
However, when procuring equipment, the Bank 
places great emphasis on considering energy 
efficiency standards. Specifically, electronic 
equipment such as computers, laptops, lighting 
devices, and air conditioning units are selected 
based on their compliance with these standards. 
This approach aligns with the Bank's commitment 
to promoting sustainable practices and minimizing 
its environmental impact.

5.           Internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues:
The Bank acknowledges the importance of addressing grievances related to human rights issues and has 
implemented robust internal mechanisms for this purpose. We have established a comprehensive Whistle-
blower Policy and a dedicated Protection of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy to effectively redress such 
grievances.
To facilitate this process, we have provided all our employees with intranet access, where we have created a 
distinct menu specifically dedicated to Whistle-blower and Women Welfare concerns. This platform allows our 
employees to securely report any violations or concerns related to human rights / employee issues. We assure 
utmost confidentiality in handling the inputs received through this menu, and the information is promptly 
forwarded to the appropriate officials for further action.
We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful working environment for all our employees, and these 
internal mechanisms serves as vital channel for addressing and resolving any grievances related to human 
rights violations.

8.           Human rights requirements forming part of your business agreements and contracts:
10.        Corrective Actions to address significant risks / concerns arising from the assessments:
The Bank has instituted a comprehensive mechanism to prevent workplace harassment. The Bank has a code of 
conduct which sets out the Bank's expectations for appropriate workplace behaviour  and addresses instances 
of harassment.
Considering the nature of the Bank's operations, the scope of human rights requirements within our business 
agreements and contracts is comparatively less. It is important to note that the Bank does not have a specific 
policy solely focused on Human Rights but it indirectly addresses through POSH, Whistle Blower Mechanism, 
Customer Right Policy etc.
The Bank's policies and practices are designed to address and manage all aspects of sexual harassment and 
discrimination at the workplace. The Bank has not identified any specific instances or significant risks that 
would require corrective actions. However, we remain committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive work 
environment and our policies are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure compliance with best 
practices and legal requirements.

**  During the financial years under review, the Bank encountered difficulty in quantifying its electricity and fuel 
consumption in terms of units. Nonetheless, we have diligently maintained precise records of the expenses 
incurred on energy consumption during this duration.
 
We further wish to inform you that the expenditure data cannot be converted from Rupees to respective units 
due to the varying tariffs of electricity per KVH and fuel per litre in different states. Furthermore, some of our 
bank branches function on a lease and rental basis, and thus receive shared billed amounts instead of units.
 
We acknowledge this constraint and are presently in the process of establishing a system to accurately 
document energy consumption from the forthcoming financial years. 
 
During the FY 2022-2023, the Bank's total energy expenditure saw an increase of 18.10% and an increase of 
13.58% in total turnover. No independent assessment/evaluation was carried out by an external agency.

The operations of banks primarily involve indoor activities that are not related to industrial processes, which are 
typically associated with significant air emissions. Therefore, the level of air emissions from our operations is 
considerably low. Additionally, as a responsible corporate citizen, we adopt environmentally conscious practices 
and comply with all applicable regulations to further minimize any potential air emissions. Further, no 
independent assessment/evaluation was carried out by an external agency.

Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
(Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency.
The Bank 's operations at different outlets do not involve production activities, eliminating the possibility of 
emitting effluent gases. However, some branch offices are equipped with diesel generators that may emit certain 
gases. To address this issue, the Bank has implemented measures to mitigate emissions. These measures include 
regular servicing of diesel generators through Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) and the utilization of mostly 
star-rated equipment. Further, no external agency conducted an independent assessment or evaluation in this 
regard.
7.         Project related to reducing Green House Gas emission:
Does the entity have any project related to reducing 
Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide

Considering the nature of CUB's business activity, the

contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. As of now, 
the Bank does not have any specific projects 
dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The Bank operates its branches across 
multiple locations, and waste management is 
carried out through varied methods ranging 
from captive disposal to collaborations with 
local vendors. E-waste is returned to the 
respective vendors, while battery waste 
materials are exchanged with third-party 
vendors in exchange for new batteries. 
Furthermore, the nature of our business 
precludes the generation of any hazardous 
or radioactive waste.
As a banking services company, our 
operations primarily focus on providing 
financial services to our customers. Due to 
the nature of our business, we do not 
generate significant waste or engage in 
activities that require waste recovery 
through recycling, reusing, or other recovery 
operations. Therefore, there is no relevant 
data available in this regard. Our 
commitment lies in adhering to responsible 
and sustainable practices within the scope of 
our operations to minimize any potential 
environmental impact. We continuously 
strive to promote environmental 
consciousness and encourage our employees 
and stakeholders to adopt eco-friendly 
practices in their day-to-day activities

As a banking services company, our

disposal methods such as incineration, 
landfilling, or other disposal operations.

The Bank has not conducted any independent assessment/ evaluation by an external agency.
9.          Waste management practices adopted in the establishment: 
Briefly describe the waste management practices 
adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of 
hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
Given that the Bank is solely engaged in financial 
services, it does not partake in any manufacturing 
processes. However, the Bank upholds sustainable 
waste management practices to ensure proper 
disposal of generated waste.
a)  E-waste, Plastic and Battery waste- The Bank 
facilitates the transportation of plastic waste to 
local vendors for processing and disposal. 
Ensuring the proper handling of E-Waste is crucial, 
both for security purposes and environmental 
considerations. Consequently, computers and 
associated accessories are delivered to vendors or 
certified disposal agencies. To track the quantity of 
battery waste collected, disposed of, and recycled, 
the Bank has implemented a reporting and 
monitoring system
b) Hazardous Waste - As a Banking Company, our 
operations do not involve the use of hazardous or 
toxic chemicals, and as a result, we do not generate 
any such waste.
c) Other waste - Given the nature of the Bank's 
business, other forms of waste are not applicable.

Details of environmental impact assessments of projects undertaken by the entity based on applicable 
laws, in the current financial year:  
 
Considering the nature of the Bank's operations, the requirement of conducting an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) as mandated by The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) does not 
apply to the Bank. Nevertheless, the Bank actively engages in environmental initiatives aligned with Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) assessments. The main objective revolves around the preservation of water bodies, 
revitalization of lakes, and recognition of their ecological consequences. These endeavours entail the desilting of 
ancient temples, lakes, and ponds to ensure optimal water levels, thereby benefiting rural areas. As a result, the 
Bank has effectively increased the groundwater table, providing significant advantages to local farmers. 
Additionally, they contribute to the restoration of heritage structures by clearing overgrown vegetation and 
undertaking desilting activities.
 
Moreover, it is important to note that the Bank is firmly committed to promoting sustainable practices and 
generating a positive societal impact. As part of our ongoing transparency initiatives, the Bank has extended 
financial assistance to Sastra University in Thanjavur for a research project titled "Green & Sustainable 
Environment." This project focuses on developing a prototype unit aimed at mitigating air pollution. Through our 
CSR endeavours, we aim to assess the progress achieved, the social and environmental impact made, and the 
efficacy of our endeavours in contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
In accordance with guidelines set forth by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bank has established a three-
tiered structure for addressing customer complaints. Typically, customers first approach their local branch to 
resolve any grievances they may have. If a complaint is within the authority of the branch manager, it is handled 
at the branch level. Any unresolved/unsatisfied cases are escalated to the Ombudsman seated at the 
Administrative Office for resolution. The Inspection Department at the Administrative Office follows up with 
branches and departments to ensure timely resolution and closure of complaints. Customers have an option to 
reach out to the Bank's Call Centre or Customer Care number to register their grievances.
Periodically branch level customer service committee meetings are held to collect direct feedback and 
suggestions from customers about various products. Actionable suggestions for service and product 
improvements are implemented. The Customer Service Committee of the Board is also conducted on a 
periodical basis to invite customer grievances and suggestions to improve the services.
To ensure effective management of customer complaints, the Bank has appointed a Principal Nodal Officer for 
Grievances, a Nodal Officer for Complaints. Additionally, an Internal Ombudsman as stated aforesaid has been 
appointed under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme.
