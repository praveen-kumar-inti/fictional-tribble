management and the promotion of circular 
economies. It is crucial to responsibly and

mainly for lighting and refrigeration. The 
constant operation of many retail locations

escalates 
energy 
demand. 
By 
improving operational energy efficiency and 
adopting diverse energy sources, companies 
can reduce their vulnerability to escalating 
energy expenses and minimize their indirect 
greenhouse gas emissions. Each business unit 
is accountable for recognizing, evaluating, and 
handling potential opportunities resulting 
from climate change.

electrical 
equipments

MEDPLUS HEALTH SERVICES LIMITED
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report (Contd.)
Governance, leadership and oversight
7. 	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements
	
At MedPlus, we are deeply committed to ensuring that our operations and practices are sustainable, inclusive, 
and responsible. We firmly believe that businesses must serve a purpose beyond profit, encompassing 
responsibilities to the environment and society. This belief is the foundation of our commitment to 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, which guide us in creating sustainable value for 
our stakeholders.
	
We are aware of the challenges our industry faces in terms of sustainability, particularly in relation to energy 
consumption, waste generation, and emissions. However, we see these challenges as opportunities to 
innovate, improve, and inspire change, not just within our organization, but across the industry and society 
at large.
	
To this end, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate our impact on the environment. A key initiative 
has been optimizing energy efficiency across our operations. We have commenced the conversion of our 
conventional lighting to LED alternatives, and continue to invest in highly energy-efficient equipment. We 
have also improved the management of our air conditioning systems to ensure they are turned off in areas 
not in use. These measures have already led to significant energy savings.
	
Our commitment to sustainability extends to our approach to waste management and reduction. We have 
established systems to responsibly collect, manage, and recycle waste, partnering with authorized agencies 
for this purpose. We have also taken steps to reduce plastic waste, with a shift to paper bags in our stores 
and reusable cloth bags at our warehouses. Our initiatives in waste reduction are making a positive impact.
	
Further, we have restructured our supply chain to be more efficient and localized. By sourcing goods from 
authorized local producers and strategically locating our warehouses, we have successfully minimized the 
distance goods need to be transported, thereby reducing fuel consumption and associated emissions.
	
As we continue our sustainable journey, we’ve engaged with stakeholders for material topic identification, 
initiated emission calculations, and embedded Environment, Health, and Safety Standards across the 
organization. Our commitment to the well-being of our workforce remains unwavering, with rigorous 
health and safety systems across our operations.
	
In the future, we aim to deepen our market penetration, expand omnichannel presence, increase private 
offerings, provide adjacent services to customers, and automate back-end operations. All these initiatives 
ensure our alignment with sustainability while delivering genuine medicines at better value to customers. 
Our recent investment in diagnostics further enhances our service spectrum, helping us build a strong 
foundation for sustainable development.
	
While we are proud of these accomplishments, we understand that there is still much work to be done. 
Sustainability is a journey, not a destination. We are steadfast in our commitment to continuously improving 
our practices, setting more ambitious targets, and leading the way in sustainable and responsible business.
	
Thank you for your continued support and trust in MedPlus as we journey towards a sustainable future.

At MedPlus, our continuous goal is to enhance energy efficiency, curtail waste, and minimize fuel consumption 
throughout our extensive network of retail outlets. We’re steadfast in our commitment to lessening our carbon 
footprint through various measures, including:
Optimizing Energy Efficiency: We have embarked on an initiative to replace conventional lighting with LED 
alternatives and to invest in equipment that is highly energy-efficient. Additionally, we are actively managing 
our air conditioning systems, specifically ensuring they are turned off in areas not in use.
We have strategically positioned our warehouses in major metropolitan areas. These decentralized facilities 
independently handle procurement and use public vehicles to service the stores in surrounding Tier 1 and Tier 
II cities or towns. This approach promotes reduced energy consumption by minimizing the distance goods 
need to be transported.
Waste Management and Reduction: We have implemented measures to collect, manage, and recycle waste 
responsibly, partnering with authorized agencies for this purpose. Our focus extends to the minimization of 
plastic waste as we use paper bags at our stores and reusable cloth bags at our warehouse facilities. Moreover, 
we dispose of pharmaceutical waste responsibly to keep emissions at bay.
Efficient and Localized Supply Chain: We source our goods from authorized local producers of FMCG and 
Pharmaceutical products. Our procurement strategy includes sourcing from seven strategic locations close to 
vendor points, which aids us in efficiently distributing products to our retail outlets. Our end-to-end supply 
chain, running from our central warehouse to the retail shops, has been streamlined to ensure maximum 
efficiency. This optimized system enables us to reduce fuel usage and resource wastage significantly.

Manner
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
The Company employs an effective system to accumulate and address all consumer complaints promptly. Our Complaint 
Management System (CMS) is a dedicated dashboard that funnels consumer complaints to our Customer Service 
Department (CSD). Based on the nature of the complaint, the CSD channels it to the appropriate departments. We adhere 
to specific turnaround timelines (TAT) for different types of complaints across various departments.
Issues relating to topics such as online exchange procedures and online delivery complaints are addressed by our 
Mart Operations Team. Customers can submit their grievances through phone calls or emails. Once a complaint ticket 
is generated in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, it becomes visible to both the customer and 
relevant employees within the department.
Moreover, our customer care team is also receptive to feedback from customers, which is essential to our constant 
improvement and ensures we uphold our commitment to excellent customer service.
