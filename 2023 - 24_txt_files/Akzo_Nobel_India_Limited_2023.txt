10. Health and safety management system:
a.Whether an occupational health and safety management system
has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No/ NA).
Yes
If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes. All manufacturing, offices and RD&I labs are certified for ISO14001
(Environment), ISO45001 (Health & Safety) Management system and ISO9001.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and
assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
We are committed to running our operations safely, by providing the equipment,
procedures and training to prevent injuries. We investigate injuries and safety
incidents and implement corrective actions to continuously improve our safety
performance.
Identifying work related hazards related to routine and non-routine
activities and taking corrective measures are key steps involved in hazard
elimination. AkzoNobel follows a structured approach which are detailed below:
i. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) for all the activities,
products and services
ii. Process Hazard Study (PHA) is performed by a team of
experts to identify hazard related to process and design.
iii. The chemical
compatibility study is performed to analyze the chemical interaction and the
risks identified to establish control measures.
iv. System based employee
engagement on hazard reporting & other leading indicators through Enablon
HSES suite as defined by Global HSES. The control measures are applied as per
the hierarchy of controls and engineering controls are most preferred while
Personal Protective Equipment are used as last line of defence.
In addition to the
above, we also perform specific risk assessments on process and people safety
such as below:
i. Static risk assessment is performed to identify the static
electricity hazards and control measures are adopted
ii. Fire Risk Assessment is
performed for identifying fire hazards and control measures established.
iii.
Ergonomic risk assessment is performed using AkzoNobel tool to identify
hazards related to manual material handling and control measures established.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work
related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks?
Yes
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services?

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and
healthy work place.
The health and well-being of our employees, customers, stakeholders, and communities is a
top priority. Our vision is to achieve zero injuries and harm through operational excellence.
We have management programs in place for people safety, health, process safety, and security
to ensure the highest standards. Our commitment to safety is supported by our Life-Saving
Rules and Golden Principle of stopping work in unsafe conditions or behavior.
During the
year, we continued our life-critical procedures and HSE&S roadmap program. We identified
areas that need improvement in our own operations and put them on a roadmap with targeted
plans and governance. We also continued to invest in functional excellence and the renewal of
our HSE&S capability framework. We continued the implementation of our lift truck/
pedestrian segregation program and Behaviour Based Safety (BBS), focusing on increased
quality through more coached observations and strengthening the capability in this area. We
launched company-wide monthly Safety Moments for safety awareness, which are used by
people managers in their team meetings to keep colleagues in all functions and levels of our
organization involved and aware of everyday safety hazards and safe behaviors. We
strengthened our Timeout for Gemba principles to encourage and engage people in daily
dialog, to learn and improve the context in which work happens and validate that capabilities,
systems and processes are in place. We continued our industrial hygiene and ergonomic
programs and actively managed occupational illness related absenteeism. Our annual Safety
Day is the moment for us to celebrate safety and reflect on how we are doing. The theme of
2023 Safety Day was “Make safety a habit today”. The theme encouraged colleagues to
reflect on their own behavior and become safety leaders by embedding good safety habits into
their daily routines – both at work and during private time. This theme further built on our
“Be human, Be safe” program, which took a human performance principles approach.

During 2023-24, we continued the deployment of our Basis of Safety standards,
with a focus on aluminium bonding and high-speed dispersers aligned with AkzoNobel global
safety drive. The standards define company expectations for these higher risk activities.
Various engineering standards have been adopted: for grounding and bonding; flexible hose
management; and maintenance of solvent storage tanks. Our locations continue to implement
equipment modifications via a risk-based approach. During 2023-24 we recorded 5 losses of
primary containment (‘LoPC’) (2022-23: Nil). The main causes identified were operational
discipline (60%) and asset integrity (32%). We continue to focus on these locations, ensuring
improvement plans to act on the underlying root causes.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the
processes for
identifying key
stakeholder groups of
the entity.
We have engaged with our stakeholders to understand areas of interest and material matters. Despite unprecedented times, we continued to
deliver on interests of stakeholders and engaged with them for this. Material matters are topics which influence an organisation’s ability to
create sustainable value not only for itself, but also for the stakeholders, over the short, medium and long term. These topics are mapped on
a matrix to show their relevance to ‘Influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions’ and ‘Significance of economic, environmental, and
social impacts’ to create a predictive model of value creation. Material matters are defined in line with ESG principles in line with the group
assessment. These material matters are identified, prioritised, and monitored as part of our operational, financial, and social activities and are
closely linked with our value creation process. These have been identified as High, Medium and Low per the chart below. These issues are
contextual and may have positive as well as adverse impacts.
High	Medium	Low
Innovating sustainable product(s)	Waste Management
Protection of Human Rights
Emission and Energy	Diversity & Inclusion	Community Involvement
Employee Health & Safety	Water

8. Mechanisms to
prevent adverse
consequences to the
complainant in
discrimination and
harassment cases.
Our whistle blower policy includes a global SpeakUp! mechanism that safeguards complainants from adverse consequences. The platform
allows anonymous reporting, ensuring confidentiality for the complainant. The investigating officer maintains the confidentiality of the
complainant, and the policy provides protection against any retaliatory action. In case of sexual harassment cases, the Company is
committed to providing an enabling working environment for its employees which is equitous, free of unlawful discrimination or
harassment. The Company has an Internal Complaints Committee (‘ICC’). The Presiding officer of the ICC is a senior female official
having experience as well as perspective on the course of action required in sexual harassment cases. The decision on the action to be taken
against the employee in a sexual harassment case is in consultation with the External ICC member. Overall, the ICC ensures that Principle
of Natural Justice is followed in the entire process and full confidentiality of complainant is maintained during and after resolution of
complaint.

identified several programs to help us achieve this: • Operational excellence that will apply energy
management to our daily operations and reduce our energy use in production, warehouses and
offices • Upgrading inefficient assets such as chillers, air compressors and furnaces to best-in-class
and improve HVAC systems for our buildings and Warehouses Our second key lever is maximizing
renewable electricity, with a priority to produce on-site with solar panels and with renewable
purchasing agreements. We also have a renewable electricity target of 50% for 2025 and 100% for
2030. We purchase Renewable Electricity Certificates or Guarantees of Origin and actively look for

management practices adopted
in your establishments.
Describe the strategy adopted
by your company to reduce
usage of hazardous and toxic
chemicals in your products
and processes and the
practices adopted to manage
such wastes.
Switching gears towards a circular economy means reducing waste and increasing circularity throughout our value chain. We’re
driven by 3R’s reduce, reuse, and recycle, while our products seek to protect and give longer life to surfaces and materials.
Reducing waste at source and increasing circularity we’re on a journey towards achieving 100% circular use of materials in our
own operations by 2030 which is in line with AkzoNobel global targets. To reach there, we’re focused on reducing the amount of
waste and increasing the circular use of materials. In 2023-24, we achieved circular use of materials for 80.4% of our obsolete
material and waste streams.
Product stewardship policy is followed to eliminate/ substitute/reduce toxic chemicals with specific
timelines to eliminate or reduce toxicity. Eg. increasing use of powder coatings/ low VOC products manufactured in liquid
coatings for industrial applications. The household products follow the same hierarchy of controls.
