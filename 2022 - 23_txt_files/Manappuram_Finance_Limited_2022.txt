As the Director responsible for the business responsibility report, I am pleased to highlight 
Manappuram Finance Limited’s (MAFIL) commitment to Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) principles and our achievements in these areas.  
At MAFIL, we recognize the importance of environmental sustainability and compliance 
with regulations. We have implemented energy-efficient lighting and air-conditioning 
systems, raising awareness among employees about energy conservation. 
Embracing technology has helped us reduce paper usage and emissions from travel, 
while improving operational efficiency. We prioritize the efficient use of materials and 
water resources, along with proper waste management practices. Notably, we have 
generated over 53,000 KWH of solar energy, powering our branches with clean and 
renewable energy. Additionally, our transition from diesel vehicles to electric vehicles 
demonstrates our commitment to reducing carbon emissions. We have also implemented 
wastewater treatment and rainwater harvesting systems to conserve water resources.  
Our focus on social responsibility revolves around our employees, customers, and 
the community. We prioritize upskilling and reskilling our workforce, providing them 
with training and resources to enhance their skills and expertise. Through our talent 
management strategy and the MADU online learning platform, we have provided 
extensive learning and development opportunities, fostering continuous growth and 
professional development. Embracing digital technologies empowers our employees, 
leading to increased productivity and streamlined processes. We are proud of our diverse 
and inclusive workplace culture, with the percentage of female employees increasing 
from 18.84% to 21.98% in the past year. Training programs on business policies and 
responsible practices ensure that our employees are well-versed and adhere to our 
responsible business principles. Employee welfare is paramount, and we strive to create 
a safe and inclusive work environment that values diversity and promotes engagement. 
When it comes to our customers, we aim to provide superior experiences through robust 
customer relationship management practices and the utilization of digital technologies. 
Our wide range of borrowing options cater to the diverse needs of our customers. 
Pioneering initiatives in online and doorstep gold lending have enhanced convenience 
and safety in transactions. During the challenging times of the pandemic, we remained 
committed to providing sustained lending support to our customers, understanding the 
crucial need for financial assistance.
In the community, we actively contribute to social welfare. Through our gold lending 
business, we empower women by providing them with financial opportunities that 
contribute to their families’ economic well-being. We support quality education and 
create learning environments that promote holistic development. Our initiatives extend 
to housing support for below poverty line (BPL) families and various community 
development projects. We are committed to improving healthcare access for marginalized 
sections of society and promote physical and mental well-being through initiatives such 
as MAcare Diagnostics. Additionally, we operate ambulances to facilitate preventive 
healthcare, emphasizing the importance of prompt emergency response.
Governance is a core aspect of our operations. We prioritize integrity, accountability, and 
oversight, fostering a culture of compliance. Our strong internal control mechanisms, 
overseen by an experienced and diversified Board with a majority of independent 
directors, promote transparency and accountability. Risk management is a key focus, 
and we proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks to safeguard our interests. 
Customer protection is integral to our practices, and we ensure fair and transparent 
dealings to enhance customer satisfaction and trust.
We are proud of the progress we have made in integrating ESG principles into our business 
operations. Our achievements in environmental sustainability, employee empowerment, 
customer satisfaction, and community development reflect our commitment to 
responsible business practices. As we move forward, we remain dedicated to continuous
