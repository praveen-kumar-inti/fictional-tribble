1
Emissions & 
Effluents
Risk
Construction is an energy-intensive 
activity and generates significant 
direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including carbon 
dioxide and methane from fuel 
use. Uncontrolled pollutants and 
emissions during operation and 
associated activities impose legal 
and Environmental risks for the 
Company.
The Company has taken measures 
to mitigate environmental impacts. It 
has implemented effective exhaust 
systems for its machinery and vehicles, 
conducting regular assessments to 
ensure efficiency. Additionally, sprinkler 
systems have been introduced along 
conveyors that transport aggregates 
within 
the 
crushers, 
aimed 
at 
minimising the release of airborne 
emissions. 
The 
organisation 
also 
carries out consistent monitoring of 
emissions to enhance its emission 
management strategies.

requires 
a 
significant 
reliance on natural resources, 
including 
electricity. 
Managing 
the energy consumption becomes 
essential.

and 
Procurement
Opportunity Companies 
are 
evaluated 
according 
to 
the 
resource 
consumption and carbon intensity 
of 
their 
real 
estate 
assets, 
their 
potential 
vulnerability 
to 
environmental construction rules, 
and their efforts to enhance the 
environmental 
performance 
of 
their real estate assets.
Positive
4
Climate 
change
Risk
Climate 
change 
is 
impacting 
almost 
all 
geographies 
and 
industries. It can pose physical 
risks such as floods, wildfires 
and can impact the structural 
integrity of infrastructure. It can 
also pose transitional risks such 
as compulsory use of renewable 
energy, change in regulations, etc.
Typically, our operational planning 
takes into account potential disruptions 
caused by weather and climatic 
variations, ensuring minimal impact 
on our activities. Given the potential 
risks 
posed 
by 
climate 
change, 
including unexpected rainfall, floods, 
and temperature fluctuations, we have 
integrated protective drainage systems 
into our work sites to prevent flooding. 
Moreover, we select materials like 
resilient bitumen that can withstand 
the challenges presented by climate 
fluctuations, thereby ensuring the 
durability of our completed projects. 
Our approach involves the careful 
implementation 
of 
suitable 
mix 
designs, demonstrating a cautious 
approach to address these climatic 
uncertainties effectively.

5
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Risk
Water is a critical resource required 
during construction, operation and 
maintenance. Water use for various 
business activities impacts the 
quality and quantity of local water 
resources. Improper discharge of 
water can result in contamination 
of water bodies. This may lead to 
a negative impact on operating 
costs and may impose a legal risk 
to the Company.
Preserving water is crucial for future 
generations. Water is also necessary 
in construction and maintenance. 
We regularly test water bodies near 
construction zones to ensure quality 
and safety. Sprinkler systems are 
utilised to manage water efficiently, 
optimising its usage in activities like 
compacting soil and reducing dust in 
plants, notably crushers and access 
roads. Water recycling innovations 
have been explored for curing in casting 
yards. Similarly, repurposed wastewater 
contributes to landscaping, gardening, 
and median and ROW plantations. 
Our commitment to sustainable water 
management is evident through these 
initiatives.
Negative
6
Waste 
Management
Opportunity The Circular Economy model of 
production 
and 
consumption 
promotes the reusing, refurbishing 
and recycling of existing materials 
and products. The transition to 
a circular economy will affect 
a 
change in 
building design 
and 
material 
usage. 
A 
shift 
in 
regulations 
and 
demand, 
combined with new technology, 
has the potential to reduce costs.
Positive
7
Biodiversity 
Protection & 
Conservation
Risk
Biodiversity 
protection 
and 
conservation includes monitoring 
the ecological impacts of our 
project areas before and after 
development to minimise negative 
impacts on the local ecosystem.
Before 
initiating 
any 
project 
development, the relevant Government 
Authority ensures proper forest and 
environmental clearances, preempting 
potential 
issues 
during 
project 
execution. We seek approvals for plant 
establishment and operation, diligently 
adhering 
to 
mitigation 
measures 
mandated by regulations. 
Continuous monitoring of soil, water, 
and air parameters guides us in 
implementing necessary mitigation 
actions if thresholds get exceeded.

Strategically positioned tall barricades

on plant premises to minimize pollution 
dissemination from plant operations.
To 
counterbalance

we plant multiple times the number 
of trees cut within roadways and 
explore tree transplantation wherever 
feasible, showcasing our dedication 
to 
biodiversity 
protection

9
Employee 
Well-
Being and 
Development
Risk
A higher employee retention rate 
reflects good company policies 
and practices that lead to higher 
employee satisfaction. However, 
a high attrition rate indicates 
low employee satisfaction. High 
attrition also increases the cost 
of replacing and training the 
employees, increases the risk of 
business getting impacted in case 
of critical roles and may reflect 
negatively on investors.
The 
management 
possesses 
the 
ability to identify individuals in need 
and provide them with training in 
relevant fields for potential deployment 
in projects. Adequate pathways for 
advancement are offered, allowing 
employees to progress in their roles. 
The 
Company’s 
employee-centric 
policies 
and 
supportive 
welfare 
initiatives ensure high retention rates. 
Effective mentoring across various 
levels significantly contributes to staff 
retention. The Company’s consistent 
financial stability can be attributed 
to the valuable contribution of a well-
maintained staff across all functions.

Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity Customer satisfaction is a key 
indicator of success. It gauges 
how effectively businesses are 
delivering products and services 
that meet or exceed customers’ 
expectations, 
providing 
insight 
into the overall performance of an 
organisation.
Positive
12
Product 
Quality
Risk
Companies in the infrastructure 
industry have a vital responsibility 
to safeguard their projects through 
the 
provision 
of 
engineering, 
design, architectural and other 
services. 
Only 
by 
ensuring 
compliance with safety standards 
can they demonstrate professional 
excellence 
and 
guarantee 
top-tier 
results. 
Poor 
design 
and construction of buildings 
or 
infrastructure 
can 
have 
devastating consequences- from 
loss of life, to decreased property 
value, to economic insecurity. 
Taking the time for proper planning 
is essential in order to prevent 
these disasters from occurring.
When it comes to structural 
integrity and safety, companies 
that don’t do well can face high 
costs for redesigning or repair, as 
well as legal liabilities and damage 
to their reputation, which could 
harm their growth prospects. 
As a consequence of climate 
change, 
companies 
in 
the 
construction and infrastructure 
industry must now consider how 
changing weather patterns could 
damage their projects – potentially 
endangering 
public 
safety. 
Compliance with the minimum 
codes and standards may not 
be enough to retain reputational 
value.
Over time, KNRCL has consistently 
employed 
comprehensive 
Quality 
Assurance (QA) and Quality Control 
(QC) protocols to ensure the durability 
and 
excellence 
of 
our 
executed 
projects, 
encompassing 
roads, 
structures, 
reservoir 
bunds, 
canal 
systems, and more. Our successful 
completion of Defect Liability Periods 
across all projects serves as evidence 
of our commitment to maintaining 
stringent quality standards during 
project execution. The monetisation of 
road assets executed under the Hybrid 
Annuity Model (HAM) further validates 
the assured quality embedded within 
our 
projects, 
offering 
a 
tangible 
assurance of the high standards we 
promise and deliver.

Human 
Rights and 
Labour 
Management
Risk
Construction is labour-intensive 
and has been the focus of human 
rights 
organisations 
for 
their 
labour management practices. The 
complexity of their workforce (size, 
labour intensity, and operational 
locations), 
management-labour 
interactions, the effectiveness of 
worker rights and the effectiveness 
of engagement with their workers 
is crucial for the Company
The 
Company 
adeptly 
manages 
its 
substantial 
workforce 
across 
diverse projects, strictly adhering to 
governmental regulations that ensure 
secure working environments, suitable 
residential provisions near sites, and 
equitable wages. Our commitment to 
labor management is underscored by 
deploying dedicated coordinators who 
address basic needs at all times. 
We prioritise human rights by promptly 
addressing deviations when observed 
to ensure the well-being and dignity of 
our workforce.
Negative
14
Community 
Engagement
Risk
Construction activities contribute 
to 
social 
and 
economic 
development. 
However, 
they 
can also create a risk for local 
communities and the environment. 
Activities such as clearing, grading, 
and using hazardous chemicals 
can negatively impact the local 
community. In some situations, 
environmental 
concerns 
and 
resistance 
from 
the 
local 
community can lead to project 
delays and, in the worst-case 
scenario, 
project 
cancellations. 
This can have a negative impact 
on the Company’s profitability and 
the opportunities it has for growth.
The Company strategically assigns 
a dedicated Manager to facilitate 
ongoing interaction with the local 
community, 
ensuring 
the 
smooth 
progression of projects. Recognising 
the 
significance 
of 
community 
engagement, the Company addresses 
grievances through Corporate Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
endeavors, 
including 
initiatives 
such 
as 
constructing village roads, facilitating 
drinking water access, and supporting 
self-help groups. The effectiveness 
of these efforts is amplified when the 
community comprehends the positive 
impact and benefits derived from asset 
development, be it roads, irrigation 
facilities, or urban assets. Encouraging 
community ownership and fostering 
identification with the development 
yields noteworthy results.
Negative
15
Compliance 
and Business 
Ethics
Risk
The key area relevant to business 
ethics is the management of 
issues such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, 
corrupt 
practices, 
money laundering, or anti-trust 
violations. Ethics violations can 
lead 
to 
police 
investigations, 
hefty fines, settlement costs, and 
damage to reputation.
The Company meticulously adheres to 
the internal financial control guidelines 
endorsed by the Board. The Company 
places 
utmost 
importance 
on 
compliance with a range of pertinent 
regulations, 
prioritising 
financial 
reporting accuracy and safeguarding 
data privacy throughout its business 
operations.

The 
Audit 
Committee 
oversees 
quarterly financial reporting authorised 
by the Board, disseminating crucial 
information to stakeholders, investors, 
and stock exchanges. 
Over the past 14 years, consistent 
dividends 
and 
a 
comprehensive 
risk 
mitigation 
policy 
underscore 
the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
compliance and business ethics. The 
accolade of top credit ratings from 
CRISIL and ICRA serve as evidence of 
KNRCL’s dedication to these principles.

Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are assessed based 
on their performance across all 
key governance issues, which 
include 
ownership 
& 
control, 
Board pay, accounting, business 
ethics, and tax transparency. This 
topic examines the effect that a 
company’s corporate governance 
and business ethics practices 
have on its shareholders and other 
investors.
The Board of Directors convenes 
regularly 
to 
oversee 
a 
spectrum 
of 
corporate 
governance 
matters 
encompassing 
accountability, 
transparency, 
ethical 
decision-
making, and more. An internal audit 
is conducted, with the resulting report 
submitted to the Board for assessment 
and confirmation of these aspects. 
This practice is well-received by 
shareholders and investors, signifying 
a commendable level of corporate 
governance reasonableness within the 
Company.

17
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Companies are assessed based on 
the amount of personal data they 
collect, their exposure to evolving 
or increasing privacy regulations, 
their vulnerability to potential data 
breaches, and their data protection 
systems.
The Company has implemented a 
robust strategy to safeguard data 
through stringent access controls, 
ensuring that only relevant staff 
members, depending on their roles, are 
authorised to add or report data.
This controlled approach limits access 
across various levels. Sharing data 
with third parties is strictly prohibited 
unless sanctioned by the designated 
officer, contingent upon demonstrated 
necessity. This framework guarantees 
data security and privacy, reinforcing 
the entity’s commitment to protecting 
sensitive information.

report, 
highlighting 
ESG 
related 
challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
Dear stakeholders,
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am delighted 
to present an overview of our ESG endeavors to our valued shareholders. 
Our steadfast commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles stands as the bedrock of our business philosophy.
Environment:
We have adopted effective exhaust mechanisms for machinery and vehicles, 
subject to rigorous periodic checks to ensure optimal performance. We’ve 
introduced sprinklers on conveyors to reduce air emissions from aggregate 
crushers, complemented by regular emissions monitoring. Our electricity 
consumption is balanced through captive sources like generators, while innovative 
water recycling techniques are applied in casting yards. Recycled wastewater is 
utilised for landscaping and plantation activities. We optimise waste materials 
generated from structures and pavements, utilising them in diversion roads and 
construction layers. Our emphasis on waste reduction, recycling, and efficient 
water use reflects our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Social:
Our social commitments include identifying and training individuals for project 
deployment, fostering opportunities for career progression, and maintaining 
high employee retention levels through supportive policies and welfare activities. 
Our dedication to mentoring contributes to staff retention and our consistent 
performance.
Governance:
Governance remains a cornerstone of our operations. Frequent Board meetings 
diligently monitor accountability, transparency, ethical decision-making, and 
business ethics. Internal audits reinforce our commitment to sound governance 
practices, enhancing shareholder and investor confidence in our approach.
In conclusion, our ESG initiatives encompass environmental sustainability, 
social empowerment, and robust governance practices. We are committed 
to addressing challenges, meeting targets, and fostering responsible growth, 
guided by our commitment to creating lasting value for all stakeholders.
We deeply appreciate your ongoing support and confidence in our organisation. 
Through collaborative efforts, we are poised to forge a brighter and more 
sustainable future together.
Sincerely,
K Jalandhar Reddy
(Executive Director)
