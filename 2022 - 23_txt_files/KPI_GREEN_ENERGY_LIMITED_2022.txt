7.	
Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the 
complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
	
The policy on prevention of Sexual Harassment, 
adopted by the Board, has the mechanism for 
addressing complaints pertaining to sexual harassment. 
All complaints related to sexual harassment are taken 
up by the Internal Complaint Committees (ICCs), which 
are governed under strict confidentiality and there are 
defined procedures to protect complainant from any 
retaliatory actions.
	
This commitment to addressing employee concerns is 
demonstrated through the implementation of a robust 
Grievance Redressal process, which facilitates prompt 
and effective investigations and resolutions. Additionally, 
the company has also adopted whistle blower policy 
for all employees of a company to report any illegal or 
unethical activities being carried out by anyone within 
the organization intentionally or unintentionally. These 
endeavors serve as the foundation for fostering a diverse 
and inclusive culture at the workplace, exemplifying 
the Company’s unwavering commitment to creating 
a supportive and equitable environment for all its 
employees.
8.	 Do human rights requirements form part of your 
business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)

rights. Further, the majority of our prominent vendors 
and customers, who significantly contribute to our 
business, are well-established corporations with
