12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
 
KIOCL has implemented an Occupational Health and Safety Management System in accordance with ISO 
45001:2018, reflecting its commitment to effectively managing the health and safety of employees and workers. 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place across various operational and maintenance activities. 
 
Regular toolbox talks and daily pep talks are conducted at work sites to reinforce safety practices. The premises 
are inspected weekly or fortnightly by safety department personnel, and any identified gaps are addressed on a 
priority basis. A Safety Committee, chaired by the CGM (I/c, Mangalore), meets once every three months. This 
committee includes representation from both management and workers, reviews safety deviations, and ensures 
timely corrective actions by the departments concerned. 
 
Safety performance is reviewed quarterly. External safety audits are conducted by authorized agencies in
