7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure). 
There has been a tremendous rise in the conscious investors in India and across the globe who are not only 
concerned with the financial disclosures but also the non-financial disclosures of the company. There is no Board 
Room where discussions around Environment, Social and Governance aspect is not discussed. At Max Life, we 
keenly take note of the developments occurring in the sphere of ESG and the best practices followed by the 
companies to advance the ESG framework. Last year India submitted five nectar elements, famously known as 
Panchamrit, to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change1. Max Life does not form part of energy 
intensive sector but recognizing the responsibility it owes to its environment and society, it made a commitment to 
reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by 2030. We have actively taken efforts for the tree plantation drive and 
awareness of financial literacy amongst communities. Further, to sustain a robust corporate governance structure, 
the emphasis is laid on the composition of directors including the right mix of executive, non-executive and 
independent directors, process to adhere proper and effective flow of information, maintaining diversity to enhance 
the effectiveness of Board. We encourage the culture to consider ESG as a way of doing business rather than 
looking it as a mere regulatory requirement. For this, we have conducted several healthy dialogues with employees 
especially the internal stakeholders and the Board to sensitize about the importance of ESG.  
The Company has charted four pillars of ESG: working ethically and sustainably, green operations, financial 
responsibility and care for people. These pillars guide the Company to take sustainable decisions for its functioning.

manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If Yes, provide details in the following 
format?  

For MLI:  
Providing life insurance is a primary business of the company. The customer life cycle in life insurance starts 
with origination or sourcing of policies, followed by underwriting and issuance of policies and thereafter, 
servicing of the policy based on customer needs and requirements and finally, by way of payment at the 
time of policy maturity or claim settlement. The following information is given in detail: 
Sourcing of insurance policies: 
FY2023 BRSR 
Page 17 | 52
Each channel and sourcing intermediary used to source insurance policies is expected to adhere closely to 
legal requirements and company rules. Individual licensed advisers, sales representatives, associated 
banks, financial organizations operating as brokers, and corporate agents are some of the sources for 
insurance policies. Additionally, customers can choose to acquire insurance coverage online through 
brokers, websites of partners, as well as web aggregators and digital platforms. Customers have the ability 
to select the sourcing and servicing framework in both physical and digital media based on their unique 
preferences or needs.   
Underwriting: 
The Company has a well-defined risk management process to determine the risk involved in insuring a 
particular life. Based on various demographic, financial and health parameters disclosed by the customer, 
the life insurance company first determines whether the life proposed to be insured poses an acceptable 
risk and, if so, it calculates a fair price for the coverage or demands further requirements like income 
documents, medical tests etc. to ascertain the quality of life of the individual seeking coverage. The 
underwriting process determines the eligibility based on the information provided, documents submitted and 
disclosures made during tele / video-underwriting or medical underwriting. Various checks and scrutiny is 
done to ensure the authenticity and genuineness of the disclosures made. The underwriting process at the 
Company is digitally enabled. The system supports the decision-making process based on logic built into 
the system itself. Adoption of technology has helped the Company scale and process insurance applications 
quicker. 
Post conclusion of underwriting and scrutiny of all relevant documents against the disclosures made, 
policies are issued as per the underwriting decision. The policy kit is made available to the customers in 
both electronic and physical format. The introduction of electronic insurance accounts where the insurance 
policy is stored digitally eliminates the need for printing and despatching of the physical policy document. 
The introduction of electronic insurance accounts where the insurance policy is stored digitally. 
Policy Servicing: 
The servicing stage involves a number of different transactions, such as renewing the contract by paying 
renewal premiums, financial transactions like switching funds in unit-linked products, or servicing requests 
from policyholders like address changes and nominee changes. Because a life insurance policy is a long-
term commitment, the Company makes an effort to stay in touch with customers throughout the duration of 
their policies and to meet their various needs as they arise. The Company offers complete digital solutions 
for policy servicing through its website, mobile app, or platforms of its partners and web-aggregators, in 
addition to the servicing options offered at the company's branches. 
Maturity, Surrender and Claims Settlement: 
An insurance policy may be closed upon maturity, upon surrender by the policyholder, or upon settlement 
of the claim in the event of the insured person's death, depending on the nature and design of the product 
and the terms and conditions of the policy. A policy of insurance could additionally come to an end under 
the circumstances outlined in the contract's terms and conditions. In the event of such closures, payment is 
made in accordance with the terms and conditions in place of contract termination. The policyholder, 
claimant, or nominee, as applicable, receives a communication detailing the payment. Life insurance 
companies pay out different types of claims depending on the policy and circumstances surrounding the 
insured's death. The most common types of claims paid by a life insurance company include: 
i) 
Death benefit: This is the most common type of claim paid by a life insurance company. When the 
insured person passes away, the life insurance company pays out a lump sum of money to the 
beneficiaries named in the policy. 
ii)  Accidental death benefit: This type of claim is paid if the insured person dies as a result of an accident. 
The amount paid out is usually a multiple of the policy's face value and is separate from the regular 
death benefit.  
FY2023 BRSR 
Page 18 | 52
iii) Terminal illness benefit: If the insured person is diagnosed with a terminal illness and is expected to 
pass away within a certain period, the life insurance company may pay out a portion of the death 
benefit early to help with medical expenses and other costs associated with the illness. 
iv) Critical illness benefit: Some life insurance policies include a critical illness benefit, which pays out a 
lump sum of money if the insured person is diagnosed with a specified critical illness such as cancer, 
heart attack, or stroke.  
Apart from these claim payouts in a life insurance policy there are also, maturity claims and surrender 
value claims: 
a)  Maturity Claim: When a life insurance policyholder completes the policy term, and the policy matures, 
they become eligible for a maturity claim. The maturity claim amount is paid only if the policyholder 
has paid all the premiums and has kept the policy in force until the end of the policy term. 
b)  Surrender Value Claim: If a policyholder wants to terminate the policy before the policy term ends, 
they can do so by surrendering the policy to the insurance company. In the event of such claims, 
payment as per the terms and conditions are made in lieu of termination of the contract. A 
communication with the details of the payment is sent to the policyholder or the claimant or the 
nominee as the case may be. 
As a company, Max Life promotes customers in engaging in Electronic Transfer of payments for the ease 
of convenience, security with speed and hassle free process to ensure high level customer engagement 
and satisfaction. A customer can intimate any of the claims by intimating the claims physically at the 
branches or through the distribution partner or on the website or mobile application. Post receipt of the 
requisite documents and after ascertaining the eligibility of the claim, the claim is processed and accordingly 
the amount is disbursed as per policy terms and conditions. 
Customer redressal is an essential part of any industry, including the life insurance industry. If a customer 
is facing any issues or grievances related to the policy, the first step is to register the complaint via 
contacting the call center over call or an e- mail or physically visiting the branch and registering the relevant 
complaint with the policy details. A robust mechanism is in place to ensure a correct and timely resolution 
is given to the customer via e mail communication to the customer. A dedicated and independent grievance 
management team is appointed which ensures that all customer grievances are addressed in a timely 
manner with appropriate resolution. The Company strictly adheres to regulatory guidelines in ensuring fair, 
efficient and timely resolution of customer complaints. The summary of grievances is reviewed by the 
Customer Service Team and Policyholders’ Protection Committee reported to the Board.

2. Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and / or 
services. 
 At Max Life, we believe that it is important that Indian consumers should be aware of the true purpose of 
life insurance. Various surveys by leading research agencies have indicated that, while the majority of 
Indians are aware of life insurance plans, ownership of term insurance is low, and consumers are not aware 
of the role life insurance can play in building a financially secure nation. Max Life led the industry initiative 
on insurance awareness. 
1. Campaign on the benefits of life insurance: Max Life is working diligently to drive importance of financial 
protection with life insurance amongst people through varied media that include mass media campaigns, 
social media, public relations, knowledge articles on online portals and Max Life’s website. We also 
drive insurance awareness through our proprietary researches India Protection Quotient & India 
Retirement Index Survey that we conduct at pre-defined intervals. 
2. Campaign focusing on protection of consumers: Fraudulent activities and spurious calling to defraud 
life insurance consumers are a reality that the life insurance industry is tackling through individual and 
joint efforts. Messages on protecting oneself from such acts are disseminated to our current 
policyholders by including such messages into the majority of customer communication. Similar 
information is also shared through SMS and articles with policyholders, along with social media 
campaigns on fraud awareness. 
3. Campaign for customers: We regularly share relevant details about life insurance through direct mail to 
our existing customer base. Every month, we observe super customer week with an emphasis on 
increasing customer awareness and engagement. By communicating with consumers digitally once a 
month via various emails and SMSs, these sessions have assisted our customers in learning more 
about the benefits of life insurance. 
3. Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption / discontinuation of essential services. 
 In case of any disruption / discontinuation of essential service: 
1. 
We inform our customers via email, WhatsApp and SMS communication. Content is either static or 
video based. 
2. 
Branch walk-in customers are informed by Max Life representatives. 
3. 
Advisors/agents are also sent electronic communication who in turn inform their customers and, 
information is also displayed on our website and through other social media assets.
