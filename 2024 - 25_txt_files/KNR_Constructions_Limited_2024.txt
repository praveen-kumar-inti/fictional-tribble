1
Emissions & 
Effluents
The construction sector is inherently 
energy-intensive, contributing 
significantly to both direct and 
indirect GHG emissions. Without 
adequate control, these emissions 
can lead to legal complications and 
environmental risks.
The Company has adopted measures 
to address environmental impacts, 
including the installation of efficient 
exhaust systems in machinery 
and vehicles, along with routine 
performance assessments. Sprinkler 
systems have been integrated along 
aggregate conveyors in crushers to 
control airborne pollutants. Emissions 
are regularly monitored to strengthen 
the overall emissions management 
framework.
2
Energy 
Management
Construction and real estate 
operations are highly dependent 
on electricity and other natural 
resources. Efficient management 
of this energy use is essential for 
reducing operational costs and 
environmental impact.
NA
3
Sustainable 
construction 
and 
Procurement
The environmental efficiency of real 
estate assets is under increasing 
scrutiny. Companies are expected 
to comply with environmental 
regulations and improve their 
sustainability credentials to stay 
competitive.
NA
4
Climate 
Change
Climate change introduces both 
physical (floods, extreme weather) 
and transitional (regulatory, energy 
shifts) risks. These can disrupt 
construction timelines and affect 
infrastructure integrity.
Operational plans are designed to 
anticipate and adapt to climate 
variability, minimising disruptions. 
Flood-preventive drainage systems 
are incorporated at work sites, and 
climate-resilient materials like high-
performance bitumen are selected to 
withstand extreme conditions. Tailored 
mix designs further enhance the 
resilience of infrastructure to climatic 
uncertainties.

5
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
Water is essential across various 
phases of construction. Overuse 
or improper discharge can deplete 
or pollute local water sources, 
triggering cost increases and legal 
repercussions.
Water bodies near construction sites 
are periodically tested to ensure safety. 
Sprinkler systems are deployed to 
optimise water use in soil compaction 
and dust suppression at crushers 
and access roads. Recycled water is 
used in curing processes at casting 
yards and for landscaping activities. 
These practises reflect the Company’s 
long-term commitment to sustainable 
water management.
6
Waste 
Management
Adopting a circular economy 
approach—reuse, recycle, refurbish—
can significantly lower material 
costs and reduce waste. It also 
prepares the business for evolving 
regulatory landscapes.
NA
7
Biodiversity 
Protection & 
Conservation
Infrastructure development can 
disrupt natural ecosystems. 
Pre- and post-project monitoring 
is essential to reduce negative 
environmental impacts and ensure 
compliance.
All projects are initiated post-
clearance from competent 
government authorities. Environmental 
compliance is maintained through 
mandated mitigation protocols 
and continuous monitoring of air, 
water, and soil. Tall barricades and 
plantations within project sites 
reduce pollution dispersion. To offset 
deforestation, multiple trees are 
planted for every tree removed, and 
transplantation is considered wherever 
feasible.
8
Circular 
Economy
Transitioning to circular economy 
principles promotes sustainable 
consumption, resource efficiency, 
and long-term cost savings.
NA
9
Employee 
Wellbeing 
and 
Development
Employee satisfaction leads to 
higher retention, while high attrition 
increases costs and risks. It may 
also negatively affect the Company’s 
reputation among stakeholders.
The Company identifies talent 
development needs and provides 
training aligned with project 
requirements. Clear career 
advancement paths, employee-
friendly policies, and supportive 
welfare programmes foster a stable 
workforce. Mentorship initiatives and 
financial stability have contributed to 
strong retention across functions.
10
Diversity and 
Inclusion
High diversity and inclusion levels 
enhance organisational culture, 
promote innovation, and strengthen 
brand reputation.

12
Product 
Quality
Poor construction quality can result 
in legal liability, rework costs, and 
reputational damage. It may also 
pose safety risks due to changing 
climatic conditions.
KNRCL enforces stringent QA/QC 
procedures throughout all projects, 
including roads, canal systems, and 
reservoir bunds. The successful 
completion of Defect Liability Periods 
and asset monetisation under the 
HAM model serve as indicators of 
sustained quality assurance and 
execution excellence.
13
Human 
Rights and 
Labour 
Management
A large, decentralised workforce 
requires robust systems to ensure 
fair labour practises, worker safety, 
and compliance with human rights 
regulations.
The Company manages its 
diverse workforce in line with 
government regulations—ensuring 
safe working environments, onsite 
accommodations, and fair wages. 
Dedicated coordinators are deployed 
at project locations to address 
workers’ basic needs, and deviations 
are swiftly addressed to uphold human 
rights standards.
14
Community 
Engagement
Construction can bring both 
development and disruption. Lack 
of community involvement may lead 
to resistance, delays, or even project 
cancellations.
A dedicated Manager is assigned 
to each project to maintain 
consistent communication with local 
communities. Through CSR initiatives 
like road construction, water access, 
and support for self-help groups, the 
Company fosters goodwill. When 
communities understand the benefits 
of infrastructure development, 
cooperation and long-term support 
significantly improve.
15
Compliance 
and Business 
Ethics
Ethics-related violations like 
fraud or corruption can lead to 
investigations, penalties, and 
reputational loss. Strong governance 
systems are essential to prevent 
such risks.
The Company rigorously follows 
internal financial control guidelines 
and ensures compliance with all 
regulatory requirements. The Audit 
Committee oversees quarterly 
reporting, promoting transparency and 
accountability. Strong credit ratings 
and consistent dividend distribution 
underscore KNRCL’s commitment to 
ethical business conduct.

Corporate 
Governance
Investors assess companies 
on their governance practises, 
which influence accountability, 
transparency, and long-term value 
creation.
The Board holds regular meetings to 
oversee governance practises, while 
internal audits support continuous 
evaluation. Audit findings are reviewed 
by the Board, signaling the Company’s 
commitment to integrity and 
responsible leadership.
17
Data Privacy 
and Security
Handling sensitive data involves risk 
of breaches, regulatory action, and 
reputational damage. Securing data 
is essential to protect stakeholders 
and business integrity.
The Company enforces strict data 
access controls, limiting information 
access based on roles. Third-party 
data sharing is prohibited unless 
specifically approved. These measures 
ensure robust data security and align 
with the Company’s commitment to 
privacy protection.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
As the director responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, I am pleased to present an overview of our ESG initiatives 
to our esteemed shareholders. Our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles forms the 
foundation of our business philosophy.
Environment: We have implemented effective exhaust mechanisms for machinery and vehicles, with regular checks to ensure 
optimal performance. Sprinklers on conveyors help reduce air emissions from aggregate crushers, supported by consistent 
emissions monitoring. Our electricity consumption is managed through captive sources like generators. We optimise waste 
materials from structures and pavements, using them in diversion roads and construction layers. Our focus on waste 
reduction, reusing, and efficient water use underscores our commitment to environmental sustainability.
Social: Our social initiatives include identifying and training individuals for project deployment, fostering career progression 
opportunities, and maintaining high employee retention through supportive policies and welfare activities. Our mentoring 
programmes contribute to staff retention and consistent performance.
Governance: Governance is a cornerstone of our operations. Frequent Board meetings ensure accountability, transparency, 
ethical decision-making, and adherence to business ethics. Internal audits reinforce our commitment to sound governance 
practises, enhancing shareholder and investor confidence.
In conclusion, our ESG initiatives encompass environmental sustainability, social empowerment, and robust governance 
practises. We are dedicated to addressing challenges, meeting targets, and fostering responsible growth, guided by our 
commitment to creating lasting value for all stakeholders. We appreciate your ongoing support and confidence in our 
organisation. Together, we are poised to build a brighter and more sustainable future.
Sincerely, 
K Jalandhar Reddy Executive Director

*During the previous FY 2023-24, projects situated in Kerala, periyasanti and Magadi were with the alignment passing along the 
existing road and work were in peak progress. Hence the generation of demolition and construction waste was high. For the FY 
2024-25, no such activities were required to be carried out and there is hardly any balance work left. The other projects are greenfield 
projects and construction and demolition waste doesn’t arise.
