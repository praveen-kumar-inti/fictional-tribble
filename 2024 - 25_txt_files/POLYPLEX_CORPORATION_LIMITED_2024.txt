1
Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change poses physical, 
transitional, and reputational risks 
across the entire value chain from raw 
material sourcing to operations and 
end-of-life of products. Increasing 
regulatory pressure, stakeholder 
expectations, and investor scrutiny 
demand proactive climate action, 
transparent disclosure, and value 
chain collaboration to mitigate Scope 
1, 2, and 3 emissions.
Polyplex addresses climate 
change across its value chain 
by sourcing more low-carbon 
raw materials and producing 
rPET film with post-consumer 
recycle content of upto 
100%. Within its operations, 
the company invests in 
biomass-based energy, 
energy-efficient systems, 
and renewable energy 
procurement while tracking 
emissions per GRI 305 and 
improving performance under 
ISO 50001. Water recycling 
further reduces impacts. 
Polyplex designs recyclable, 
mono-material, and low-
impact films, conducts LCAs, 
and supports customers with 
recycling and EPR initiatives. 
Climate risks are aligned into 
risk management

Waste 
Management 
& Circular 
Economy
Risk
Improper waste handling leads 
to environmental degradation, 
regulatory penalties, and brand risk. 
Circular economy practices are now 
demanded by global brands and 
regulators.
Polyplex practices 3Rs 
(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), 
reprocesses in-house 
PET/BOPP scrap, and 
manufactures Sarafil rPET 
films from 100% recycled 
content. Waste segregation, 
disposal via authorized PCB 
vendors, and collaboration 
with recyclers are in place.
Negative
3
Energy 
Efficiency
Risk
High energy intensity increases cost 
and carbon footprint. Regulatory 
mandates like ISO 50001 require 
improved efficiency. 
Polyplex has deployed VFD-
enabled blower systems, 
optimized pump speeds, 
and replaced inefficient air 
handling units. ISO 50001 
certified EMS guides energy-
saving actions across plants. 
Sites monitor specific energy 
consumption and report 
progress annually.
Negative
4
Water 
Resource 
Management
Risk
Water scarcity, uneven availability, 
and regulatory scrutiny make efficient 
water use a priority. Industrial zones 
face increasing pressure to reduce 
discharge and increase recycling.
Plants in India operate reuse 
treated water for landscaping 
and cooling towers and have 
replaced soft water with raw 
water in non-critical areas. 
Negative
5
Biodiversity 
Management
Risk
Operations near ecologically sensitive 
areas can disrupt habitats, leading to 
reputational and compliance risks. 
Biodiversity protection is increasingly 
embedded in global ESG frameworks 
(GRI 304).
Greenbelt development, 
afforestation, and buffer 
zones are created around 
plants. Wastewater is treated 
before discharge to avoid 
soil or water contamination. 
Biodiversity risks are 
assessed before expansion or 
land development projects.
Negative

Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Polyplex develops recyclable mono-
material structures, heavy-metal free 
BOPET, and solvent-free printable 
films. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) 
are conducted. Products comply with 
REACH, FDA, and EFSA guidelines. 
End-use sustainability is considered 
during product design.
Positive
7
R&D and 
Technological 
Innovation
Opportunity
R&D centers in India focus on rPET 
films, chemical recycling, and down-
gauging. The team collaborates with 
OEMs and customers to co-develop 
low-impact films. Polyplex aligns with 
SDGs 9, 12, 13 and MSCI metrics.
Positive
8
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Accidents or unsafe conditions lead to 
legal liabilities, productivity loss, and 
reputational damage. 
Polyplex has implemented 
ISO 45001 systems, safety 
audits, near-miss reporting, 
and emergency preparedness 
drills. Training and TRIR 
metrics are monitored and 
reported. Regular internal 
and external audits ensure 
ongoing compliance.

2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) b. If yes, what percentage of inputs 
were sourced sustainably?
	
Yes, the Company encourages sustainable sourcing through localization of raw material procurement, reuse of pallets 
& packaging materials, focus on bio sourced raw materials and continuous evaluation of alternative transportation 
arrangements. The intent is to source the Raw Material locally wherever it is available; imports are only in case of local 
unavailability – on an average about 92.73% is domestically sourced. The Company strives to work with the same raw 
material/service providers thereby setting an exemplary model, in terms of stakeholder engagement.
	
Our commitment to fostering trust-based relationships with our supply chain partners is paramount. By adhering to 
our code of conduct and engaging in regular dialogue to address any concerns, our partners contribute significantly to 
our mission. Together, we work towards a culture characterized by honesty, integrity, and accountability, ensuring that 
our business practices not only meet but exceed the ethical standards expected by our stakeholders.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
Polyplex recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship and strives to reduce waste through the usage of the 
3 R’s (Reuse, Reduce and Recycle). We minimize manufacturing waste through source reduction, reuse and recycling, 
and responsibly disposing of hazardous waste. Waste from direct materials, packaging materials and plant operations 
are the three categories of waste generated by our operations (hazardous and non-hazardous). Because PET in both film 
and resins is often recyclable, the polyester film manufacturing process has a minimal environmental impact. We have 
the required EIA approval for its Polyester resin line, and we provide periodical reports to the competent authorities 
as required by the Environmental Clearance (EC).
Categories of waste generation
Sub-categories
Steps to minimize waste
Waste from direct materials
Non-hazardous waste like polyester 
chip lumps, polyester film lumps, waste 
trimmings, contaminated films, and waste 
aluminum coated film.
We recycle and reuse 90% of our simple 
PET film waste and the remaining is sold to 
third-party contractors.
Waste from packaging materials Waste like wooden pallets, plastics, PVC 
cups, and paper cores as packaging material 
for both incoming material, as well as 
finished goods.
We re-use packaging material internally 
multiple times and the remaining is sold to 
third parties.
Waste from plant operations
Waste like sludge from ETP and tank 
bottom, oil and lubricants, scrap metal, 
batteries, chemical waste, and used drums.
Most of the waste is non-hazardous and 
sold to third parties. Hazardous waste is 
disposed to authorized vendors.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities
	
(Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. 
	
EPR is applicable to our activities. The registration as a Producer, as an Importer and Recycler has already been 
received. As a responsible manufacturer of Polymeric films, the Company abides by the obligations under the EPR plan.

the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
We place great emphasis on efficient waste management practices and are committed to ensuring that all types

‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’. Most of our industrial process waste is recycled inhouse.
	
Embracing a dynamic product design strategy, we place sustainability and circular economy principles at the forefront. 
Our focus on eco-friendly products, including recycled PET (rPET) films and mono-PET structures, exemplifies our 
dedication to sustainable innovation that minimizes environmental impact and enhances resource efficiency. We 
developed and optimized “chemical recycling” process for manufacturing Sarafil rPET.
	
Polyester film with post-consumer recycle content of upto 100% for packaging applications. The film has been made 
available commercially using postconsumer PET bottle flakes as input material. The rPET resin has properties same 
as that of virgin PET resin and the resultant PET film is compliant with regulatory requirements including EC and US 
FDA compliances.
