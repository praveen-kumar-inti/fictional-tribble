Risk
The Chemical industry faces strict 
regulation governing air emissions, 
water discharge, chemical safety, 
and process safety, among other 
issues. Anticipating and adapting 
to regulatory developments, both in 
the short and long term, is a critical 
issue for the industry, as regulatory 
developments can significantly affect 
product demand, manufacturing costs, 
and brand value.
In order to mitigate the risk attached to Current 
and emerging regulations, the organization 
has EHS representatives responsible for each 
facility for understanding and reporting on local 
regulatory activity and they are responsible for all 
air permitting, air quality reporting, understanding, 
water permitting, wastewater quality reporting and 
ensuring the facility is ready for any new regulations. 
Organization also is an active participant in local 
industries associations where information related 
to change in regulation is being shared with 
members. Further, we manages this risk through 
assessments of potential risks and backup plans 
to continue production in the cases of disruptions 
to raw material sources, manufacturing sites, and 
even the distribution process.

Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Employees in chemicals manufacturing 
facilities face health and safety risks 
from exposure to heavy machinery, 
harmful substances, high temperatures 
and pressure, and electrical hazards, 
among others. Creating an effective 
safety culture is critical to proactively 
mitigate safety impacts, which could 
result in financial consequences, 
including higher healthcare costs, 
litigation, and work disruption.
The organization being Chemical industry has 
already identified the risk associated with the 
same and thereby has strict policy and guidelines 
regulating health and safety of its employees. 
Safety is one of the five core values of our 
organization & hence gets top management focus. 
The organization endeavors to maintain a safe 
work environment and promote a culture of safety 
thereby minimizing safety-related expenses and 
potentially improve productivity. The company 
also provides insurance facility to its employees 
as a compensating measure in case of any health 
hazard.
Negative
3.
Climatic 
Effects
Risk
There are high chances of production/ 
operational activities getting affected 
in case of extreme weather events 
such as cyclones and floods, heatwave 
etc. The company, having vast area 
coverage of its operations has two 
such manufacturing locations in India. 
One is Mahad plant (prone to heavy 
rains) and other is Jhagadia plant 
(prone to Cyclone/ dry climate), apart 
from this we have dedicated third party 
manufactures in two other states of 
India.
Organization has invested in electrical and 
instrumentation (for flood protection) and other 
critical facilities. In order to prevent impact of such 
scenario, company has implemented proactive 
measures to tackle flood related emergency and 
climate conditions. Further, we have covered such 
instances in our insurance policy. In addition to 
this, we have kept our third-party manufacturers 
ready as backup in case of emergency. The entire 
emergency response team of the organization was 
trained on handling flood emergency by the local 
National Disaster Management team.
Negative
4
GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Chemical manufacturing generates 
direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions from the combustion 
of fossil fuels in manufacturing and 
cogeneration processes, as well as 
process emissions from the chemical 
transformation of feedstocks.
The organization with the legacy of responsible 
innovation, continues to develop ways in order to 
reduce emission. Since we proactively discloses its 
details related to emission via CDP and EcoVadis, 
it helps us innovate and better utilize our alternate 
means of energy which further helps us to reduce 
GHG emissions.
Negative
GHG 
Emissions
Opportunity Since the organization is ahead of the 
curve in researching reporting and 
reducing the fatal aspects of its emissions 
and effluents, it is able to better manage 
its hazardous waste and other waste with 
a visible positive impact on financial and 
non-financial aspects.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.72
	
The company focuses on sustainable technologies and best practices to improve its fuel & energy efficiency, human health and 
well-being and chemicals from sustainable sources.
	
The company has installed vapour absorption chillers (VAM’s) in 3 of its units which run on waste steam to produce chilled water 
whereby saving significant electricity & directly helps to reduce the GHG emissions. Additionally, new VAM proposal is under 
consideration for waste heat recovery from flue gases.
	
The company also has “fuel replacement project” under implementation on burning of Biomass by replacing Coal combustion 
which is underway and targets to be completed by 2030. The company is also installing solar panels at its Mahad unit to fulfil its 
Science Based Targets commitment for Net Zero by 2050. Currently the plan is to have 25% of its power requirement from solar 
power by 2025.
