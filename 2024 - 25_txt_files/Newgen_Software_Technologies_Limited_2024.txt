Majority of our offices are situated in multi-tenant buildings, where water treatment and discharge are the 
responsibility of the building management or developer.
	
To guarantee proper water management, we have put in place a Zero Liquid Discharge method in our Chennai 
office. Based on a batch process sewage treatment plant (STP), we run our own water treatment facility with a 12 
KLD (Kilo Litres per Day) capacity. This cutting-edge technique blends contemporary disinfection methods with 
conventional anaerobic digestion. Ozonation and filtration are used to disinfect the water once it has been cleared 
of biopollutants. As part of our sustainability initiatives, the treated water is being used for cleaning and gardening.
