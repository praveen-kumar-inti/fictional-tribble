1
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
If occupational health and safety 
practices 
within 
operations 
are 
not properly managed, they can 
expose employees to risks such as 
physical, ergonomic, respiratory, and 
fire incidents, ultimately resulting 
in 
decreased 
productivity 
and 
reputational damage.
Opportunity:
Lux management is firmly committed 
to the health and safety of its employees 
and workers. The Company’s safety 
practices encompass all possible 
measures to remove or, at the very 
least, reduce risks to the health, safety, 
and welfare of employees, workers, 
contractors, authorised visitors, and 
anyone else who may be affected by 
our operations. This commitment 
truly distinguishes us as a responsible 
player.
A commitment to consult and co-
operate with workers in all matters 
relating to health and safety in the 
workplace is practiced to ensure 100% 
safety of the workforce and security of 
female employees and workers.
Wearing 
personal 
protective 
equipment 
and 
clothing 
and 
complying 
with 
management’s 
directions for health and safety are 
inculcated in workers.
To ensure the health and safety of its 
employees and workers, the Company 
regularly conducts various initiatives 
such as health camps, eye care camps, 
First Aid and CPR training, audiometry 
check-ups, lung function tests, gut and 
liver health awareness sessions, BMD 
scans, breast cancer screenings, and 
fire safety drills etc.
Negative & Positive
2
Energy 
Efficiency
Opportunity
Managing energy consumption is an 
important focus area in the garment 
industry.
The Company uses energy-saving 
LED lighting systems across its plants. 
Legacy systems are replaced with 
energy-efficient advanced technology 
that consumes less energy.
NA
Positive
3
Climate 
Change & 
Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Greenhouse gas emissions contribute 
to global warming and climate 
change, which directly impact raw 
material prices and can lead to 
supply chain disruptions. Improper 
GHG management can damage a 
Company’s 
reputation, 
potentially 
resulting in reduced investments.
Opportunity:
Generating power from clean and 
renewable sources can contribute 
to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions and promote a cleaner 
environment.
The Company has established an 
emissions management strategy to 
accomplish its commitment to the 
environment.
The Company has expanded its solar 
capacity from 1 MW to 1.7 MW by new 
installations of 400 kW at Tiruppur 
office and facility and 300 kW at 
Avinashi facility, together meeting 
around 8% of the total electricity 
demand.
The Company is also exploring 
opportunities to enhance its capacity 
further.

Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The primary waste generated in the 
operations processes is cloth waste.
If this waste is not managed well, 
it may end up in landfills, causing 
negative environmental impact.
Opportunity:
Promoting responsible sourcing of 
raw materials, employing automated 
cutting processes, and implementing 
waste reduction measures by reusing 
the cloth material can help reduce the 
Company’s environmental impact.
The nature of the Company’s business 
model and its operations results in 
negligible hazardous waste, which is 
disposed of responsibly.
The Company reduces waste by 
optimising the cutting process using 
state-of-the-art technology. Further, 
95% of the leftover fabric cuttings are 
resold and ultimately recycled into 
new products.
Negative & Positive
5
Well-being of 
Employees
Opportunity
Commitment to employee well-being 
is a crucial aspect of the Company’s 
sustainability strategy. Valuing human 
capital through a comprehensive 
employee value proposition is critical 
for long-term business viability and 
sustainability. Employee well-being 
enhances the quality of work, thereby 
boosting productivity.
The Company prioritizes promoting 
a holistic experience for employees 
through training, skill-upgradation, 
and employee engagement programs. 
Additionally, financial management 
sessions are organized on aspects 
such as PF, tax awareness, etc. to 
enhance the financial knowledge of 
employees.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company’s fabric knitting and cutting processes generate minimal hazardous waste, which is disposed of responsibly in accordance 
with applicable statutory protocols. Lux minimizes cloth waste generation during these processes by implementing advanced 
technology and computerized cutting systems. This approach ensures that fabric waste is kept to a minimum. The waste generated, 
such as cloth cuttings made of natural yarn, is easily recyclable. Approximately 95% of this recyclable waste is sold to external recyclers 
for repurposing in other industries, supporting the Company’s commitment to a circular economy. Lux strives to minimize plastic in its 
packaging wherever possible, and any residual plastic is sold to authorized vendors. Other paper-based packaging materials are also 
recyclable and sold to responsible vendors.
