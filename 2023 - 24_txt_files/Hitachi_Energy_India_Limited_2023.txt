HSE aspects are incorporated into R&D through:
	
Eco Design: Eco Design, also referred to as Environmentally Conscious Design (ECD), aims to reduce a product’s environmental 
impact, while maintaining or improving its functionality of the product. Integration of environmental aspects as early as possible 
into the product design and development process offers flexibility to make changes and improvements to our products. This 
enables us to make effective decisions about environmental aspects that we control.
	
Safety in Design: Incorporating design solutions for identified hazards and reasonably foreseeable risks that may occur as 
the product is manufactured, transported, installed, serviced and disposed of. The Company’s designers also consider the 
behavior of design components in context of the product life span – for example, how often a component might fail during the 
product life and the potential impacts of such failures. Consideration is also given to post-life aspects through the elimination 
or minimization of exposure to toxic or environmentally damaging materials designed into the product.
	
HSE Checklist for the Company’s Gate Model: The HSE Checklist helps to identify key Health, Safety, Environmental 
(HSE) and Sustainability aspects in the Company’s product and technology development projects. R&D systematically and 
comprehensively identifies and assesses health, safety and environmental risks and opportunities.
	
Guideline for material selection: Environmental impact of a product is determined by the material and energy inputs 
and outputs generated at all stages of its life cycle: raw-​material acquisition, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. 
Material selection guidance on for energy conservation, pollution prevention, resource conservation, promotion of a safe work 
environment is provided to reduce impact of product on the environment.
	
Every year projects focusing on environmental improvements are identified in our operations as part of their environment 
management program and budget allocated.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 	 details.
	
The main sources of the Company’s direct (Scope 1) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are the fuels used in our operations, 
such as natural gas usage and SF6 losses during production processes and gas handling on site. Indirect (Scope 2) GHG 
emissions from purchased electricity. The Company recognizes the need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5C above 
pre-industrial levels, in order to avoid the worst affects of climate change. As such, our ambition is to become carbon neutral in 
our own operations by 2030 and achieve Net Zero across the entire value chain by 2050. To achieve this, we have implemented 
several projects and initiatives which include: Solar roof top installations at Maneja where 932 kW is installed of which 292 kW 
is operational and Doddaballapur where 600 kW is installed. The installed capacity would meet 20-30% of total electricity 
requirement in each of the facilities. Mysuru facility has Power Purchase Agreements which caters to nearly 90% of its electricity 
requirement. The remaining GHG from grid electricity is covered by purchasing International Renewable Energy Certificates 
(I-REC). Going forward we will move away from purchasing I-REC to more direct, and potentially more value adding methods 
such as green tariffs, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and own generation.
	
At project site, solar roof top installations are used to power offices at Adani HVDC project and 6 GPQS sites totaling 47.7 kW 
capacity. 6 sets solar based mobile charging facility with 3 lights and 2 USB installed in rest sheds and worker colony and 7 CNG 
vehicles are used at HVDC site.
	
Energy conservation activities include replacing conventional lamps with LED, installation of solar lights, electrical retrofits such 
as replacement of old drives and compressors with energy efficient equipment; process improvements such as optimizing 
operations of HVAC and AHUs and thermal insulation of hotlines to prevent heat loss. At Maneja, energy monitoring systems 
were installed to monitor energy consumption patterns and take appropriate actions. 7 nos. of HT/LT substations and 53 energy 
meters are connected to the monitoring system. At Halol and Maneja, LPG was replaced by low carbon PNG while Mysuru uses 
biofuel such as paddy husk and waste dust from own operations to fuel its boilers. Replacing old R22 based HVAC systems to 
high COP R410A at Maneja has also resulted in reduction in GHG emissions.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 	
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Managing waste from its own operations has been the Company’s priority and has been continuously improved through the 
Company management system standard for waste management. We strive to always 1) reduce waste generated 2) reuse what 
we can, and 3) recycle all possible waste generated. We work continuously to move waste upwards in the waste hierarchy and, 
finally, eliminate it. At a company level, we implement the 5Rs, where ‘rethink’ and ‘repair’ are included, mostly relating to the 
way we deliver value to customers.
	
Integration of sustainability considerations in Research & Development (R&D) gate models to ensure that Health, Safety, and 
Environment are considered and understood when assessing R&D projects. Environmentally Conscious Design (ECD) reduces 
a product’s environmental impact, while maintaining or improving its functionality. Integration of environmental aspects as 
early as possible into the product design and development process enables organizations to make effective decisions about 
environmental aspects that they control.
92
	
Reducing generation of waste and reducing the wastes that is sent to landfill or for incineration remains the Company’s focal 
area. Waste reduction is incorporated in the product design stage to ensure waste minimization in manufacturing process. 
Source segregation of waste, in-house recycling of packaging materials and reuse continues to add more value to waste and 
reduces the quantum of non-recyclable wastes that are sent to landfill. All wastes are sent to relevant Pollution Control Board 
(PCB) authorized recyclers.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web-link.
	
Yes, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is part of the Company’s organizational resilience program. It is designed to reduce the 
impact of a business interruption which could occur due to a range of events ranging from financial, natural causes or man-made 
events. It helps Business Unit/Function to respond effectively to the disruption and restore its essential services and mission 
critical processes as quickly as possible to ensure timely recovery. It provides a reference tool for the actions required during 
or immediately following an emergency or incident that threatens to disrupt Business Unit/Function normal business activities.
	
The key objectives of this business continuity plan are to:
	
•	
Identify advanced preparations and procedures that will enable Business Unit/Function to respond quickly to disruptive 
incidents and ensure continuity of critical business functions.
	
•	
Reduce employee injury or loss of life, and minimize damage and losses.
	
•	
Have documented plans and procedures to ensure effective execution of recovery strategies for critical business functions.
	
•	
Reduce and mitigate disruptions to business operations.
	
•	
Identify teams which would need to respond to incidents and define specific responsibilities.
	
•	
Quantify the impact of incidents in terms of monetary, time, operations, and work force.
	
•	
Recover quickly from an emergency and resume full operations.
	
The various steps are:
	
Key Business Processes & Recovery Priorities
	
List all the key processes and sub processes of that must be maintained or quickly restored in the event of a disruptive incident. 
It provides a high-level description for each of the process and assigns a priority (criticality) ranking to each of them.
	
Risk assessment
	
Risk assessment is one of the main parts of the BCM system. The RA process involves identification, analysis, and evaluation of 
all possible risks, hazards, and threats to the operating environment, and defines likelihood/impact of disruptive events caused 
by such threats.
	
Once the risks have been identified, their impact on different aspects of operations are gauged. Those risks which affect mission-
critical operations should be handled first. The following strategy is used to handle risks:
	
•	
Prevent – Risks which are of high probability with high impact. These risks must be attended first by using mitigation, 
prevention or any other strategy to lessen or avoid its impact.
	
•	
Accept – Risks which have low probability and low impact. Nothing specific needs to be done for such risks, but the 
organization should be vigilant. If a back-up strategy is put in place for such a risk, all the better
	
•	
Contain – Risks which have a high probability of occurring but having low impact on operations. Use mitigation strategies 
to minimize impact of the risk on business operations.
	
•	
Plan – Low probability but high impact events. Though this may be once in a lifetime event, its impact could be disastrous. 
The business should plan the steps to be taken if such a risk occurs. Once the steps to be taken are in place, production 
can be resumed in the shortest possible time with the least loss.
	
Business Impact Analysis
	
The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies and prioritizes the mission-critical business processes and key functions, disruption 
related operational impacts, and the resources (internal and external) required to recover critical operations.
96
	
A properly executed BIA will guide in reducing the overall operational and financial impacts, reduce potential losses, and enhance 
the business operations.
	
Business Continuity Strategy
	
Business Continuity Plan describes the strategy devised to maintain business continuity in the event of a disruption to operations. 
This strategy will be invoked when the primary facility(ies) somehow be damaged or inaccessible, and business critical operations 
are interrupted.
	
Recovery priorities
	
The strategy is to recover critical business functions at an alternate site location (if an off-site strategy has been put into effect 
to provide recovery service). Critical business functions are the most critical for immediate recovery at the secondary location.
8.
