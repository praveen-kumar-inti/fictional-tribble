1
Energy 
Management 
& Transition
Risk
Autoline has 6 plants across 
the country, with one additional 
plant starting operations from 
the current financial year. Energy 
being a major cost item, escalation 
in energy prices is a risk. Cost of 
electricity and energy breakdown 
pose risks for the Company. We are 
actively seeking ways to become 
more energy efficient, keeping this 
expansion in picture.
We are working on 
proposals to desrisk 
our energy cost through 
investments into Solar 
power projects. The power 
from these will reduce our 
overall energy costs. This 
initiative aims to mitigate 
the environmental impact 
and ensure a more 
sustainable and reliable 
energy solution.
Positive: Adopting clean energy 
instead of grid to an extent will 
help to reduce our Expenses 
towards power.
2
GHG 
emissions
Opportunity
With the evolving nature of the 
automobile industry, it is imperative 
that we work on programs to reduce 
our overall carbon footprint. Our 
operations inherantly result in a 
lower direct emissions impact, while 
a significant chunk of our emissions 
is attributable to our value chain.
We aim to restrict the 
emissions by tracking 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon 
emissions from this year.
Positive: Ensure lesser 
consumption of fuel by keeping 
emissions under check.

Financial implication of the risk 
or opportunity (indicate positive

3
Waste 
management
Opportunity
Most of the waste generated at our 
plants is some form of metal waste, 
which is sold and as scrap and 
recycled or re-used further. 
Our target is to achieve 
a lower rate of waste 
generation, by optimizing 
the usage of material.
Positive: We are engaging 
actively in cost-saving by 
reducing the waste generated 
to the minimum.
4
Employee 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
It becomes critical due to the 
nature of work on our shop floor, 
that the employees and workers 
are safeguarded from injuries at all 
times.
We plan to adopt a strict 
approach, with zero 
tolerance towards safety 
breaches. To train the 
employees, we have 
introduced ‘Gurukul’ in 
our premise, wherein they 
undergo regular safety 
training. To ensure the 
health and well-being of 
employees, Autoline has 
also implemented annual 
checkups and counseling 
sessions. In compliance 
with the Factories Act, a 
doctor is provided at the 
factory, and group health 
insurance is also covered.
Negative: Impact on the 
brand name and morale of the 
employees and workers.
5
Product 
Life cycle 
management 
Risk
The Company is adding new product 
lines to cater to specific customer 
needs. Unless the products that 
are developed are in line with the 
requirements of the customers, there 
stands a risk of non-acceptance of 
the products.
We plan to commence 
development of products 
only after a thorough R&D.
Negative: Intensive initial 
investment in developing a 
product.
6
Supply chain 
sustainability 
and reporting 
Risk
There is a risk of vendors not 
complying with relevant laws and 
regulations applicable to them.
We have a robust quality 
control mechanism and 
vendor onboarding in 
place, in which we seek 
to include the vendors’ 
compliances as well.
Negative: Enabling smooth 
operations of the Company.
7
Business 
Ethics 
Opportunity
The Company has no history of 
any irregularities in matters like 
bribery, corruption, defrauding, 
money laundering and such. Ethical 
practices will contribute to the 
sustainability of the Company, 
ensuring the Company's long-term 
success. 
We have commenced 
tracking the indicators 
on business ethics, on a 
quarterly basis. 
Positive: The risks of legal 
liabilities or reputational 
damage are minimal due to the 
ethical business practices we 
adopt.

8
Risk 
Management 
Opportunity
We are cognizant of risks that 
are inherent to our organization. 
Operational risks like safety 
concerns and energy management, 
as well as compliance and financial 
risks have been considered here. A 
key aspect of our risk management 
over the years has been to 
understand the major risks and to 
build a mechanism to mitigate them.
We have been proactively 
identifying and mitigating 
risks. The mitigation 
measures we are adopting 
or planning to adopt have 
been highlighted against 
each identified risk in this 
section.
Positive: By promptly identifying 
and addressing potential risks, 
we safeguard our financial 
stability and enhance our 
credibility.
9
Data Privacy 
Risk
Robust data privacy policies and 
procedures demonstrate good 
governance. Our data privacy 
policies reflect our transparency, 
accountability, and ethical conduct. 
However, the Company is handling 
sensitive information of our 
customers, mishandling of which 
poses a risk.
At Autoline, there are 
mechanisms in place to 
minimize data breaches. 
Our comprehensive 
IT security framework 
incorporates strong 
firewalls, restricted access 
mechanisms, and other 
safeguards to protect 
against data breaches.
Negative: The financial 
consequences of data breaches 
at operational or financial levels 
can be substantial. Having 
optimum checks in place helps 
us avoid that cost.
10
Human rights 
and Labour 
practices 
Risk
The automotive parts industry has 
operations which inherently involve 
potential risks to Human Rights. 
Identifying and assessing human 
rights risks throughout the supply 
chain is crucial.
We seek to:
 - Ensure compliance with 
labor laws, including 
wages, working hours, 
and safety conditions.
 - Implement measures 
to prevent and address 
forced labour and child 
labour, across the supply 
chain.
 - Creating inclusive 
workplaces free from 
discrimination.
Negative: Human rights 
violations can severely damage 
a Company’s credibility and 
lead to financial penalties. In 
extreme cases, these violations 
can result in significant business 
losses.
11
Water 
management 
Opportunity
At Autoline plants, water 
consumption is restricted to a 
minimal, owing to the nature of our 
business. 
While our industrial 
processes minimize 
water consumption, we're 
committed to overall 
water efficiency. We're 
implementing water-
saving practices in our 
offices and exploring water 
reuse options within our 
facilities.
Positive: Limited consumption 
of water minimizes wastewater 
generation, reducing the risk of 
penalties regarding wastewater 
disposal regulations.

Stakeholder input is essential for recognizing and addressing environmental and social concerns. Their perspectives 
are instrumental in determining and setting goals for Autoline’s ESG initiatives. In line with this, we undertook an 
extensive materiality assessment this year, which included detailed interactions with internal as well as external 
stakeholders. We engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, such as employees, workers, customers, vendors, 
shareholders, and the Board, to understand the areas of greatest importance to them and our organization, from an 
environmental and social perspective.
