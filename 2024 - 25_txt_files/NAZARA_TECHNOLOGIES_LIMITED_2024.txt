Governance, leadership and oversight

Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG-related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding 
the placement of this disclosure) :-
Nazara Technologies, as a prominent name in the gaming and sports media space, 
remains deeply committed to embedding responsibility and sustainability into every 
aspect of our operations. Our approach continues to be guided by Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) priorities, ensuring that growth is aligned with accountability. We 
continue to explore and adopt measures that minimise our environmental impact, with a 
focus on resource efficiency, responsible waste management, and sustainable practices 
wherever possible.
At the heart of our ESG journey is our belief that long-term success is inseparable from the 
well-being of people and communities. We emphasise trust, inclusivity, ethical conduct, 
and equal opportunity as central values that shape the way we operate. Our ambition is 
not only to deliver engaging gaming experiences but also to contribute positively to the 
ecosystem in which we function.
Engagement with our stakeholders forms a crucial pillar of our strategy. We maintain 
active dialogue with investors, regulators, employees, and customers to ensure that their 
perspectives are reflected in our decision-making. By listening closely to their evolving 
expectations, we are better placed to design policies, strengthen governance, and 
identify new areas of responsibility that align with global sustainability standards.
Technology is at the core of Nazara’s identity, and we recognise its dual role in driving both 
opportunities and risks. As we expand our platforms, we are placing greater emphasis on 
building secure digital environments, safeguarding user data, and adopting responsible 
practices in game design. We believe that innovation must be paired with accountability 
to create safe, inclusive, and engaging experiences for our diverse audience.
Looking ahead, Nazara Technologies reaffirms its dedication to advancing sustainability 
and responsible business conduct. We will continue to pursue our ESG commitments 
with focus and resilience, ensuring our actions generate value not only for the Company 
but also for the wider community and the environment.
