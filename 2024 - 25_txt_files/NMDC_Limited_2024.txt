Details of improvements in environmental and social impacts 
In our ongoing research projects at the R&D Centre, we are actively 
engaged in the process of developing cold bonded pellets and 
developing a dry process for upgradation of silicious low grade blue 
dust. 
Blue dust is a type of iron ore that is very fine and rich in iron oxide 
but often contains impurities like silica, making it low-grade and 
less suitable for direct iron production. To enhance its usability, cold 
bonded pelletization and dry upgradation processes are employed. 
Cold bonded pelletization aims to agglomerate fine iron particles 
into larger pellets without high-temperature sintering by mixing the 
ore with binders such as cement, forming pellets, and allowing them 
to harden at room temperature. This method saves energy, offers 
binder flexibility, and produces strong pellets. The dry upgradation 
process targets the removal of impurities without water, involving the 
crushing and grinding of the ore, magnetic separation to differentiate 
iron from non-magnetic materials, and air classification by size. This 
approach conserves water, reduces environmental impact, and is 
cost-effective, thereby making low-grade iron ore more usable and 
eco-friendlier, benefiting the iron and steel industry. 
To enhance the environmental and social outcomes of its mining 
operations, NMDC consistently invests in cutting-edge technology. A 
notable example of this commitment is the adoption of slurry pipeline 
transport for iron ore fines. Here are the key points: 
To supplement its existing K-K Railway line for transporting iron ore 
lumps and fines from its Bailadila mines to Vizag, NMDC has adopted 
slurry pipeline transport. This innovative approach converts iron ore 
fines into a concentrate slurry. At the terminal stations, the slurry 
undergoes filtration to produce pellet feed concentrate, a key material 
then converted into pellets for the iron and steel industry.

Details of improvements in environmental and social impacts 
The adoption of slurry pipeline transport reflects an alignment with 
industry best practices, capitalizing on the advantages of using iron 
ore fines in pellet form. This method offers considerable environmental 
and operational benefits compared to rail transport. The underground 
pipeline significantly reduces land disturbance, enabling the 
continuation of existing activities on the surface. Moreover, the 
process efficiently handles low-grade slimes, thereby reducing 
ore wastage. Unlike weather-dependent rail, the pipeline ensures 
uninterrupted operation, even in adverse conditions. This solution is 
particularly valuable for accessing and transporting ore from remote 
regions where traditional rail infrastructure is not feasible 
In the first phase, NMDC has taken up the laying of 135 kms of slurry 
pipeline from Bailadila to Nagarnar. About 107 km of slurry pipeline 
has been laid as on 31/03/2025. 
2. 
a. 
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
Yes. In the realm of sustainable sourcing, NMDC expects all its suppliers must adhere to the highest human rights 
standards. This means treating all workers and contractors with dignity and respect, providing humane working conditions, 
and actively preventing discrimination and harassment. Crucially, it entails guaranteeing no breaches of human rights, 
specifically prohibiting forced and child labor, while also championing freedom of association and supporting collective 
bargaining rights 
b. 
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?

NMDC has a Board-approved Whistle Blower Policy to safeguard employees from victimization when reporting discrimination or 
harassment. As per Department of Public Enterprise (DPE) guidelines, the Audit Committee, formed by the Board of Directors, 
reviews the effectiveness of the Whistle Blower Mechanism. 
Strict confidentiality is maintained, ensuring that whistleblowers are protected from any form of retaliation. Employees assisting in 
investigations receive the same level of protection. Vigilance complaints filed with the Vigilance Department keep complainants' 
identities strictly confidential. If an employee lodges a harassment complaint against a superior, their identity is protected, and if 
necessary, transfers may be arranged for the complainant's safety. 
To address workplace concerns: 
• 
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC): Established at all Units/Projects under the POSH Act, 2013, ensuring protection 
against sexual harassment and discrimination for women employees. 
• 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism: Led by a Grievance Redressal Officer at all Units/Projects to handle workplace grievances 
related to harassment or discrimination. 
• 
SC/ST Welfare Associations: Formed across all Units/Projects to promote welfare and prevent discrimination against SC/ST 
category employees. 
NMDC remains committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace for all employees.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation 
Dry screening operations are currently underway at the iron ore mining complexes of Donimalai and Kirandul, as well as Deposit-
10/11A of the Bacheli complex, with no discharge from the screening plants during this phase. However, wet screening takes 
place at Deposit-S's Screening Plant in the Bacheli complex during the monsoon season, lasting 80 to 90 days. 
For tailings management, after the ore beneficiation process, tailings from the thickener are deposited into the Tailing Dam 
for settling, after which clear water is discharged through a decanting pipe and reused for dust suppression and gardening. 
Additionally, at the Panna Diamond Mining Project, a Tailing Dam has been built to settle kimberlite tailings, with the clear water 
recirculated into the processing plant via the RPH. 
To prevent suspended solids from entering natural streams during the monsoon, check dams have been strategically constructed 
along various nalla courses. Moreover, ETPs and STPs are established across all mining complexes. NMDC maintains a 
zero liquid discharge policy, ensuring no water seepage occurs anywhere in the project area, reinforcing its commitment to 
environmental safeguards in mining operations.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes. 
NMDC is committed to minimizing waste in its iron ore mining process, with low-grade iron ore stored in subgrade stockpiles. As 
part of its sustainability efforts, NMDC is actively implementing the 3R strategy by exploring technological solutions to enhance 
the utilization of low-grade iron. Measures are being undertaken to reduce waste generation and reuse by-products, with ore 
blending serving as a key resource conservation strategy. Blending low-grade ore has shown encouraging potential. 
A significant portion of mining waste consists of solid rocks, known as overburden, which is disposed of in designated waste 
dumps at each site, a common industry practice. To reinforce and stabilize these dumps, NMDC employs Garland drains, Toe 
walls, and Geo-coir matting. 
Hazardous waste from mining operations includes waste oil, used lubricants, and grease-soaked cotton cloths used for cleaning 
HEMMs. In line with the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, NMDC disposes of 
such waste through authorized vendor auctions. Additionally, the company has installed a 1 0KLD biomedical waste incinerator at 
its Bacheli complex and has established organic waste converters across its project sites.

Statutory Reports 
3. 
With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators above, provide details 
of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention and remediation 
activities. 
The Diamond Mining Project in Panna is located near the Panna Tiger Reserve within the Gangau Wildlife Sanctuary, where 
mining operations take place in a single vertical pit with working benches reaching 120 meters deep. Controlled blasting and 
bottom initiation techniques are employed to minimize vibration and noise levels, while environmental quality parameters: 
water, air, and noise are routinely monitored and well-maintained. A monitoring committee appointed by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court periodically reviews the workings of the project and suggests remedial measures which are implemented diligently 
by the NMDC team. 
Indirectly, mining activities contribute to air pollution (dust), water pollution (sedimentation), noise pollution, and alterations in local 
hydrology. NMDC counters these by employing robust dust suppression techniques (water sprinkling, greenbelts), constructing 
check dams and garland drain for sediment control, striving for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) to prevent water contamination, 
and using quieter machinery with controlled blasting to reduce noise disturbance. These efforts reflect a holistic approach to 
environmental stewardship, balancing mineral extraction with stringent ecological protection and a commitment to long-term 
sustainability.

with summary) 
Slurry Pipeline 
Project 
Rooftop Solar PV 
cells 
Green Belt 
Development 
Check Dams and 
garland drains 
NMDC operates six iron ore deposits in the Bailadila Sector of 
Chhattisgarh. To enhance iron ore evacuation, NMDC has taken up 
construction of slurry pipeline from Bailadila to Nagarnar at an estimated 
cost of 800 crores. Currently, most iron ore production from Bailadila 
relies on the KK Railway line, which has limitations for transporting over 30 
million metric tons per annum (MPTA). To reduce dependence on railways, 
NMDC adopted an alternative mode of evacuation-transporting iron 
ore fines in slurry form through the Slurry Pipeline Project. This approach 
also utilizes iron ore slimes by converting them into iron ore concentrate. 
The pipeline is laid underground, allowing existing activities to resume 
after completion. The project benefits the local population by creating 
employment opportunities. In the first phase, NMDC is laying 135 km slurry 
pipeline from Bailadila to Nagarnar. As on March 31, 2025, laying of about 
107 km is complete. 
NMDC's projects as well as HO use rooftop solar PV cells as a part of their 
energy consumption. 
NMDC has proactively developed green spaces by planting trees in and 
around its operational zone. This initiative involved community consensus 
and guidance from district forest officers. 
NMDC has made considerable efforts to strategically manage sediments, 
control red water discharge, and mitigate soil erosion by constructing 27 
check dams and garland drains. 
Outcome of the 
initiative 
To reduce the dust 
and particulate 
emissions during the 
transportation of ore 
as well as reducing 
scope-3 emissions 
of downstream 
transportation. 
Reduction in Scope 2 
emission by consuming 
about 1.64 million units 
of solar power. 
Sequestration of carbon 
from the atmosphere. 
Conservation of surface 
runoff water and 
recharge of ground 
water. 
5. 
Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
Yes, NMDC formulates project-specific disaster management plans, which are integral to the project's risk management 
strategy. These plans are publicly accessible on NMDC's website. The Disaster Management Plan aligns with the National 
Disaster Management Plan-2019 (NDMP-2019) and incorporates the Hon'ble Prime Minister's 10-point agenda on Disaster Risk 
Reduction, with clearly defined responsibilities for designated officers.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard. 
NMDC is committed to minimizing any adverse environmental impacts that may arise from its value chain. In line with this 
commitment, We mandate that all suppliers adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct policy, which requires full compliance 
with government regulations, including those pertaining to environmental sustainability and protection. This policy ensures 
that suppliers actively engage in sustainable practices such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing pollution, 
implementing effective waste management strategies, conserving biodiversity and land, and enhancing resource and energy 
efficiency in their operations. 
To further mitigate potential environmental impacts, we are in the process of initiating processes to closely work with its suppliers 
to monitor and improve their sustainability practices continuously. The company encourages innovation and the adoption of 
environmentally friendly technologies and processes. We are deliberating on the possibility of conducting regular assessments 
and audits, to ensure that its suppliers are effectively implementing these measures, thereby reducing the overall environmental 
footprint of its value chain. NMDC is fully dedicated to environmental stewardship and is committed to contributing positively to 
global sustainability efforts.
