Financial 
implications

(Indicate

1
Climate Change & 
GHG Emissions
Environment
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Risk: The company’s assets 
are prone to climate induced 
physical and transition risks 
which are anticipated to 
increase in frequency and/
or intensity over the years. 
Adverse 
weather 
events 
can cause various form of 
business disruptions. Alkem 
understands 
the 
global 
urgency 
of 
addressing 
climate change i.e., limit the 
increase in average global 
temperatures.
Opportunity: 
Climate 
change impacts may lead to 
various health implications 
on 
individuals, 
thereby, 
necessitating the demand 
for responsive health care 
services in future.
The Company’s initiatives and 
actions are guided by its ESG 
policy that serves as an enabling 
framework to fulfil its business 
responsibilities 
towards 
addressing climate change and 
GHG emissions related risks. 
Alkem has taken the targets 
for reducing its scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 42% by FY’33. 
Additionally, this risk has been 
included 
in 
the 
company’s 
Enterprise Risk Management 
system 
and 
appropriate 
mitigation strategies (at entity 
level) have been identified to 
address the risk.
The 
company 
has 
also 
undertaken 
to 
quantify 
its 
Scope-3 emissions and intends 
to 
undertake 
measures 
to 
reduce them by engaging with 
the relevant stakeholders.
Negative 
implications 
due to adverse 
impact on 
company’s 
assets

(Indicate

2
Biodiversity
Environment
Risk
Biodiversity loss can pose 
a significant risk to the 
company given the reliance 
of 
the 
pharmaceutical 
industry on a variety of 
natural 
resources 
and 
biological compounds. A 
reduction in biodiversity 
can lead to a scarcity of 
medicinal 
plants 
and 
other raw materials critical 
for 
drug 
development 
(especially in Biosimilars and 
Nutraceuticals 
segments), 
potentially increasing costs 
and 
impacting 
supply 
chains. 
Environmental 
degradation 
resulting 
from operations and new 
projects undertaken could 
also heighten regulatory 
scrutiny, leading to stricter 
compliance requirements.
The company is committed to 
protecting and preserving the 
natural resources and ecosystem 
as a part of Environmental 
Protection in its ESG Policy.
As a part of its CSR initiatives, the 
company 
participates 
in 
mass 
plantation drives to restore green 
cover.
Negative 
implications due 
to cost incurred for 
the protection of 
biodiversity
3
Energy Management
Environment
Risk / 
Opportunity
Risk: 
The 
Company’s 
operations 
are 
energy-
intensive and consume a 
high amount of fuel and 
electricity. If not managed 
well, 
the 
company 
might have to bear high 
operational costs due to 
energy 
inefficiencies 
in 
operations.
Opportunities: 
Improving 
the 
existing 
processes 
for 
increased 
efficiency, 
upgrading 
to 
new 
technologies, and switching 
to greener energy sources 
will immensely benefit the 
company’s operations in 
terms of improved yield, 
increased 
profitability 
and reducing the GHG 
emissions.
The company targets to reduce 
its energy consumption by 1% 
Y-O-Y through energy efficiency 
measures 
from 
baseline 
of 
FY’23. Multiple initiatives have 
been adopted for improved 
energy management, some of 
these include:
• 
Use of PNG Gas in boilers 
instead of furnace oil at select 
sites.
• 
Biomass 
Briquette 
Boilers 
installed at sites to minimize the 
use of traditional fossil fuels.
• 
Installation 
of 
Variable 
Frequency Drive (VFD)
• 
Replacement of non-efficient 
Air Handling Unit (AHU) with 
new efficient AHU
Additionally, 
by 
FY’26, 
Alkem 
strives to obtain ISO 50001 for all its 
operating sites.
Negative impact 
due to cost 
incurred for 
the capex of 
energy efficient 
equipment; 
however, positive 
financial impact 
projected in long-
run due to lower 
cost of energy

Waste Management
Environment
Risk
Being in the pharma sector, 
the 
company 
generates 
significant 
quantities 
of 
hazardous 
waste 
along 
with other non-hazardous 
waste 
categories, 
which 
if not managed properly 
might lead to regulatory 
non-compliances, fines & 
penalties, work restrictions 
and 
environmental 
degradation.
The company’s emphasis on 
waste minimization is reflected 
in their adoption of 3R principle: 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. The 
company has also tied up with 
government authorized waste 
management firms to support 
in 
the 
waste 
management 
practices 
in 
line 
with 
3R 
principles.
Negative impact 
due to cost 
incurred in 
handling and 
management of 
waste
5
Water 
Management
Environment
Risk
Shortage of water resource 
at the key locations of 
company’s 
business 
operations, 
including 
manufacturing 
and 
R&D 
sites, can disrupt operations 
and, 
hence, 
business 
continuity. Availability of 
poor-quality water is also 
a 
concern 
considering 
pharma 
manufacturing 
demands 
good 
quality 
water to meet product 
quality standards.
The 
Company 
focuses 
on 
reducing 
freshwater 
intake 
by 
monitoring 
its 
water 
consumption, 
auditing 
the 
raw effluent and treated water 
discharge, 
and 
educating 
workforce 
on 
water 
saving 
practices.
Rainwater 
harvesting 
and 
effluent treatment plants are 
set up at all manufacturing 
sites. Currently, 42% of the 
manufacturing 
plants 
are 
following Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD). 
Furthermore, 
the 
company strives to become 
water neutral by FY’30.
Negative impact 
due to cost 
incurred in 
meeting water 
demand during 
shortages or 
availability of 
poor quality 
water
6
Product Quality 
and Patient Safety
Social
Risk
Unintended characteristics of 
the product may cause health 
and safety risks for end users 
i.e. patients, thereby, leading 
to reputational damage, fines, 
or penalties along with loss of 
customers’ trust
Alkem has a pharmacovigilance 
system in place to safeguard 
patient health through efficient 
and 
timely 
identification, 
collection, 
assessment, 
and 
communication of medicine-
related adverse events.
The 
Company 
also 
strictly 
adheres to cGMP guidelines 
which are enforced by regulatory 
agencies for quality assurance 
in 
manufacturing 
processes. 
Quality 
control 
checks 
are 
conducted periodically across 
facilities for all machinery and 
equipment 
to 
identify 
and 
address any non-compliances.
Positive 
implications 
due to customer 
acceptance and 
loyalty

Occupational 
Health & Safety
Social
Risk
Due 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
pharmaceutical 
industry, 
the company’s employees 
and workforce are exposed 
to 
hazardous 
chemicals 
and substances during the 
manufacturing 
and 
R&D 
processes.
The Company is focused on its 
‘Zero Harm’ approach – Zero 
Harm to People, Assets, and 
Environment. The Environment, 
Health & Safety (EHS) policy 
is applicable across the all the 
sites. Baddi (Unit 1 & 2), Daman 
(Unit 1), Sikkim (Unit 1, 2, 3, & 
5), Ankleshwar, and Mandwa 
manufacturing sites are ISO 
45001 certified.
The Company carries periodic 
EHS audits on the sites to 
identify the gaps and address 
them. The culture of health & 
safety is promoted through 
extensive health and safety 
trainings for both employees 
and workers. Multiple initiatives 
are deployed to ensure Process 
safety and Control of chemical 
exposure.
Positive 
implications 
due to 
increased work 
productivity and 
reduced LTIFR.
8
Human Resource 
Development
Social
Opportunity
The 
industry 
demands 
human 
capital 
which 
is knowledge and skills 
driven. 
The 
productivity 
and efficiency of employees 
associated 
with 
the 
company, provides better 
asset integrity and business 
growth along all functions 
of the business.
The Company has adopted 
appropriate 
enforcement 
mechanisms in form of dynamic 
Human 
Resource 
policy 
framework, Environment Health 
& Safety (EHS) Policy, ESG Policy, 
and other relevant guidelines. 
The HR team provides strategic 
and skill development trainings 
to foster a balance of personal 
and professional growth of 
every employee. Alkem offers 
its employees with an inclusive 
and supportive environment 
with 
suitable 
employment 
benefits such as insurance, 
medical 
support, 
maternity 
leaves, paternity leave, sick 
leave, support from benevolent 
funds during emergencies, and 
access to counselling in case 
of need. The Company fosters 
diversity 
and 
encourages 
equal opportunities among its 
employees, hereby striving to 
attract and retain the best talent 
across all functions and levels.
Positive 
implications 
due to increased 
productivity of 
workforce.

Availability and 
affordability of 
medicines
Social
Risk
As a part of its social and 
moral responsibilities, it is 
important for the company 
to 
provide 
and 
place 
products in the markets 
where they are accessible 
and 
affordable 
for 
the 
patients. 
The 
company 
may otherwise lose market 
share to competitors who 
offer more accessible and 
affordable 
alternatives, 
resulting 
in 
significant 
decline in revenue and 
profitability 
for 
the 
company. In a longer run, 
it may become difficult to 
regain customer trust and 
market position in future.
The Company’s R&D facilities 
are working towards innovative 
solutions to ensure affordability 
and accessibility of products 
without 
compromising 
the

Sustainable Supply 
Chain
Social
Risk
Gaps 
in 
pharmaceutical 
supply chain may likely 
disrupt the production and 
distribution of medications, 
leading to shortages or 
delays in getting essential 
drugs 
to 
patients. 
The 
consequences can affect 
both company’s reputation 
and public health.
Alkem 
has 
obtained 
an 
Associate 
Membership 
with 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain 
Initiative (PSCI) to attain safety, 
environmental, 
and 
social 
outcomes, across its value chain 
and promote responsible value 
chain practices.
In addition, the company has 
shown its commitment towards 
sustainability in supply chain by 
taking targets around screening 
and evaluating its critical suppliers 
against ESG practices, while also 
initiating accounting of its Scope-3 
emissions.
Negative 
implications are 
observed due 
to cost incurred 
in suppliers’ 
assessment.

Human Rights
Social, 
Governance
Risk
Violation of human rights 
principles can harm the 
reputational image of the 
Company and trust within 
its stakeholders.
The Company has a well-

locations.
The 
Company 
also 
has 
a 
specific Code of Ethics for all 
its 
stakeholders 
including 
suppliers, 
vendors, 
and 
contractors to guide ethical 
practices in the value chain.
Negative

short term due 
to cost incurred 
to ensure strict 
inclusivity of 
human rights 
principles in 
systems and 
processes 
through regular 
audits, trainings, 
and compliance 
measures.

Statement by director responsible for the BRSR report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievement:
Alkem has made significant strides over the last 50 years and is committed to improve the well-being of its customers and 
patients through provision of affordable, high-quality products across a wide range of therapeutic areas. We are committed 
to a sustainable and responsible growth, as we strive to fulfil the expectations of our valued stakeholders. Aligned with our 
overarching purpose of ‘Enduring Quality, Care, and Innovation’, Alkem has formulated its business sustainability strategy based 
anchored by three strategic pillars:  
Striving for Environmental Stewardship: At Alkem, we are committed to a greener tomorrow through our strategic steps 
towards addressing climate change, optimizing energy use, and ensuring sustainable water and waste management. Our 
efforts include:
•	
Proactively addressing climate change by reducing our Scope-1 and Scope-2 GHG emissions by 42% by FY’33, alongside 
reducing energy consumption by 1% year on year through energy efficiency measures, based on FY’23 baselines. Initiatives 
underway include transitioning to cleaner fuels, increasing the share of renewable energy in our portfolio, and pursuing ISO 
50001 certification for key manufacturing sites, such as all four units at our Sikkim facility. 
•	
Our focus extends to water and waste management, with goals to achieve water neutrality by FY’30, ensure recycle or reuse 
of non-hazardous wastes to over 90% by FY’25, and reach zero waste to landfill at our operating sites by FY’26. Some of the 
current key initiatives include repurposing treated water for domestic use, ISO 14001 certification for five manufacturing 
sites, 100% recycling or recovery of non-hazardous waste generated (such as glass, paper, metal, and food waste), and 
reclaiming the domestic product plastic packaging waste to be recycled in collaboration with authorized plastic recycling 
vendors, etc. 
Ensuring Care for All: Our employees, communities and stakeholders are integral to our success. Some of the key interventions 
worth mentioning for engaging various stakeholders are as follows:
•	
Uplifting communities through our CSR initiatives focusing on healthcare, education, rural development, and environment. 
Some of the key CSR interventions undertaken this year include establishing Advanced Radiotherapy Centre, providing 
home-based palliative care, conducting campaigns on hygiene and sanitation in schools, and empowering women. 
•	
Enhancing gender diversity within our workforce, aiming for a 5% increase by FY’27. Strategies include actively recruiting 
women in our Sales Team and nurturing junior female employees for mid-level roles through initiatives like the ‘SHINE- 
Women Excellence Program’.
•	
Creating a conducive work environment where the workforce can thrive. With five of our manufacturing locations certified 
under ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems) and remarkably low Lost Time Injuries records, we 
are committed to our ‘Zero harm’ approach, ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees. 
•	
Driving organizational cultural transformation to mainstream sustainability through an extensive capacity and capability 
building campaign. Close to 5000 workforce and 30 Senior leadership Team members have been trained on Sustainability 
principles as of FY’24.  
Upholding Trustworthy Stewardship: Our Board of Directors, with their rich and diverse experience, provide strategic oversight 
to our business operations. Under their aegis, we have fortified our commitment to stakeholder interests and long-term value 
creation through the implementation of robust systems, procedures, and policies. Some of our key initiatives undertaken in 
FY’24 include:
•	
Integrating ESG Risks into our Enterprise Risk Management system, recognizing climate change as an integral aspect in our 
core business strategy. 
•	
Training 100% of our employees on the ‘Code of Conduct’, covering essential topics like anti-corruption, anti-bribery, 
whistleblowing, etc.
