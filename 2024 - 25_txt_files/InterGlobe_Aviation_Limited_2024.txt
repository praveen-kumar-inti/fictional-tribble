requires the top 1,000 listed entities in India to prepare 
and disclose Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR) in accordance with the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015. Furthermore, the top 150 listed entities are required 
to get reasonable assurance on the BRSR core indicators 
as per the SEBI circular number SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/

InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Dear Stakeholders,
It gives me immense pleasure to share our Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for FY2025. This 
is our fourth BRSR and has been prepared in accordance 
with the guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (SEBI LODR Regulations). IndiGo has 
engaged with TUV India Pvt. Ltd. (TUV NORD Group), a 
third-party independent assurance provider to conduct 
reasonable level assurance of the BRSR Core indicators. 
The assurance was conducted in-line with the ISAE 3000 
(Revised) requirements. The independent assurance 
statement is provided in the BRSR. 
FY2025 marked another remarkable year in IndiGo’s 
journey, which began 18 years back. Over this time, we 
have revolutionised air travel in India, becoming the 
nation’s most preferred airline by connecting people and 
aspirations. As of March 2025, our fleet expanded to 434 
aircraft, we added 10 new destinations and now connect 
91 domestic and 40* international locations. This year, we 
proudly served 118 million passengers.
IndiGo remains unwavering in its commitment to 
sustainability, responsibility, and ethical governance. 
Our ESG journey reflects our core values and our vision 
for a more sustainable future. We continue to embed ESG 
principles into every facet of our business, ensuring a 
positive impact at every level. In FY2025, we continued 
to make significant strides toward decarbonisation 
by adding 58 new Airbus A320neo aircraft, which are 
15% more fuel-efficient, bringing our neo fleet to 76% 
of our total fleet despite supply chain constraints. Our 
GHG emission intensity stood at 61.7 grams of CO2e 
per Available Seat Kilometer (ASK), 17.3% lower than 
the 2016 baseline. This places us among the lowest 
emitting airlines, globally. In our ground operations, we 
continue to transition towards electric-powered ground 
service equipment and refining operational procedures 
to enhance our environmental footprint. Our commitment 
to environmental stewardship was recognised with the 
prestigious ‘National Energy Conservation Awards 2024’ 
by the Government of India. Oil marketing companies 
in India are working towards local production of SAF to 
enable decarbonisation journey of Indian aviation. We 
are actively engaged with the oil marketing companies as 
they create these path-depending solutions.
In line with our broader sustainability goals, we continue to 
focus on water conservation and waste management. We 
collaborated with Indore Airport on a waste management 
initiative that converts inflight and other waste into 
2
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
compost. Onboard our aircraft, we have deployed water-
saving technologies and are steadily phasing out single-
use plastics in our in-flight catering services.
As India progresses on a path of growth and prosperity, 
customer preferences continue to evolve. In response to 
these changing needs, we introduced our business product 
IndiGoStretch, a thoughtfully curated premium seating 
class designed for aspirational travelers seeking enhanced 
comfort and flexibility at accessible price points. Another 
exciting milestone was the launch of IndiGo BluChip, our 
much-awaited loyalty program created to recognise and 
reward our most valued customers.
IndiGo remains committed to fostering diversity, equity, 
and inclusion within its workplace. Women comprise 
over 44% of our workforce. We are one of the global 
leaders in female pilot representation. Additionally, we 
have joined IATA’s ‘25 by 2025’ initiative, which aims to 
increase women in leadership roles to 25% by 2025. We 
continue to take significant steps to ensure that people 
with disabilities (PwD) and LGBTQ+ employees feel 
supported and valued at IndiGo. Our commitment to DEI 
was recognized with the “DEI Champion Award” by the 
Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Reaffirming our dedication to accessible air travel, we 
partnered with the UDAN initiative led by the Government 
of India and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Under this 
program, IndiGo operated over 6,684 flights and 
transported 433,200 passengers in FY2025, expanding 
connectivity and accessibility across the country.
IndiGoReach, our CSR arm, focuses on community-centered 
programs, including conserving India’s rich heritage and 
equipping young people with skills relevant to the Travel, 
Transportation, Logistics, and Hospitality (TTLH) sectors. 
Employees play an active role in these initiatives by 
volunteering their time and expertise, strengthening the 
depth and reach of these programs.
Governance is foundational to our business, built on 
the pillars of transparency, accountability and ethical 
conduct. We believe that sound governance is not just a 
requirement, but a key enabler of trust and sustainable 
growth.  Our Board of Directors and our leadership team 
upholds these principles with diligence and integrity, 
guided by a robust policy and compliance framework. 
We welcome our stakeholders to read our BRSR and share 
their valuable feedback at esg@goindigo.in.

1
Climate 
Change-
related risk
Risk
As an airline, we 
acknowledge the risks 
associated with climate 
change.
Some of the potential risks 
that we foresee are: 
Policy and regulatory 
risk emerging from 
regulatory changes 
such as CORSIA.
• 
Increased input cost on 
account of SAF usage, 
since SAF is significantly 
costlier compared to 
conventional Jet fuel 
or purchase of Eligible 
Emissions Units i.e. 
carbon credits.
• 
Reduced demand due 
to stigmatisation of 
sector
Investments in next 
generation aircraft. These 
aircraft are 15% more 
fuel efficient and will 
reduce our risk exposure. 
Currently, 76% of our fleet 
consist of Airbus A320neo 
family aircraft.
We are actively engaged 
with regulators to be 
aware of regulatory 
developments and to 
ensure compliance.
We are actively engaged 
with oil marketing 
companies to ensure 
we are fully aware of 
availability pricing etc.
Since fuel is the most significant 
cost for us, these regulatory 
changes may potentially result 
in an increase in our cost.
2
Fuel and 
Energy
Opportunity
• 
Jet fuel is the most 
significant cost for an 
airline.
• 
Fuel is also the largest 
source of direct GHG 
emissions for an airline. 
We have taken series of 
initiatives over the years 
to ensure fuel and energy 
efficient operations e.g.,
Investments in next 
generation aircraft which 
are 15% fuel efficient.
 Electrification of 
ground operations
Fuel optimizing flying SOPs, 
 Young fleet
• 
A young and Fuel-efficient 
fleet and adherence to best 
fuel practices, provides 
us with an opportunity 
to optimise our fuel 
consumption and results in 
lower fuel cost.
3
Waste 
Management
Opportunity 
and risk
Waste in our business is 
generated in. 
• 
Onboard food sales,
• 
Maintenance activities 
for aircraft and ground 
service equipment. 
• 
Food and IT waste at 
corporate office.
 Appropriate waste 
disposal practices
 Focus on waste 
reduction and recycling
 Partnering with airports 
and vendors as 
may be applicable.
The 3R approach (reduce, 
recycle & reuse) provides 
opportunities to save cost.

4
Aircraft noise
Risk
Aircraft noise impacts the 
communities residing near 
the airports. Global noise 
regulations and standards 
are becoming stricter 
year on year calling for 
investment in advanced 
technologies.
ICAO has set very stringent 
noise abatement standards. 
Significant part of our fleet 
is compliant with the ICAO 
chapter 14 which is the most 
stringent standard.
Aircraft noise above the 
permissible limits, carries risk of 
fines in the medium to long term
5
Diversity, 
Equity, and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Creating a diverse and 
inclusive work environment 
is essential for building a 
sustainable business. Key 
priorities include:
• 
Promoting a balanced 
workforce.
•

for discrimination.
• 
Implementing inclusive 
work practices.
•

regardless of gender, 
age, nationality, race, 
ethnicity, religion, social 
status, disability, sexual 
orientation.

opportunities to 
candidates with physical 
disabilities.
• 
Commitment to IATA’s

• 
These best practices 
lead to a balanced work 
environment.
• 
Talent retention, leads to 
lower hiring cost 
6
Safety
Opportunity 
and risk
Safety is our utmost 
priority, essential for 
operational integrity, 
passenger trust, regulatory 
compliance, and financial 
sustainability.
• 
Safety Management 
System (SMS) which aims 
to ensure best safety 
practices and to minimize 
incidences.
• 
Safety training and 
emergency drills
• 
Health initiatives like 
sessions with doctors 
or nutritionists and 
counselling sessions on 
mental well-being.

part of IndiGo's Safety Management System (SMS) and Structured Safety Process (SSP) frameworks, which include both 
proactive and reactive components.

the system. This investigation process identifies the underlying causes of accidents and incidents, provides learning, and 
contributes to the continual improvement of the aviation system. IndiGo has a sophisticated system in place to collect all 
network incidents, which are then reported to regulatory authorities by the Flight Safety department as needed.

inflight services, airport operations & customer services, OEMs, and airport operators to determine the root cause(s) and 
contributory factor(s). Based on the findings, mitigation actions are formulated to prevent future occurrences. IndiGo's 
Permanent Investigation Board, in collaboration with the regulatory authority, investigates all major events.
 
 
In summary, a continuous encouragement on safety culture has resulted in an increase in safety awareness across the 
operational staff, which is evident by the type and number of reports being received by Flight Safety. IndiGo's commitment

Details of the initiative
Outcome of the initiative
1
Next generation 
Aircraft
Minimising fuel consumption serves as our most powerful lever 
for decreasing CO2 emissions. A crucial aspect of this strategy 
involves updating our fleet with Airbus A320neo family aircraft. 
Currently, approximately 76% of our fleet consists of Airbus 
A320neo family, which are 15% more fuel-efficient and 50% 
quieter compared to the previous generation aircraft.
The initiative has resulted 
in a 17.3% decrease in CO2 
emissions per available seat 
kilometre between fiscal 
years 2016 and 2025.

Optimization 
of flying SOPs 
(Standard Operating 
Procedures)
We consistently adhere to established flying Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) that facilitate continuous fuel 
optimisation. Some examples of these practices include 
single-engine taxiing, optimised flap settings during landing, 
optimised descent profiles, weight reduction measures such as 
electronic flight bags.

Notes:
Energy: The airport energy consumption data was sourced from the available data (like invoices, bills, SAP statements etc.) in the 
system. For some airports where dedicated electricity data is not available for particular month, it is extrapolated based on the 
average basis considering the data of Major Metro Stations (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad). This is 
considered reasonable as these stations cover more services and has higher number of staff support for the passengers compared to 
other small airports.
Water: Water upliftment into aircraft was monitored based on basis of invoices. Sample invoices were verified during the Assurance 
process. Water purchase invoices were considered for the monitoring of this data. Water discharge from the aircraft uplifted water was 
assumed as 70 %; for consumption in lavatory.
Waste: The company currently has two hangars, one in Bengaluru and one in Delhi. CTO and CTE is received for Bangalore hangar. 
At these establishments, hazardous waste is being generated in the form of used oil, grease, lubricants etc. from the maintenance 
activities. Currently these wastes are disposed through Pollution Control Board authorized vendors who recycle these wastes in line 
with their consent conditions. Any ongoing applicable formalities with pollution control board on statutory requirements shall be 
expedited to obtain the consent from the respective State Pollution Control Board in-line with the statutory requirements.
The reporting boundaries for the above attributes include 91 domestic airport locations across 35 states/UTs and 40 international 
airports across 25 countries. An on-site verification was conducted at IndiGo Corporate Office, Delhi airport hangar site, and Oberoi 
Flight Service catering kitchen locations from 9th Dec 2024 to 11th December 2024.

prohibits the use of this assurance statement for the purpose of greenwashing or making misleading claims. It is the responsibility of 
the reporting organization to ensure full compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
TUVI's India Private Limited (TUVI) was commissioned to provide an independent assurance engagement and is responsible for 
delivering a reasonable level of assurance on the non-financial disclosures (for BRSR Core KPIs) and for expressing a conclusion based 
on the procedures performed. It is important to note that the engagement did not include an assessment of the -related issues, or 
the overall sufficiency of the report except as covered within the defined scope of assurance.
TUVI’s responsibility was limited to the agreed scope of work, which comprised:
1. 
Reasonable assurance on the non-financial quantitative and qualitative disclosures (for BRSR Core KPIs) related to the nine 
attributes as outlined in Annexure I - Format of BRSR Core.
The reporting organization (IndiGo) retains full responsibility for ensuring the authenticity, completeness, and accuracy of the 
information and for archiving the underlying data for a reasonable duration.
TUVI’s assurance procedures were based on the assumption that all data and information provided by IndiGo were complete and 
accurate. The data was verified on a sample basis, and no responsibility is assumed by TUVI for the full verification of all underlying 
records. The primary intended user of this assurance statement is IndiGo; however, the client may use it at their own discretion in 
accordance with their specific requirements. TUVI expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility:
1. 
For decisions made by any individual or entity based on this assurance statement; and
2. 
For any damages resulting from the reliance on incomplete, inaccurate, or erroneous data reported.
The assurance engagement is conducted with the understanding that IndiGo has provided true and complete information 
throughout the process.

Action Plan
The following improvement areas were identified and shared with IndiGo. These recommendations align with IndiGo 
management’s existing objectives and sustainability initiatives in addition to BRSR Core disclosure reporting. Notably, 
IndiGo has already recognized many of these areas, and the assurance team supports their continued focus to advance 
the organization’s sustainability goals:
i. 
Waste reporting: IndiGo may encourage to monitor the chain of custody for suppliers who are not directly recycling the 
non-hazardous waste
ii. 
Data digitization: IndiGo can utilize digital platforms to capture the data on periodic basis and perform the internal audit on 
half yearly basis
Conflict of Interest
In alignment with the BRSR requirements established by SEBI, managing and disclosing potential conflicts of interest is critical to 
ensuring the integrity, independence, and credibility of the assurance engagement. As per SEBI guidelines, assurance providers are 
required to identify and disclose any existing or potential conflict of interest that could compromise the objectivity or neutrality of 
their assessment. TUVI maintains a robust process to assess and address any such risks. TUVI thoroughly evaluates its relationships, 
affiliations, and financial interests to identify any factors that may give rise to a conflict. Where potential conflicts are identified, 
appropriate safeguards are implemented to mitigate or eliminate any undue influence on the assurance process. We are committed to 
maintaining independence and impartiality in our assurance services. As part of our transparency obligations, any identified conflicts 
are clearly disclosed within the assurance statement. TUVI acknowledges that the failure to adequately address conflicts of interest 
could undermine the credibility of the assurance conclusions and the reliability of the reported information. Therefore, we strictly 
comply with throughout the engagement.
