Risk
The expansion of

demand can potentially result in 
a subsequent rise in greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions
The adoption of new and efficient 
technologies and the transition 
towards greener options, such 
as onsite solar projects and the 
purchase of renewable energy 
through power purchase agreements 
(PPAs), will lead to a reduction in 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Additionally, we have committed to 
for science-based targets near term 
and net zero by 2040.

For efficient energy management, 
solar panels and LEDs are installed 
at various facilities. Additionally, 
we have installed “Back Pressure 
Turbine” – to reuse excess steam in 
a turbine to generate electricity for 
internal usage and also, optimized 
usage of Steam pressure in wet 
processing machines.

Various raw materials are used 
in the manufacturing process 
and there is a continuous 
effort to source most of them 
sustainably to produce eco-

impact on the environment.
A continuous connect is maintained 
Positive with suppliers to motivate 
and drive them to adopt sustainable

in shortlisting and on boarding 
suppliers.

Natural Lighting: Installed skylights in the new TOB unit to utilize natural lighting, reducing power requirements 
from MSEB.
b. 	
Kolhapur - Steam/Coal:

generating savings in fuel/coal.
c. 	
Kolhapur - Alternate Sources of Energy:
- 	
Initiated the use of green fuel (biomass) in boilers. This fuel is mixed with coal and fed to the boiler, allowing up to 
approximately 10% biofuel usage, reducing coal (fossil fuel) requirements.
d. 	
Kolhapur - Capital Investment on Energy Conservation:
- 	
Completed an additional 1.25 MW solar installation, reducing MSEB power requirements by almost 1.8 million units 
annually.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
	
We use a risk-based approach to identify credible business risks and routinely review our management plan to keep it current 
and effective. At Indo Count, the Risk and Disaster Management function supports our strategic objectives, safeguards business 
interests, and proactively strengthens our ability to respond to internal and external threats. This ensures the uninterrupted 
delivery of critical business operations during any disruption.
10.	
Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
We are committed to implement effective waste management practices which aim to minimize environmental impact and 
promote sustainability. Additionally, our Company has adopted a comprehensive strategy to reduce the usage of hazardous 
and toxic chemicals in both our products and processes. We prioritize the responsible management of such waste to ensure 
the safety of our employees, communities, and the environment.
	
The biological sludge hazardous waste Cat.35.3 generated from our ETP treatment facility undergoes a carefully designed 
process to ensure its proper management. Initially, the sludge drained from the ETP is collected in a dedicated sludge tank 
before being directed to the Thickner tank. From the Thickner tank, the supernatant water is recycled back into the ETP process, 
while the thick sludge at the bottom is fed into a Screw press. Within the Screw press, the sludge is efficiently separated into 
two parts. The water portion, extracted from the screw press, is once again recycled within the ETP system. The remaining 
sludge, consisting of approximately 15% to 20% solid content and 80% water content, is carefully directed to a sludge dryer. 
This specialized equipment facilitates the drying process, resulting in sludge powder with a moisture content of 8%. It is 
important to note that we strictly adhere to environmentally responsible practices and refrain from utilizing any hazardous or 
toxic chemicals throughout our processes. The dried sludge, meeting the necessary moisture criteria, is disposed of through 
an Authorized CHWTSDF (Centralized Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility). By implementing these 
meticulous procedures, we ensure the safe and sustainable management of our biological sludge hazardous waste, minimizing 
any potential negative impacts on the environment.
	
We have replaced conventional petrochemical dyes with alternate “Natural dyes” under Pure Earth category of dyed/printed 
fabrics. These natural dyes are made from waste extracts of plants/fruits and are pure organic dyes, thereby reducing the usage 
of synthetic dyes. Ensuring usage of compliant dyes & chemical in process, we are a registered member at ZDHC and we ensure 
our products meet ZDHC MRSL norms. More than 95% of our input dyes & chemicals are meeting ZDHC norms.
