Letter from the Chairman and  
Managing Director
Dear shareholders,
During the last three years, your Company has 
grown annually in healthy double digits with the 
market capitalization increasing almost four-fold. 
ABB India’s performance has perfectly mirrored the 
growth of the Indian economy with the broad-based 
revival of capital expenditure led by the government 
across traditional and emerging sectors.  
Your Company has been working with customers 
and partners to meticulously craft their respective 
growth journeys in a sustainable and resource 
efficient manner. This has been led by our purpose 
and the ‘ABB Way’ operating model. We have made 
our own processes more robust and efficient, further 
deepening our footprint in the country. 
The global technology leadership, with a highly 
localized portfolio and engineering prowess, 
has enabled ABB India to partner the nation’s 
development journey over several decades. Your 
company has made a major contribution to 
the nation’s journey of energy transition, local 
manufacturing upgrade and modernizing the 
entire transport ecosystem including building 
roads, railways, modern ports and airports. ABB 
India’s portfolio of digital and energy efficient 
solutions also partner in strengthening the digital 
infrastructure backbone of the country, while 
fighting the impact of climate change. 
This report will provide an integrated update 
on how ABB India, through its strategy and 
operating model, is creating value for its various 
stakeholders. Aligned with our purpose, we have 
the capacity and proficiency to contribute to the 
resource and energy needs of an expanding local 
market and specifications of several global ones, 
while safeguarding the environment for future 
generations. As a conscientious corporate citizen, 
we will continue our efforts for enhancing employee 
well being and future resource upskilling, even as we 
contribute to wholesome social progress.
Delivering on our commitment 
ABB India has consistently delivered a solid 
performance across all key parameters such 
as orders, revenue, profitability and cashflow 
generation. The Company has built a robust 
pipeline of orders from a diverse set of sectors 
like data centers, electronics, metros and railways, 
renewables, automotive, water and wastewater 
and power distribution. Simultaneously, we have 
deepened our base in segments like metals, mining, 
cement, pulp, and paper through our energy efficient 
and eco friendly solutions. 
The year was marked by record high orders of INR 
12,319 crore (order backlog up by 30 per cent) and 
revenue of INR 10,447 crore. Our profit after tax 
increased by 22 per cent while our cash position 
continues to be robust. This was also the first year 
in recent times for ABB when two dividends were 
declared in a, year. A special one was already paid in 
August 2023 and a final one is now proposed to be 
approved by the shareholders at the Annual General 
meeting. The uptrend for earning per share (EPS) 
continued at INR 58.90 for CY2023 while Return on 
Capital Employed (ROCE) touched the best-in-class 
level, doubling from 2019 to reach 21 percent this 
calendar year.
Creating value now and for the future  
Our Indian operations, fully aligned with the 
ABB Way model of operation, are now yielding 
greater benefits from the portfolio realignment 
and productization. We are actively managing our 
business portfolio to ensure that our divisions 
conform to our company purpose and deliver on our 
commitments to stakeholders. Our portfolio has 
expanded significantly, now serving 23 segments 
comprising core and emerging or lighter ones 
as compared to seven segments back in the pre-
COVID days. The share of the lighter segments (data 
centers, electronics, water, F&B, pharma, warehouse, 
and logistics, etc.) to the orders basket has doubled 
in the last five years. This renders greater flexibility 
in business model and risk mitigation in response to 
market dynamics. 
ABB India continues to work closely with all its 
customers, channel partners and system integrators, 
deeper in the tiers 2 and 3 cities to fulfill their 
growth ambitions in a sustainable manner.  From 
smaller cities to global markets, your company has 
also deployed a multi pronged strategy to cater to 
evolving customer demands. While making in India 
for the world, regional strategies, global feeder 
factories, product customizations, OEM or channel 
focus as per geographies and local certifications 
have ensured preference for ABB India products in 
varied markets.

Partnering the India growth story 
India continues to be a beacon of growth in a global 
landscape, which though uncertain, has been able 
to avoid some major projected risks in 2023. ABB 
India’s solutions have been an integral part of this 
journey - be it in power distribution, smart power, or 
smart building technology for projects of national 
importance. ABB’s ‘Made in India’ global technology 
solutions such as energy efficient drives, eco-
efficient switchgears, automation, and digitalization 
solutions are catalyzing the country’s energy 
transition with renewables (solar and wind) and 
hydrogen. 
Our automation solutions have been ensuring 
efficient monitoring and tracking of resources - 
be it water, energy or the last mile delivery and 
connectivity for natural gas networks across cities 
and remote areas. ABB has also been effectively 
partnering the transformation of Indian industries 
in steel, cement, oil and gas, pulp and paper, and 
mining for a greener and more sustainable mode of 
operation. The robotics solutions are also playing 
a significant role in the nation’s rapid strides in 
self reliance and localization of value chain in the 
electronics segment. 
ABB’s traction technology and electrification 
solutions are also a part of India’s journey of 
electrifying transport networks with varying levels 
of high speed and semi high speed trains. Our 
solutions are well entrenched in the automotive 
sector, in manufacturing and optimizing paint usage, 
and battery tray assembly of electric vehicles, among 
other applications. The exponential rise in airports 
and air traffic in the country has also provided an 
opportunity for switching technology, distribution 
products, electrification panels and building 
automation solutions.
Sustainability  
The company has been working closely with our 
customers, suppliers, and partners across the 
country to imbibe sustainability in their activities. 
We are witnessing a surge in the number of 
companies joining the Energy Efficiency Movement 
in India. A multi city symposium on the topic was 
held for industry peers and partners to enhance 
awareness about the available solutions to drive 
efficiency initiatives in their organizations. Divisions 
across business segments are working with their 
partner ecosystems to create a greater awareness 
on sustainability and energy efficiency initiatives, 
incentivize the adoption of good practices and 
encourage sale of higher efficiency products or 
solutions. 
On the portfolio front, the local manufacturing 
and launch of eco-efficiency switchgears and the 
power management solutions for data centers with 
environment product declarations are excellent 
examples of creating a sustainable footprint across 
industries. The Annual Report will highlight our 
achievements and targets in sustainability e.g. GHG 
emissions of Scope 1 and 2, water conservation and 
recycling, and renewable electricity. The updates on 
community projects, human rights, diversity and 
inclusion, safety and integrity will also be highlighted 
in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report. 
Facing the future with confidence 
ABB India has made solid, record progress in 2023. 
This has been a gradual and positive journey of 
various initiatives involving people, processes, 
and products cumulatively over the last few years. 
Empowered by the guidance of our seasoned Board 
of Directors, we are poised to sustain this growth 
trajectory, going forward. ABB India is set to create 
benchmarks and new growth templates underlined 
by sustainability and integrity. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to 
thank our stakeholders for their continued trust and 
support. Together with our customers, employees, 
partners, suppliers, and investors, we will continue 
to provide superior value for all our stakeholders by 
balancing the needs of society, the economy, and the 
environment. 
Best regards,
ADRIAN GUGGISBERG

Value creation model
By combining our technology leadership in 
electrification, motion and automation with our 
decentralized ABB Way operating model, we create 
holistic value for our stakeholders while enabling a 
more sustainable and resource-efficient future.
Our value creation model provides a 
comprehensive summary of the holistic value 
we generate for all stakeholders across ABB’s 
entire value chain.  
The value we create for our stakeholders 
measures our success as a purpose-led 
Company:
•	 by delivering leading financial performance 
through world-class technology
•	 by enabling a low-carbon society
•	 by preserving resources
•	 by promoting social progress
•	 by embedding a culture of integrity and 
transparency along the extended value chain
With our holistic approach to value creation, 
we also consider the complexities of the 
external environment. These include risks, 
opportunities and exposure to key megatrends, 
as well as how ABB impacts and is impacted by 
our stakeholders. 
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

Global megatrends are shaping our world. 
Inherently complex and interconnected, 
they transcend borders and markets and are 
transforming our societies. For businesses, 
governments and countries, megatrends pose 
both opportunities and challenges. At ABB, 
we believe that by relentlessly focusing on our 
purpose and continuing to deliver a leading 
offering in electrification and automation, 
we are well positioned to capitalize on key 
megatrends and deliver superior value for our 
stakeholders in the long term. At ABB India, we 
take a broad view of external developments 
including economic and geopolitical shifts. 
Across industries, demand for autonomous 
operations continues to increase and 
digitalization is increasing productivity 
and resource efficiency, and making 
manufacturing more flexible, while improving 
quality and simplicity. At the same time, 
emerging technologies and increasing digital 
connectivity are fueling India’s data growth 
and consequently the need to process and 
make sense of such data. While AI has become 
increasingly prevalent in people’s lives, the 
advancement of technology has long been 
moving us towards a future in which the 
physical and digital worlds merge.

Business environment
As a global company operating in a dynamic business environment, 
we need to consider a wide range of economic, environmental, political 
and social developments. To keep up-to-date, we closely monitor evolving 
risks and opportunities and maintain a continuous dialogue with our 
stakeholders. In line with ABB’s strategic direction, we continuously fine 
tune our offering to reinforce our technology leadership in electrification 
and automation and position ABB to capitalize on global megatrends.

Automation & Robotization 
Digitalization
India’s demographic trend of a younger 
workforce positions it positively as most 
large economies face shrinking working age 
populations and tight labor markets. India's 
working age population will continue to grow 
until 2037, with age dependency falling until 
2032, and India will account for 21 percent of 
the incremental increase in global working 
age population in the next 10 years. The 
large domestic consumption base and rapid 
growth are expected to lead to real growth in 
consumption spending of about US$ 1.7 trillion 
during the period of 2019-2030 which would 
be the third highest growth in demand across 
economies. The share of health, education and 
other services has increased in the total basket 
of consumption, spelling new investment 
opportunities.

Many new ideas on the global manufacturing 
value chains have been popularized - such 
as supply chain resilience, onshoring and 
“friend shoring” driven from the disruptions 
due to COVID-19 and geopolitical changes. 
While onshoring is being driven in technology 
intensive areas by automation and policy 
push, labor intensive sectors are witnessing 
companies diversifying their offshore 
manufacturing bases to create more supply 
chain resilience and flexibility. At a sectoral 
level, this creates opportunities for India 
to attract labor intensive manufacturing 
and create alternative value chains in India. 
Manufacturing opportunity for India is also 
growing because of MNCs picking India as a 
manufacturing and export hub to diversify 
their supply base to reduce geopolitical and 
economic risks. 
To achieve economic growth in India, 
urbanization is intrinsic to development and is 
projected to bring enormous opportunities for 
economic growth and global competitiveness. 
Roughly one third of India’s total population 
lived in its cities in the year 2022. The trend 
clearly indicates an increase in urbanization by 
more than four percent in the last decade alone 
as per a report by Statista. India has reached 
a turning point in the journey of its economic 
transformation wherein half of the country 
would be ‘urban’ in a few decades.

In the face of climate change, Indian society 
faces an urgent and pressing need to transition 
to a low-carbon society and preserve natural 
resources. To enable an equitable transition, 
India requires solutions that are more energy 
efficient, that are powered by renewable or 
low-carbon energy sources, and that enable 
production with fewer inputs. While growing 
population and rising urbanization are putting 
pressure on infrastructure and increasing 
energy consumption, government is setting 
clear climate objectives, and incentivizing 
investments in the expansion and upgrading of 
the energy system.

Material topics for value creation
In 2023, ABB at the Group level conducted its 
first double materiality assessment, reflecting 
both an impact and a business perspective. 
This allowed us to get a clearer picture of our 
actual or potential impacts on the economy, the 
environment, society, and people, as well as to 
understand the business implications emerging 
from risks and opportunities related to our 
material topics.
 
The methodology took into consideration 
regulatory requirements and guidance of 
reporting standards and Sustainability 
Disclosure Standards. The results of our dialogue 
on material topics with our internal and external 
stakeholders are summarized in our materiality

Rupee fared relatively well compared to other emerging market 
currencies. It depreciated by 0.29 percent between January 1 
and mid December, dropping from INR 82.7 to approximately 
INR 83.01 by December 15, marking an 11 percent decrease from 
the previous year. 
Various factors contributed to this fluctuation, including 
geopolitical tensions, monetary policy adjustments in the 
Western world, trade imbalances, and fluctuations in commodity 
prices. Nonetheless, Indian markets reached unprecedented 
heights, with the Sensex and Nifty indices hitting record levels 
of 70,000 and 21,000 respectively. Furthermore, the IPO market 
remained vibrant throughout the year, witnessing a diverse 
range of companies entering the capital markets, spanning from 
traditional industries to cutting edge technology based firms.
Economic and market overview
In 2023, both global and Indian landscapes were marked by

and maintained its reputation as the fastest growing economy. 
It was a year characterized by resurgence in capital expenditure, 
driven by government initiatives to pursue one of the world's 
largest infrastructure expansion programs. This endeavor not 
only spurred private investment across a broader spectrum of 
industries but also diversified the base of industrial segments 
experiencing growth.
India’s GDP growth grew by 7.8 percent year-on-year in the first 
quarter of the financial year (April to June 2023) with a higher 
than expected 7.6 percent in the July to September 2023 quarter, 
as per initial estimates from the National Statistical Office. In 
its October forecast, the IMF had noted that India’s real GDP 
would increase beyond 6 percent in 2023 and 2024. Further, the 
GDP is projected to grow between 6 and 7.1 percent annually in 
fiscal years between 2024 and 2026 as per S&P Global’s report.

Risks and opportunities
The proactive management of risks is an integral part of how we do business. 
Our defined risk management framework enables us to identify and assess 
risks early and ensures that we have appropriate responses to manage and 
mitigate their effects across all levels of ABB. At the same time, we seek to 
turn the risks we face into potential opportunities and strive to manage 
both risks and opportunities in a responsible way. This approach supports 
the creation and protection of value for ABB, our stakeholders and society. 
The enterprise risk management (ERM) process 
is a holistic approach to identifying risks that 
could adversely impact the achievement of 
ABB’s strategic business objectives and lead to 
a material financial impact. The ERM process 
is embedded in our ABB Way operating model 
and encompasses all levels of our organization. 
It provides our leadership, including our 
Executive Committee and the Finance, Audit 
and Compliance Committee (FACC) of the 
Board of Directors, with a comprehensive 
overview of the most critical risks faced by our 
business. This information informs our overall 
strategy and risk discussions and allows us 
to make better-informed decisions to protect 
value and take calculated risks to create value, 
in a rapidly evolving societal and business 
environment.
The ERM process is cyclical and based on the 
ongoing identification, assessment, mitigation 
and monitoring of the most critical risks 
affecting ABB. Our detailed methodology starts 
with the identification of our strategic business 
objectives. Next, we identify the most critical 
risks which could prevent us from achieving 
these objectives and lead to a potential 
material financial impact in the next five years. 
These risks are then assessed in terms of 
their potential impact, likelihood and speed 
of occurrence. Specific responses to address 
these risks are then planned, implemented and 
continuously monitored to ensure they remain 
effective. The ERM process categorizes risks as 
strategic, financial or operational:

We enable a low-carbon society
Enabling a low-carbon society is at the center of our purpose 
and value proposition and a key pillar of our Sustainability 
Agenda. In this chapter, we report on our efforts and 
achievements in reducing emissions in our own operations. 
Faridabad 
In-line with our sustainability target 2030 
towards establishing low-carbon operations, 
the Company is working towards reducing 
the environmental footprint where Faridabad 
facility has adopted the renewable energy 
sources and energy-efficient operations. 
The unit has installed 330 KWp grid-
synchronized rooftop solar plant to increase 
the renewable power usage for its own 
operations. The site’s machinery is also 
outfitted with high energy efficient IE3 and 
IE4 motors, energy-efficient lighting, HVAC 
solutions (highest-rated energy-efficient 
motors and drives), and measurement 
analytics products etc. to improve the energy 
productivity of its operation. With various 
sustainability initiatives, the site also boasts a 
platinum rating under Green factory building 
rating system from the Indian Green Building 
Council.
Nashik
In order to achieve low-carbon operations, 
ABB Nashik has adopted various measures 
with regard to green power utilization as well 
as enhancing the energy productivity for its 
operations. Some of the major initiatives with 
respect to improving energy efficiency at the 
operations are related to LED lighting usage, 
insulated wall and roof panels, more efficient 
air conditioning, demand based lighting, and 
cooling in meeting rooms all managed via a 
KNX and Cylon building management system. 
The factory also uses the ABB Ability Energy 
Manager, a cloud based solution that collects 
data from various sensors to monitor energy 
consumption and identify inefficiencies to 
further enhance the energy efficiency at 
operation. The factory has also installed around 
1 MWp of rooftop solar panels to further reduce 
its carbon footprint.

We preserve resources 
In line with ABB Group's 2030 sustainability targets, we are aiming 
to enable a low-carbon society, preserving resources while applying 
high standards for integrity and transparency beyond compliances.
Nashik 
ABB Nashik facility has been certified as 
water positive with a water positivity index 
of 1.14 by the GRIHA Council (Green Rating 
for Integrated Habitat Assessment), India. To 
achieve water positivity, the Nashik facility 
introduced a range of measures including a 
rainwater harvesting system to reduce run off 
and recharge the groundwater table and reuse 
the stored rainwater to meet other domestic 
requirements. The installation of water 
efficient fixtures reduced water consumption 
by 30 percent and a drip based irrigation 
system, and sewerage treatment plant allow 
wastewater to be reused for irrigation and 
other domestic purposes. The annual rainwater 
harvesting potential of the system is 34.49 
million liters.
Nelamangala, Bengaluru
ABB Nelamangala factory has been certified 
as ‘Zero Waste to Landfill*,’ an environmentally 
friendly philosophy towards reducing the 
amount of waste that ends up in landfill to 
improve circularity in operations. Currently, 
more than 99% of generated waste at the 
factory is diverted away from landfill, which 
means that most waste generated is either 
reused, recycled, or sent to energy recovery. 
Diverting waste away from landfill implies 
optimum utilization of resources to improve 
circular approach in operations and is a positive 
step in our sustainability journey. The ‘‘Zero 
Waste to Landfill” has been achieved through 
systematic 5R approach (Refuse, Reduction, 
Recycling, Reuse and Recovery of energy from 
Waste) to adopt circularity. 
Some of the major initiatives carried out at the 
factory include refusal of single-use plastic and 
reduction of non-recyclable stickers (release 
paper) by converting to preprinted labelling. 
The waste recycling was also enhanced by 
improving the waste segregation system 
across the unit and disposal of the waste 
through authorised recyclers. For some of 
the non-recyclable waste, an energy recovery 
initiative was taken wherein the waste is sent 
to a cement plant for energy recovery as an 
alternate fuel. 
Peenya, Bengaluru
ABB Peenya Campus has been certified as 
water positive with a water positivity index of 
1.05 by the GRIHA Council (Green Rating for 
Integrated Habitat Assessment), India. The 
plant has the potential to recharge 1,19,373 
cu.m. rainwater from the site (excluding 
rooftop) runoff. Some of the major initiatives 
include rainwater use and recharge, reduction 
in the use of freshwater, water recycling, and 
real-time monitoring of water consumption, 
recharge, and saving. The installation of 
water-efficient fixtures and fittings reduced 
the freshwater consumption for its domestic 
purpose, whereas the domestic wastewater 
generated within the site is treated through 
the inhouse sewage treatment plant (STP) 
and recycled for gardening purposes through 
efficient water sprinklers as well drip based 
irrigation system resulting in water recyclability 
enhancement by 12 percent as compared to 
previous year.
ABB Peenya campus reduces the dependency 
on freshwater demand by 22 percent as 
compared to previous year through various 
water conservation initiatives to achieve long 
term sustainability goals, which resulted in 
reduction of freshwater withdrawal and overall 
water footprint of the Company.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes the provide details:
	
Yes. In the journey of reducing GHG emission and in line with ABB Group's 2030 sustainability targets, ABB has been 
contributing towards the energy saving technologies to help its society to reduce their GHG emission whereas more than 
half of its products and services are used in applications that have a positive impact on the environment. ABB is committed 
towards enabling a low-carbon society by achieving carbon neutrality in its own operations and supporting its customers 
and suppliers to reduce their emissions in line with its 2030 sustainability targets. ABB has been driving the decarbonization 
strategy with the help of Renewable energy (RE) RE100, Energy Efficiency (EP) EP100 & Electric Vehicles (EV) EV100 goal 
realization in its own operations. As per RE100, ABB commits to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity until 2030 
whereas, EP100 commitment will be helping ABB to establish energy efficiency targets and continue deploying energy 
management systems at the Company’s sites. The EV100 goal realization will help ABB to electrify its own fleet to remove 
the GHG emission through its operation. At the Company, several renewable energy projects including inhouse solar panel 
installations, procurement of renewable energy through third party Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) & renewable energy 
certificates have contributed towards achieving its RE100 commitment in the year 2022 and eliminated its scope-2 GHG 
emission from its operations.  
 
	
Whereas, various energy efficiency improvement activities are also being carried out in-line with EP100 commitment 
such as replacement of conventional lighting with LEDs, light sensors installation, compressor efficiency improvement, 
replacing old motors with IE3/IE4 motors, implementing the Building Management System (BMS) to further reduce GHG 
footprint. The  Company is also shifting towards greener fuels by partially replacing diesel usage in its diesel generators 
with more environmentally friendly natural gas to further reduce its carbon footprint at its unit. In-line with the 
sustainability framework, the Company is encouraging the green factory building certification across its operating 
facilities to further reduce its environmental footprint.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxics chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes:
	
In line with ABB Group's 2030 sustainability targets, the Company aims to embed circularity across its operation and its value 
chain. The Company has established a strong waste management system with major focus on waste segregation, storage 
& disposal with systematic 5R approach namely, Refuse, Reduction, Recyclability, Reuse and Recovery of energy from waste. 
Some of the major initiatives carried out at the factories are related to refusal of single use plastics usage, reduction of 
non-recyclable stickers (release paper) by converting to preprinted labeling, reduction in paper usage to aim towards 
paperless factory etc. In the endeavor towards achieving zero waste to landfill at its operations, the waste recyclability has 
been also enhanced by improving the waste segregation system across units, whereas waste to energy recovery initiative 
has been taken for non-recyclable waste, which are sent to cement plant for energy recovery as alternate fuel.  With its 5R 
approach, its Nelamangala factory has been certified as “zero waste to landfill” campus with more than 99% of diversion rate 
in the current year. Thus, the Company has focused on hazardous and non-hazardous waste management through various 
process improvement initiatives, periodic engagement with internal and external stakeholders (i.e. waste disposal vendor) 
and adopting the systematic 5R approach on waste management.

5.	 Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/weblink: 
	
Yes. The Company has embedded resilience by design philosophy in the workspace across different dimensions of the 
“new normal” including resilience in work, workforce, workplace, technology, supply chain, and leadership. Being a 
manufacturing Company, there is a potential that its operations may be affected due to core technical risks materializing 
in its environment like technology failures, supply chain gaps, natural calamities, civil disturbances, cyber attacks etc. 
The Company has also started integrating climate change risks into each of these dimensions and its business continuity 
/contingency plans. To meet the organizational continuity objective, ABB has made significant efforts towards Crisis 
Management and resilience planning to ensure effective response, prioritized recovery of its time-sensitive operations and 
mitigation of potential business continuity risks. The crisis management plan is guided by the ABB Country Management, 
led by Country Task Force (CTF), and is based on ABB global best practices and includes for disaster management.

7. 	 Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental 
impacts:
	
 
7 percent of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) were assessed for environmental impacts. 
	
ABB is committed to responsible sourcing and helping its partners meet the challenges of responsible manufacturing. 
Together, ABB and its suppliers have the responsibility to run businesses in a sustainable way, obeying international and 
local laws, taking action to limit environmental impacts, respecting the legal and human rights of workers, and implementing 
effective health and safety policies, within both its own operations and the extended supply chain. It partners with its 
suppliers to ensure that its sustainability expectations, aspirations and targets are understood and met. The ABB Supplier 
Code of Conduct, which is available in multiple languages, sets forth its expectations in clear terms. The Supplier Code of 
Conduct reflects the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, as well as the core tenets of the broader ABB Code of Conduct. 
	
Through Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) approach, the Company addresses issues that fall within six main 
categories: general management, labor rights, social benefits, health, safety and the environment. The approach is backed 
by risk-based monitoring that covers a broad range of suppliers and incorporates group-wide standards and targets. 
The management and implementation of the SSBM system is handled by ABB’s four business areas, allowing for business 
specific programs and processes. The approach is governed by a steering committee and a working group comprised of 
representatives from its business areas and the sustainability team. 
	
Under SSBM, new suppliers registering with ABB must review and acknowledge ABB’s Supplier Code of Conduct. In addition, 
to qualify for consideration, suppliers must complete a self assessment that incorporates questions on how suppliers 
manage issues such as labor, human rights, the environment, health and safety, and integrity, as well as management of their 
own supply chains. Depending on the results from the self assessment and other parameters, further due diligence is carried 
out. Once the supplier has become part of ABB’s supply chain, a risk based approach is used to monitor their sustainability 
performance, much like the procedure under the previous SSDP system. The Company engages with the supplier for training, 
onsite assessments and follow-up audits until closure of all deficiencies is achieved. 
	
ABB Group's 2030 sustainability strategy includes an ambitious target to cover at least 80 percent of its  supply spending in 
focus countries with SSBM by 2030. Its calculation of the coverage of the SSBM program considers supplier self assessments 
(such as those received during supplier onboarding and qualification) and on-site assessment processes. 
	
	
To assess the effectiveness of its approach, ABB Group has set a goal of closing 75 percent or more identified risks from 
supplier assessments by 2025. Closure timelines for identified risks vary from a month to a year, depending on the severity of 
the case. Some complex issues may require a joint effort to resolve, under a longer timeline.

Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and /or services:
 
	
The safe and responsible usage of the Company’s products, systems and services are outlined in the relevant product 
manuals, literature and videos. The Company regularly engages in dialogue with the customers to discuss the Company’s 
offering portfolio and as to how it can address the customer’s requirements, including the customers’ need to become more 
sustainable, achieve greater efficiency, preserve resources and reduce GHG emissions. The Company’s domain experts guide 
and share advice with customers through varied channels and also in different forums, including trade shows, customer 
connect programs, service events, technology days, key account manager relationships, webinars, training sessions, blogs 
and articles published in trade journals.  
 
3.	
Mechanism in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/ discontinuation of essential services:
	
The Company is not directly engaged in providing essential services as defined in the Essential Services Maintenance Act. 
At the same time, the Company always maintains continual communication with its customers, to identify problems before 
they become serious, allowing both parties to work towards mutually beneficial solutions. This, together with the Company’s 
relentless focus on quality and customer service, positions the Company as a trusted partner.

(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes provide details in brief:
	
Yes. To support the customers’ circularity journeys and highlight the circularity performance of ABB products, ABB Group has 
launched the EcoSolutions™ label globally. The label provides full transparency into environmental impacts across the entire 
product lifecycle, through a third-party verified environmental product declaration (EPD) and circularity KPIs. This frame-
work will soon be deployed at the Company. 
 5.	 Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products/services of the 
entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No): 
	
Yes. The Company has implemented the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey methodology to know how the Company is 
perceived by its customers. NPS is both a loyalty metric and a discipline for using customer feedback to aid sustainable growth 
of the Company. The relational NPS surveys measure customer loyalty, based on long-term engagement between senior 
managers at the customers’ end and the Company. Complementary to this, the Company also intensively uses transactional 
NPS surveys to get real time, touch-point specific feedback from operational level customer staff for identification of 
improvement measures on a continuous basis. The relational NPS surveys are held biennially; the last survey was conducted 
in the previous year (2022) and the next survey is planned for the subsequent year (May-June 2024).

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of ABB India Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of ABB India Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 
December 2023, and the statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), statement of changes in equity 
and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 December 
2023, and its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements 
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

Revenue from fixed price contracts using percentage of completion method
See Note 2.6 and 2.3(a) to the financial statements
The key audit matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
Revenue from fixed price contracts are recognized in accordance with Ind 
AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and as detailed in note 
2.6 of the “significant accounting policies” in the financial statements.
There are key judgements and estimates involved in recognition of 
revenue relating to fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion 
method, which includes:
•	
Estimation of total contract costs and remaining costs to 
completion, which is a critical factor in measuring progress of a 
contract and amounts of revenue to be recognized;
•	
Evaluation of risks arising from operational delays, contract terms, 
changes in estimations, technical, legal, external environment etc. 
This requires the Company to estimate costs to capture such risks, 
including liquidated damages and warranties.
 
In view of the above and given the Company and its stakeholders focus 
on revenue as a key performance indicator, we determined this to be a 
key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following audit 
procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence:
•	
We assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting 
policies by comparing with applicable accounting standards.
•	
We understood the process on revenue recognition of fixed price 
contracts using percentage of completion method and tested key 
internal controls (both design and operating effectiveness) with respect 
to revenue recognition of such contracts on random sample basis.
•	
We performed analytical procedures on revenue recognised during the 
year on such contracts at segment level to identify unusual variances, if 
any, vis-a-vis previous year and discussed with designated management 
personnel.
•	
We performed substantive testing on the statistically selected samples 
of revenue transactions recorded during the year by testing the 
underlying documents and approvals.
•	
We evaluated management’s estimates over contract costs by 
performing analytical procedures on such estimates and discussed with 
designated management personnel.
•	
We performed a retrospective review for contracts completed during 
the current year by comparing the final outcome of the contracts with 
previous estimates made for those contracts to assess the reliability of 
the management’s estimation process.
•	
We tested provision for onerous contracts on statistically selected 
samples.
•	
We performed tests on whether actual costs have been accrued in 
the correct period, by testing the underlying documents for samples 
selected using statistical sampling.
•	
We tested the disclosures made in the financial statements
Recoverability of trade receivables 
See Note 2.12(a) and 2.3(c) to the financial statements
Trade receivables, including retention money with customers, forms a 
significant part of the financial statements. Management’s assessment of 
recoverability of trade receivables involves critical evaluation of all factors 
impacting recoverability including impact of external environment such 
as capability of customers to pay.
 
Management makes an impairment allowance for trade receivables on 
the basis of its assessment of recoverability of specific customers and 
on the basis of expected credit loss model for the remaining customers 
in accordance with Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. For the purposes 
of impairment assessment, significant judgements and assumptions are 
made, including assessing credit risk, timing and amount of realization, 
etc.
In view of the above, we determined this to be a key audit matter.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit 
procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence:
•	
We obtained an understanding of the processes implemented 
by management to estimate impairment provision against trade 
receivables.
•	
We tested key controls (both design and operating effectiveness) over 
management’s estimate of impairment loss on a random sample basis.
•	
We obtained and tested the appropriateness of ageing of trade 
receivables with the underlying invoices on a sample basis using random 
sampling.
•	
We obtained, discussed and tested management assessment of 
impairment for specific customers on statistically selected samples and 
discussed with designated management personnel.
•	
We evaluated the impairment model adopted by management to 
estimate the expected credit loss and tested related assumptions and 
computations. We corroborated management’s estimates based on 
past trends, available information and discussed them with designated 
management personnel.
•	
We have also involved specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of 
management’s expected credit loss model and related assumptions.

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The 
annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the applicable laws and 
regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
157
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparation of financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether 
the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s 
Report on the financial statements of 
ABB India Limited for the year ended 
31 December 2023
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even 
date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of ABB India Limited (“the Company”) as 
of 31 December 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 December 2023, based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
165
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the financial statements for 
the year ended December 31, 2023
1.	 Corporate Information	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
ABB India Limited (‘the Company’) has served utility and industry customers for over seven decades with the complete 
range of engineering, products, solutions and services in areas of Automation and Power technology. The Company has 
extensive installed base for manufacturing and a countrywide marketing and service presence. Besides catering to Indian 
domestic market, the Company is also playing an increasing role in the global market.	
	
	
	
The Company is a public limited company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of the Indian Companies 
Act. The registered office is located at Bengaluru. Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock 
Exchange (NSE).	
	
	
	
The financial statements are approved for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on February 20, 2024.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.	 Significant accounting policies
2.1	 Basis of preparation of financial statements	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
A	
Statement of compliance
	
	
	
	
	
These financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are prepared in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 notified 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('Act').	
B	
Functional and presentation currency
	
	
	
	
The financial statements are presented in INR in crores, rounded off to two decimal places, except when otherwise 
indicated.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
C	
Basis of measurement
	
	
	
	
	
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis of accounting, 
except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:	
	
	
	
• Derivative financial instruments	
	
	
	
• Fair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit obligations.	
	
	
	
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
2.2	 Use of estimates
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, 
judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Application of 
accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the 
use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 2.3. Accounting estimates could change 
from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made 
as management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates 
are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects 
are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis.	
	
	
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
172
2.3	 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
a.	
Project revenue and costs
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to estimate the costs expended to date as a proportion 
of the total costs to be expended. Costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as 
there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on 
uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected 
contract estimates at the reporting date.
b. 	
Provision for litigations and contingencies
	
The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable 
that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised 
when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the 
Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.
c. 	
Expected credit losses on trade receivables:
	
The expected credit loss provision on trade receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and 
expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the 
inputs to the expected credit loss calculation based on the Company’s history of collections, customer’s 
creditworthiness and market conditions at the end of each reporting period.	
	
2.4	 Current versus non-current classification	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. An 
asset is treated as current when it is:
•	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle	
	
	
•	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading	
	
	
•	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or	
	
	
•	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period	
	
	
•	
All other assets are classified as non-current	
	
	
	
	
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non- current as per the Company’s operating cycle and other 
criteria set out in Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained 
its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current and non- current classification of assets and liabilities, 
except for projects business. The projects business comprises long-term contracts which have an operating cycle 
exceeding one year. For classification of current assets and liabilities related to projects business, the Company uses 
the duration of the individual life cycle of the contract as its operating cycle.	
	
	
	
	
	
A liability is current when:		
	
•	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle	
	
	
•	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading	
	
	
•	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or 	 	
	
•	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period	
	
	
•	
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current		
	
•	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities		
	
	
	
	
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.

2.5	 Foreign Currency
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Functional currency 
The functional currency of the company is the Indian Rupee.	 	
	
Transactions and translations
	
Initial recognition transactions in foreign currencies are recorded by the Company at their respective functional 
currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates 
of exchange at the reporting date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.	
	
	
	
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are 
translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and 
non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the 
exchange rate prevalent at the date of the transaction.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net 
profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash flow items denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the 
transaction.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.6	 Revenue Recognition 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services 
rendered is net of variable consideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company as part 
of the contract  Revenue is stated exclusive of goods and service tax and net of returns and trade and quantity discount.
	
	
	
Revenue from sale of products is recognised on transfer of control of the products to the customers, which is usually 
on delivery of goods to the customer or as per contractual terms with the customer.
	
	
	
Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, in proportion that the 
contract costs incurred for work performed up to the reporting date bear to the estimated total contract costs. 
Contract revenue earned in excess of billing has been reflected under “Other current assets” and billing in excess of 
contract revenue has been reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the balance sheet. Full provision is made for 
any loss in the year in which it is first foreseen. Liquidated damages / penalties are provided for as per the contract 
terms wherever there is a delayed delivery attributable to the Company.
	
	
Revenue from services is recognised as per the terms of the contract with the customer using the percentage of 
completion method, in proportion that the costs incurred for work performed up to the reporting date bear to the 
estimated total costs.	
	
	
	
	
	
Revenue from the development services are recognised on a cost plus basis and billed in accordance with the terms of 
arrangement with the customer.	
	
	
	
Commission income is recognised as and when the terms of the contract are fulfilled.	
	
	
	
Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis, based on the underlying interest rates.	
	
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
174
2.7	 Income Taxes
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, or in other 
comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be 
paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted.	
	
	
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at 
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be 
realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which 
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the 
substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. 
	
The Company offsets tax assets and tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
	
	
	
2.8	 Property, plant and equipment  
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Such cost  includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are 
required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. 
Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and 
equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied.
	
	
	
	
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. The Company identifies 
and determines cost of each component/ part of Property, plant and equipment separately, if the component/ part 
has a cost which is significant to the total cost of the Property, plant and equipment and has useful life that is materially 
different from that of the remaining asset.
	
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is 
classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet 
date are disclosed under capital work- in- progress.	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line 
method. Based on technical evaluation, management believes that the estimated useful lives as given below best 
represent the period over which management expects to use these assets The estimated useful lives of assets are as 
follows:	 	
	
	
	
	
	
Useful lives estimated by the management in years: 	 	
•	
Leasehold improvements

ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
175
	
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end.	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal 
or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition 
of a property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the property, plant 
and equipment is derecognized.
	
	
2.9	 Intangible assets	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally 
generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is 
reflected in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The estimated useful 
life of assets in years are as follows:
•	
Technical know-how fees	
	
3-10
•	
Capitalized software costs	
	
3-5
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.	 	
	
	
	
	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life recognized on business combination are tested for impairment 
at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash generating unit to which the assets pertains is less than the carrying value.
	
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when 
the asset is derecognised.	
	
	
2.10	Borrowing costs		
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. 
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
	
	
	
 2.11	Inventories	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the 
sale.  The comparison of cost and net realisable value is made on an item-by-item basis. The cost of various categories 
of inventories is arrived at as follows:	
	
	
	
Stores, spares, raw materials, components and stock-in-trade - at rates determined on the moving weighted average 
method.
	
Goods in transit – at actual cost.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Work-in-progress and finished goods - at full absorption cost method which includes direct materials, direct labour 
and manufacturing overheads. Cost is determined on weighted average method.	
	
	
	
Provision for obsolescence is made wherever necessary.

2.12	Impairment
a	
Financial assets (other than at fair value)
	
The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
impaired. Ind AS 109 (‘Financial Instruments’) requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. 
The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not 
constitute a financing transaction. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount 
equal to the 12-month expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit 
risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. Additionally, the Company provides for 
impairment upon the occurrence of the triggering event.
	
The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on evaluation of the risk of default over the expected life of 
the receivables and expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past history of collections, 
customer’s credit-worthiness, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
	
b	
Non-financial assets
	
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
	
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.	 	
	
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate  that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair  value less cost to sell and the value-in-
use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to 
which the asset belongs.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable 
amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the statement of profit and loss if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of  the asset is 
increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization or depreciation) had no impairment 
loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.13	Cash flow statement
	
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of 
transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and 
item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities of the Company are segregated.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.14	Other income
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest 
method.

2.15	Provisions, contingent liability and assets  
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
General 
 	
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that is 
reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If 
the effect of time value of  money is material, Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at 
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
	
Warranty provisions
 
Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised when the product or services are  sold to the customer. Initial 
recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related costs is revised annually.
	
Contingent liability
	
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its 
existence in the financial statements.	
	
	
Contingent assets
	
	
Contingent assets are not recognised or disclosed in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset 
is not a contingent asset and are recognised.
	
Onerous contracts
	
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract 
is considered to exist where the Company has a contract under which the unavoidable costs (full cost basis) of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.	
	
2.16	Financial instruments
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.16.1	
Initial recognition
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial 
recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, that are 
not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.	
	
2.16.2	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
a. Non-derivative financial instruments  	
	
	
(i)	
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business where the 
objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of 
the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
178
(ii)	
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is 
held within a business where the objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity 
instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based 
on its business model. Further, in cases where the Company has made an irrevocable election based 
on its business model, for its investments which are classified as equity instruments, the subsequent 
changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.
	
	
(iii)	 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued 
through profit or loss.
	
		
(iv)	 Financial liabilities
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, 
for trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying 
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
(v)	
Derecognition
	
A financial asset is primarily derecognised when:
•	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
•	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.	
	
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the Company could be required to repay.	
	
	
b.	 Derivative financial instruments
	
	
	
	
The company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts 
to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these 
contracts is generally a bank. Commodity risk is mitigated by entering into future contracts to hedge against 
fluctuation in commodity prices.	
	
	
	
	
	
Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value through profit or loss
This category has derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges.
	
Although the company believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they 
may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either 
not designated a hedge or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial 
asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss.	 	
	
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other 
income / expenses. Assets/ liabilities in this category are presented as current assets/current liabilities if they 
are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Certain commercial contracts may grant rights to the Company or the counterparties or contain other 
provisions that are considered to be derivatives. Such embedded derivatives are assessed at inception of the 
contract and depending on their characteristics, accounted for as separate derivative instruments and shown 
at their fair value in the balance sheet with changes in their fair value recognized through profit or loss.	
	
	
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

2.17	Fair value of financial instruments
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Fair value hierarchy:  
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within 
the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
Level 1  -	 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 -	 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
Level 3 -	 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
2.18	Earnings per share
	
	
	
	
	
	
 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially 
dilutive equity shares.
2.19	Employee benefits
	
2.19.1	
Gratuity & Provident Fund - Defined benefit plans
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The present value of the obligation under defined benefit plans are determined based on actuarial valuation 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method. In case of funded plans, the fair value of the plan assets is reduced 
from the gross obligation under the defined benefit plans to recognize the obligation on a net basis.	
	
	
	
In case of defined benefit plans, remeasurement comprising of actuarial gains and losses is recognized in 
other comprehensive income (OCI) and is reflected in retained earnings and is not eligible to be reclassified 
to profit or loss.	 	
	
	
The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in 
statement of profit and loss:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
•	
Service cost including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements; and	
	
	
•	
Net interest expense or income.	
	
	
Provident fund has been considered as a defined benefit plan since any additional obligations on account of 
investment risk and interest rate risk are required to be met by the Company.	
	
	
	
	
	
2.19.2	
Superannuation - Defined contribution scheme
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Contribution to Superannuation Fund, is made at pre-determined rates to the Superannuation Fund Trust 
and is charged to the statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee renders the related 
services. There are no other obligations other than the contribution payable to the Superannuation Fund 
Trust.

2.19.3	
Compensated absences
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee 
benefits. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects 
to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Company presents 
the entire accumulated leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, since it does not have an unconditional 
right to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting date.
	
The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by 
an independent actuary at each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method on the additional 
amount expected to be paid/availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance 
sheet date.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
2.19.4	
Share based compensation 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The company recognizes compensation expense relating to share-based payments in net profit using fair-value 
in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-based payment. The estimated fair value of awards is charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the 
award was in-substance, multiple awards with a corresponding increase to share options outstanding account. 
 
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the Company measures the services acquired and the 
liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. The Company recognizes the services received, and a liability to 
pay for those services, as the employees render service. The liability is measured, initially and at the end of each 
reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the share appreciation rights, by applying an option pricing 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the share appreciation rights (SAR’s) were 
granted, and the extent to which the employees have rendered service to date. The liability is remeasured at 
each reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of the SARs. Any changes in the liability are 
recognized in profit or loss.
	
	
2.20	
Cash and cash equivalents	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purpose of statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cheque at hand and 
cash and deposit with bank.	
	
	
	
2.21	
Operating cycle	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
A portion of the Company‘s activities (primarily long-term project activities) has an operating cycle that 
exceeds one year. Accordingly, assets and liabilities related to these long-term contracts, which will not be 
realized/paid within one year, have been classified as current. For all other activities, the operating cycle is 
twelve months.
	
 	
2.22	
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
	
Non-current assets (including disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered 
highly probable.
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
cost to sell.
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised from the date when they are 
classified as held for sale.
	
An impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to 
fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognized for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an 
asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognized. A gain or 
loss not previously recognized by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognized 
at the date of de-recognition.
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
181
	
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as 
held for sale are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.
	
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and:
 (a) represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and;
 (b) is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations.
	
The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit and loss. 
The comparative statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the operation had been discontinued from 
the start of the comparative period.
	
2.23	
Leases
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for 
a period of time in exchange for a consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
•	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset;
•	
the Company had the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from use of the asset 
throughout the period of use; and the Company had the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
The Company as lessor
	
	
At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the 
consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices. When 
the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an 
operating lease.
	
The Company as lessee
	
The Company recognises a right-of-use asset (ROU) and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying 
asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
	
	
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Company 
by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a 
purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying 
asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the 
right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements 
of the lease liability.	
	
	
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental 
borrowing rate as the discount rate.	
	
	
	
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
	
-		
fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
	
-		
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at 
	 	
the commencement date;
	
-		
amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
	
-		
the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease 
	 	
payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension 
	 	
option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Company is reasonably certain not to 
	 	
terminate early.	
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
182
	
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the 
Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Company 
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a 
revised in substance fixed lease payment.	
	
	
	
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount 
of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has 
been reduced to zero.	
	
	
	
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
	
The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low value 
assets and short-term leases. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as 
an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company’s significant leasing arrangements are 
mainly in respect of land & buildings, plant & equipment and vehicles.
	
	
2.24	
Exceptional items
	
When an item of income/expense within profit and loss from ordinary activities is of such size, nature or 
incidence that their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of the Company for the year, the nature 
and amount of such items are disclosed as exceptional item.	 	
	
	
2.25	
Standards Issued but not Effective	
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable to the Company for the financial year starting from January 1, 2024, as 
below:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements
	
The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their 
significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material 
when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial 
statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial 
statements.	
	
Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes	
	
	
The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and 
decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in 
paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, 
on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company does not 
expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.	
	
	
	
	
Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors
	
The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The 
definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. 
Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are 
subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require 
items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Company 
does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.

Goodwill and CGU's impairment testing
The Company tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis as at 31 December. The recoverable 
amount of a Cash Generating Unit (‘CGU’) is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. 
The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the management. An average of the 
range of each assumption used is mentioned below.

Discount rate

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) which represents the weighted average return 
attributable to all the assets of the CGU. These estimates are likely to differ from future actual results of operations and cash 
flows.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Based on the above assessment, there has been no impairment of goodwill.

The sensitivity results above determine their individual impact on the plan's end of year defined benefit obligation. In reality, the plan is subject to 
multiple external experience items which may move the defined benefit obligation in similar or opposite direction, while the plan's sensitivity to such 
changes can vary over time.
The actuarial valuation of Interest Guarantee liability has been computed using the deterministic approach as outlined by the professional Guidance 
Note (GN) 29 issued by the Institute of Actuaries of India.

Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
	
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that 
are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed 
in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the 
Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. 
An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The carrying value of trade receivables, loans receivable, trade payables, other financial assets and liabilities, cash and 
cash equivalents and bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents are considered to be the same as their fair value, 
due to their short term nature.	
ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
201
	
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with banks/financial institutions. Foreign currency forward 
contracts are valued using valuation techniques which employ the use of market observable inputs using present value 
calculations. The model incorporates various inputs including the deal specific fundamental, market conditions, maturity 
period, transaction size, comparable trades, foreign currency spot and forward rates.

Financial risk management objectives and policies	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise lease liabilities, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these 
financial liabilities is to support its operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents and bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from 
its operations.
	
The Company is exposed to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks. The Company’s senior management is supported by a risk management committee that advises 
on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The risk management committee 
provides assurance to the Company’s senior management that the Company’s financial risk activities are governed by 
appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the 
Company’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist 
teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in derivatives 
for speculative purposes may be undertaken. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these 
risks, which are summarised below.
i.	
Market risk	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include trade payables, trade receivables and 
deposits.
	
Commodity contracts	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company uses commodity future contracts to hedge risk against fluctuation in commodity prices. The following 
are outstanding future contracts entered into by the Company as on December 31, 2023.

Foreign Currency Risk	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions, 
primarily with respect to the CHF, USD, SEK and EUR. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions 
and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not Company's functional currency (INR).

iii	
Credit risk	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Credit risk arises from cash held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to clients, including outstanding 
accounts receivable.  The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets.  The objective 
of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets. The Company assesses the credit quality of the 
counterparties, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(i) Trade receivables	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Trade receivables consists of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries.
 
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivable. Under the 
simplified approach, the Company does not track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance 
based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from initial recognition.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. The 
provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is 
adjusted for forward looking estimates. At year end, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
	
Individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade 
receivable and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss within other expenses.
	
Specific allowance for loss has also been provided by the management based on expected recovery on individual customers.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The provision provided in books for trade receivables overdue:

Management does not expect any significant loss from non-performance by counterparties on credit granted during the 
financial year that has not been provided for.
	
(ii) Other than trade receivables	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Management believes that the parties from which the receivables are due have strong capacity to meet the obligations 
and risk of default is negligible or nil and accordingly no provision for expected credit loss has been provided for.
iv.	
Liquidity risk	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank 
overdrafts and debentures. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable 
securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations 
when due and to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Company maintains 
flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.	
	
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted 
payments.

ABB INDIA LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 2023
214
A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a 
customer and hence is not a financial instrument. In Company’s contracts with customers, since the contractual right to 
payment arises only upon achievement of milestones specified in the contract, it is believed that the performance completed 
until the achievement of a particular milestone should be recorded as a contract asset under non-financial assets. 	
 
During the year, ₹123.16 crores (December 31, 2022 - ₹39.81 crores) from opening balance of contract assets has been 
reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Revenue recognized during the year from opening balance of contract liabilities amounts to ₹164.72 Crores (December 31, 2022 - 
₹135.06 Crores).	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
c)	
There is no revenue recognised during the year from the performance obligation that is satisfied in previous year (arising 
	
out of contract modifications).	
	
	
	
	
	
	
d)    Performance obligation on fixed price contracts	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The fixed price contracts are ordinarily presumed to consist of combined obligations which are not distinct in the 
context of the contract (i.e., single performance obligation). This is highly attributed to the long-term construction 
nature of the projects, whereby deliverables are typically highly interrelated and combined. The typical scope of turnkey 
contracts arrangements includes engineering, manufacturing, shipment, delivery installation, testing, erection and 
commissioning and civil works. Although there are several components to the overall scope of the contract, the turnkey 
contracts are generally considered one performance obligation.
e)	
Remaining performance obligations
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be 
recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize 
these amounts in revenue.		
	
	
	
	
	
	
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at December 31, 2023 is 
₹8,404.15 Crores (December 31, 2022 ₹6,468.71 Crores). The conversion to revenue is highly dependent on meeting the 
delivery schedules, contractual terms and conditions with customers, availability of customer sites, changes/ variation 
in scope/ prices etc. In view of these, it is not practical to define the accurate timing of conversion to revenue. However, 
it will be in a range of 1 to 3 years.
