Physical

security
Risk
BSE is one of the few public institutions of national 
importance in India.  It is synonymous with 
development of capital markets and investments in 
India. Considering its significance to the economy and 
people of India, it was the BSE building which was the 
first place of attack in the 1993 serial bomb blasts 
resulting in 84 casualties and hundreds of injuries. 
Since then, BSE has continuously been on heightened 
risk of another terror attack based on intelligence 
inputs.
Bollards/Crash Barriers are installed at 5 approach points to prevent 
vehicle from reaching the BSE premises. No vehicles (except 
essential services vehicles like Police, Cash Van, Ambulance etc) are 
permitted to enter BSE premises. The BSE building is guarded by 
4 levels of security including BSE's personal security and Mumbai 
Police. Periodical joint mock drills are carried out by Mumbai Police, 
Special Commandos and SRPF along with BSE security guards. 
Decoy attempts are carried out by Mumbai Police to check alertness 
of BSE security guards.

Investor Awareness
Opportunity
We believe, investor education and awareness is 
the key to the wealth and financial well being of the 
investors. Protecting the interest of the investors 
dealing in securities is one of the main objectives of 
BSE. The capital market can grow only when investors 
find it safe for them to invest and they are assured 
that the rules governing the market are fair and just 
to all the players.
The grievances of investors against listed companies and BSE Trading 
Members are redressed by BSE. BSE also assists in the arbitration 
process both, between Trading Members inter-se and between 
Trading Members and non - Trading Members.  With a view to ensure 
speedy and effective resolution of claims, differences and disputes 
between Trading Members inter-se and between Trading Members 
and non - Trading Members, BSE has laid down a set of procedures 
for arbitration thereof. These procedures are duly embodied in the 
Rules, Bye-laws and Regulations of BSE, which have been duly 
approved by the Government of India / Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI).
