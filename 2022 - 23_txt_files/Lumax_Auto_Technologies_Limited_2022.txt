24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
Risk
Opportunity
S. 
no.
Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Waste 
management
Handling and disposal of 
waste pose as a risk. Waste 
reduction together with 
enhanced circular economy 
and performance has added 
environmental benefits as an 
opportunity.
Disposal of waste through 
authorized recyclers.
Together with some 
negative implications, 
this would largely have a 
positive impact on cost-
cutting opportunities 
through waste management, 
as the manufacturing 
process generates waste as 
a by- product.
2
Water 
management
Reduction in consumption 
in the Company’s business 
processes.
This would have minor 
financial implications as 
the Company has already 
taken significant initiatives to 
reduce water consumption 
and recycle it efficiently 
in the past. Hence there 
seems to be little scope for 
further efficient use of water.
3
Climate and 
environmental 
action
Global warming and industry 
operation and transition risk.
Climate change and 
industry transition are 
now embedded in 
the Company’s risk 
management process.
There may be negative 
financial consequences 
of failing to implement 
mitigating strategies. 
However, the Company 
is committed to take all 
positive steps in the right 
direction.
4
Energy
Use of energy is inevitable 
part of the Company’s 
operations. However, 
efficient use and the 
implementation of the 
Company’s own renewable 
energy sources will help 
improve the Company’s 
operations.
Active energy management 
and transition to ISO 50001.
In the short-term, there 
may be negative financial 
impact on investing on Solar 
Generators; however, in the 
long-term there would be 
positive financial impact with 
methodical use of energy 
sources and aligning with 
the industry expectations.

Emissions
Challenging roadmap to 
address Scope 3 Green 
House Gases (GHG) 
emissions with respect to 
value chain partners.
Roadmap for Scope 1 and 
2 GHG emission is being 
designed with committed 
timelines. Furthermore, the 
collaboration for detailed 
strategies to address 
Scope 3 GHG emission 
for the entire supply chain 
of the Company will help 
address the issue in a 
progressive manner.
There may be negative 
financial consequences 
for failing to implement the 
designed roadmap and 
future strategies. However, 
the Company is committed 
to taking positive steps in 
the right direction.
6
Employee 
health and 
safety
In a Company, managing 
safety and health is an 
essential component 
of running a business. 
Therefore, businesses must 
conduct a risk assessment 
to identify hazards and 
risks in their workplace(s) 
and implement actions to 
successfully control them.
The Company’s commitment 
to continuous improvement 
in the areas of health and 
safety best practises around 
the world in accordance with 
its global SHE policy for all of 
its employees and workers.
There are several initiatives 
and programs that have 
been implemented to 
cover all aspects of health 
and safety management 
and are being actively 
monitored for continuous 
improvement.
There may be some 
financial investments in 
terms of taking measures 
for employee safety; that 
would, in turn have a 
significantly positive impact 
on employee health and 
their confidence in the 
Company’s culture in the 
long run, which would attract 
new talent and help retain 
existing employees.
7
Diversity and 
equality
Insufficient diversity across 
the group to find out the right 
talent to balance the diversity 
equation.
Improved hiring 
techniques, demonstrating 
the Company’s value and 
culture to attract a diverse 
talent pool.
There may be minor 
financial implications while 
strategizing improved hiring 
techniques and systems.
8
Community
Health and safety as a risk.
Talent attraction and 
retention as opportunity.
Socio-economic 
compliance.
Probable positive and 
negative financial impacts.
9
Employee 
engagement
Increased loyalty and 
productivity.
Neutral financial impact.

performance and capitalize

Ethics and 
compliance
Regulatory risk with respect 
to operating in multiple 
jurisdictions and cultures.
Healthy and safe 
environment and freedom of 
speech as opportunities.
Compliances with the 
Code of Conduct, Annual 
Ethics Training program, 
Grievance Redressal 
Mechanism and periodic 
Compliance Audits.
Probable and negative 
financial impact for 
regulatory breach.

diversification and value 
addition aligned with industry 
trends.Further, environmental 
aspects are to be considered 
in product design.
Positive financial impact.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Waste generation being an inevitable part of the manufacturing process, efforts have been made to create value from 
waste. With the aim of diverting a significant quantum of waste from going to landfills, the Company has adopted systems 
and procedures that helps repurpose used material and reintroduce excess material into the production process. The 
Company follows the ‘3R’ strategy of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle for its waste management. The Company also follows 
legally prescribed procedures and applies environmentally sound disposal techniques for disposing of the hazardous 
waste, whereas the non-hazardous waste is sold to the authorised recyclers, as identified by the Company. Further, to 
reduce the wastage of water, the Company has installed ETPs and STPs at 7 of its plants, wherein the Company reuses 
the treated water for gardening and other non-potable purposes. In addition to the above, the Company also optimizes 
its water consumption through rainwater harvesting at some of its plant locations.
