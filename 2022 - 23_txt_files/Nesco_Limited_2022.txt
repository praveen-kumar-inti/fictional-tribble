We have undertaken a detailed materiality exercise on ESG parameters in the reporting year which has been guided by 
ESG experts. The process involved peer benchmarking, interaction with stakeholder representatives within the 
management, executive leadership and business unit heads. Indicated below are material responsible business 
conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to 
our businesses. This includes all of Nesco's businesses including Indabrator.

Material issue

Energy and GHG 
Emissions 
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
(Risk): Climate Impacts are 
affecting society and businesses 
and as a Responsible Corporate 
Citizen, we are taking actions to 
minimize our impacts. 
(Opportunity): Green Buildings and 
low GHG emissions are important 
criteria for current and potential 
occupiers. Additionally, there 
would be a need to adapt to 
climate change. Focus on GHG 
Emission reduction here will enable 
a more resilient business.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt  or 
mitigate
We have started our GHG 
accounting (as discussed 
in Principle 6, Q 6) and 
some of our sustainability 
initiatives to reduce GHG 
emissions (Principle 6, 
Q7). We are also 
embarking on a green 
education initiative in 
collaboration with our 
occupiers
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
Positive: Proactive action 
will positively influence 
our brand, and 
occupancy rates, and 
improve customer 
attraction as well as lease 
renewals. Additionally, 
resource efficiency will 
improve our margins.

Waste and Water

Excellence &

Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
(Risk): Waste and Water 
Management helps address 
resource efficiency, ensure 
responsible disposal as well as 
address the challenge of water 
scarcity. There is a need to go 
beyond the regulatory risk of non-
compliance. Not following the 
compliance norms related to 
water/waste can impact occupier 
sentiment as well as approvals for 
future projects.
(Opportunity): We have identified 
opportunities to reduce waste, and 
water consumption and leverage 
recycling/reuse of both which will 
have a positive business outcome.
Health and Safety for our 
employees, workers, contractual 
workforce, as well as those of our 
occupiers, are crucial for us 
(Risk) - A significant quantum of 
labour for our businesses is 
provided by contractual labour on 
our premises and we need to 
ensure compliance as well as 
appropriate safety. 
Opportunity -Well-managed, 
diverse employees and workers 
who are appropriately 
compensated, engaged and 
provided opportunities for career 
growth ensure a productive and 
resilient workforce
Opportunity - We are improving 
our systems and governance 
mechanisms to further improve 
customer satisfaction across our 
businesses. Besides improving our 
operational agility to improve 
service levels and improve 
profitability we also see an 
opportunity in leveraging digital 
technologies.
In case of risk, 
approach to adapt  or 
mitigate
Our approach to Waste 
Management has been 
discussed in detail in 
Principle 6, Q9. Our 
approach to effective 
water management has 
been briefly discussed in 
Principle 6 Q3 and Q4
Additional Capex is 
planned for Organic 
Waste Composting to 
generate manure which 
also helps in our green 
cover and biodiversity.
Our Health and Safety 
Risk Management 
Processes are discussed 
in Principle 3, Q10 to Q15
The benefits, training, 
career development 
retention, safety and 
other aspects of human 
capital management are 
discussed in Principle 3
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
Positive - Reduced 
environmental Impact, 
reduced cost of 
operations and 
maintenance for us and 
the occupiers, addresses 
the risk of penalties and 
impact on brand 
reputation
Negative - Health and 
Safety incidents would 
affect employee/worker 
morale and impact our 
reputation
Positive - We have robust 
processes for our 
employees and workers 
and are further 
strengthening our 
governance mechanisms 
for contractual workers to 
ensure that we get 
positive outcomes
Positive: Operational 
efficiency will improve our 
bottom-line while 
customer centricity would 
enable resilient top line 
and improve reputation.

*The Leadership including the Chairman and Managing Director reviews the Company's policies every year. During this 
evaluation, the policy's effective implementation is assessed, and any policy or procedure adjustments needed are identified. If 
any amendments are needed, these are made and shared with the Board for approval.
**The Company complies with all legal responsibilities that are relevant to the principles, and in case of any non-compliances, 
the Chairman and Managing Director being responsible, ensures prompt action to rectify any issues.

Note: We continue to invest in capital expenditure to improve the environmental and social impacts of our business 
operations. The areas detailed above are aligned with our material topics. The nature of the commercial contracts and our 
current financial accounting systems do not allow an accurate numerical calculation of the percentage figure.
Nesco's sourcing practices and procedures adhere to sustainable sourcing principles. We are in the process of 
developing a more formal sustainable sourcing policy and framework for our key vendors and suppliers. Most of our 
suppliers and vendors are in reasonable proximity to our operating locations across Business Units and all our 
Business Units support local suppliers and disadvantaged communities. 
Our IT Park Business chooses suppliers and vendors (producers, traders, manufacturers, retailers, or service providers) 
that meet a wide range of sustainability metrics such as respecting basic human rights, worker Health and Safety, land 
use planning, and others. Our IT Towers are LEED-certified buildings and as such during the construction of additional 
facilities, we use sustainable materials and buy from vendors by considering the environmental impacts of production, 
community relations, etc. 
At Indabrator, input materials and components are sourced from certified partners who are compliant with standards 
such as ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, etc.

a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). 
If yes, the coverage such system?
At Nesco, we have built robust systems to address Occupational Health & Safety Management System (OHSMS), 
recognizing its criticality to our own operations and the interests of our occupiers and other stakeholders. Our policy 
framework currently has Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) and Fire Life Safety (FLS) policies, and we periodically 
assess the need for additional policies. These are supported with robust procedures including those for Care and 
Maintenance, Safety and Security, and Facilities Management. We have built standard operating processes (SOPs) 
covering a variety of aspects of Health and Safety within operational tasks including for example, 
garden/façade/equipment maintenance, facility management, etc.  We developed strong procedures and Covid-19 
precautions and restrictions during the pandemic which can be rapidly adapted to any new public health situation. 
Additionally, we have a remote monitoring system of STP water parameters, Lift visual inspection along with location, 
Exhaust and Ventilation, BTU (British Thermal Units) Monitoring for HVAC chilled water, Water Tank levels, Status of 
AHU (ON/OFF) along with filter cleaning status. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system includes safety and 
health and undertakes periodic reviews/assessments and provides action areas for improvement across our 
businesses. External third-party Audit and certification are in process for OHS ISO-45001.
Our Indabrator Business Unit complies with the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) 
relevant to the manufacturing sector. The OHSMS covers every employee of the organization, and the system is 
applicable at all work locations at Indabrator. 
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity? 
We conduct weekly onsite training for our housekeeping staff and monthly training for our engineering team on 
Occupation Health and Safety. Some of the key aspects covered include the identification of safety and work-related 
hazards as well as potential risks. We also have a periodic third-party audit process in place for a monthly inspection 
and reporting for all fire detection and suppression system installed. An annual third-party electrical and elevator audit 
is in place for complete electrical infrastructure health state check, energy efficiency measures, fire safety infrastructure 
operation, AMC contracts, and preventive maintenance. The half-yearly program for Reward and Recognition is done 
for all in the TFM (Total Facility Management) team and the parameters include safety-related aspects.  Besides these, 
there are walkaround inspections carried out by managerial staff and other senior personnel who actively assess safety 
risks on a non-routine basis. Our incident reporting and management system also helps in ensuring speedy mitigation 
and adaptation of systems towards improved safety.

Nesco | Believe
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
Since Indabrator is a manufacturing unit, it is relatively more prone to occupational hazards. To address these, we have 
robust systems and processes in place to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a regular and non-routine 
basis. The scope includes assessing factors like light, air, fumes, noise, ease of movement etc. across each section of 
the plant. Risks are assessed and prioritized for action based on significance. Our processes to assess and record 
hazards include mitigation and ensuring subsequent awareness and training on any necessary safety precautions or 
control measures. We have an internal method statement that elaborates on the safety systems in place and the 
significant health and safety risks that have been identified.
c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Yes/No) 
Yes, we have defined processes and multiple channels for quick and effective communication. We have a WhatsApp 
group which is for immediate capture and reporting of incidents. Incident reports are maintained at the site to report, 
track and address all work-related hazards. Instructions, awareness, and training programmes are periodically 
conducted for all stakeholders on reporting and removal from risks. This includes an appropriate reporting/escalation 
system on WhatsApp/telephone/e-mail to provide detailed incident reports to senior management depending on the 
urgency, sensitivity, and impact.
At Indabrator, there is a framework in place for people to report work-related hazards and remove themselves from such 
hazards. Workers are trained to identify any such work-related dangers and report them via the communication 
channels available at their specific workplaces including suggestion boxes on each floor. These are reviewed and 
addressed on priority. The forms are also in the local regional language (Gujarati) with a reward mechanism to 
encourage active participation from workers and the contractual workforce.
Half-yearly joint Fire Drills are conducted for all Offices and staff at Nesco as well as Indabrator plants to educate 
personnel for preparedness during emergency/Fire evacuation situations
d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
Yes. Employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services provided by company-
operated health care facilities as well as external healthcare facilities, which are appropriately compensated in 
accordance with business policy. As an employee-friendly workplace, we also provide access to a recreational area, 
gym. To deal with emergencies, we provide 24x7 access on our office premises to an ambulance service which 
associated with a nearby hospital.

13. Number of Complaints on the following made by employees and workers: 
For the Nesco business operations at Goregaon in Mumbai, we ensure adequate signage and risk identification and 
mitigation systems to ensure that workers, employees, visitors, and occupier’s employees are aware of all necessary 
precautions that need to be taken. Regular clients interaction and engagement process is in place with all licenses 
operating out of Nesco. Communication and awareness are shared with employees of clients on infrastructure, health, 
safety and recreation. Client’s third-party audits on occupational health and safety are conducted at regular intervals and 
no issues or gaps have been reported. Additionally, we provide regular training for the workers and employees who are 
responsible for maintenance and repair work aligned to work-related safety risks. 
There is a process of hot and cold work permit for all critical repair and maintenance work and no gas-based welding is 
permitted within Nesco. All refrigerants and fire detection and suppression system and emergency response systems are 
under AMC and audited by third-party. ISO 45001 certification for Occupational Health and Safety is in process. We also 
ensure adequate fresh air in all areas, CO2 sensors, lighting and appropriate air conditioning thereby providing a 
productive and healthy work environment. We also provide green spaces with landscaping while maintaining more than 
1,400+ trees having a high oxygenated capacity which provides a green and healthy environment for our stakeholders. 
There are multiple facilities like a gym, futsal, Badminton, Pool table, Food courts, etc on our premises. Periodically 
engagement activities are conducted in the form of sports, festivals and celebrations at Nesco Goregaon. We also have an 
on-site ambulance (24X7) which has a tie up with a nearby hospital for immediate medical response in case of an 
emergency which is accessible to our employees as well as those of our clients.
Due to the nature of our Indabrator business, one of the most important aspects of personal health and safety at the 
workplace is providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). We provide employees and workers with PPEs, to avoid 
various hazards in our manufacturing facilities. PPE includes gloves, protective hearing gear (earplugs, muffs), hard hats, 
goggles, etc. We also ensure appropriate housekeeping/cleanliness of our workstation and plant area to avoid accidents. 
Routine safety inspections are conducted, and any hazards identified are addressed immediately. We also conduct 
periodic Security checks and security audits.

assessments. Electrical Audit is handled by a 3  party and a 3  party FFS (firefighting 
system) maintenance is in place. Additionally, we have an In-house monthly maintenance 
schedule for critical systems and the Inhouse team undertakes daily and bi-monthly 
thermography for all critical systems. At Indabrator, Health and Safety Assessments are 
conducted annually by the certifying agencies.  
Working Conditions
100%, Working Conditions are routinely assessed by managerial staff, Human 
Resources and Leadership. Additionally, our grievance management mechanisms ensure 
that the feedback loop is closed with appropriate actions. Internal assessments are 
carried out for Health and Safety Practices as well as Working Conditions at Indabrator. 
Nesco has a high tonnage water cooled HVAC system. One of the critical electrical panels feeding power to the chilled 
water pump got overheated which was observed during a routine thermal check by the shift engineer. To mitigate risk and 
further improve our existing fire suppression system, we have installed terminal heating sensors and automated self-
activation fire extinguishers for individual panels as well as a thermal detection system using thermography for all critical 
panels. 
The safety incident recorded in Principle 3 Q11, involved a gate which fell down. We extended inspection to all the 
remaining doors and canopies of the site to avoid similar accidents in the future. A training session on hazard transmission 
was conducted for the entire team and an annual maintenance contract for periodic maintenance and checks was awarded 
covering all doors. We will conduct an inspection of all doors, taking into account all critical parameters every two months 
or three months. 
As an active business for many years, we have through our stakeholder-facing functions built a strong understanding of 
stakeholders who are impacted by and in turn influence our business outcomes. To further validate and improve this, we 
conducted a workshop with the leadership teams of each of our businesses with an external ESG consultant. The scope 
was expanded to include a variety of direct and indirect stakeholders including employees of occupiers as well as 
contractual and permanent workers and employees of service providers. We undertook peer benchmarking with 
stakeholders considered by industry peers as a cross-verification. These were subsequently prioritized for scope, mode 
and frequency of engagement. We are in the process of optimizing these engagements in line with the priority, influence 
and control, as well as our material ESG priorities.

The current scope of Human Rights for us are detailed in Principle 5, Q 4. Copies of the HR manual have been provided to 
managers and employees while policies are prominently displayed on notice boards. New employees on induction are

We have a robust grievance mechanism for all types of grievances including Human Rights issues. These are escalated to 
the complaints redressal committee which also handles POSH-related complaints.
There were no complaints related to Sexual Harassment, Discrimination at the workplace, Child Labour, Forced 
Labour/Involuntary Labour, Wages or other human rights-related issues in the reporting year.
We have a detailed POSH policy which is readily available for all employees. The policy helps ensure that the complainant is 
protected from any form of retaliation. This includes protection against any adverse actions or treatment based on the 
complaint, such as termination, demotion, or harassment. The policy provides for situations where provisions can be made 
for support to the complainant during the investigation and resolution process. This can include offering counselling 
services, granting leaves of absence, or making temporary arrangements to separate the complainant and the accused to 
ensure a safe working environment.
Human Rights clauses are currently included in some of the Leave and License Agreements. We are in the process of 
evaluating the specific human rights clauses that should be incorporated in our contracts with different categories of 
stakeholders.
There were no formal assessments on human rights that were carried out in the reporting year. Human Rights 
considerations are a part of the SOP for our workforce and feature in relevant contracts. We are in the process of 
rd
developing an internal audit/assessment protocol for future assessments and will be engaging a 3  party to support this 
exercise.

For our IT Parks, Foods, Events and Exhibitions businesses based out of Goregaon, BMC water bills are provided by the 
MCGM while STP plants process sewage and kitchen water discharge. The borewell water level and the STP water 
output are checked by the in-house team. A third-party agency is in place to carry out water quality testing for BMC inlet 
water, STP plant water (both inlet and outlet), and borewell water quality. 
 
We recognize the importance of water conservation in our business operations. We have installed rainwater harvesting 
systems at the Mumbai premises. We also have implemented appropriate measures for rainwater harvesting as per the 
Green Building norms. We have three STP plants of 500KLD, 300KLD, and 110KLD capacity. Sewage and sludge and 
water discharge are processed and used for flushing water and gardening. We have also invested in an irrigation system 
for water conservation for watering our gardens and landscape area and a water saving plumbing system with low-flow 
plumbing fixtures. At Indabrator, the water usage is only for domestic purposes (drinking and flushing). The plants are 
located in a greenfield area and wastewater is used for maintaining the green belt and agriculture in the nearby regions.

The GWP rates used are as per the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the grid 
emission factor is as per CEA CO2 Baseline Data. The emissions for Scope 1 are combined CO2 equivalents of GHG 
based on 100-year GWP based on fuel consumption (fugitive emissions and other GHG emissions are not factored in 
these calculations) and so these should be considered indicative. We have excluded the consumption of fuel in 
company-owned vehicles for this year. We have initiated accounting for Greenhouse gases (GHGs) to help us analyse 
areas where energy efficiency improvement is most required. Over time, we will be bringing in more nuanced reporting 
and will consider other elements and Scope 3 carbon accounting in due course.  This will guide us towards an improved 
understanding of our overall emissions and subsequent improvements. 
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external 
agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency.
Yes, GHG accounting calculations and evaluation have been done based on data provided by an external agency viz.; 
Sustainability and Strategy. This is not equivalent to an assurance.
We have initiated GHG accounting only from the current reporting year and as such our initiatives on energy conservation 
and green energy have given us GHG improvements.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
*We have BMC empaneled vendor for dry, wet and plastic waste disposal which ensures segregation into plastic, paper, 
cardboard, glass, etc. and is appropriately recycled. For example, plastic waste is eventually recycled into crude oil and 
fuel for use as feedstock for olefin cracking and transportation.
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external 
agency? (Y/N) If yes, name of the external agency.
Yes - Waste data is as per the Environmental Audit Report by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. Declaration and 
certification are taken for segregation and recycling of plastic waste disposed of by BMC empaneled vendor and e-
Waste vendor at Indabrator.  We are in the process of defining an audit/assessment protocol to ensure disposal by the 
vendor is as per the self-certification and will evaluate reporting of end-disposal methods.
At the IT Park, we have a rigorous process for the segregation of wet and dry waste to facilitate recycling and disposal 
through the OWC machine at Nesco. This facilitates the process of reuse, recycling, and recovery of waste. Firstly, there 
is segregation of waste at designated locations inside the complex. Secondly, it is segregated and put into wet and dry 
bins. For dry waste, we have an authorized vendor who collects it from our garbage disposal site and recycles it. At 
Nesco Foods there is a refrigerated garbage room and a dedicated area wherein the wet waste is stored and recycled 
through the OWC machine. We use Organic Waste Composting machines for wet and biodegradable waste to convert 
to manure which is used for gardening, upkeep, and maintenance of the MMRD outside NESCO as well as for the metro 
station landscape and plantation. We recycle the flush water in STP and generate 350 kg per annum of approximate 
sludge as manure at the site for gardening purpose. Organic Compost waste, which is used to enrich the soil for 
gardening purposes.  Plastics, E-waste, and Hazardous waste are collected, processed, and disposed of by a 
government-certified vendor who ensures appropriate further segregation by material type, recycling, and disposal. 
Our Nesco Foods uses bio-degradable Eco-ware & Paper products as disposable service ware in which all food is 
served. The empties are collected back in dedicated bins and disposed of through a proper Garbage Clearance 
Mechanism of BMC. There is a refrigerated garbage room and dedicated area wherein the wet waste is stored and 
recycled through the OWC machine. Approx quantity of wet waste processed per month is 250kgs. We have a BMC 
empaneled vendor for plastic waste disposal, mostly water bottles. Additionally, we carry out awareness drives 
including regular communication with all the clients to segregate the dry and wet waste for the disposal in the garbage 
area. 
At Indabrator, we dispose off the plastic waste and E-waste to a govt registered vendor. We do not generate hazardous 
waste at our units. Other wastes like wood or cardboard wastes are utilized for the manufacturing process at our 
foundry unit. Currently we do not have a mechanism to record this, but we plan to start monitoring data from financial 
year 2023-24.

We have a mechanism to collect formal (Notice, letter, e-mail, etc) and informal (verbal, in-person) feedback or 
grievances at our entry gates, staff/security.  These are reported to the immediate reporting manager i.e., a Security 
officer, Technical/Housekeeping manager, and Facilities Management based on the nature of the grievance on a 
WhatsApp group and telephonically. Minor incidents are addressed by the first level of escalation and the closure along 
with incident information and actions taken are communicated to the Standing Committee. If the grievance hasn't been 
addressed within the defined TAT, then the issue is escalated to the Standing Committee and subsequently to the 
Chairperson till it is appropriately addressed.
Since our Indabrator business operates in a greenfield area located far from any residential area, it does not affect any 
neighboring community and hence does not receive any grievances from the community. However, we maintain a 
register with our security personnel in case any such grievance were to occur.

For our IT Parks business which comprises the most significant spend, our suppliers are larger companies given the 
quality, scale and nature of goods and services required. We are in the process of evaluating our spend categories to 
explore expanding suppliers from MSME/Small Producers where possible in Events, Exhibitions and Foods businesses 
to promote inclusive and equitable economic growth. At Indabrator we have 64 MSMEs/ small producers for which 
input material is Directly sourced. Out of these 13 suppliers are from within the district and 51 suppliers from outside 
districts.
The Company is constantly striving to provide value to its customers through its products and services. Customer 
complaints are received through various channels such as letters, emails, phone calls, messages and meetings. The 
complaints are segregated into operational or contractual and allocated to appropriate departments. These are then 
systematically resolved by the relevant client-facing function in a time bound fashion as the first point of redressal. In 
case of any gaps or need for management intervention, these are escalated to the BU heads for further action or 
escalation to management if needed to expedite/obtain permissions for effective complaint resolution. We also conduct 
periodic meetings with customers to identify any challenges proactively. We also have customer feedback forms and 
surveys on various parameters related to the services/products to ascertain customer satisfaction and take focused 
actions for improvements.

The data we have access to is limited to that of our employees and operational interactions with customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders. We ensure adequate cyber security and data privacy norms are maintained as per the nature of 
information.  All data and information are classified into public/confidential/sensitive/personal to ensure that the user 
exercises appropriate care in ensuring its confidentiality. Any information shared outside the company has to be with an 
entity which also adheres to the highest standards and are compliant with IS/ISO/IEC 27001 or equivalent standards. 
We have a well-defined policy which includes user registration, user authentication and user responsibilities (including 
handling internal and external confidential information), access management and network access control. This policy is 
also extended to suppliers who are provided access from time to time. Our sensitive systems follow isolation protocols 
which limit access based on our risk analysis and they leverage the in-built security features of the system (including but 
not limited to e.g.; SAP, Tally, VMS, AUTOCAD etc). 
This policy is shared with employees in the employee induction as well as the employee manual and regular reminders 
on its key features and compliance expectations are shared via email. Suppliers when provided access to our networks 
are also educated about the policy to ensure compliance. We have also a well-defined grievance management system 
with an appropriate governance and escalation process.
