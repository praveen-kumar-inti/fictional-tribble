Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
We understand the importance of a hostile-free environment for enabling our employees to work efficiently. We are committed to 
protecting the rights of all our employees and workers and provide them with a work environment free of physical, verbal, or mental 
abuse. We also have “zero tolerance” for harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, 
pregnancy, age, national origin, disability, sexual harassment and/or other actions that might promote an objectionable or work 
intimidating environment, including unwanted or unsolicited sexual approaches. We have formulated and implemented a policy on 
prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace with a mechanism of receiving and redressing complaints and have formed a committee 
to supervise its smooth functioning. The policy also ensures that there are no adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination 
and harassment cases. As a matter of policy, we keep the complainant’s name anonymous.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes, all our plants are implementing various projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are constantly monitoring green energy 
production processes and outcomes, as well as the diligent implementation of emission reduction programs. Our aim has been to deploy 
wind and solar energy sources and to continually undertake multiple initiatives at facilities to reduce emissions. Emissions are reduced in a 
variety of ways at our plants through process innovation. Throughout our plants, we use the Kaizen philosophy (constant improvement). 
The following are some of the initiatives at our facilities
•	
At Chopanki and Bhiwadi, replacement of coal fired boilers with Gas fired boilers.
•	
We have created a green belt covering an area of approximately 4 lakh square meters in and around our largest facility in Bhuj thus 
expanding our greening project and have planted trees, bushes and grass in and around our Bhuj plant. This also resulted in many 
endangered species finding refuge in the vast ecosystem we established. There are 57,895 trees in total inside the Bhuj plant area 
and 43,059 trees outside the premises.
•	
Our diverse plant projects and green technology solutions decrease energy emissions leading to a reduction of carbon footprint.
•	
Use of Noltec carbon conveying system and foldable containers has resulted in reduction of plastic jumbo bags.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Our philosophy is “no waste leaving the premises.” Our aim is to evaluate all elements of our value chain and implement risk mitigation 
strategies as needed. At our plants, we identify and categorize the waste into two streams for effective segregation and disposal: 
hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste. There are separate storage areas for hazardous and non-hazardous waste. A procedure for 
handling hazardous and nonhazardous waste is in place to ensure effective monitoring and disposal. Further, to decrease waste, we 
have used a variety of measures such as selling non-hazardous garbage to a vendor for proper disposal and transporting our products in 
what our industry jargon refers to as “naked condition” which is a useful technique to minimize waste during the transit stage. Based on 
the principles of circular economy, the utilization of recycled rubber considerably improves our environmental performance. Rubberized 
friction fabric is recycled for making specific types of products.
