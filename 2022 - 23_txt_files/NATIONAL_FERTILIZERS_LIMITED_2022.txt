• In the FY 23-24, it 
is necessary to 
recycle all the 
100% plasƟc waste 
generated, which 
amounts to 
approximately 
16000 MT.
• As per latest draŌ 
NoƟﬁcaƟon dated 
06.10.21 on the 
maƩer, 35% 
recycling of PlasƟc 
Waste generated is 
required to recycle 
in year 2021-22 
and 70% in 2022-
23.
• However above 
will bring 
sustainability in 
the business thus 
considered as 
opportunity.
NegaƟve
• Urea is sold at GoI 
controlled price. 
AddiƟonal 
expenditure will 
impact the 
ﬁnancials of the 
company.
• EsƟmated 
expenditure for 
current year is 
about Rs 3 crore 
considering 100% 
recycle.
NFL has fulﬁlled 
recycling of PlasƟc 
Waste for the FY 
2021-22 & FY 2022-
23. However for 
current year 2023-
24 tender is being 
ﬂoaƟng to engage 
agencies 
accordingly. 
Risk 
PlasƟc waste 
Management rules-
2016 :
MOEF & CC has 
noƟﬁed “PlasƟc 
Waste Management 
Rule 2016 (amended)”
 wherein ferƟlizer 
manufacturing 
companies have to 
get registered with 
State PolluƟon 
Control Board/ 
Central PolluƟon 
Control Board as 
Brand Owner and 
prepare an acƟon 
plan on collecƟng 
back the plasƟc waste 
and its disposal.  
2.
NegaƟve
• NFL has 
completed the 
energy saving 
projects by March 
2022 leading to 
reducƟon of 
energy 
consumpƟon and 
reducƟon of 
carbon footprints 
by more than 
25%. 
Risk 
Tightening of 
Energy norms 
by DoF 
• It is expected that 
GoI will further 
Ɵghten energy 
norm by 2025 and 
in such a case, 
non-meeƟng of 
energy norms, 
company 
operaƟons shall be 
unviable. 
However there is 
opportunity to 
implement energy 
saving scheme 
measures & reduce 
carbon footprints.
• Already GoI has 
implemented 
revised target 
energy norms 
under NUP-2015 
for Nangal, 
Bathinda and 
Panipat from 
st 
1 April,2022 
whereas same has 
been implemented 
st
from 1  April, 2023 
for Vijaipur-I. 
• Further NFL has 
requested to DoF 
to exempt 
Vijaipur from 
NUP-2015 target 
energy norms. 
• To meet revised 
Norms of NUP-
2015, NFL has 
already spent 
more than Rs 
1000 Crore.
• However for 
further energy 
reducƟon, NFL is 
carrying out 
study through
