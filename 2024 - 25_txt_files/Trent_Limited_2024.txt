Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
for the year 2024-25
The Tata Group’s culture inherently embraces sustainability as a foundational value that is embedded in the strategic plans 
and operations of each of its companies. As a part of the Group, the Company is equally committed towards this front and 
strives to create enduring impacts on the environmental, social, and economic ecosystems that sustain our business and 
maximize value creation for all its stakeholders.
While we place strong emphasis on expanding our brand presence to meet evolving customer needs, we are responsible as 
both an employer and market player. Our commitment to nurturing a diverse portfolio of growth initiatives is reflected through 
our efforts to establish responsible practices across the value chain. We aim to develop a compelling portfolio of lifestyle 
brands, prioritizing responsible growth to meet the demands of the market.
Our Sustainability strategy is anchored in our overarching vision: Touch lives across choice markets with a portfolio of 
fashion & lifestyle brands that are fresh, responsible and bring joy to all. This vision propels us towards a future where 
sustainability forms an inherent part of everything we do, shaping our operations and driving positive impact across the value 
chain.
This strategy is underpinned by three strategic ESG pillars, namely, Be Resource Efficient, Be Responsible by Design and 
Be People Conscious. Each of these pillars addresses key material issues identified by the business and its stakeholders. 
Under these three pillars, we delve into forays of energy management, emission reductions, waste management, principles 
of circularity, product selection, fabric traceability, ethical supply chain, as well as social considerations such as people 
well-being, diversity & inclusion, and community development. These pillars serve as guiding principles for our operations 
and business practices, ensuring that our efforts are directed towards creating long-term value for the business and its 
stakeholders.
Our Sustainability agenda is driven by the Company through an internal Sustainability team consisting of cross-functional 
expertise under the oversight of the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability (CSR&S) Committee and the Board. 
The Risk Management Committee oversees our ESG risks and mitigation actions. Compliance is followed in letter and spirit 
integrating the Tata Code of Conduct into every facet of the business.

Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
Alongside sustaining business growth and financial performance, we remain steadfast 
in our dedication to building resilience, ensuring that our growth ambitions do not come 
at the expense of our commitments to our people and planet agenda. Our Sustainability 
agenda, anchored by the three pillars of: Be Resource Efficient, Be Responsible by 
Design, and Be People Conscious, serve as a guiding force for our choices.
Resource efficiency is central to our sustainability efforts. We continue investing in 
renewable energy and energy-efficient practices across our stores and distribution 
centers. Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) with smart energy solutions as well as 
energy efficient hardware such as high-lumen lighting and inverter ACs has helped in 
optimizing use of conventional power sources. Around 40% of the electricity demand 
at three distribution centers is met through renewable energy (through solar rooftops). 
Sustainable logistics continues to be a key priority, and we are making progress 
towards minimizing emissions associated with every garment shipped to customers. We 
embrace circular waste management practices, advocating for reduced consumption of 
materials, and promoting recycling and reuse within our operations. Use of plastic totes 
is an example of such a practice that eliminates use of single use cardboard boxes. 
Advancing product stewardship, we incorporate responsible material in Trent’s apparel 
that focuses on Responsible by Design pillar. Vendor Code Conduct that provides a 
framework for ethical and responsible business practices by the value chain partners, 
was rolled out during the year to the vendors.
Our social efforts are guided by the Be People Conscious pillar. The well-being, 
professional growth, and safety of our workforce take precedence above all else. As 
advocates for equal opportunities, we uphold fair and equitable hiring procedures. 
Furthermore, we are dedicated to implementing certified health and safety protocols, to 
foster a safe workplace environment.

In addition to adhering to the principles outlined in the TCoC, Trent’s operational framework is bolstered by a comprehensive 
set of governance policies. These Policies, meticulously crafted and regularly updated by the Senior Management Team and 
periodically reviewed by the Board, serve as foundational pillars that underpin our operations and guide decision-making 
processes.
A brief description of some of these Policies is provided below. The said Company Policies are available on the website of the 
Company at https://trentlimited.com/pages/policies 
Whistleblower Policy: This policy serves as a platform for employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to express 
concerns related to unethical business conduct or actions that may be perceived as inconsistent with Tata values.
Anti Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy: This policy is designed to safeguard the Company against involvement in any bribery, 
facilitation payments or corruption, even unintentional.
Anti Money Laundering Policy: The purpose of this policy is to prevent the Company from being involved in any form of money 
laundering, even unintentional.
Dividend Distribution Policy: This policy guides decision making with respect to distributing dividends while ensuring fairness, 
sustainability and consistency in distributing profits to shareholders.
Remuneration Policy: This policy provides a framework for the remuneration of Directors, Key Managerial Persons, and other 
Senior Managerial employees of the Company.
Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices: This outlines the requirement for the Company to ensure timely, adequate, uniform, 
and universal dissemination of information and disclosure of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, in compliance with 
regulations.
Materiality Policy: This policy ensures that events and information that the Board considers significant and warranting disclosure 
are reported to the stock exchanges within an appropriate timeframe. It provides guidelines to determine and publicly share 
events or information that could have a material impact on the Company’s performance and share price.
Trent’s Environment, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) Policies focus on its environmental, social commitments as well as 
corporate social responsibilities. These Policies are crafted based on the nine principles of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability under the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct. These policies are also aligned with the 
industry best practices, designed to mitigate risks and act as key enablers of Trent’s sustainability strategy across the three 
pillars.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
We have implemented several circular waste management practices, wherein waste generated within the Company 
is recycled or repurposed to produce new products that may even be re-integrated into our daily operations. Our 
processes to manage various types of waste include:
	
(a)	
Plastics (including packaging): The Company uses plastic and cardboard cartons for packaging products; 
however, these materials are removed before the items reach customers, as products are sold unpackaged. To 
support environmentally responsible waste disposal, the Company has partnered with a plastic recycling vendor 
registered under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. This partner facilitates plastic packaging 
recycling and ensures proper management and recycling of paper-based materials, including cardboard. 
	
(b)	
E-waste: As part of our commitment to environmental responsibility, all electronic waste generated across our 
operations is managed through a certified e-waste disposal partner. This ensures compliance with safe disposal 
standards and minimizes the environmental impact of electronic disposals.
	
(c)	
Other waste: By replacing single-use cardboard boxes with reusable plastic totes in our supply chain, we will 
have significantly reduced packaging waste, promoted multiple use, and supported more efficient, low-impact 
logistics operations.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, take steps to address the same.
	
Yes. The Company is registered as the Brand owner and Importer on EPR portal of Central Pollution Control Board 
(‘CPCB’). The waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to CPCB.
	
The Company has taken several measures to address the responsible disposal of plastic waste generated in our stores 
and distribution centers. We collaborate with vendors for waste collection and recycling. Further, to advance circularity, 
we purchase biodegradable bags, recycled cardboard, and paper from them. Additionally, we have rice-paper bags as 
an option to LDPE plastic bags and use recycled paper tags on our products.
	
Our commitment to sustainable waste management also encompasses waste diversification initiatives. For example, 
fabric waste from apparel production is transformed into Do Good Bags, providing opportunities to women from 
marginalized communities to build livelihoods and improve their lives. This initiative has reached around 7 Lakh 
customers lives and helped prevent fabric waste from reaching landfills. Additionally, this initiative also resonates with 
our evolving customers who prioritize investing in businesses that contribute positively to the planet and society.

Trainings on Safety
Timely and regular safety training is essential for minimizing accidents among the employees. These sessions provide 
valuable insights into their working environment, potential risks and effective prevention measures. As a critical component of 
the identification and management of workplace risks, employees receive Health and Safety training as part of the induction 
Company Overview / Statutory Reports / Financial Statements / Notice 
process when joining the Company. Additionally, they are trained to follow the Safety Reporting System to raise alerts about 
unsafe conditions on iSafe, the Incident Reporting application.
Moreover, the Company’s associates undergo training to ensure they understand the process and importance of reporting all 
incidents and injuries to the health and safety team. This proactive approach aims to prevent unsafe behavior, address unsafe 
conditions in the workplace and mitigate the occurrence of adverse incidents. Women’s Safety Training, Two-Wheeler Safety 
Training and Fire & First Aid Safety Training are the major trainings provided to all employees.
The employees are also imparted training on the Tata Group’s Accelerated Reduction in Repeat Events (‘ARRE’) for enhanced 
H&S awareness, air quality monitoring, water quality testing, ergonomics review etc. and quarterly servicing of air conditioning 
filters. Ensuring luminosity at workstations is above compliance standards.

speak up. Feedback thus taken is acted upon and necessary remediation measures are instituted. Any complaints or 
instances filed through the ethics redressal mechanism, functional heads, or third-party portal are promptly taken up by 
the relevant individuals or committees.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Recognizing the need to address the responsible disposal of plastic waste generated in our stores and warehouses, we 
have collaborated with vendors for waste collection and recycling. We have officially registered as the brand owner and 
importer on the EPR portal of the CPCB.
	
In line with our dedication to circularity and reducing our environmental footprint, we procure biodegradable bags, 
recycled cardboard and paper from our suppliers. Embracing innovation, we use rice-paper bags as an eco-friendly 
alternative to traditional LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) plastic bags and utilize recycled paper tags on our products.
	
Our efforts in being resource efficient are supported by our commitment to creating circular economies. The principles 
of reduce, repurpose/reuse, and recycle underpin our approach to managing waste generated in our operations 
sustainably. Further, a centralized waste management system that enables improved traceability of waste supports our 
endeavors to segregate and dispose different types of waste appropriately. While hazardous waste is safely disposed 
through authorized vendors, non-hazardous waste is either recycled, or safely disposed through appropriate channels.
	
The Company is taking strides to minimize paper waste by re-considering the use of cardboard boxes in its logistics 
fleet. Instead, we are exploring innovative alternatives such as plastic totes for transporting goods to reduce paper 
waste.

such incidents are mitigated.

handling of personal data through e-learning, internal audits and other activities. We are in process of aligning with the 
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
	
Implementation of internal information security audits
	
We regularly conduct internal information security audits to verify that security measures are functioning effectively, in 
accordance with relevant laws and internal regulations and policies. We also conduct annual cyber security maturity 
assessments to assess ourselves in relation to the industry benchmark.
	
Enhancement of information security awareness
	
Our employees, contract employees, and third parties are provided security education/training so that everyone dealing 
with our information assets can maintain their integrity. Also, we continue to train our employees to respond to changing 
information security circumstances.

Independent Assurance Statement to Trent Limited on select non-financial sustainability disclosures in the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the financial year 2024-25.
Introduction and objective of engagement
Trent Limited (the ‘Company’) has developed its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) (the ‘Report’) 
based on the BRSR reporting guidelines including the BRSR Core indicators prescribed by SEBI for listed entities. The 
reporting criteria have been derived from the Principles of National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC), 
and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
BDO India LLP was engaged by the Company to provide independent assurance on BRSR Core indicators of the Report that 
includes the Company’s performance for the period 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. 
The Company’s responsibilities
The Report content and its presentation are the sole responsibilities of the management of the Company. The Company 
management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation 
of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement.
BDO’s responsibilities
BDO’s responsibility, as agreed with the management of the Company, is to provide reasonable assurance on the non-financial 
information of the BRSR Core indicators as described in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’ section below. We do not accept 
or assume any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organization. Any reliance a third party may place 
on the Report is entirely at its own risk. 
Assurance standard
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 
3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and ISAE 3410, 
“Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement” issued by the International Auditing and Standards Board. We 
applied the criteria of ‘Reasonable’ assurance.
Scope & boundary of assurance
We have assured non-financial information of the BRSR Core indicators1 in the Report, pertaining to the Company’s performance 
for the period 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. 
The reporting scope and boundary cover the Company’s operations. Verification of non-financial sustainability performance 
data, based on our professional judgment was conducted at the following sites, on a sample basis: 
-	
Corporate Office, Mumbai
-	
Backoffice, Pune
-	
Distribution Centre- Vapi, Gujarat
-

-	
Westside (W096), Bangalore, Karnataka
-	
Zudio (Z575), Chennai, Tamil Nadu

Assurance methodology
Our assurance process entails conducting procedures to gather evidence regarding the reliability of the disclosures covered 
in the assurance scope. We conducted a review and verification of data collection, collation, and calculation methodologies, 
1SEBI vide SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023
Independent Assurance Statement
Company Overview / Statutory Reports / Financial Statements / Notice 
and a general review of the logic of inclusion/ omission of relevant information/ data in the Report. Our review process included:
	
Evaluate and assess the appropriateness of the quantification methods used to arrive at the non-financial sustainability 
information of the BRSR Core indicators in the Report;
	
Review of consistency of data/information within the report as well as between the Report and source;
	
Engagement through discussions with personnel at both corporate and business unit levels who are accountable for the 
data and information presented in the Report;
	
Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription, and 
aggregation;
	
Review of data collection and management procedures, and related internal controls.
Limitations and exclusions
There are inherent limitations in an assurance engagement, including, for example, the use of judgment and selective testing 
of data. Accordingly, there are possibilities that material misstatements in the sustainability information of the BRSR Core 
indicators in the Report may remain undetected.
The assurance scope excludes:
	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2024 to 31st March 2025);
	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which reporting is based; 
we have been informed by the Company that these are derived from the Company’s audited financial records; 
	
The Company’s statements and claims related to any topic other than those listed in the ‘Scope & boundary of assurance’;
	
The Company’s statements that describe the qualitative/quantitative assertions, expression of opinion, belief, inference, 
aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intention.
Our observations 
We have reviewed the disclosures in the “Report” for the reporting period from 1st April 2024 through 31st March 2025. The 
disclosures of the Company, covered under the ‘Scope and boundary of assurance’, are fairly reliable.
Our conclusion
Based on the scope of our review, we conclude that the non-financial sustainability disclosures as mentioned in ‘Scope and 
boundary of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability.
