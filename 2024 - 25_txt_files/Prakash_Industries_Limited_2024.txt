Inclusion & Diversity
 
 
Prakash Industries Limited is committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace that supportsequal 
opportunity and encourages representation from all sections of society. Under its Inclusion & Diversity pillar, the 
Company aims to create a respectful, supportive, and empowering environment for all employees, irrespective of 
gender, physical ability, or background.
 
 
1. Gender Diversity
 
 
 
The metals and mining sector, due to its inherent structural challenges, has traditionally seen lower female 
participation in its workforce. Cultural perceptions, a lack of representation, and limited gender-sensitive 
infrastructure have contributed to this trend. Prakash Industries acknowledges these challenges and has taken 
proactive measures to gradually shift this paradigm. Despite the slow pace of transformation, the Company is 
consistently working towards improving female representation by creating more opportunities for women, 
especially in roles such as healthcare support (nursing) and in corporate and administrative functions. 
Dedicated eﬀorts are being made to promote a gender sensitive work environment, with equal access to growth 
opportunities, training, and compensation.
 
 
2. Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

Water
Management
Risk and
Opportunity
Increasing water stress in 
regions like Chhattisgarh 
and Odisha may impact 
long-term water availability.
Recycling through STP and 
ETP, along with zero liquid 
discharge, strengthens 
water eﬃciency and 
regulatory compliance.
The company 
ensures optimal use 
of water through 
continuous 
monitoring and 
conservation eﬀorts. 
Treated water is 
recycled through STP 
and ETP, and the 
plant maintains Zero 
Liquid Discharge 
status. These 
measures strengthen 
resilience and reduce 
freshwater 
dependency.
Positive and Negative
Occupational
Health &
Safety
Opportunity
Implementation of ISO 
45001:2018, regular safety 
trainings, and robust safety 
systems promote a culture 
of well-being and minimize 
workplace incidents, 
enhancing workforce 
productivity and 
compliance.

Employee
Development/
Well-being
Risk and
Opportunity
Evolving workforce 
expectations highlight the 
need to broaden skill 
development eﬀorts across 
all employee groups to 
maintain high engagement 
and operational excellence.
Regular trainings, structured 
career development, and 
employee engagement 
initiatives support retention, 
motivation, and productivity.
Positive and Negative
We are exploring 
opportunities to 
diversify our energy 
mix by evaluating 
renewable options, 
while continuing to 
expand eﬃciency 
measures such as 
waste heat recovery 
(WHR) and high-
eﬃciency equipment. 
In addition, we 
conduct regular 
energy audits and 
implement the

Energy /
Renewable
Energy
Risk and
Opportunity
Continued dependence on 
fossil-based captive power 
may face economic and 
regulatory headwinds under 
evolving carbon pricing or 
ESG-linked funding 
frameworks.
Enhancing energy eﬃciency 
through WHR and other 
measures oﬀers cost 
savings and supports low-
carbon transition.
The company is

while continuing to 
expand eﬃciency 
measures such as 
WHR and high-
eﬃciency equipment.
Positive and Negative
Air Pollution
Opportunity
Deployment of pollution 
control technologies like 
bag ﬁlters, scrubbers, 
ESPs, and dry fog systems 
enhances air quality and 
ensures ongoing 
compliance with regulatory 
norms, contributing to a 
safer and cleaner work 
environment.
Positive
Human Rights
and Labour
Practices
Risk and
Opportunity
Strengthening human rights 
governance across the 
value chain is becoming 
increasingly important, as 
evolving stakeholder 
expectations and regulatory 
scrutiny may pose 
reputational or compliance 
risks in the absence of 
formal due diligence 
mechanisms.
By improving working 
conditions, wages, and 
safety standards, we can 
attract better talent, reduce 
employee turnover, and 
enhance productivity. 
Respecting labor rights 
fosters a more loyal, 
engaged, and healthier 
workforce.
Negative (with potential
to become positive as
practices are improved)
The Company is in 
the process of 
integrating human 
rights clauses into 
supplier agreements 
and developing a 
comprehensive 
framework for supply 
chain due diligence, 
in alignment with 
global best practices.
The Company is also 
conducting training 
programs for workers 
in high-risk areas, 
monitoring their 
activities to ensure 
safe work practices, 
and providing 
adequate personal 
protective equipment 
(PPE). A strict policy 
enforcing a 100% 
ban on child labor 
has been 
implemented, which 
is expected to 
enhance worker 
satisfaction and 
signiﬁcantly reduce 
industrial accidents.

(HR) manual, and 
formalize a human

Systems, Venturi Scrubber Systems, Dust Suppression Systems, 
and Higher Stacks to reduce particulate emissions. The Company 
has also deployed Online Continuous Emission and Eﬄuent 
Monitoring Systems (CEEMS) to ensure real-time monitoring of 
environmental parameters. Substantial capital has been allocated 
to strengthening eﬄuent management through the augmentation 
of the Eﬄuent Treatment Plant (ETP), including additional 
treatment facilities, and the construction of water recirculation and 
spray systems. Further infrastructure enhancements include the 
installation of rainwater and roof water harvesting systems, spout 
installations, dust collectors, and water sprinklers in the Coal 
Handling Plant (CHP).
In line with energy eﬃciency goals, the Company has invested in 
Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), high-eﬃciency motors 
(IE3/IE4), condensate recovery systems, power factor 
improvement panels, and thermal storage systems. Upgrades to 
facility lighting through LED replacement and integration of 
motion/daylight sensors have further optimized power 
consumption. Additional improvements include HVAC 
optimization with energy-eﬃcient chillers, insulation of hot 
surfaces, eﬃcient pumping systems, and building envelope 
upgrades. The Company has also undertaken a large-scale green 
belt development initiative, including the plantation of over 10,000

The Company is committed to the principles of circular economy 
and sustainable waste management. It follows the philosophy of 
"Wealth from Waste," aiming to reuse and recycle byproducts and 
wastes generated during the steelmaking process to the 
maximum extent possible. The processes in place for diﬀerent 
waste categories are as under:
 
(a) Plastics (including packaging):
 
 
Plastic waste is not applicable to the Company, as plastic 
is not used in the manufacturing process.
 
(b) E-waste:
 
 
E-waste generated from the plant is disposed of through 
authorized re-processors and vendors approved by the 
appropriate authorities.
 
(c)  Hazardous Waste:
 
 
Hazardous waste, mainly comprising used oil and waste 
oil, is 100% sold to authorized dealers for further recycling.
 
(d) Other Waste:
 
 
The Company believes in creating wealth from waste and 
has adopted several initiatives to reuse and recycle 
various byproducts and waste generated in the 
steelmaking process.
 
 
Slag from the Steel Melting Shop and Ferro Alloy Plant is 
processed in a Metal Recovery Plant to recover valuable 
metal for reuse in steelmaking. The remaining slag is 
reused in road construction and for ﬁlling abandoned 
mines.
 
 
Mill Scale from SMS, Accretion, and Cooler Oversize 
Material from the DRI plant are used in the production of 
ferro alloys.
 
 
Fly ash from the Power Plant is utilized for making ﬂy ash 
bricks and is also supplied to cement plants.

Waste management practices adopted in the establishment:
 
 
Brieﬂy describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
 
In the process of sponge iron production, coal is used to generate the heat and chemical reaction necessary for 
removing oxygen from iron ore. During this metallurgical reaction, along with sponge iron, coal char and ﬂue gas are 
generated as by-products of the DRI process. To utilize this waste, coal char is used as a fuel for power generation in 
the captive power plant. By using char in power generation, the Company saves a proportional amount of coal, 
thereby contributing to the conservation of natural resources and maintaining a cleaner environment.
 
 
To further optimize resource use, the Company has installed a Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) to generate 
power using the ﬂue gas from the DRI process.
 
 
In the steel-making process via Induction Furnace, slag is generated, which contains iron particles mixed with non-
metallic residues. To recover these metal particles, a magnetic slag crusher has been installed. Approximately 10% 
of the metal content is recovered and reused in the induction furnace for steel production, thereby conserving raw 
materials. The remaining portion of slag is utilized for levelling work, road construction, and similar applications.
 
 
Waste generated from the power plant, primarily ﬂy ash, is used in brick/block making, road construction, and 
various concrete applications. Fly ash is also disposed of in abandoned mines. The Company operates a ﬂy ash 
brick manufacturing plant within its premises, and these bricks are used in all types of construction activities at the 
plant. In addition, ﬂy ash is also disposed of in low-lying areas using safe and scientiﬁc methods for handling, 
transportation, and dumping.
 
 
Through these practices, the Company eﬀectively utilizes waste as a source of energy and raw material, thereby 
reducing environmental pollution and conserving natural resources.
