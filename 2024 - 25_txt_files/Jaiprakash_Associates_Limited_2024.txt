a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Y/ N).  
	
	
Yes - The Company has developed and institutionalized internal processes to ensure that the sources and means of 
transportation of the raw materials and components which are input to the different projects are sustainable in the 
long-term. The Company evaluates its major suppliers and contractors to ensure that they are in compliance with 
legal and environmental norms in their business activities. 
	
	
The Engineering and Construction Division of the Company primarily undertakes large-scale projects that require 
specialized machinery and equipment, many of which are imported in order to meet the stringent quality parameters 
that are adhered to. The raw materials such as cement, steel and construction chemicals, etc. that go into the 
construction projects are also sourced from reputed national firms. Wherever possible, and with all other factors 
remaining equal, the Company prefers to procure raw materials and spare parts from vendors and dealers that are 
nearest to the project sites. Local markets are continuously explored and encouraged to arrange for material suitable 
for construction. At many of the Company’s ongoing project sites – Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, 
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana State, Bhutan and Nepal – the Company endeavours to hire the manpower locally, as 
far as possible. 
	
	
In the Cement Division, majority of the total stores & spares procured are from local suppliers. The Company 
undertakes Annual Rate Contract agreements with suppliers in order to provide them with certainty regarding the 
volumes required, and to avoid recurring tendering for regularly procured materials. The Company has always 
followed the philosophy of ‘Reduce, Reuse and Recycle’, wherever practically feasible. In Cement Division, for 
example, fly ash, which was earlier considered as industrial waste, is now being recycled and used as a process 
material in the cement plants. Around 30% of fly ash used in PPC grade is either generated from the captive power 
plants, or purchased from the market. This reduces the clinker requirement by about 30%. 
	
	
In the Hospitality Division, during the year 100% of procured materials were sourced from local suppliers.
	
	
Within the Engineering and Construction Division, due to the nature of the business, there is limited scope for the 
recycling of products. However, all the Company’s project offices make use of a significant level of reusability – the 
camps and workshops that are erected at each of the sites are made almost entirely of dismantled materials and 
components taken from earlier project sites. The individual elements like doors and window frames are designed in 
such a way as to be sturdy, and also be easily reusable. Excavated materials, stones and boulders are reused for the 
back-fill and construction activity, and any steel scrap is disposed off to agencies for re-rolling.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Presently, no data is available of the percentage of inputs which were sourced sustainably.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste. 
	
The company maintains safety norms at all its sites, which ensures the implementation of safe waste management 
practices. External auditors conduct audits to verify ongoing compliance and adherence to environmental standards.
	
At plants, hazardous waste is collected and stored in empty drums and barrels, which are then kept in a covered shed within 
an isolated and fenced area. This storage method follows the guidelines outlined in the Hazardous Waste (Management, 
Handling, and Transboundary Movement) Rules. 
	
(a) 	
Plastics (including packaging) : Plastic waste is disposed off through authorized vendors. 
	
(b) 	
E-waste: E-waste is disposed of through Agencies possessing E-waste Licence issued by State Pollution Control 
Board. 
	
(c) 	
Hazardous waste: Hazardous waste is disposed of through Agencies who are authorized to reprocess Hazardous 
waste/possessing Licence for the same, issued by State Pollution Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board.
	
(d)	
other waste: Use of Organic Waste Converter / composter to treat wet garbage & recycle Compost pits for diverting 
landscape waste

Yes, Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the Cement Plants. The cement plants are registered
