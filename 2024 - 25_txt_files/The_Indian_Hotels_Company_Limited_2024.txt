Climate 
Strategy
Risk
IHCL recognizes the significance of addressing 
climate change, which poses various risks and 
offers opportunities crucial for the sustainability 
of its business. The company is aware of climate-
related risks such as regulatory changes, resource 
shortages, and physical damage to assets. 
Consequently, IHCL is committed to embedding a 
comprehensive Climate Strategy within its business 
framework. This approach to climate resilience 
guarantees adherence to regulations, continuity of 
operations, and safeguarding of assets.
IHCL's climate strategy is highlighted by the adoption of 
renewable energy (RE), the implementation of energy-
saving measures, and other resource-saving initiatives. 
The company is transitioning to renewable sources 
such as solar and wind to power its operations, thereby 
decreasing dependence on fossil fuels and lowering 
emissions. Concurrently, IHCL is modernizing its facilities 
with energy-efficient technologies, including advanced 
HVAC systems, lighting, and intelligent building solutions 
to reduce energy use. The IHCL Business Continuity and 
Disaster Response Plan has been established to ensure the 
uninterrupted functioning of essential business processes 
and the safety of guests and employees during unforeseen 
events or disasters. These measures not only address 
climate-related risks by boosting operational resilience 
and efficient use of resources but also establish IHCL 
as a frontrunner in eco-friendly hospitality, dedicated 
to diminishing its ecological impact and meeting the 
sustainability expectations of guests and stakeholders.
Negative implications
Opportunity
At the same time, the company capitalizes on 
opportunities for gaining a competitive edge by 
implementing energy-saving practices that lead 
to cost reductions, elevate the brand's reputation, 
encourage innovation, and resonate with the rising 
consumer demand for environmentally friendly 
tourism experiences. Furthermore, IHCL's Climate 
Strategy reinforces its dedication to engaging 
with stakeholders by fulfilling the environmental 
standards expected by guests, attracting skilled 
individuals, and benefiting local communities. By 
actively transitioning to a climate-aware approach, 
IHCL not only reduces the risks linked to climate 
change but also seizes the chance for market 
distinction, securing enduring business success 
and enhancing shareholder value in a world that is 
increasingly prioritizing sustainability.
Positive implications
Emission 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
For IHCL, managing emissions and energy 
consumption presents a significant opportunity 
for cost savings, adherence to regulations, and 
brand improvement. Through the adoption of 
energy-efficient technologies and the reduction 
of emissions, IHCL is able to decrease operational 
costs, 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
tightening 
environmental regulations, and bolster its image as 
a leader in sustainable hospitality.
Positive implications
Risk
Nonetheless, should emissions and energy use 
not be managed properly, the repercussions 
could be substantial. Inefficiencies and surging 
energy costs could drive up operational expenses. 
Furthermore, failure to adhere to regulations might 
lead to penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. 
Moreover, the company's reputation could be 
tarnished, potentially eroding customer confidence 
and diminishing its share of the market.
IHCL has taken steps to address the risks associated 
with energy and emission management by introducing 
energy-saving technologies, including solar hot water 
systems, heat pumps, and waste heat recovery units, 
which have resulted in considerable energy conservation. 
Additionally, the company has switched to LED lighting, 
implemented energy-efficient laundry systems, and 
equipped its facilities with modern air conditioning units. 
These measures not only lessen IHCL's ecological footprint 
but also help to alleviate the financial and reputational 
risks linked to energy usage and emissions.

Financial implications 
of the risk or

Waste 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Effective waste management is crucial for IHCL, 
given the substantial amount of waste produced 
by its hotel activities. Poor waste management 
practices can lead to environmental degradation 
and community impact, as well as higher disposal 
expenses. By adopting robust waste minimization 
and recycling strategies, the company can cut 
expenses, keep its premises tidy, and showcase its 
dedication to sustainable practices.
IHCL processes all biodegradable waste through composting, 
with 20 of its hotels featuring in-house composting facilities. 
The company is actively working to eliminate single-use 
plastic items, having already removed plastic straws and 
aiming to replace PET water bottles with glass alternatives 
in guest rooms and banquet areas. To support this shift to 
plastic-free offerings, IHCL has set up 19 bottling plants 
across its various properties, paving the way for a broader 
adoption of sustainable practices.
Positive implications
Food Safety 
and Quality
Opportunity
By enforcing stringent food safety protocols, 
IHCL has the chance to boost client contentment, 
maintain its distinguished reputation, and meet 
regulatory requirements. Upholding top-tier food 
safety and quality standards allows IHCL to draw in 
and keep a loyal customer base, which can result in 
higher earnings and customer loyalty.
IHCL maintains strict food safety standards through the 
implementation of stringent protocols, regular inspections, 
and continuous training for its staff to ensure unwavering 
compliance with sanitation guidelines.
Positive implications
Talent 
Management 
and Retention
Risk
An inability to recruit, keep, and nurture premier 
talent may impede organizational effectiveness, 
creativity, and market rivalry. In the hospitality 
sector, where outstanding service is crucial, having 
a competent and driven team is vital for providing 
unparalleled guest experiences. Moreover, a 
scarcity of talent, especially in niche positions like 
chefs, concierge, and hospitality management, can 
intensify operational difficulties.
In response to the challenges of talent management, 
IHCL employs a strategic approach by offering attractive 
remuneration packages to draw in top-notch professionals. 
The company places a strong focus on career advancement, 
presenting employees with a transparent roadmap for 
their development prospects within the firm. Additionally, 
IHCL is committed to fostering a supportive and dynamic 
workplace culture, which plays a crucial role in keeping a 
talented and enthusiastic team.
Negative implications
Opportunity
At IHCL, adept handling of talent management 
paves the way for fortifying its brand and spurring 
innovation, as a proficiently managed team provides 
exceptional service in the fiercely competitive 
hospitality sector. Committed employees act as 
representatives of the brand, elevating IHCL's 
standing and fostering customer allegiance. Tactical 
planning for the workforce equips the company to 
tackle forthcoming obstacles, and initiatives aimed 
at retaining personnel cut down on expenses and 
leverage the knowledge of experienced employees, 
enhancing the company's operational efficacy as a 
whole.
Positive implications
Guest 
Experience 
Opportunity
In the competitive landscape of the hospitality 
industry, IHCL's emphasis on exceptional service 
and personalized guest experiences can be a 
strategic advantage that directly influences 
customer satisfaction and loyalty. Prioritizing the 
customer experience allows IHCL to stand out from 
its competitors, build brand loyalty, and consistently 
attract repeat business. By innovating in areas such 
as guest journey mapping, technology integration, 
and unique local experiences, IHCL can transform 
each stay into a memorable and distinct encounter.
IHCL's pursuit of excellence in guest experiences 
is demonstrated by its seamless integration of 
state-of-the-art technologies and a focus on personalized 
service. Each property under IHCL's umbrella infuses 
local traditions into tailor-made experiences, captivating 
guests with the signature intuitive service of the Taj brand. 
The IHCL Response Assistant (IRA), driven by artificial 
intelligence, streamlines operational processes, and 
I-DOCS, a comprehensive omnichannel platform, deepens 
the quality of guest engagement. Additionally, the I-ZEST 
platform elevates both operational effectiveness and 
safety standards, providing guests with the convenience 
of handling check-ins, enjoying amenities, and completing 
payments effortlessly through their personal devices.
Positive implications
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Effective supply chain management is a gateway for 
IHCL to unlock new levels of operational excellence 
and guest delight. Optimizing its supply chain allows 
IHCL to streamline procurement, providing each 
property with the finest goods and services, which 
translates into cost savings and the consistent 
delivery 
of 
exceptional 
guest 
experiences. 
Additionally, a dynamic supply chain allows IHCL to 
adapt to changing market demands and maintain 
high-quality standards, providing guests with an 
experience that adapts to their evolving needs.
IHCL is focused on evolving and refining its supply chain 
operations, which are crucial for supporting its wide array 
of hotels. By working closely with a network of supplier 
partners nationwide, IHCL has set up effective standard 
operating procedures that consistently achieve quality, 
cost, and delivery targets. The company's approach 
to supply chain management focuses on the effective 
allocation and optimal use of resources, as well as 
harmonizing its varied supplier base with the company's 
core values and principles.

Statement by director responsible for the BRSR report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievement:
Mr. Puneet Chhatwal (Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer): Being the oldest operating company of the Tata Group, we have always 
embraced the vision of our founder Jamshedji Tata, who believed that the community is not just another stakeholder, but the very reason 
for our existence. Throughout the years, we have adopted a responsible approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices 
in all aspects of our operations. We have introduced an industry leading ESG+ programme called Paathya, which sets clear milestones for 
various ESG initiatives to be achieved by 2030. Additionally, we have committed ourselves to the Science-Based Targets initiative and are 
actively working towards achieving Net Zero Emissions to prioritise environmental sustainability. 27 of our hotels are EarthCheck Certified, 
18 of which have been certified at Platinum level and 3 hotels are Master Certified. We are dedicated to decarbonising our operations, 
which includes eliminating single-use plastics and implementing other measures. For Scope 2 emissions, we have established significant 
agreements for green power for numerous properties. Furthermore, we have a comprehensive programme in place to collaborate with 
our supply chain partners on Scope 3 emissions. We are in the process of exploring various measures related to Scope 3 emissions for our 
customers. We are also actively working with our owner partners to implement ESG initiatives within their respective hotels. Our employees 
are the backbone of our business, and we deeply appreciate their commitment and care towards our community, customers, and each 
other. Empowering and enabling our employees to carry out our strategic priorities while embracing sustainability as a fundamental 
principle is crucial to our future success.

Yes
	
What is the coverage of such system? The system covers all employees and all hotels.
b. 	 What are the processes used to 
identify work-related hazards and 
assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
Routine Risk Assessment Processes
	−
Regular Safety Audits and Inspections: IHCL conducts periodic safety audits and 
inspections across all properties. These audits are designed to identify existing hazards 
and potential risks in the daily operations of the hotels. The audits cover various aspects 
including fire safety, electrical installations, kitchen operations, and guest areas.
	−
Employee Reporting Mechanisms: Employees are encouraged to report hazards 
immediately using an incident reporting system. This proactive engagement helps in 
early identification of routine risks that may arise during daily operations.
Non-Routine Risk Assessment Processes
	−
Dynamic Safety Risk Assessments: In response to specific incidents or external changes, 
such as construction activities or the introduction of new equipment, IHCL conducts 
dynamic safety risk assessments. These assessments involve revisiting and analysing the 
potential impacts of the new variables on existing safety protocols (change management).
	−
Comprehensive Pre-Construction Risk Analysis: Before the commencement of any 
new construction or major renovation projects, a thorough risk analysis is conducted. 
This analysis focuses on identifying potential hazards associated with new construction 
activities, including high-risk tasks and environmental impacts. It helps in planning safety 
measures and emergency responses tailored to the specific risks identified.
	−
Incident Analysis and Investigation: Any accidents or safety incidents are followed 
by a detailed incident analysis to determine the root causes. These investigations 
help in understanding non-routine hazards and in developing corrective measures to 
prevent recurrence.
Ongoing Improvements and Feedback Integration
	−
Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback from employees and safety audits are continuously 
analysed to update risk assessment methodologies. This integration ensures that both 
routine and non-routine processes are refined over time to enhance safety outcomes.
	−
Best Practice Sharing: Learnings from both routine and non-routine assessments are 
shared across the organization through periodic Safety & Security updates and inter-hotel 
safety forums. This practice helps in standardizing safety measures and improving risk 
assessments across all properties.
c. 	
Whether you have processes for 
workers to report the work-related 
hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Yes/No) 
Yes
d. 	 Do the employees/ worker of  
the entity have access to  
non-occupational medical and 
healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
Yes, all sites have access to medical and healthcare services for non-work-related needs, 
either on-site or through partnerships with trusted healthcare providers in the vicinity. 
Furthermore, employees receive training for on-site medical emergency response.

single-use plastic bottles have been replaced with glass ones to cut down on single-use plastics.
2. 	 Working in tandem with authorised recyclers: To not just implement accountable waste management practices 
but also to enable utilisation or reclamation of the expended products.
3. 	 Shifting towards Bio-compostable commodities: We have replaced plastic amenities and packaging with wooden 
& paper alternatives.
4. 	 Phasing out plastic amenities and packaging: A goal has been set to entirely eradicate single-use plastics by 2030 
via a series of incremental targets.
5. 	 Management of wet waste: All the hotels under IHCL’s banner have on-site composting tools, and there are plans 
to establish an organic waste treatment system at every hotel by the year 2030.
6. 	 For every stream of waste, segregation of waste is carried out at site, same is quantified, tracked and an optimum 
recycling method is followed as per the nature of waste.

The IHCL Business Continuity and Disaster Response Plan has been developed to safeguard the smooth operation of 
critical business functions and ensure the well-being of guests and employees during disruptive incidents or disasters. 
It is inspired from the ‘Tata Disaster Response Guidelines’ available at https://www.tatasustainability.com/pdfs/
Highlights/TataDisasterResponseGuidelines.pdf.
	
The plan includes an assessment of potential risks and their potential impact on the business. It prioritizes and allocates 
resources through a risk assessment process, and strategies are formulated to mitigate, transfer, or accept risks. 
Detailed plans have been devised for each critical business function, identifying key personnel who are trained in 
their roles and responsibilities. The plan features emergency protocols for immediate response, employee actions, 
evacuation, sheltering, and effective communication with guests and authorities. It also outlines procedures for 
damage assessment, property restoration, and recovery.

Adverse Impact
Mitigation or adaptation measures
Plastic Waste
To mitigate the use of plastic packaged drinking water, we have setup inhouse glass bottling 
plants which not only reduces our dependence on buying plastic bottles but also helps reduce the 
energy required to recycle them or waste generated.
Also making sure glass bottles are returned to refurbish them in our plant which reduces the 
waste generated. Additionally, sourcing wooden and paper amenities from vendors.
Food Waste
We have set up organic waste composters or converters in most of our hotel locations so that wet 
waste is handled internally and not outsourced through third party. Currently we have 26 Organic 
Waste Treatment Systems (OWC/ Biogas).
Waste water
All the facilities are equipped with wastewater treatment plants and most of them have STP and 
ETP to recover and use in gardening and cooling towers

In our opinion, the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages 158 to 197 of the Integrated Annual Report

as per the Reporting Boundary set out in Section A of page 158.

(Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, 
Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards

our report. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants (IESBA). 
KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (the Firm) applies International Standard on Quality Management

The Indian Hotels Company Limited
Our reasonable assurance on the BRSR Core does not cover the other information and we are not expressing any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our assurance on the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether other information is materially inconsistent with the 
BRSR Core, or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Integrated Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to Those Charged With Governance and describe actions applicable under the applicable laws 
and regulations.
Intended use or purpose 
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand 
that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
Responsibilities for the Identified Sustainability Information (ISI) 
The management of the Company acknowledges and understands their responsibility for:
	−designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
	−selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related 
to reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation 
of the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation of the ISI in the 
relevant report;
	−preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria;
	−ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanations;
	−establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, goals and 
performance measures;
	−providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
	−ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
	−making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances;
	−identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of information covered by assurance in 
accordance with the reporting criteria;
	−preventing and detecting fraud;
	−selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their information needs;
	−informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
	−supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI. 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations 
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevance of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG Footprint, Water Footprint, Energy Footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed

and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the 
engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by 
reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of

information covered by reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company; and
