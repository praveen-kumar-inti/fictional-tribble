BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & 
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING (‘BRSR’)
(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information 
about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide 
stakeholders with a comprehensive view of a company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable 
development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, 
aiming to promote transparency and accountability.)

Green building
O
Green buildings are more efficient than 
traditional 
buildings 
and 
may 
lower 
operating costs, increase revenues, and 
reduce exposure to the physical and 
transition 
risks 
presented 
by 
climate 
change. These factors may increase the 
valuation of green buildings, making them 
stronger credit assets and better collateral. 
With

2.
Water 
Management
R
Water serves as an indispensable resource 
essential 
across 
construction 
stages. 
Moreover, it finds application in various 
administrative and business activities, 
exerting a direct influence on local water 
resource quality and quantity. Excessive 
withdrawal can deplete local water sources, 
harming 
ecosystems 
and 
aggravating 
water scarcity issues. Compliance with 
water usage regulations is essential to 
avoid fines and delays in project completion.
We have in 
place systems 
and processes 
to track, 
measure, 
manage and 
monitor water 
used for the 
Company’s 
operations.
Negative
3.
Waste 
management
R
Our construction and business activities 
yield a substantial volume of waste, making 
effective waste management a critical 
concern. Waste management involves 
treatment, handling, storage, disposal and 
regulatory compliance of waste.
We have 
systems and 
processes to 
track, measure, 
manage and 
monitor waste 
generated due 
to operations 
and also 
disposed by us.
Negative
4.
Carbon 
emissions 
and energy 
management
R
The construction industry is a significant 
contributor 
to 
carbon 
emissions 
and 
energy consumption, primarily through the 
operation of machinery, transportation 
of 
materials, 
and 
energy-intensive 
construction 
processes. 
Regulatory 
frameworks are increasingly focusing on 
carbon emissions and energy efficiency 
standards, with stricter regulations being 
implemented to mitigate climate change 
and 
reduce 
environmental 
footprint. 
Failure to comply with these regulations 
can result in legal liabilities, fines, and 
reputational 
damage, 
significantly 
impacting the company’s bottom line 
and its ability to secure future projects. 
Prioritizing sustainability practices can 
open up new business opportunities, 
attract environmentally-conscious clients, 
and position the company as a responsible 
corporate citizen committed to mitigating 
its environmental impact.
We have 
taken steps 
to promote 
energy 
efficiency by 
installing solar 
panels, utilizing 
LED lights 
and other 
measures in 
our office.

Biodiversity 
conservation 
and

O
By embracing biodiversity as one of the 
important aspects of the business, the 
Company can secure long-term value. 
Biodiverse 
ecosystems 
contribute 
to 
property resilience, enhance natural beauty, 
and attract environmentally conscious 
buyers and tenants. Being associated with

overall success of the Company.
NA
Positive
7.
Health and 
Safety
R
The health and safety of onsite staff is a 
significant risk for the construction sector 
and the Company. The workforce faces 
potential hazards such as construction 
site accidents, exposure to hazardous 
materials, fire hazards, etc.
We prioritize 
health and 
safety by 
effectively 
implementing 
our health 
and safety 
policy and 
management 
system, 
thereby 
managing 
and mitigating 
risks related 
to health and 
safety.
Negative
8.
Human rights 
and Labor 
Management
R
Operations in the real estate sector may 
cause 
significant 
human 
rights 
risks, 
particularly concerning land acquisition 
and resettlement, as well as labor rights. 
Real estate development projects often 
entail acquiring land, potentially displacing 
local communities and affecting their 
access to land, resources, and livelihoods. 
Additionally, real estate activities rely 
on labor, including construction workers 
and property managers, who are at the 
risk of exploitation, substandard working 
conditions, discrimination or insufficient 
compensation.
We proactively 
manage 
human rights 
and labor 
management 
risks by 
implementing 
robust policies, 
comprehensive 
management 
systems, 
and regular 
monitoring 
to ensure 
compliance 
and protect 
the rights and 
well-being of 
our workforce.

Brand 
Management
O
An effective branding strategy and brand 
positioning are essential for cultivating 
customer commitment and preference. By 
strategically defining brand identity and 
differentiating offerings from competitors, 
the Company can build strong connections 
with its existing and potential customers. 
This fosters loyalty and ensures that 
the company’s brand stands out in the 
marketplace, driving long-term success 
and growth for the business.
NA

10.
Privacy and 
data security
O
Due to growing reliance of real estate 
sector on technology and data driven 
solution and involvement of significant 
amount of personal and financial data in 
the transactions, addressing privacy and 
data security proactively, can mitigate 
cyber threats, ensure compliance with 
regulations, build trust, and provide a 
competitive edge in the industry.

Business 
Ethics, 
Accountability

Failure to adhere to ethical standards 
can result in legal liabilities, reputational 
damage, loss of consumer trust and 
financial losses for a company
Through the 
integration of 
comprehensive 
policies and 
management 
systems, the

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights 
impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business?
Yes
The Company has established an “Internal Complaint Committee” in compliance with the POSH guidelines to 
document instances of sexual harassment grievances. Additionally, the HR head is directly accountable for other
human rights matters, and employees can directly communicate any related issues to the HR head.
5.	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
The HR head addresses human rights concerns, and employees report issues directly to them. A procedure is in 
place to investigate and resolve complaints, with protective measures against backlash. If the matter is beyond 
the HR head’s purview, it escalates to higher management. Under the Company’s POSH Policy, safeguards 
prevent adverse consequences for complainants in discrimination and harassment cases. The confidential 
complaint register is not shared with unauthorized persons, and a confidentiality clause ensures non-publication 
of identities or proceedings.

a confidential complaint register, which is inaccessible to anyone without proper authorization. Furthermore, the 
policy includes a confidentiality clause that mandates the non-disclosure of the identities of the aggrieved women,
