The Company’s Grievance Redressal Procedure is accessible to all employees and workers, providing a clear and structured 
framework for addressing work-related grievances. This policy is designed to facilitate open and transparent discussions, ensuring 
that any concerns or issues raised by employees are handled fairly and justly, in strict compliance with the Company’s policies and 
guidelines.
	
The procedure encourages employees to initially discuss their grievances with their immediate reporting authority. This initial 
step aims to seek an informal resolution, fostering direct communication and problem-solving at the supervisory level. If the issue 
remains unresolved or if the employee feels uncomfortable addressing it with their immediate supervisor, they can then initiate the 
formal grievance redressal mechanism.
	
The formal process involves submitting a detailed grievance report, which is reviewed by a dedicated grievance committee or 
designated HR personnel. This Committee is responsible for conducting a thorough investigation, ensuring all relevant facts and 
perspectives are considered. The committee works diligently to provide a fair and unbiased resolution, maintaining confidentiality 
and protecting the rights of all parties involved.
