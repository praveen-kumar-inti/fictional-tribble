26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues.
	
Material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying 
the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the 
following format:
	
Strengthening the materiality assessment process from the previous year, your Company has broadened its 
stakeholder engagement to better understand the evolving landscape of risks and opportunities. This expanded 
dialogue with both external and internal stakeholders has enabled your Company to refine the classification of 
material issues, ensuring that its sustainability strategy remains robust and responsive to the most pertinent 
challenges and opportunities.

1
Climate 
Change 
Resilience
R
Climate change poses 
risks to businesses, 
affecting operations 
across the value chain. 
Physical threats like 
droughts and floods 
disrupt raw material 
sourcing, while the shift 
to a low-carbon economy 
introduces transitional 
risks such as changing 
consumer demands, 
rising costs, and evolving 
regulations.
Your Company promotes 
climate-smart agriculture 
by supporting sustainable 
farming, including soil 
health management, water 
conservation, managed use 
of fertilizers etc. Through 
farmer partnerships, it 
enhances techniques and 
resilience, ensuring a stable 
supply chain with reduced 
environmental impact.
Climate change can drive 
up operational costs. 
While renewable energy 
and sustainable practices 
require upfront investment, 
they lead to long-term 
efficiency and resilience.
2
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management
R&O
Energy use, rising costs, 
and stricter emissions 
regulations. Managing 
both direct and supply 
chain emissions is 
crucial to protect brand 
reputation and ensure 
long-term sustainability.
Your Company aims to 
reduce environmental impact 
and costs by gradually 
shifting to renewable energy, 
improving efficiency, and 
innovating sustainable 
packaging, while partnering 
with suppliers and farmers to 
promote sustainable farming 
practices.
While renewable energy 
and sustainable packaging 
involve investments, they 
help in reducing long-
term expenses, boost 
brand value, and reduce 
emissions. Collaborating 
with suppliers and farmers 
strengthens supply chain 
resilience and supports 
consistent quality.
3
Circular 
Economy 
and Waste 
Management
R&O
Regulatory pressures 
and rising consumer 
expectations can 
challenge operations 
and reputation. However, 
adopting circular 
practices can cut costs, 
boost brand value, and 
strengthen supply chain 
resilience, supporting 
long-term sustainability.
Your Company’s commitment 
to invest in sustainable 
material, ensure full Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
and educate consumers to 
environmental awareness is 
high.
While sustainable materials 
may require investments, 
they offer long-term 
gains through innovation 
in alternatives, meeting 
regulatory compliance, 
ensuring stronger brand 
value and increased 
consumer trust and sales.
4
Water 
Management
R
Since your Company 
operates in water-
stressed regions, it 
may affect resource 
availability and 
production. Inadequate 
water management can 
impact local ecosystems 
and communities.
Mitigation efforts by your 
Company include adopting 
Zero Liquid Discharge at 
most sites (7 out of 9) to 
recycle wastewater, along 
with investments in water- 
saving technologies and 
process improvements to 
reduce usage.
While requiring upfront 
investments, these 
initiatives strategically 
position your Company 
for long-term gains 
through reduced water-
related costs, enhanced 
operational efficiency, and 
Consent to Operate (CTO).

5
Employee 
Health and 
Safety
R
Inadequate safety 
measures and non- 
conformance to 
standards may increase 
the risk of workplace 
injuries and health 
concerns.
Your Company conducts 
regular risk assessments, 
provides safety training, and 
monitors practices, while 
promoting employee well-
being through mental health 
programs.
Limited safety and well-
being measures can lead to 
higher costs from medical 
claims, legal issues, and 
reduced productivity.
6
Human Rights
R
Your Company 
engages with various 
stakeholders, including 
employees, suppliers, 
customers, farmers, and 
communities. This may 
pose human rights risks 
across operations or 
partnerships.
Your Company promotes 
ethical labor and 
environmental standards 
across the supply chain, 
supported by grievance 
mechanisms to address 
potential violations effectively.
Platforms like ‘Speak Up’ 
support open reporting 
for employees, workers, 
and external stakeholders, 
reinforcing a respectful and 
inclusive work culture.
Human rights violations 
can lead to significant 
financial impacts, including 
legal penalties, reputational 
damage, and loss of 
consumer trust, all of which 
can impact brand value.
7
Talent 
Attraction, 
Development 
and Retention
R
Lack of a strong talent 
strategy may impact 
employee engagement, 
efficiency, and retention.
Your Company fosters talent 
retention and performance 
through competitive rewards, 
inclusive culture, and robust 
development programs. 
Regular engagement 
surveys help align workforce 
motivation with business 
goals.
Inability to attract and 
retain skilled employees 
can result in higher 
operational costs and 
a potential loss of 
competitive edge in the 
market.
This situation could also 
lead to increased expenses 
related to employee 
turnover and recruitment 
efforts.
8
Product 
Quality and 
Safety
O
Enhanced brand 
reputation, customer 
loyalty
Product safety and quality 
are key strengths for your 
Company, supported by 
internal controls from 
sourcing to distribution.
Regular audits, staff training, 
regulatory collaboration, and 
consumer feedback ensure 
continuous improvement and 
compliance with evolving 
standards.
Initially, investing in robust 
quality control and safety 
measures can lead to fewer 
defects, returns, recalls, 
and legal issues in the long 
run, resulting in significant 
cost savings.
Consumers would be 
willing to pay a premium 
for products they perceive 
as high quality and safe, 
leading to increased market 
share and profitability.
9
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
R&O
Your Company’s reliance 
on diverse raw materials 
brings sustainability 
risks, making responsible 
sourcing vital for supply 
stability and long-term 
growth.
Your Company adheres to 
the Nestlé’s Responsible 
Sourcing Core Requirements 
and partners with suppliers to 
promote ethical, sustainable 
practices. It also invests in 
traceability systems and 
supports certifications like 
Rainforest Alliance and 
Bonsucro.
Sustainable sourcing 
may involve initial costs 
due to investments in 
certification and supply 
chain traceability. However, 
it offers long-term financial 
benefits through ensuring 
supply chain resilience, 
and minimizing disruptions 
related to sustainability 
issues.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Business 
Ethics
R&O
Robust governance 
structures include 
establishing effective 
risk management 
frameworks, internal 
controls, and audit 
committees, which help 
identify, assess, and 
mitigate potential risks.
Lapses can lead to legal 
penalties, regulatory 
scrutiny, and reputational 
damage.
Your Company has a strong 
governance structure in 
place with robust compliance 
monitoring, to strengthen 
internal control.
Corporate governance risks 
are managed through strong 
oversight, guided by
Nestlé’s Business Principles 
and Code of Conduct. This 
includes board diversity, 
regular audits, stakeholder 
engagement, and ongoing 
training to ensure 
transparency and integrity.
Breaches in ethical 
practices may lead to 
significant financial 
consequences, including 
potential fines for 
regulatory non-compliance 
and legal expenses from 
ethical breaches. Poor 
governance may also 
result in investor mistrust 
impacting long term 
financial health of your 
Company.

Specific commitments, 
goals and targets set by 
the entity with defined 
timelines, if any.
Nestlé, globally, has set ambitious climate goals and commitments, aiming to be Net Zero 
by 2050. Your Company, being one of the key markets of Nestlé Group is also committed 
to reducing its carbon emissions in line with the group-level commitment. It aims to 
reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030, using its 2018 emissions 
levels as a baseline.*
Your Company’s approach to net zero is designed to mitigate emissions across the value 
chain and help address impacts on natural ecosystems, communities and food systems.
6.
Performance of the entity 
against the  specific 
commitments, goals and 
targets along-with reasons 
in case the same are not 
met.
One of your Company’s core strategic commitments is to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2050. This ambition is aimed at driving business transformation to ensure long-term 
resilience and build a future-ready enterprise. To realize this commitment, your Company 
is executing a multi- faceted strategy that addresses emissions across the entire value 
chain.
Your Company’s sustainability actions are built around four core pillars:
In Climate Action, your Company is addressing emissions across the supply chain, 
from agriculture and livestock, to support a more climate- resilient food system. Your 
Company achieved 100% renewable energy, including Renewable Energy Certificates 
(RECs). These efforts reflect our commitment to decarbonizing operations and 
transitioning to a low- emission future. Furthermore, ~89,000 Gigajoules annualized 
savings were realized from energy reduction projects.
In Sustainable Packaging initiatives your Company aims to ensure no plastic ends 
up in landfills, with a focus on continuing to be 100% plastic neutral, reducing virgin 
plastic use, and using packaging that is designed for recycling.
In Water Stewardship, we are improving water efficiency in operations and expanding 
access to clean drinking water in the communities we serve. Your Company has nine 
factories, and seven factories are zero liquid discharge (ZLD) factories, consuming all 
the treated effluent within factory for its need of process or land maintenance.
Finally, in Responsible Sourcing, we are committed to sourcing key ingredients—such 
as coffee, cocoa, and palm oil where approximately 55% of our key ingredients were 
sustainably sourced, while prioritizing human rights and livelihoods throughout our 
supply chain.

263
Annual Report 2024-25
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work related hazards and assess risks on a routine 
and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Risk assessment is central to the Nestlé Health & Safety Health Management System, that is instrumental 
in identifying and managing any hazards, ensuring protection of individuals, and prioritizing safety 
improvements across operations. Your Company is dedicated to continuously improving health and safety 
by refining processes, work practices, and systems. Your Company recognizes that employee engagement 
is crucial in creating and sustaining a safe workplace, and adherence to safety principles is a fundamental. 
Employees are responsible for ensuring safe practices to prevent injuries and are encouraged to engage in 
initiatives to improve workplace health and safety.
	
	
Your Company deploys several processes to identify work-related hazards and assess risks in a routine and 
non-routine manner, some of which are mentioned below:
 
 
HIRAO (Hazard identification and Risk Assessment Opportunity) is an element of ISO 45001. 
This commitment is reinforced by conducting detailed risk assessments, including those 
focusing on machinery, specific tasks, material handling equipment, facility safety, noise levels, 
ergonomics, and more.
 
 
Permit to work management system: Your Company prioritizes the effective management of critical 
risks that may result in injuries, through a comprehensive process designed to identify and mitigate 
risks associated with high hazard tasks, both routine and non-routine. The permit- to-work process is 
crucial to ensure safety during activities such as work at height and confined space entry, especially 
concerning contractor management and capital projects. This process includes a risk prediction tool to 
assess and mitigate risks before commencement of tasks.
 
 
Method statements: This provides a detailed methodology for mitigating risks associated with critical 
non-routine activities, particularly for capital investment projects. It is especially useful for projects 
involving large-scale civil construction and installation of heavy equipment.
 
 
ATEX (Atmospheric Explosion prevention management tool): A tool used to identify the process-
related hazards associated with manufacturing of powders and establish risk mitigation measures.
 
 
PESIS (Preliminary Environmental & Workplace Safety Impact Study): A tool used for new product 
development where new processes/equipment changes are evaluated for identification of any risks 
and hazards and implementing controls for their effective mitigation.
 
 
User Requirement specifications in Capital Investment Projects: For machinery and process safety, 
safety measures are integrated into the User Requirement Specifications and are thoroughly validated 
through Factory Acceptance Tests and Site Acceptance Tests, among others.
 
 
Shift risk prediction tool: Manufacturing lines have the concept of being risk assessed on shift basis 
using a concept of traffic light (Red, Amber & Green) so that people in the shift are aware of the level 
of risk associated with the shift.
 
 
S&H Tagging: A tool for proactive identification and reporting of any workplace hazards.
 
 
Behavioral Feedback System (BFS): Your Company views behavior as crucial to success, expecting 
managers, team leaders, and employees to embody Safety & Health (S&H) values in their daily operations.
 
 
Contractor Field Safety Audits: A tool to facilitate joint inspections of project sites with contractors, 
allowing for the recognition of best practices and the identification of violations, which can then be 
proactively addressed to prevent potential harm.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove 
themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, your Company’s ‘SpeakUp’ platform allows all employees and workers to report any concerns including 
safety-related hazards. In addition, your Company has adopted various systems and processes that allow 
reporting of work-related hazards.
264
Nestlé India Limited
	
	
1.	
GEMBA: Gemba is the Japanese term “genchi genbutsu” that is interpreted as ‘management by 
walking around’. Your Company has systems in place for top management to conduct regular safety 
tours at the workplace. Primary focus of these tours is to identify any unsafe conditions. This provides 
an opportunity to the workers to engage with the management and provide feedback regarding any 
unsafe working conditions.
	
	
2.	
Safety Committee Meetings: The Safety Committee provides a forum for workers and management 
to collaborate for resolving any identified health and safety issues. The Safety Committee consists of 
fair representation from management and workers. These meetings also have representation from 
contractors at the sites to provide them with a forum for reporting any unsafe conditions.
	
	
3.	
Safety campaigns: Safety campaigns help promote awareness among employees and contractors, 
allow identification of hazards and also provide an opportunity to share any feedback for workplace 
safety improvements.
	
	
4.	
Behavioral feedback Sessions (BFS): Primary focus on identification of unsafe conditions, safe 
& unsafe behaviors, and one-to- one coaching sessions to improve behaviors. The BFS forms are 
available both in hard copy and digitally in most locations.

Solution: Your Company implemented world-class ring lock system scaffolding for safe civil work, created 
method statements for high-risk tasks, and hired dedicated safety professionals to enforce strict Safety & 
Health protocols.
	
Significant Risk- Driving on roads for business purpose, since the employee must travel for the workplace using

Solution: Your Company ensures all vehicles meet your Company’s safety standards, provides defensive driving 
and awareness training for sales employees, and has established clear road travel policies.

by filing a report on web portal or by calling the hotline operated by an independent third party. This ensures a 
safe and confidential way for individuals to voice concerns without fear of retribution. Nestlé Code of Business 
Conduct prohibits retaliation against employees who make reports in good faith. Every complaint is investigated 
thoroughly, and remedial actions are taken if required.
5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
All human rights-related grievances received outside the formal ‘Speak Up’ system—whether via letter, email, 
or social media—are systematically recorded in the case management module within the ‘Speak Up’ platform. 
These concerns are addressed and reported in line with established protocols. This process extends to include 
the Company’s suppliers, vendors, and other external stakeholders. A structured Grievance Redressal Protocol 
is in place to investigate such matters thoroughly, ensure appropriate responses to complainants, and document 
findings. Employees may also raise concerns directly with HR or their reporting managers, and such cases are 
handled with equal diligence. To reinforce awareness, all employees undergo training on Nestlé’s Corporate 
Business Principles. Regular audits by CARE Auditors and the internal audit team ensure compliance with 
these standards.
	
Additionally, external auditors assess how these principles integrate into the Company’s broader corporate 
governance framework. Significant observations and recommendations are communicated to the Audit 
Committee of the Board by the Compliance Officer. Nestlé’s Code of Business Conduct strictly prohibits retaliation 
against individuals who report concerns in good faith. Every complaint is investigated with due seriousness, and 
corrective actions are implemented where necessary.

(hereinafter referred to as ‘Criteria’):
	
a.

Management’s Responsibilities
6.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting on 
296
Nestlé India Limited
the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, 
preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This 
responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of 
the BRSR and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
7.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect 
comparability between entities. 
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control
8.	
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA’), which is 
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, confidentiality 
and professional behaviour.
9.	
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms that 
Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements”

or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.

(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
(‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This 
standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. 
11.	
A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 
use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks 
of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding 
to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information. 
12.	 The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
13.	 Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
