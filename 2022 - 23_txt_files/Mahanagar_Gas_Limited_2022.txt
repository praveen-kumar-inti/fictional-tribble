Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Asset integrity 
and critical 
incident 
management
Risk
Pipeline & compressor 
infrastructure is backbone 
of MGL. Gas being 
inflammable and a 
necessity of life; asset 
safety, human life and 
continuity of supply can 
be at risk without efficient 
systems in place.
MGL has an Asset Integrity Policy in place 
along with an Integrity Management 
System (IMS) conforming to applicable 
regulatory requirements (PNGRB – IMS). 
The Asset Integrity Management at 
MGL is supported by relevant systems & 
procedures laid down in the company. 
For the management of critical incidents, 
MGL has an Emergency Response & 
Disaster Management plan (ERDMP), 
conforming to PNGRB norms, which is 
managed primarily by HSE and O&M 
departments, including conduct of Mock-
drills at prescribed intervals.
Negative implication 
would depend upon 
extent of damage and /
or period for which gas 
supply is discontinued.
2
Energy 
management
Risk
Compressors is critical 
equipment in MGL 
operation which consumes 
substantial power to 
dispense CNG. 
Some of the important initiatives 
undertaken for energy management at 
our premises are listed below:
•	
Maintaining Electrical power factor of 
electrical systems at all CNG stations 
at desired level (close to unity) to 
operate the system at best efficiency.
•	
Installation of stationary cascades 
of adequate capacity at every CNG 
station to provide buffer and reduce 
number of start/ stops and idle running 
of CNG compressor.
Due to various efficiency 
initiatives undertaken, 
negative implication is 
minimal.
Inefficient energy 
management can lead to 
increase in operational 
cost.
•	
Installation of solar power panels 
on MGL offices and gas receiving 
stations.
•	
Most offices are equipped with LED 
lights replacing CFL and fluorescent 
bulbs for energy saving.
•	
Installed automatic auditors and 
rectifiers for energy management. 
These fault identification and error 
diagnostic equipment help them to 
rectify the issue before any incident 
and lowering the energy consumption.

3
GHG emissions
Opportunity
Usage of natural gas 
emits less GHG emissions 
as compared to coal and 
liquid fuels, as well as 
far fewer pollutants, per 
unit of energy delivered. 
Also usage of renewable 
energy further reduces 
GHG emission.
•	
Continuous expansion of operations 
gives an opportunity to MGL to 
increase gas sales and thereby 
reduce GHG emissions which could be 
caused by other energy alternatives.
•	
Also, there is reduction in GHG 
emissions due to various initiatives 
undertaken by the company such as 
installation of solar power panels, 
measures for reduced energy 
consumption, usage of higher capacity 
cascades to reduce the number of 
trips of CNG transporting vehicles 
resulting to reduced emissions, 
transportation cost and dry outs at DB 
Stations
Positive implication 
because increased 
geographical coverage 
& incremental sale of 
natural gas helps to 
reduce GHG emissions 
otherwise caused by 
other fuels.
To minimize methane 
emissions present in 
natural gas due to 
leakages.
The following actions being taken to 
reduce leakage of natural gas (Methane) 
to atmosphere:
•	
Periodic preventive maintenance of all 
CNG & PNG assets 
•	
Odorizing the gas to identify the 
minutest of leakages
•	
Using FLIR Camera (Forward Looking 
Infra Red) to identify and arrest 
leakage at all Gas Receiving stations, 
CNG ROs, District Regulating Stations 
etc.
•	
Lock Pressure Test in Pipeline network
•	
Leakage survey across districts with 
Gas Detectors
•	
Riser maintenance
•	
Inspection of domestic installation at 
customer premises
4
Occupational 
health and 
safety including 
Employment 
practices
Risk & 
opportunity
Risk:
The employees are the 
greatest assets and their 
safety and wellbeing is of 
paramount importance. 
Improper handling of 
health and safety risks can 
lead to disastrous impacts 
on both property and 
humans. Lack of training 
in technical & behavioural 
aspects can impact 
company performance 
adversely.
MGL is ISO 45001:2018 certified and has a 
HSE policy available at the website which 
illustrates our commitment towards health 
and safety. 
Every person working for MGL gets trained 
in the required Safety and Technical 
Competency (STC). Personal protective 
equipment is distributed to all eligible 
individuals and usage of the same is 
ensured. Apart from the mandatory annual 
health surveillance for all employees, 
periodic executive health check-up is also 
carried out to keep track of the health 
of our employees. Health and term life 
insurances, financial aids are also part of 
the benefits provided to the employees. 
Positive implications due 
to various employee 
policies and safety 
practices in place

company along with safe

We are committed to providing equal 
opportunities in employment and thus 
create an inclusive work environment 
which gets reflected through our talent 
acquisition policy. In our continued 
efforts to boost the performances of 
the employees, training programs are 
planned throughout the year to enhance 
their skills and knowledge.
5
Human Rights
Risk
Non-adherence of human 
rights, a company can 
be prone to operational 
delays, lawsuits, reduced 
employee satisfaction, lost 
opportunities in expansion 
or new investments, and 
reputational harm.
MGL supports the safeguarding and 
upholding of human rights. We conduct 
our activities in a way that respects 
human rights and is a business imperative 
for us. We have code of conduct policy in 
place and it is mandatory for everyone 
to read, acknowledge and abide by it in 
spirit. 
Also, we do not recruit or employ children 
at our workplaces.  
Negative implications on 
case-to-case basis
6
Local 
communities 
including 
Corporate 
Social 
Investment
Opportunity
In developing nations 
like India, Corporates 
have significant role to 
play in ensuring inclusive 
growth. While CSR related 
Regulations make it 
mandatory, at MGL it is 
considered as one of the 
ways of uplifting needy, 
marginalized community 
through various projects
MGL has a Corporate Social 
Responsibility policy. We consider 
local community as an important 
stakeholder. We continuously engage 
with communities in which we operate 
to understand their expectations and 
explain the benefits of nature gas 
distribution.
Additionally, we undertake various 
CSR initiatives to promote education, 
community health, sanitation, 
infrastructure, rural development etc.
Positive reputation with 
community will translate 
into faster project 
executions.
7
Customer 
relationships, 
experience and 
satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
In future era of losing 
marketing exclusivity, 
unsatisfactory customer 
can lead to loss of market 
share.
Opportunity:
Excellent CRM can help us 
to retain and grow market 
share by increasing sales 
volume.
MGL has a robust consumer grievance 
redressal mechanism in place. All of 
our CRM processes & practices are ISO 
certified.
We have a Omni channel customer 
interface consisting of adequately manned 
- 24x7 customer helpline and walk-in 
centres. To provide additional support 
we have mobile app, website and social 
media channels.
A customer satisfaction survey is 
conducted periodically by an independent 
agency to gauge the satisfaction index 
of domestic PNG customers (existing and 
new). 
There are financial costs 
involved in running CRM 
system as a whole but 
customer satisfaction is 
a positive outcome of it.

End-use Safety
Risk
MGL takes adequate 
safety measures including 
pressure reduction at 
appropriate levels as a 
CGD company but lack of 
awareness about product 
usage, hazards etc. at end 
of customers could pose 
significant risk of accidents.
Our invoices, mailers, web site, newsprint 
advertisements, registration camps etc. 
facilitate awareness creation. A strong 
after sales service mechanism is also in 
place for any eventuality.
Negative implication 
could lead to 
consequential costs and 
reputational damages 
for the company.
9
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Lack of adherence to 
corporate governance 
strategies may incur 
increased government 
oversight, loss of investor 
trust, regulatory penalties 
and fines for the company.
MGL has various committees with defined 
roles and responsibilities in place that 
include Audit Committee, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee, CSR 
Committee, Stakeholders Relationship 
Committee and Risk Management 
Committee.
Negative implication 
either financially, 
legally, or reputational 
depending upon the 
nature of its failure.
10
Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
High business risk is 
associated in case of non-
compliance or unethical 
business practices and 
it can lead to financial 
penalties as well as 
reputational damages.
We have Code of Conduct Policy in place 
for all our Suppliers/ Business Partners and 
the same is available on the website of the 
Company. Additionally, a copy of the same 
is integral part of all our tenders. We also 
have Code of Conduct applicable to all 
our employees and Directors which covers 
various topics such as values, stakeholder 
treatment, our beliefs & culture and 
safeguarding provisions. Inter alia, it includes 
guidance on human rights, diversity, anti-
bribery, conflict management etc.
Negative implication 
due to non-compliance. 
There are no cases 
reported due to fraud, 
money laundering or 
executive misconduct 
during the year.
11
Risk 
Management
Risk
Risk Management is 
important in any business 
for various stakeholders 
but assumes much higher 
significance in CGD 
industry due to risk of 
accidents, volatility in 
gas prices and need for 
uninterrupted gas supply.
MGL has enterprise risk management 
policy in place which details the Risk 
Management principles and framework 
along with the associated procedures 
for MGL’s business environment and act 
as guidance for critical decision-making 
process such as strategic, operational, 
financial, legal etc. The Policy framework 
includes objective of identification 
of elements of risks which includes 
operational risks as well as business risks 
and assessment of management’s actions 
to mitigate the exposures periodically.
Further, Risk Management tool is in place 
to aggregate risk data for identification of 
the elements of risks.
Negative implication. 
Magnitude of which 
depends upon 
incidence, volume of 
gas, external factors like 
currency fluctuation etc.
12
Data Security
Risk
A large amount of 
personal data is captured 
for operational reasons, 
particularly in household 
customer category which 
puts customers’ data privacy 
at significant risk. Ensuring 
data privacy of customers is 
necessary for the company 
and is also covered under 
the data protection laws.
MGL has IT Policy and Framework on 
Cyber Security and Data Protection which 
is placed on the website of the Company. 
We have robust ERP system where we 
follow strict access control guidelines 
with due care on segregation of duties to 
ensure customer data security.
Leakage of personal 
data can lead to 
negative implications 
including penalties, 
fines and reputational 
damages.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements. 
MGL, a pioneer in city gas distribution sector, is on a mission to create a greener and more sustainable future for the geographical 
areas in which it operates. With a steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship, the company recognizes its crucial role in 
mitigating the impact of climate change. In pursuit of this goal, MGL is making significant strides towards promoting sustainable 
practices, and natural gas is at the forefront of their efforts.
The company’s flagship product, natural gas, is renowned for its superior eco-friendliness in comparison to other available 
alternatives. Its usage significantly reduces the carbon footprint, making it a much cleaner and efficient fuel option. In line with its 
commitment to the environment, MGL is continuously exploring new and innovative ways to reduce pollution levels.
MGL’s unwavering dedication to sustainable practices is not only reflected in its products but also in its vision and mission, 
which aligns seamlessly with ESG goals. As a responsible corporate citizen, MGL remains fully cognizant of its duties towards 
society. The company places a great deal of emphasis on corporate governance and inclusive growth, ensuring that its 
business practices remain ethical and equitable at all times. MGL believes that creating sustainable solutions requires not just 
corporate responsibility but also collaboration and partnerships with stakeholders to achieve a common goal of a better and 
brighter future for all.
At MGL, we are committed to providing clean and affordable energy solutions to our customers and society at large. As a city 
gas distribution company, we understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and enhancing our environmental 
performance. MGL is planning to set up a Compressed Biogas (CBG) plant in Mumbai, capable of processing up to 1000 Tons 
Per Day (TPD) of organic Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in coordination with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). MGL 
is proud to be a part of this innovative and impactful initiative, which is aligned with the government’s SATAT (Sustainable 
Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme to promote CBG as an alternative and affordable clean fuel for 
transportation. MGL believes that this project will set a benchmark in India and will inspire others to follow suit.
The CBG plant aims to promote sustainable practices in Mumbai including renewable energy generation, greenhouse gas 
reduction, and socio-economic factors. By utilizing anaerobic digestion technology, the plant converts organic waste from 
MSW into CBG, a renewable and clean energy source. It will also help us create value for our customers by offering them a 
competitive and reliable fuel option. This project will potentially benefit by generating employment opportunities and will also 
contribute to the national goal of achieving energy security and sustainability.
The following sections elaborate on the sustainability implications of this initiative:
1.	 Waste Management: The plant’s capacity to process 1000 TPD of organic MSW demonstrates a significant step towards 
efficient waste management in Mumbai. By diverting a substantial volume of organic waste from landfills, the CBG plant 
helps alleviate the strain on existing waste disposal facilities. This reduces environmental pollution and associated health 
risks while promoting the principles of the circular economy.
2.	 Renewable Energy Generation: The CBG plant generates renewable energy by harnessing the potential of organic waste. 
The processing of 1000 TPD of MSW has the potential to produce a substantial amount of CBG. This renewable fuel source 
can be used to replace conventional fossil fuels in various applications, including transportation, industrial processes, and 
household energy consumption. The transition to CBG-based energy promotes sustainability by reducing carbon emissions 
and dependence on non-renewable resources.
3.	 Greenhouse Gas Reduction: Anaerobic digestion of organic waste in the CBG plant plays a vital role in mitigating greenhouse 
gas emissions. By capturing methane, a potent GHG released during waste decomposition, the plant significantly reduces 
the environmental impact. The reduction in methane emissions can contribute to Mumbai’s climate change mitigation efforts.
4.	 Socio-Economic Impacts: The establishment of the CBG plant brings socio-economic benefits to the local community. The 
project creates employment opportunities, ranging from construction and operation to maintenance and administration. 
Additionally, the plant supports to contribute to improved livelihoods, waste segregation awareness, and community 
engagement.
