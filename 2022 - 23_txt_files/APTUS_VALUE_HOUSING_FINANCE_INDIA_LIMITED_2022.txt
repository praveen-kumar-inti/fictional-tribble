and 
positive business reputation 
among 
the 
stakeholders 
which can, in turn, lead to a 
competitive advantage.
-
Positive: Contributions made 
by the Company towards 
upliftment of the community 
through 
various 
initiatives 
and partnerships focusing on 
the health, education, social 
development among others, 
elevates 
the 
Company’s 
brand value among the local 
community 
members 
as 
well as contributes towards 
positive social performance.

Affordable 
housing 
Opportunity & 
Risk
The demand for shelter 
grows in line with the 
increase in population and 
the standard of living. Most 
of 
the 
housing 
finance 
Institutions today cater to 
the needs of upper-middle 
and high-income customers 
which are a part of the 
formal segment and hence 
the availability of IT returns, 
salary 
certificates 
and 
income proofs makes the 
credit assessment relatively 
easy. But this creates a 
divide as there is a huge 
segment that is associated 
with 
the 
informal, 
low 
income, and middle-income 
segments which remains 
unserved and underserved. 
Thus, the aspirational first 
home remains a dream for 
most of the Indians from 
lower 
/ 
middle-income 
backgrounds. This stratum 
is highly susceptible to the 
volatility of the economic 
environment which calls for 
a high level of empathy and 
awareness of the impact of 
the economic vicissitudes 
on their lifestyle.  The credit 
assessment needs to be 
unique and appropriate and 
suitable for each of these 
businesses. 
Affordable 
housing refers 
to  housing units 
for the Lower & 
Middle Income 
Group where 
the sale prices of 
this house would 
be determined 
by States/
UTs with due 
consideration to 
the affordability 
of the targeted 
segment.
Positive: Enabling our fellow 
countrymen and women from 
the Low and Middle Income 
(LMI) segment to construct 
their dream home
Negative: The lack of adequate 
documents 
makes 
the 
assessment of their income a 
challenging task and calls for 
an individualistic approach.
