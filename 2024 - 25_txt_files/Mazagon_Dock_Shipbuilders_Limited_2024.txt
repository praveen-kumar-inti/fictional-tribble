1
Energy 
Management
Risk
In MDL’s shipbuilding and 
manufacturing operations, 
energy is a vital input 
impacting 
production 
costs and environmental 
footprint. Heavy reliance 
on purchased electricity 
and fossil fuels exposes 
the company to volatile 
energy prices and evolving 
regulatory 
requirements, 
including carbon emissions 
norms. Managing energy 
consumption and exploring 
alternative sources are key 
to reducing operational 
risks and securing long-
term cost efficiency.
To 
mitigate 
the 
risk 
associated 
with 
energy 
management, 
MDL 
undertook a series of 
energy conservation and 
sustainable 
development 
measures 
during 
FY 
2024–25. These included 
the 
procurement 
of 
inverter-based 
welding 
machines and rectifiers, 
BLDC pedestal and ceiling 
fans, LED lighting such 
as 
flood 
lights, 
street 
lights, and batten lights, 
Variable Frequency Drive 
(VFD) and 5-star rated air 
conditioners to enhance 
energy efficiency across 
operations. Additionally the 
Company procured green 
tariff energy to achieve 
a 50% renewable energy 
target and signed a Power 
Purchase 
Agreement 
(PPA) with NTPC Vidyut 
Vyapar Nigam Ltd for the 
installation of a 1,375 kW 
rooftop solar plant.
Negative
(There has been 
no negative impact 
in 
the 
reporting 
period of 2024-25)
2
Waste 
Management
Risk
MDL’s 
manufacturing 
processes generate waste 
such as metal shavings, 
plastic waste and non-
hazardous waste which 
require careful handling to 
comply with environmental 
laws. 
Ineffective 
waste 
management 
can 
lead 
to regulatory penalties, 
clean-up 
liabilities, 
and 
harm to local ecosystems, 
impacting the company’s 
operational continuity and 
public reputation.
MDL follows a robust 
waste 
management 
strategy by working with 
authorized 
vendors 
to 
recycle waste, reuse it 
in its own operations, or 
sell it through approved 
channels. 
This 
method 
supports 
eco-friendly 
disposal 
practices 
and 
enhances 
sustainability 
by reducing waste and 
fostering 
a 
circular 
economy.

Data Security
Risk
Handling sensitive defence 
contracts and proprietary 
shipbuilding technologies 
places MDL at risk of 
cyberattacks 
and 
data 
breaches. Any compromise 
of confidential information 
could result in significant 
financial 
losses, 
legal 
challenges, and damage 
to 
national 
security 
interests, highlighting the 
critical need for robust 
cybersecurity measures.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
c o m p r e h e n s i v e 
cybersecurity 
policy 
in 
line 
with 
government 
guidelines 
and 
has 
taken several corrective 
measures 
to 
enhance 
its 
security 
framework. 
Cybersecurity 
advisories 
from 
regulatory 
bodies 
such as the Cyber Security 
Group 
– 
Department 
of 
Defence 
Production 
(CSG-DDP), 
the 
Cyber 
Investigation 
Research 
Agency, 
CERT-In, 
and 
the National Informatics 
Centre 
are 
routinely 
reviewed and shared with 
employees 
to 
promote 
awareness. 
Regular 
Vulnerability 
Assessment 
and Penetration Testing 
(VAPT) audits are carried 
out to proactively identify 
and 
address 
security 
risks. The Company also 
maintains 
continuous 
communication with the 
CSG-DDP, 
submitting 
regular 
reports 
on 
its 
cybersecurity 
structure, 
assessed risks, and the 
actions taken to mitigate 
emerging threats.

Product quality 
and Safety
Risk 
The 
high 
standards 
required 
for 
defence 
vessels 
and 
marine 
equipment 
mean 
that 
product 
failures 
can 
cause major operational 
setbacks, legal penalties, 
and harm to customer 
trust. 
Conversely, 
delivering 
safe, 
reliable 
products can differentiate 
MDL in a competitive 
market and build long-
term client confidence.
At 
MDL, 
long-term 
product safety is ensured 
through 
careful 
design 
processes, 
stringent 
evaluation 
of 
suppliers, 
and 
active 
customer 
engagement, 
including 
support for maintenance 
and investigations in the 
event of accidents. These 
measures help minimize 
potential financial risks, 
such 
as 
revenue 
loss, 
while 
reinforcing 
our 
commitment to maintaining 
the highest standards of 
safety and reliability across 
the industry.

Employee 
Health & Safety 
Risk
MDL’s workforce 
faces 
risks associated with heavy 
machinery 
operation, 
confined 
spaces, 
and 
hazardous 
materials 
inherent to shipbuilding. 
Failure 
to 
maintain 
stringent 
health 
and 
safety standards can lead 
to workplace accidents, 
increased 
compensation 
costs, 
and 
productivity 
losses, emphasizing the 
need for a proactive safety 
culture.
MDL 
has 
adopted 
a 
comprehensive 
strategy 
to 
uphold 
workplace 
health 
and 
safety, 
integrating 
regular 
inspections, 
structured 
training 
programs, 
and 
continuous 
awareness 
initiatives. 
The 
Medical 
& Occupational Health & 
Safety Department leads 
health awareness efforts, 
while biomedical waste 
is responsibly managed 
through 
authorized 
disposal 
channels. 
Daily safety checks, a 
formal 
Work 
Permit 
System, 
periodic 
safety 
meetings, 
and 
ongoing 
training 
for 
employees 
and 
subcontractors 
reinforce 
the 
safety 
framework. 
Additional 
measures 
include 
employee 
recognition 
for safe practices, visible 
safety 
signage, 
strict 
housekeeping, 
regular 
equipment 
maintenance, 
a clear incident reporting 
process, thorough accident 
investigations, 
and 
meticulous documentation 
of 
safety-related 
activities—all 
aimed 
at 
fostering a safe and risk-
free work environment.

Materials 
Sourcing
Risk
MDL’s reliance on critical 
raw materials like steel, 
aluminium and specialty 
components exposes it to 
supply chain vulnerabilities 
linked 
to 
geopolitical 
instability 
and 
market 
fluctuations. 
Disruptions 
or 
cost 
increases 
in 
sourcing 
can 
impact 
production timelines and 
financial 
performance, 
requiring strategic supply 
management.
MDL mitigates the financial 
risks of supply disruptions 
and fluctuating input prices 
by reducing reliance on 
critical materials through 
the use of alternatives 
and securing stable supply 
sources. 
A 
stringent 
vendor 
vetting 
process 
ensures that all suppliers 
meet high standards of 
reliability, 
quality, 
and 
ethical conduct, reinforcing 
operational resilience and 
supporting 
long-term 
financial stability.
Negative
(There has been 
no negative impact 
in 
the 
reporting 
period of 2024-25)
7
Business Ethics
Risk
Operating 
within 
the 
defence 
sector, 
MDL 
must navigate complex 
compliance requirements 
and 
ethical 
standards. 
Any lapse in anti-bribery 
or 
corruption 
controls 
can 
result 
in 
severe 
legal consequences and 
erode stakeholder trust, 
making governance and 
transparency fundamental 
to business continuity.
By implementing strong 
governance 
practices, 
MDL effectively reduces 
the 
risk 
of 
violating 
business ethics laws and 
facing regulatory penalties 
or damage to its brand 
value. Rigorous oversight 
and a firm commitment 
to 
ethical 
standards 
enable the Company to 
ensure compliance while 
preserving its reputation 
for integrity and reliability.

equipment 
presents 
an 
opportunity 
to 
reduce emissions during 
operation.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements:
	
At Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), we recognize that long-term business sustainability is rooted not just in 
operational excellence, but also in responsible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. As one of India’s leading 
defence public sector undertakings, we are deeply committed to aligning our growth with national priorities such as Make 
in India, Skill India, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our ESG approach integrates innovation, inclusion, and 
integrity into every aspect of our operations, ensuring that our progress positively impacts both people and the planet.
	
During the reporting year, we made significant strides across key ESG pillars. On the environmental front, we continued 
to advance cleanliness and waste reduction through responsible resource management, cleanliness drives and awareness 
campaigns. Socially, we strengthened our community development programs, emphasizing nutrition, education, health, and 
women empowerment, while also deepening our engagement with SC/ST and women entrepreneurs through targeted vendor 
development initiatives. Governance remains a cornerstone of our ethos, guided by transparency, regulatory compliance, and 
ethical conduct in all our dealings. Observance of Vigilance Awareness Week further strengthens our commitment to integrity 
and ethical conduct across the organization.
	
As we look ahead, MDL remains steadfast in its journey to build a resilient, inclusive, and future-ready enterprise. We will 
continue to evolve our ESG framework, collaborate with stakeholders, and lead with purpose, ensuring that our legacy is not 
only measured in ships delivered, but in the positive change we help drive across society.

Complied except with respect to composition of the Board of Directors under SEBI (LODR) 
Regulations, 2015 due to non-appointment of Non-Executive Directors, Independent 
Directors and Woman Director and minimum number of Directors. Since, the Company is 
a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE), the appointment of directors has to be made by 
the concerned Administrative Ministry. Hence, the matter has been referred to the MoD 
for filling up the post and the same is awaited with MoD/ DPE. Compliance with statutory 
requirements is periodically reviewed by the Board of Directors.

for treating different types of effluents, such as a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), a Grey Water Treatment Unit, and an 
Oil-Contaminated Water Treatment System.
	
The STP handles up to 2 m³/hour of domestic sewage, focusing on reducing contaminants like BOD, COD, and suspended 
solids. Treated water is disinfected using a hypochlorite solution and is suitable for non-potable reuse, such as toilet 
flushing and gardening.
	
The grey water facility processes up to 4 m³/hour of wastewater, incorporating disinfection and advanced filtration 
through sand and activated carbon filters to enable water reuse within operations.
	
The oil-water separation system is equipped to treat up to 5 m³/hour of oil-laden wastewater. It features critical 
components such as a collection sump, transfer pumps, corrugated plate interceptor, oil sensors, and a final holding tank, 
effectively enabling the recycling of water that would otherwise be discarded.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes
	
The Company has put in place a systematic and community-driven approach to waste management across its facilities. 
Since FY 2010–11, day-to-day solid waste generated within the yards has been effectively managed in partnership with 
NGOs, without any financial outlay, enabling the organisation to maintain a zero-garbage status.
	
A structured system is in place for the segregation and disposal of various types of scrap and waste materials. Dedicated 
rate contracts are assigned for the clearance of accumulated scrap, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, wood, 
aluminium, copper, furniture, rubber, and paper. Plastic waste is collected on a daily basis by contracted personnel or 
NGOs, who then facilitate sorting and channel it for reuse or recycling.

1
Recycling 
of Rubbish/ 
garbage
Dry waste, including plastics and other recyclables, is collected on 
a daily basis through the support of NGOs or contractors. These 
agencies are responsible for sorting the waste for recycling or 
reuse, operating the service on a no-profit, no-loss basis to support 
sustainability goals.
Notable decrease in the 
volume of dry waste sent 
to landfills.
2
Sewage 
Treatment 
Plant
To manage wastewater generated on smaller ships, commercial fleets, 
and defence vessels, specialised treatment units are installed that 
offer a compact and efficient solution. These systems are engineered 
to treat onboard sewage in a manner that ensures the final discharge 
meets environmental regulations, with output quality significantly 
exceeding the limits prescribed under MARPOL Annex IV and MEPC 
227(64).
Instead of relying on traditional chemical-based disinfection 
methods, the technology operates on a proprietary process involving 
electrolytic oxidation. This approach removes the need to store or use 
hazardous chemicals altogether. Additionally, the units are equipped 
with automated features and remote access capabilities, enabling 
real-time monitoring.
Improved water quality 
with 
significantly 
reduced levels of BOD, 
COD, and suspended 
solids, ensuring minimal 
environmental impact.
3
Oil-Water 
Separation 
System
Oil-water separators (OWS) play a crucial role in both maritime and 
industrial settings, functioning to extract oil and other pollutants from 
water before it is discharged. These systems contribute meaningfully 
to environmental protection for several key reasons:
1. 	
Environmental Safeguarding – By ensuring that only treated, 
clean water is released, OWS units help reduce the environmental 
risks associated with oil contamination, thereby protecting 
aquatic ecosystems and minimizing harm to biodiversity and 
human well-being.
2. 	
Adherence to Global Standards – As per mandates from the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO), vessels are required 
to have OWS units in place to restrict oil discharges into marine 
environments within the permissible range of 5 to 15 parts per 
million (ppm).
3. 	
Conservation of Marine Biodiversity – The presence of oil in 
water bodies can severely disrupt marine ecosystems, impacting 
organisms from microscopic plankton to large marine animals. 
OWS systems help reduce the occurrence and impact of such 
pollution events.
4. 	
Protection of Public Health – Preventing the release of oil into 
water sources reduces the risk of water contamination, thereby 
supporting safer conditions for communities relying on these 
resources.
5.	
Innovation in Environmental Technology – The continuous 
evolution of OWS systems drives forward advancements in 
pollution control methods, contributing to the development 
of more reliable, efficient, and environmentally friendly 
technologies.
Enhanced 
marine 
protection 
through 
reduced oil discharge, 
better 
regulatory 
compliance, and overall 
support for sustainable 
operations.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link. 
	
Yes, the entity has a well-defined Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan, developed through a detailed 
evaluation of potential risks and emergency scenarios. The primary objective of the plan is to minimise the impact of 
unexpected events such as accidents, fires, explosions, or natural disasters on human safety and physical infrastructure.
	
The plan provides a structured approach for managing disruptions and restoring normal operations. It includes clear 
procedures for incident response, enabling management to take timely preventive and corrective actions. Depending 
on the nature and extent of the event, the plan can be activated either in part or in full. It clearly defines the roles and 
responsibilities of key personnel, outlines communication protocols, and specifies the presence required from designated 
teams during emergency situations.
	
The plan is structured around three key questions: who needs to be informed, who is responsible for specific actions, and 
where each team member is required to be during a crisis.
	
In addition, the entity follows a confidential Long-Term Business Continuity Vision Plan, which extends until 2033 and is 
aligned with the strategic directives of the Ministry of Defence, Government of India.

Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited  
Dockyard Road, Mazagaon, Mumbai – 400010
JointValues ESG Services Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 
“JointValues”) was appointed and engaged by the management 
of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (hereinafter referred 
as “the Company”) for performing an independent assurance 
of the nine core attributes as mentioned in SEBI’s BRSR Core1 
format2 for information pertaining to environmental, social, 
and governance performance disclosed by the Mazagon 
Dock Shipbuilders Limited in the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the ‘reporting period’ April 1, 
2024 to March 31, 2025 considering related regulation3, 4, 5, 6 
for listed entities issued by the SEBI.
JointValues 
performed 
the 
engagement 
through 
a 
multidisciplinary team of experienced professionals and 
subject-matter specialists, on attributes pertaining to 
environmental, social, and governance performance of the 
Company reported through BRSR Core, to obtain sufﬁcient 
evidences to support the professional judgement, and 
provide the basis for conducting reasonable assurance within 
the deﬁned scope and boundary of the engagement.
The Assurance team applied professional judgement, skills, 
and techniques with professional scepticism in a systematic 
engagement process to arrive at an independent opinion 
about the subject matters within the scope and boundary of 
the engagement.
Methodology, Scope and Boundary of Assurance
JointValues conducted this reasonable assurance of the 
company in accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance 
Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).
JointValues conducted the engagement process with 
adherence to ethical requirements, professional standards, 
and compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, in line with the International Standards on 
Quality Management (ISQM), Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements or Other 
Assurance or Related Services Engagement issued by IAASB.
During the engagement, the assurance team complied 
with the JointValues’s Code of Conduct, that deﬁnes 
independence and other ethical requirements and aligns 
with the best practices and the International Code of Ethics 
(ICE) for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).
The scope of this engagement, as agreed upon by JointValues 
and the company, was to provide Reasonable assurance on 
the non-ﬁnancial sustainability disclosure covered under 
nine core attributes of the BRSR Core format, as provided 
by the company to JointValues in the BRSR format. The 
values related to the nine core attributes of BRSR Core as 
provided by the company are mentioned in Annexure-I to the 
assurance statement.
The reporting boundary of the company’s BRSR is “standalone 
basis” as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A of the SEBI’s 
BRSR format for the reporting period from April 1, 2024, to 
March 31, 2025.
Limitations and Exclusions
-	
Reducing engagement risk to zero is rarely attainable; 
therefore, “reasonable assurance” is less than absolute 
assurance.
-	
Preparing the company’s BRSR information requires 
management to set the criteria, decide what 
information is relevant to include, and make estimates 
and assumptions that impact the reported information.
Business responsibility & sustainability report
Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited
53
-	
Calculating and measuring certain amounts and BRSR 
Core metrics, such as GHG emissions, water, waste and 
energy footprint, involves assumptions/estimations 
and inherent measurement uncertainty. Even though 
we obtain sufﬁcient appropriate evidence to support 
our opinion, it does not eliminate the uncertainty in 
these amounts and metrics.
-	
Evaluation, veriﬁcation and assessment of any 
company’s ﬁnancial performance and data have been 
out of the scope of this engagement, except relying 
on the company’s third-party audited ﬁnancial reports 
as provided to us during the course of engagement, 
wherever materially required concerning the nine core 
attributes of the BRSR core. The assurance does not 
cover the Company’s statements that express opinions, 
claims, beliefs, aspirations, expectations, aims, or 
future intentions. Additionally, assertions related to 
Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive 
issues are beyond the scope of this assurance.
-	
Aspects of the BRSR and the data and information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identiﬁed 
Sustainability Information.
-	
The assessment does not include a review of the 
Company’s strategy or other related linkages expressed 
in the Report. These aspects are not within the scope 
of the assurance engagement.
-	
The assurance does not extend to mapping the BRSR 
with reporting frameworks other than those speciﬁcally 
mentioned. This engagement does not consider 
assessments or comparisons with frameworks beyond 
the speciﬁed ones.
-	
The absence of a signiﬁcant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-ﬁnancial information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities.
Procedures Followed:
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we have:
●	
Interviewed 
relevant 
personnel 
of 
Company’s 
management 
responsible 
for 
Sustainability, 
Environmental Social Governance (ESG) and their 
team through a combination of virtual and physical 
meeting interactions for understanding the process 
of collecting, collating the subject matter as per SEBI 
Circular for BRSR Core.
●	
Assessed the appropriateness of various assumptions, 
estimations and materiality thresholds used by the 
Company for data analysis.
●	
Performed analytical procedures to analyse trends 
in the historical data and accordingly ascertain the 
reasonableness of the data reported in the current 
year.
●	
Performed substantive testing on a sample basis of 
the identiﬁed sustainability indicators, to verify that 
the data had been appropriately measured with the 
underlying documents recorded, collated and reported, 
including returns and internal monitoring reports ﬁled 
to various authorities by the company and relied upon 
by us. This includes assessing records and performing 
testing, including recalculation of sample data.
The selection of the assurance approach was based on our 
professional judgment, considering the nature, timing, data 
availability, evidence produced and the extent required to 
assess the risks of the information for material misstatement 
or deliberate misrepresentation by the company. Our opinion 
on the continuing effectiveness of the company’s internal 
controls is out of the scope of this assurance statement. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in this statement’s “Our responsibilities” section.

the information for the period April 1, 2024- March 31, 2025 
only and not on any other elements included in the BRSR or

particularly described in the scope above.

PRIORITY SDGS
At Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), sustainability is not just a compliance 
goal—it is a core part of our operational ethos and social commitment. Our efforts 
are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
serve as a global blueprint for a better and more equitable future. By integrating 
these goals into our CSR initiatives, workplace practices, and community outreach 
programs, MDL strives to drive measurable impact across health, education, 
environment, gender equality, and inclusive growth. The following sections outline 
how our key initiatives contribute to advancing specific SDGs, reflecting our 
dedication to responsible business and nation-building.
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
Health and well-being are foundational to sustainable 
development, and MDL has consistently prioritized physical, 
mental, and emotional wellness across communities. Through 
its SUPOSHANA Program and partnership with Seva Bharati, 
MDL supports child nutrition and holistic development, 
particularly for children from economically weaker sections. 
The company has also funded 75 pediatric cardiac surgeries, 
providing life-saving interventions for children who otherwise 
lack access to critical care. In partnership with HelpAge India, 
MDL has restored sight to 4,000 senior citizens through 
cataract surgeries, significantly enhancing their quality of life.
Further supporting families during health crises, MDL 
distributed free meals to caregivers at government hospitals, 
alleviating financial and emotional burdens. On the workplace 
wellness front, initiatives such as musical therapy sessions 
during International Women’s Day promoted emotional well-
being for subcontract women workers. Regular blood donation 
camps, Yoga Day celebrations, and safety awareness skits foster 
a culture of care, health, and safety across the organization and 
surrounding communities.

PRIORITY SDGS
SDG 4: Quality Education
Access to quality education empowers individuals and 
catalyzes societal progress. MDL’s collaboration with Seva 
Bharati Vijayawada aims to bridge educational inequities by 
supporting academic and innovation-focused activities for 
children from underserved communities. These efforts help 
nurture creativity, critical thinking, and lifelong learning among 
youth who often face barriers to opportunity.
SDG 5: Gender Equality
Promoting gender equality and empowering women are 
essential to inclusive development. On International Women’s 
Day 2025, MDL conducted musical therapy sessions and 
financial literacy workshops specifically tailored for subcontract 
women workers, supporting their emotional resilience and 
economic empowerment. Furthering its commitment to 
inclusivity in business, MDL organized a vendor development 
program targeting women entrepreneurs, helping women-led 
businesses access procurement opportunities and grow their 
enterprises.
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
Clean water and sanitation are vital for public health and 
environmental sustainability. MDL’s active participation in 
the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign and Special Campaign 4.0 
involved extensive sanitation work in public spaces—including 
garbage clearance, fogging, and drain cleaning—to prevent 
disease outbreaks and improve hygiene in local communities.

Fostering safe, inclusive, and empowering workplaces is key 
to economic resilience. During Safety Week, MDL promoted 
a strong safety culture through skits and awareness sessions. 
A financial literacy initiative for subcontract women workers 
enabled informed economic participation, while vendor 
development programs for SC/ST and women entrepreneurs 
encouraged supply chain diversity. MDL’s presence at the Oil, 
Gas & Power World Expo 2025 further highlighted its role in 
industrial growth and its position as a competitive, responsible 
employer in India’s engineering and shipbuilding sectors.
SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
MDL plays a key role in advancing sustainable industrial 
growth and technology. Its presence at the Oil, Gas & Power 
World Expo 2025 reflected a focus on innovation in surface 
engineering. A seminar on the Srijan Portal further promoted 
indigenous manufacturing and reduced import reliance. MDL 
also engages with institutions like NSTI to build a future-ready, 
skilled workforce aligned with Make-in-India goals.
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
Reducing inequalities means ensuring fair access to services 
and opportunities for all, especially the underserved. MDL 
supports this through the SUPOSHNA Program with Seva 
Bharati, offering nutrition and education to underprivileged 
children. It funds heart surgeries for children and cataract 
surgeries for seniors, providing essential healthcare. To promote 
economic inclusion, MDL has organized vendor development 
programs for SC/ST and women entrepreneurs, encouraging 
greater diversity in business.

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Building inclusive and sustainable communities requires 
attention to cleanliness, public health, and resilience. MDL’s 
commitment to this goal is evident in its active role in Swachhata 
campaigns, where employees and volunteers participated in 
large-scale clean-up drives, fogging, and waste removal efforts 
in and around its operational areas. These initiatives directly 
support healthier urban environments and promote community 
ownership of public hygiene.
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
Promoting sustainable consumption and production practices 
is essential to reducing waste and conserving resources. 
MDL demonstrated its commitment to this goal through 
#SpecialCampaign4, where it cleared out old files from the 
Service Block on October 3, 2024. These files were responsibly 
shredded and donated to the Cancer Patient Aids Association, 
a registered charitable NGO, reflecting MDL’s focus on waste 
reduction and social responsibility.
SDGs 13 & 15: Climate Action & Life on Land
Protecting the environment requires both immediate and long-
term action on climate change and biodiversity. MDL’s tree 
plantation drive, #EkPedMaaKeNaam, organized across various 
locations supports reforestation, enhances urban green cover, 
and contributes to carbon sequestration. This initiative is a 
tribute to maternal care and environmental stewardship alike, 
aligning with global goals for climate action and conservation 
of terrestrial ecosystems.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
Strong institutions are built on transparency, ethics, and 
civic participation. During Vigilance Awareness Week, MDL 
organized street plays and outreach programs that addressed 
corruption and promoted integrity among employees and 
local residents. These engagements not only reinforce ethical 
values within the organization but also help build trust in public 
institutions.
SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
MDL recognizes that partnerships are essential to advancing 
the Sustainable Development Goals. Throughout its initiatives, 
the company has worked with a variety of NGOs, government 
bodies, and industry platforms to expand impact and promote 
collective action. Collaborations with Seva Bharati for child 
development, HelpAge India for cataract surgeries, and NSTI 
for skill development exemplify MDL’s multi-stakeholder 
approach. The #EkPedMaaKeNaam campaign brought together 
municipal bodies, students, and community members, while 
the blood donation drives and Swachhata campaigns relied 
on strong coordination with public health authorities and civic 
agencies. These partnerships underscore MDL’s commitment 
to cooperative, cross-sectoral action in pursuit of sustainable 
development.
