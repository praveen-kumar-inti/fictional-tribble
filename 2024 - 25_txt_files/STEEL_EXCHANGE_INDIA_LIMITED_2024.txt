In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
SEIL is trying to set up targets to treat the emissions in
a much responsible manner and transition to low car-
bon steelmaking is critical for the long-term success
of the Company. SEIL also aims to maximize the
amount of scrap charged into its existing blast furnace-
based steelmaking operations
We are striving to reducing our energy footprint by em-
bracing energy-efficient technologies. Moreover, we are
proactively trying to integrate renewable energy sources
into our energy mix and contribute to a greener and
more sustainable world.
Minimizing withdrawal of fresh water from rivers by
maximising the recycling of treated waste effluents
within the plant by setting up effluent treatment plants.
SEIL aims to maximize the amount of scrap charged
into its existing blast furnace-based steelmaking op-
erations
A significant part of SEIL production is through the
blast furnace route, which is an emission intensive
process and contributes towards global warming.
Production of steel is a highly energy intensive pro-
cess and consumes a large quantity of energy from
multiple sources: coal, natural
Gas, electricity and other fossil fuel.
SEIL utilises a large quantity of water in its processes
and draws this water from multiple sources.
Steel as a material lends itself to circularity and is re-
cyclable as ferrous scrap to produce new steel. Steel
produced through recycling has a significantly lower
carbon footprint, as opposed to producing primary
steel by reducing iron ore.
SEIL believes that Employee Well-being and Development
creates a healthy company culture, better employee satis-
faction and higher employee engagement and therefore,
helps attract and retain talent. The Company's ability to at-
tract and retain talent provides the Company with a com-
petent and experienced workforce and reduces recruitment
costs for the Company. A high quality and motivated
workforce is critical for company sustainability.
We adopt best practices to ensure healthy employee
relations, employee growth and development as well
as work satisfaction. We have strived to build caring
and collaborative relationships based on trust and
mutual respect, paving the way for a respectful work-
place for all.

Risk
Occupational Health
& Safety
Ensuring the safety of its employees, contract workers and
communities is critical for continued regulatory and social
license to operate, especially considering process related
hazard in steelwork. In case safety related processes or
performance of the Company is deemed inadequate, or in
case of a significant safety incident, prohibition order from
the government may also lead to partial closure of the plant.
We endeavour to achieve the objective of safety and
health responsibilities through a robust safety manage-
ment system framework and a sound safety gover-
nance structure.

a.
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, the steel industry is one of the highest carbon-emitting sectors globally. While significant research and development efforts are underway to decarbonize the steel making
process, most breakthrough technologies are not yet commercially viable at scale. In this context, sustainably sourcing input raw materials-key contributors to the industry's
carbon footprint-remains a pressing challenge.
b.
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
Zero. The Company is in the process of setting up mechanisms to follow and track this data digitally.
3.
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous
waste and (d) other waste.
Steel has a very long service life before it needs to be recycled. End-of-life steel or scrap steel is not considered as waste product by the Company, instead used as input product by
remelting. The Company is committed to circularity and reuses scrap generated during the production process. Further the steel slag generated during the production is sold to
cement manufacturers which helps in reducing the emission intensity of cement production.
4.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
