P r u d e n t 
Enterprise Risk 
Management 
(ERM)
Risk

structures (e.g., securitizations, 
pooled loans) require disciplined 
and

risk 
management to prevent default 
concentration 
or

losses.
The company has a strong 
and centralized ERM system 
which mandated regular 
stress tests, enhance partner 
due diligence, and integrate 
risk signals into real-time 
dashboards. The ERM is 
periodically reviewed by the 
Northern Arc Operational 
Risk Committee.
 Negative: Provisioning 
requirements,

Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory dues have been deducted and deposited by the value

filings such as GST returns and PF/ESI challans. TDS is also deducted at applicable rates from vendor payments, ensuring a level of 
compliance is maintained from our side.

Northern Arc Capital Limited follows a structured approach to identifying its key stakeholder groups, considering their impact on and 
interest in the company’s operations. The primary stakeholders include shareholders, who provide strategic oversight; lenders and 
investors, who support the company’s funding needs; and value chain partners, such as originator institutions and service providers, 
who enable product delivery. Customers, including MSMEs and retail borrowers, are central to the company’s mission of promoting 
financial inclusion. Employees and the Board are key internal stakeholders driving execution and governance. Regulatory authorities 
such as the RBI and SEBI are engaged to ensure compliance and responsible conduct. The company also recognizes society as an 
important and a larger stakeholder in relation to its social impact and public transparency.
Stakeholder identification is periodically reviewed and refined through ongoing engagement mechanisms such as investor meetings, 
regulatory consultations, employee feedback platforms, customer service interactions, and community outreach. This process 
ensures that the company remains responsive to stakeholders’ needs and expectations.

Leadership Indicators
1. 
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 
Northern Arc Capital Limited has established a robust governance framework in which several Board-level committees oversee the 
processes and mechanisms for engaging with each of its key stakeholder groups. Dedicated relationship teams/individuals maintain 
ongoing dialogue with customers, investors (both domestic and offshore lenders), regulators, value-chain partners and shareholders, 
and they consolidate insights and emerging concerns into formal feedback reports for the relevant Board committees each quarter. 
In addition, select stakeholder representatives—and, periodically, individual Board members—participate in in-person meetings or 
roundtables to address strategic issues or urgent matters directly.
 
On the social and environmental front, Northern Arc’s sustainability function partners with non-governmental organizations to 
identify critical needs at the grassroots level, from financial-literacy programs to climate-resilience projects. Progress on these 
initiatives is captured in the annual Sustainability Report and reviewed by the CSR & ESG Committees, which reports regularly to 
the full Board.
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
 
Yes. The engagement by various teams at Northern Arc Capital with stakeholders such as employees, investors, borrowers, regulators, 
and communities provides relevant inputs on environmental and social topics. These consultations help identify material ESG issues 
and are factored into the design and implementation of the company’s ESG initiatives. For instance, feedback from investors has 
informed Northern Arc’s focus on climate-aligned financing and responsible lending practices. Similarly, insights from borrowers 
and partners in rural and semi-urban areas have influenced the development of inclusive financial products and digital outreach 
strategies. Input from employees and communities have supported the company’s focus on ethical conduct, shaping policies and 
activities across the organization
3. 
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
 
Northern Arc Capital Limited, through its CSR initiatives, has undertaken various programs aimed at addressing the needs of 
vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups. Guided by a Board-governed Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy, the 
company focuses on supporting marginalized, poor, needy, under-privileged, and differently abled individuals. Specific instances 
include educational support for underprivileged students, natural resource enhancement projects, and healthcare initiatives targeted 
at underserved population. These initiatives are designed to contribute to the well-being and sustainable development of these 
communities, reflecting Northern Arc’s commitment to inclusive growth and social equity.

At Northern Arc Capital, robust internal mechanisms are in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues, ensuring a fair, 
transparent, and accountable work environment. These mechanisms include:
 
1. 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism: Northern Arc has a structured grievance redressal system that allows employees and 
stakeholders to raise concerns related to human rights, workplace behavior, or unfair treatment. All grievances are reviewed in 
a time-bound manner and addressed by designated internal committees or officers.
 
2. 
Equal Opportunity Policy: The company’s Equal Opportunity Policy reinforces its commitment to non-discrimination and 
inclusivity, particularly for women, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities. It ensures that all individuals have 
access to equal treatment in hiring, training, promotions, and work conditions.
 
3. 
Code of Conduct: The Code of Conduct outlines expected standards of behavior for all employees and serves as a guiding 
document to uphold human rights, ethical practices, and respectful workplace interactions. Any violations of the Code, especially 
those concerning dignity, fairness, or human rights, are subject to investigation and corrective action.
 
4. 
Whistleblower Policy: Northern Arc’s Whistleblower Policy provides a secure and confidential channel for employees and 
stakeholders to report concerns related to unethical behavior, human rights violations, or policy breaches without fear of 
retaliation. Whistleblower complaints are reviewed independently, with appropriate follow-up actions taken by the Ethics 
Committee or relevant authority.
 
5. 
Safe Working Environment and Sexual Harassment Policy: Northern Arc enforces a zero-tolerance approach to sexual 
harassment through its PoSH Policy. An Internal Committee (IC) is constituted in line with legal requirements to handle 
complaints, conduct fair investigations, and ensure appropriate redressal and support for affected individuals.
 
These mechanisms collectively ensure that human rights concerns are taken seriously, reported safely, and addressed effectively 
within the organization.
