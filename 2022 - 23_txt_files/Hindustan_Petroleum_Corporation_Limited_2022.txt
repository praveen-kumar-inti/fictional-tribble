Question 7
Statement 
by 
Director 
responsible 
for 
the 
business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
It gives me pleasure to present the maiden Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) of our Corporation for FY 2022-
23. The mandatory requirement of publishing of BRSR by major 
listed entities is a commendable initiative of SEBI, as BRSR gives 
a holistic picture of the functioning of the Organization towards 
responsible Business Conduct.
BRSR is a report that is prepared in line with the National 
Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct, which outlines the 
nine essential principles – conducting and governing business 
with integrity and being ethical, transparent and accountable; 
practicing sustainable development; ensuring well-being of 
employees including value chain partners; respecting interests 
and being responsive towards stakeholders; promoting human 
rights; protecting and restoring environment; maintaining 
transparency and responsible manner in the advocacy of public 
policy; promoting inclusive growth & equitable development; 
and providing value to consumers in a responsible manner.
Thus, these principles emphasize the importance of maintaining 
ethical and sustainable practices by industry. By embracing 
these principles, the oil and gas industry can demonstrate 
their commitment to responsible business conduct, minimize 
environmental impacts, address social concerns, and contribute 
to a more inclusive and responsible global economy.
HPCL has been amongst one of the early adopters of Sustainability 
Reporting (since 2012) and ESG practices in India and has been 
disclosing its Sustainability and ESG performance through 
Sustainability Reports and Business Responsibility reports. 
These reports present our efforts towards continually building 
a sustainable business while upholding our commitment to the 
Environment, Social Sustainability and Ethical Business Practices.
HPCL is transforming the energy landscape across the nation 
and beyond with solutions that satisfy a wide spectrum of 
energy needs. Embedding myriad solutions for diversified 
energy needs, it is HPCL’s constant endeavor to bring the latest 
solutions in the ever-evolving energy transition landscape, 
especially considering the Climate Change challenges and the 
Net-Zero targets.
Climate change is a defining challenge, and its global impacts 
affect every sector of the economy. Recognizing the impact 
of Climate change challenges and the related goals on our 
Operations and the urgency for addressing these challenges, 
HPCL is set on the path of sustainability and is adopting 
measures that limit and reduce the impact of our operations on 
the environment.
As a responsible corporate citizen HPCL has already embarked 
on the journey to address the risks related to climate change, 
simultaneously exploring opportunities for growth in our 
business portfolios and the emerging business in energy 
transition landscape.
HPCL 
has 
already 
undertaken 
numerous 
projects 
for 
environment stewardship in the areas of energy conservation, 
expanding the pipeline network-an environment friendly mode 
of transportation, increasing share of renewables, increasing 
percentage of ethanol blending, setting up of ethanol production 
facilities, introduction and adoption of cleaner fuel offerings, 
further expansion of the EV Charging network, augmentation of 
CNG facilities at its Retail Outlets, promoting use of CBG through 
CBG projects, undertaking R&D projects in Green Hydrogen and 
other environmental initiatives, introducing new offerings in the 
area of petrochemicals, fuels and bitumen among others.
Apart from the above, HPCL has recently completed its 
Environmental Strategy with the help of world-renowned 
consultants and has drawn a road map for de-carbonization of 
its operations in line with its Net-Zero target of 2040 for Scope-1 
& Scope-2 emissions, with a strong focus on transitioning 
towards being a multi-energy green corporation. Thus, HPCL 
has focused its strategy on transition to a future that is multi-
energy, low carbon and customer oriented with a commitment 
to provide accessible and affordable clean energy.
Recognizing technology as a fundamental driver of value, 
HPCL has taken a proactive approach in incorporating Digital 
technologies into its business to elevate the customer and 
stakeholder experience and facilitate transparency and 
convenience in business transactions.
In order to revitalize the organization towards future challenges, 
HPCL has undertaken with renewed resolve, to create a 
“Nayaa HPCL” - “Nayaa” in every respect by being fresh, fast & 
fluid; and be recognized for human values, integrity, superior 
performance, agility and out-of-box thinking by rekindling the 
true HP Spirit.
The BRSR disclosure is an important milestone in HPCL’s ESG 
journey and HPCL has strived to provide responses to all 
Essential as well as Leadership indicators. As the BRSR landscape 
evolves, HPCL will continue to get enriched from the insights and 
learnings from the industry, regulators, academia, institutions 
and shall endeavor to add further value to its disclosures.
“Nayaa HPCL” forges ahead hand in hand with nature, growth 
through Safety and Sustainability and with the mantra of 
Delivering Happiness.
Wishing the readers all the best and success.

PRINCIPLE 4:
Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to 
all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder 
groups of the entity.
HPCL has instituted a governance structure to focus 
on embedding the ESG aspects within our strategy, 
organisational culture and business verticals. The Board 
has constituted Corporate Social Responsibility and 
Sustainability Development (CSR&SD) Committee, headed 
by an Independent Director.
We identify stakeholders key to our business through 
their impact on the organisation and the value we create 
for them in return. We have identified distinct stakeholder 
categories for our business. The precursor to establishing 
the mode and periodicity of stakeholder engagement is 
stakeholder prioritisation. The periodicity and engagement 
mode can span from one-on-one interaction at various 
frequencies to annual group level meetings to enhance 
strategic collaborations. To formulate an effective strategy, 
we assess the nature and depth of the impact that these 
stakeholders may have on our business and the extent to 
which our business decisions will make an impact.
Identification of materiality topics is carried out through a 
process of consultation with stakeholders and opinions of 
the experts based on prevailing best global practices and 
business environment.

engagement.
Eg:
In the recent years, in line with then directives of the

(refineries and marketing infrastructure) to produce and 
market BS VI fuels from BS IV, which lead to pollution 
reduction. Further, HPCL is also focussed on the augmenting 
the biofuel (ethanol, biodiesel and CBG) supply chain which 
is a major step in reducing GHG emission and combatting 
climate change.
While undertaking CSR projects under the specified focus 
areas, HPCL undertakes consultation with concerned 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
community/ 
local 
authorities/ 
representative bodies to tailor programs/ projects to 
address their needs.

identified as a material topic year on year by HPCL’s internal 
and external stakeholders. This aspect is included in the 
company’s sustainable development policy.
3. 
 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/

 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the 
complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
HPCL has a Whistle-Blower Policy wherein the permanent 
management and non-management employees can report 
to the management concerns about unethical behaviour, 
actual or suspected fraud or violation of the company’s 
code of conduct or ethics policy. The objective of this 
policy is to build and strengthen a culture of transparency 
and trust in the organization and to provide employees – 
officers and workmen with a framework / procedure for 
responsible and secure reporting of improper activities 
(whistle blowing) and to protect employees wishing to raise 
a concern about improper activity / serious irregularities 
within the Corporation.
“Improper Activity” means any activity by an employee of 
the Corporation that is undertaken in performance of his 
or her official duty, whether or not that act is within the 
scope of his or her employment, and that is in violation of 
any law or the rules of conduct applicable to the employee, 
including but not limited to abuse of authority, breach 
of contract, manipulation of company data, pilferage of 
confidential / proprietary information, criminal offence, 
corruption, bribery, theft, conversion or misuse of the 
Corporation’s property, fraudulent claim, fraud or willful 
omission to perform the duty, or that is economically 
wasteful or involving gross misconduct, incompetence or 
gross inefficiency and any other unethical biased favoured 
or imprudent act.
The policy provides that the confidentiality of those 
reporting violations shall be maintained and they shall not 
be subjected to any discriminatory practice. The Whistle-
Blower policy is hosted on the website of the Company.

special features for filing bitumen, which is a 
cost effective, environment friendly, efficient 
and easy logistics and handling alternative to 
the traditional MS drum/bulk pack for both 
producers/seller and the users
This initiative addresses the problem of 
packaging 
& 
transportation 
of 
Bitumen. 
This innovative packaging dissolves into the 
bitumen itself on heating, eliminating the need 
of using drums that have to be cut & disposed 
when bitumen is unpacked for use. Leads to 
material conservation due to zero wastage
