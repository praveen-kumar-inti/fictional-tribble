ENVIRONMENTAL
1.
Sustainability 
and Climate 
Responsibility
R
Climate change, energy 
shortages, and stricter 
environmental rules can 
affect our costs, operations, 
and delivery timelines. 
Increased carbon footprint 
or non-compliance could 
damage our reputation and 
stakeholder confidence. 
Supply chain disruptions 
from extreme weather are 
also a concern.
MosChip is committed to 
achieving Net-Zero GHG 
emissions by 2040. To 
support this goal, we lease 
office spaces from LEED-
certified property owners 
and ensure that all e-waste 
is handled by government-
approved recyclers. We also 
conduct regular monitoring 
and compliance checks 
to stay on track with our 
sustainability and climate 
goals.

2.
Sustainability 
and Climate 
Responsibility
O
Sustainability and climate 
responsibility offer us 
the opportunity to lower 
operating costs, improve 
efficiency, and enhance 
our brand image. Moving 
towards Net-Zero emissions 
by 2040 also drives 
innovation and collaboration 
across our value chain. 
It allows us to work with 
suppliers and partners who 
share our environmental 
goals, creating stronger and 
more responsible networks.
Our approach is to 
adopt energy-efficient 
practices, promote green 
procurement, and engage 
stakeholders on climate 
action. These efforts help 
us deliver long-term 
value while meeting our 
sustainability commitments 
in regard to Net Zero.

SOCIAL
3.
Employee 
Talent risk, 
well-being, 
health and 
Safety
R
The Company values its 
people and aims to be 
a preferred employer of 
choice, where employee 
health and well-being 
are a priority. Skilled and 
motivated employees 
form the backbone of the 
organisation. Managing 
people effectively and 
efficiently gives the business 
a competitive edge. However, 
there is a risk if the company 
is unable to hire and manage 
talent appropriately.
We depend on the 
knowledge, skills, and 
creativity of our people, 
and their well-being is key 
to our success. To address 
risks to physical safety 
or emotional health, we 
have well-planned health 
and safety practices in 
place. We regularly assess 
workplace conditions, follow 
strict safety protocols, and 
provide access to health 
and mental wellness 
support. Employees receive 
regular training on new skills 
and behavioural aspects 
to help manage emotional 
challenges. Our aim is to 
maintain a safe, healthy, 
and supportive environment 
where everyone can perform 
at their best.
Negative
4.
Community 
Impact
O
Our community initiatives 
give us the opportunity to 
create a positive social 
impact while building 
stronger relationships with 
the areas where we operate. 
Supporting education, 
skill development, and 
local welfare helps uplift 
communities and fosters 
goodwill. Such efforts also 
enhance our reputation and 
align with our corporate 
values.
To stay connected with 
the local community by 
supporting initiatives 
like education through 
Shiksha, healthcare through 
Niramay, and environmental 
efforts under Paryavaran. 
Volunteering programs also 
give MosChip employees 
a chance to give back and 
make a real difference 
where it matters most.

Customer 
Focus and 
Ethical 
Sourcing
R
Maintaining strong customer 
relationships and ensuring 
ethical sourcing are critical 
to our business success. 
Any lapse in product 
quality, service delivery, or 
supplier compliance could 
harm our reputation and 
customer trust. Supply chain 
disruptions or unethical 
practices by partners may 
also affect operations. 
Rapid changes in customer 
expectations and regulatory 
requirements add to this 
risk. These factors make it 
essential to manage both 
customer focus and sourcing 
practices carefully.
We work closely with 
customers to understand 
their needs and provide 
consistent quality and timely 
delivery. Our suppliers are 
evaluated against defined 
ethical, environmental, 
and quality standards 
before onboarding. Regular 
audits and performance 
reviews help ensure 
ongoing compliance. We 
also maintain alternative 
sourcing options to reduce 
dependency on single 
suppliers. Continuous 
feedback from customers is 
used to improve products, 
services, and supply chain 
practices.
Negative
GOVERNANCE
6.
Data Privacy 
and Security
R
Protecting enterprise data is 
not just a business need but 
it’s a responsibility we have to 
our customers and partners. 
As we handle sensitive 
information, it’s critical to 
ensure that data is secure 
and used appropriately. 
Failing to do so could lead 
to serious consequences, 
including legal penalties and 
damage to our reputation. 
With data privacy regulations 
tightening around the world, 
staying compliant is both a 
risk we must manage and an 
opportunity to build trust with 
our customers.
We take protecting data 
seriously by making sure 
only the right people have 
access and by regularly 
checking our systems for 
any weaknesses. Our team 
gets regular training on how 
to handle data carefully and 
follow privacy rules. We keep 
up with changes in data 
laws so we don’t get caught 
off guard. If there’s ever a 
problem, we respond quickly 
to fix it. Keeping data safe is 
part of how we do business 
and build trust with our 
customers.
Negative
7.
Data Privacy 
and Security
O
Strong data privacy and 
security practices give us the 
chance to build customer 
trust and differentiate 
ourselves in the market. As 
more clients seek partners 
who can protect sensitive 
information, efficient security 
systems can attract new 
business. Meeting global 
data protection standards 
also opens opportunities in 
regulated markets. Secure 
handling of information helps 
strengthen relationships 
with stakeholders. This focus 
supports both business 
growth and our reputation as 
a trusted technology partner.
We invest in advanced 
cybersecurity tools, 
regular system audits, and 
employee training on data 
protection practices. Our 
policies align with global 
privacy regulations and 
industry standards. Access 
to sensitive data is strictly 
controlled and monitored. 
Incident response plans are 
in place to address potential 
breaches quickly. We also 
work with clients to ensure 
security measures meet 
their specific compliance 
requirements.

Corporate 
Governance 
and Conduct
R
Strong corporate governance 
and ethical conduct are 
essential for maintaining 
stakeholder confidence and 
meeting legal requirements. 
Any lapse in compliance, 
transparency, or integrity 
could damage our reputation 
and lead to regulatory action. 
Inconsistent adherence to 
policies or code of conduct 
can affect decision-
making and business 
relationships. Rapid changes 
in regulations increase the 
risk of unintentional non-
compliance. These factors 
make governance and 
conduct a critical area to 
monitor closely.
We have a well-defined 
governance framework with 
clear roles, responsibilities, 
and accountability at all 
levels. Policies on ethics, 
compliance, and disclosure 
are communicated to all 
employees and reviewed 
regularly. Mandatory training 
ensures awareness of legal 
and ethical obligations. 
Internal audits, board 
oversight, and whistle-
blower mechanisms help 
identify and address issues 
promptly. We also track 
regulatory changes to 
update our practices in line 
with the latest requirements.
Negative
9.
Currency 
volatility
R
Fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates create both 
transaction and translation 
risks for the company. 
As MosChip’s functional 
currency is the Indian 
Rupee, any appreciation of 
the Rupee against major 
foreign currencies can 
reduce reported revenue 
in Rupee terms, impact 
profitability, and in some 
cases lead to collection 
losses. On the other hand, 
Rupee depreciation can 
make revenues and earnings 
appear higher than they 
actually are, which may give 
stakeholders a misleading 
view of the company’s true 
business performance.
To manage currency 
risks, we closely monitor 
exchange rate movements 
and assess their potential 
impact on revenues and 
costs. We explore natural 
hedging by aligning costs 
and revenues in the same 
currency wherever possible. 
Forward contracts or 
hedging instruments are 
used when necessary. Our 
finance team regularly 
reviews currency exposures 
and updates management. 
We aim to present a 
fair financial picture by 
explaining material currency 
impacts in our reporting.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
	
At MosChip, responsible and ethical business practices are deeply embedded in our mission and vision. As we present 
this year’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to 
the principles of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). These principles not only guide how we operate today 
but also shape how we envision the future of our company and our role in the communities we serve.
	
We recognize that long-term business success must go hand-in-hand with environmental stewardship, inclusive 
growth, and sound governance. Over the past year, we have made meaningful progress across all three pillars of 
ESG and have also set ambitious targets that reflect both our aspirations and our responsibilities.
	
On the social front, we are investing in our people by enhancing learning opportunities and building awareness 
around ESG. A major focus area for us is workforce diversity. We are committed to strengthening gender diversity 
and have set a goal to reach 40% women representation in our workforce and 30% in senior leadership roles by 2030. 
Additionally, we are striving to be recognized as one of the top employers in our core regions—a reflection of our 
people-first culture and strong employee engagement.
	
From an environmental perspective, we understand the urgency of addressing climate change and have outlined 
clear goals toward becoming a more sustainable organization. We aim to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 
2040. As a step in that direction, we are targeting a complete reduction (100%) in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions by FY2030, using FY2024 as the baseline. Furthermore, we are working toward sourcing 100% of our 
electricity from renewable sources by 2030. These initiatives reflect our commitment to reducing our environmental 
footprint while supporting India’s broader clean energy transition.
	
On governance, we are reinforcing our sustainability efforts within the supply chain, ensuring our partners share 
our values around ethics, compliance, and responsible sourcing. We are also working toward achieving industry 
recognition for excellence in information security and data privacy—areas that are increasingly critical in today’s 
digital world.
	
While the journey toward these goals is not without its challenges, we remain steadfast in our commitment. Each 
milestone we achieve strengthens our belief that responsible business is not only the right thing to do but also 
essential for long-term value creation. Our progress so far is the result of the collective effort of our teams, and I 
thank every employee, partner, and stakeholder who has contributed to it.
	
As we move forward, we will continue to act with integrity, learn from experience, and lead with purpose—ensuring 
that sustainability is not just a goal, but a way of doing business at MosChip.

The Company manages conflicts of interest as follows:
	
Directors and Senior Management are expected to always act in the best interest of the Company. They should 
avoid any business activity or relationship that could create a conflict between their personal interests and their 
responsibilities to the Company. This includes avoiding transactions with relatives or with firms where they or their 
relatives have a significant role or financial interest. If such a transaction is necessary, it should only be carried out 
after full disclosure and approval by the Board.
	
They should also not accept gifts from individuals or companies that have business dealings with MosChip, especially 
if the gift could influence their decisions or give the impression of a conflict of interest.
	
Directors and Senior Management must not hold any financial interest directly or through relatives in any company 
that competes or does business with MosChip, particularly in the case of key partners such as suppliers, customers, 
or distributors.
	
That said, it is not considered a conflict if they or their immediate family members use services from businesses 
that also provide services to MosChip like banks, law firms, insurance companies, or brokers so long as they receive 
those services under normal terms available to the public.
	
Good Governance Practices
	
Declaration of Interest: All Directors are required to declare their interests in Form MBP-1 as per the Companies Act, 
2013 (Section 184).
	
Related Party Transactions: Any related party transaction is carefully reviewed and approved by the Board and, 
where required, by shareholders through special resolutions under Section 188 of the Companies Act, 2013.
	
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct: The Company follows a clear Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that 
outlines how we expect our team to conduct themselves professionally and ethically.

a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) Yes
	
	
MosChip follows a supplier onboarding approach rooted in sustainability. As part of this process, the company 
conducts sustainability due diligence when engaging new vendors. Additionally, an annual sustainability 
risk assessment is carried out across all purchasing categories. Based on identified risk criteria, MosChip has 
initiated supplier evaluations focused on sustainability parameters. To further support this initiative, a feedback 
program has been introduced to enhance vendor awareness and improve their sustainability performance.

MosChip has established a robust supplier onboarding process that integrates sustainability criteria, ensuring 
all new vendors undergo a comprehensive Vendor Due Diligence procedure with a strong focus on sustainability.

As a semiconductor design services company, MosChip’s operations are primarily knowledge- and technology-
based, with minimal material consumption. The Company does not use raw materials in manufacturing; hence, 
the concept of recycled or reused input materials is not applicable. However, for operational needs, MosChip 
promotes reuse of office equipment, furniture, and peripherals wherever possible, and channels obsolete IT assets 
to authorized recyclers, contributing indirectly to resource circularity.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused,

MosChip is a semiconductor design services company and does not manufacture or sell physical products; hence, 
product and packaging reclamation under EPR is not applicable.
	
However, the Company manages internal operational e-waste (such as obsolete computers, peripherals, and 
network equipment) through authorized recyclers. During the reporting period, approximately 0.8 tonnes of such 
waste was channeled for safe recycling and disposal in compliance with applicable environmental regulations.
