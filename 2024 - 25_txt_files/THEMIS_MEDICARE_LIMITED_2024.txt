Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pleasure to present to you the Annual Report for the Financial Year 2024-25 a year of 
solid growth, focused execution and strong foundations laid for long-term value creation. Our performance 
through this fiscal year reflects our unwavering commitment to innovation, operational excellence and strategic 
foresight.
Throughout the year, we witnessed a consistent upward trajectory in both, revenue and profitability. Our 
Formulations segment delivered remarkable growth, supported by deeper penetration in hospitals and targeted 
initiatives to drive growth of focused brands. The segment grew over 20% year-on-year in Q3, and continued its 
strong momentum through Q4, driven by our strategic product mix, increased brand productivity and efficient 
allocation of on-field workforce. In our Hospital Business, our expansion into new contracts and geographies 
translated into over 13% Year-on-Year (YoY) growth with Critical and Intensive Care segments leading the charge.
Our Trade Business also continued to perform well, posting over 45% YoY growth in the second quarter alone 
and sustaining momentum through the rest of the year. Investments made in past quarters in strengthening our 
sales team, talent acquisition and market presence have been yielding tangible results.	
The API business faced some headwinds during the year, particularly from pricing pressures in China and 
domestic players. Despite this, our continued efforts in driving cost efficiency, sourcing optimization and 
structural realignment have helped us contain the impact and maintain business resilience.
Coming to our financial performance for the year 2024-25, our revenue increased 6.22% YoY to Rs. 405.51 
crores, while EBITDA and PAT stood at Rs. 49.05 crores and Rs. 29.83 crores, respectively.
We have entered the new fiscal year with optimism and a sharpened focus on innovation-led growth. Our aim 
is to further strengthen our presence in high-potential therapeutic areas, deepen our hospital reach and fast-
track high-value product launches. Moving forward, we are emphasizing cost rationalization, optimizing field 
force productivity, enhanced working capital management and selective investments in high-margin brands.
We remain committed to building a future-ready organization — one that is agile, efficient and focused on 
creating sustained value for patients, healthcare providers and stakeholders alike.
In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders, customers, employees, bankers and all 
stakeholders for their unwavering support and dedication.
Yours sincerely,
         SD/-

Formulations
•	 India is also a leading exporter of pharmaceutical 
formulations with a 14% market share by 
volume and ranking approximately 12th in export 
value globally. This market share is significant, 
considering India's cost-competitiveness and high 
standards in drug manufacturing.
•	 The formulations sector is expected to witness 
double-digit growth over the next five years. This 
growth will be propelled by rising demand for 
generic drugs in developed markets where cost-
effective alternatives are increasingly preferred. 
India's strong position in formulations is fuelled 
by its ability to produce high-quality medicines at 
competitive prices.
Regulatory Landscape
•	 India’s pharmaceutical industry is navigating a 
complex global landscape with regulatory changes 
and price control mechanisms playing a pivotal role. 
Future Outlook
The APIs and formulations markets are well-positioned 
to grow in the coming years. Increased investments, 
strategic acquisitions, and global market expansion 
are key drivers of this sector. As companies continue 
to enhance their capabilities and diversify their 
product offerings, India's role as a global hub for such 
products will become even more prominent.

Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) and 
Outsourcing
The CMO market which supports pharmaceutical 
production was valued at USD 172.8 billion in 2023 
and is projected to grow at a 7.7% CAGR until 2032. 
Outsourcing to CMOs allows pharmaceutical firms 
to cut costs, enhance production flexibility and scale 
operations. This trend of outsourcing has made India a 
key hub for contract manufacturing, attracting global 
pharmaceutical companies seeking cost-efficient 
production solutions.
Hospital Industry Overview
The Indian hospital industry is poised for robust 
growth with a projected CAGR of approximately 12% 
over the next three fiscal years. This growth is being 
driven by a combination of factors including increased 
healthcare awareness, a rise in lifestyle diseases, 
a growing elderly population and expanded health 
insurance coverage. Additionally, the rising disposable 
income, augmented public expenditure on healthcare 
and the growth of medical tourism are contributing 
to the industry's expansion. India is emerging as a key 
player in medical tourism, attracting patients from 
across the globe due to its competitive healthcare 
costs and high-quality services.

The sector is also witnessing increased deal-making 
activity with major investments by private equity firms 
and foreign players in Indian healthcare providers. 
Company Strategy & Outlook
TML has a diversified product portfolio which is a 
strength that the Company aims to leverage. The 
Company has a strong presence in Formulations 
and Injectables and a wide geographical network 
of distribution. We are focusing on expanding its 
presence in the hospital business across the country. 
We believe there are numerous opportunities in this 
sector especially given our strong product pipeline. 
TML is among the leading players in the country to 
offer a comprehensive range of anesthesia products 
which is advantageous for the hospital business. We 
also have divisions in critical care and intensive care 
which are key parts of our long-term growth plan.
Moreover, the Company is also investing in trade 
and co-marketing business, seeing them as areas 
with substantial potential for growth. This positions 
TML well in the market which is showing tremendous 
growth opportunities. Among nations that produce 
pharmaceuticals, India has long held the top spot. 
Medicine spending in India is projected to grow 9-12% 
over the next five years, leading India to become 
one of the top 10 countries in terms of medicine 
spending. Going forward, better growth in domestic 
sales would also depend on the ability of companies 
to align their product portfolio towards therapies such 
as cardiovascular, anti-diabetes, anti-depressants and 
anti-cancers for chronic diseases, which are on the 
rise.
The Indian Government has taken many steps to 
reduce costs and bring down healthcare expenses. 
The National Health Protection Scheme (which aims 
to offer universal healthcare), the ageing population, 
the rise in chronic diseases and other government 
programmes including the opening of pharmacies that 
offer inexpensive generic medications are together 
expected to serve as a boost to the pharmaceutical 
industry which bodes well for Companies like TML.

5.	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues
Yes, the Company has established comprehensive internal mechanisms to address grievances related to

plays a central role in identifying addressing and mitigating any human rights impacts or concerns at their 
respective locations. Employees and workers are encouraged to approach these HR teams directly to report 
grievances in a safe and supportive environment.
To strengthen its efforts in fostering a safe and inclusive workplace, the Company has constituted an Internal 
Complaints Committee (ICC) at each plant under its Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH), 
in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 
2013. These committees ensure that any complaints related to sexual harassment are dealt with promptly, 
confidentially and in strict accordance with applicable legal frameworks and the company’s internal policy.
Additionally, employees have access to the Employee Self Service (ESS) portal, which allows for the 
electronic submission of grievances. This dual channel grievance redressal system comprising both direct 
HR interaction and digital submission ensures that human rights related concerns are swiftly addressed, 
thoroughly investigated and appropriately resolved.
Moreover, the Company’s Business Code of Conduct and Ethics outlines its commitment to fairness, respect, 
non-discrimination and dignity for all individuals, thereby providing an overarching ethical framework for 
handling such issues. This integrated approach helps maintain a respectful and rights oriented workplace 
culture across all company locations.

8.	 Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
The Company maintains a strong zero-tolerance stance against any form of retaliation, harassment, or 
adverse consequences towards individuals who report concerns including those related to discrimination 
or harassment. This commitment is clearly articulated in its Whistle Blower Policy and reinforced through 
its Business Code of Conduct and Ethics.
Employees, workers and stakeholders are encouraged to report grievances in good faith, without fear of 
retaliation. The Whistle Blower Policy provides for a confidential and secure reporting channel and explicitly 
protects whistle-blowers from any detrimental treatment. It outlines clear procedures for inquiry and 
mandates that no individual who raises a concern whether anonymously or otherwise will be subject to 
retaliation, discrimination or any form of disadvantage as a consequence.
Furthermore, the Company affirms that any act of retaliation or misconduct against a complainant will be 
treated as a serious violation of company policy. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment, is taken against any individual found to be engaging in retaliatory behaviour, in accordance 
with the law and internal policies. These mechanisms collectively ensure that employees and stakeholders

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation. 
The entity has not implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism at its facilities; however, 
comprehensive Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) are in place to ensure that wastewater is treated effectively 
and in compliance with applicable environmental norms.
At the Haridwar facility, an upgraded ETP with a capacity of 25 KLD/day is operational. It is primarily used 
for the pre-treatment of wastewater, removing impurities before the water undergoes further treatment or 
safe discharge. This facility supports the company’s adherence to environmental standards and contributes 
to its broader sustainability goals.
At the Vapi facility, while ZLD is not applicable, a robust multi-stage ETP is in operation. The process involves:
•	Initial oil and grease separation;
•	Chemical neutralization using hydrated lime, alum and polyelectrolyte;
•	Sludge separation and drying;
•	Biological treatment via aeration;
•	Final sedimentation to separate biomass.
The treated water is then discharged into the GIDC underground drain, complying with the prescribed inlet 
norms of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). During the reporting year, the Vapi plant alone 
treated and discharged approximately 8112 KL of effluent to the CETP, where it undergoes further treatment 
prior to final discharge into the tidal zone of the Damanganga River.
Although ZLD systems are not yet in place, the company maintains stringent effluent treatment protocols 
and continues to explore opportunities to enhance water sustainability across its operations.

8.	 Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
Themis Medicare Limited has actively pursued initiatives during the reporting year to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions as part of its broader commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. 
One notable project involves a significant transition in lighting systems at one of its manufacturing facilities. 
In recognition of the inefficiencies and environmental impact of Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) which 
release approximately 80% of their energy as heat the company has replaced them with Light Emitting 
Diode (LED) bulbs, known for their superior energy efficiency and reduced heat generation. As a result 
of this initiative, approximately 90% of the lighting systems at this facility have been converted to LED 
technology.
The shift to LED lighting not only minimizes electricity consumption but also contributes directly to lowering 
indirect GHG emissions associated with energy use, particularly when sourced from conventional, carbon-
intensive grids. This step underscores the company’s proactive approach to integrating environmentally 
responsible practices into its operations and reducing its overall carbon footprint.
Although this specific initiative was implemented in one of the manufacturing units, it serves as a 
clear example of Themis Medicare Limited’s focus on operational sustainability and its commitment to 
progressively adopting measures that contribute to climate change mitigation. The company continues to 
evaluate opportunities across its locations to further enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental 
impacts in line with its sustainability goals.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the members of Themis Medicare Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Themis Medicare Limited (the 
“Parent”) and its subsidiaries, (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which 
comprises the consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2025, and the consolidated statement of profit 
and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information. (here in after referred to as the “Consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
(‘Ind AS’) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the 
Group as at March 31, 2025, and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their 
consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters section below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the 
Key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
2024    2025

Key Audit Matters
How was the matter addressed in our Audit
Revenue Recognition – the Parent:
The company has numerous customers from different 
geographical and having different terms of engagement 
and conditions relating to Revenue recognition, the right 
of return, variable consideration and price adjustments.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when control 
of the products being sold is transferred to the customer 
and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. 
The performance obligations in the contracts are 
fulfilled at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal 
customer acceptance depending on customer terms.
Our Audit Procedure Included:
We performed substantive testing by selecting samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year by verifying the underlying 
documents, which included goods dispatch notes and shipping 
documents.
We inspected, on a sample basis, key customer contracts to identify 
terms and conditions relating to goods acceptance and rebates and 
assessing the Company’s revenue recognition policies with reference 
to the requirements of the applicable accounting standards.
We assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition 
accounting policies, including those relating to rebates and discounts 
by comparing with applicable accounting standards.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable, after deduction 
of any trade discounts, volume rebates and any taxes 
or duties collected on behalf of the government such as 
goods and services tax, etc.
The Parent recognises revenue when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that 
future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
specific criteria have been met for each of the company’s 
activities as described below. The company bases its 
estimates on historical results, taking into consideration 
the type of customer, the type of transaction and the 
specifics of each arrangement.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Trade Payables
At 31 March 2025, the total trade payables balances 
included in Note No. 17 was Rs. 5,143.75 Lacs (Previous 
Year: Rs. 4,729.23 Lacs).
For the year ended March 31, 2025 letters seeking 
confirmation of balance/statement of account to 
selected vendors for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
Independent confirmations were received from a few 
parties and necessary adjustments, if any, were made. 
Accordingly, it has been determined as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures in relation to trade payables included:
-	Obtaining an understanding of and assessing the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of key internal controls 
over the existence and performance of Procurement activities;
-	Selecting a sample of items of procurements made during the year 
ended 31st March 2025 and inspected underlying documentation to 
assess the Occurrence, Completeness, Authorization, Accuracy, Cut 
off and classification;
-	Obtaining confirmations and / or account statements from selected 
accounts payables and reconciling to the vendor accounts;
-	We assessed and validated the ageing profile of trade payables;
Confirmations have been sought from vendors and wherever 
received, the necessary adjustments required, if any, have been 
made. In respect of others, balance as per Books of Account has been 
adopted and no adjustments have been proposed.

Key Audit Matters
How was the matter addressed in our Audit
Trade Receivables:
At 31 March 2025, the total receivables balances net 
of provisions included in Note 8 was Rs. 17,710.24 Lacs 
(Previous Year: Rs. 17,794.55 Lacs).
For the year ended March 31, 2025 letters seeking 
confirmation of balance/statement of account to 
selected customers for the year ended 31.03.2025. 
Independent confirmations were received from a few 
parties and necessary adjustments, if any, were made. 
Accordingly, it has been determined as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures in relation to trade receivables included:
-	We assessed and validated the ageing profile of trade receivables;
-	We assessed recoverability on a sample basis by reference to cash 
received subsequent to year-end and issue of credit notes post 
year-end, as necessary;
-	Obtaining confirmations and / or account statements from selected 
customers and reconciling to the general ledger accounts;
-	We considered the appropriateness of judgements regarding 
provisions for trade receivables and assessed whether these 
provisions were calculated in accordance with the Company’s 
provisioning policies and / or whether there was evidence of 
management bias in provisioning, obtaining supporting evidence as 
necessary.
Confirmations have been sought from customers and wherever 
received, the necessary adjustments required, if any, have been 
made. In respect of others, balance as per the books of account 
has been retained and necessary adjustments were made in these 
Financial Statements for doubtful cases based on subsequent 
collections. Hence no further adjustments are warranted. However 
the management should take necessary steps to ensure 100% 
compliance with regard to third party direct confirmations.
Based upon the above, we satisfied ourselves that management has 
taken reasonable judgements that were materially supported by the 
available evidence in respect of the relevant receivable balances 
and also for doubtful recovery the provision has been provided. 
We did not encounter any issues through these audit procedures 
that indicated that provisioning in respect of trade receivables was 
inappropriate.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
•	 The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s 
Report, Management Discussion and Analysis Report and Business Responsibility Report, but does not 
include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon.
•	 Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
•	 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information, compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries and joint ventures audited by the 
other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the 
other auditors and consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries and joint ventures is traced 
from their financial statements audited by the other auditors.
•	 If based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated 
2024    2025
106
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in 
accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board 
of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and its associates and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and 
of its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to 
liquidate or cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint 
ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associates 
and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls system in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates 
and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
2024   2025
107
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the business activities 
within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such business activities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors. For the business activities included in the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually 
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate 
the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that 
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure - A to the independent Auditors’ Report
(Referred to in paragraph (f) under the ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our 
report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
1.	 In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the Company as of and 
for the year ended 31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
of THEMIS MEDICARE LIMITED, (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary 
companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
2.	 The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, and its subsidiary companies, its associate 
companies and jointly controlled companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the “Internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential component of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by The Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).” These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
3.	 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by The Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to 
our audit of internal financial controls and both issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over 
financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.
4.	 Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial control system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled companies.
2024   2025
111
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
6.	 A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal 
financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1)	 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
2)	 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the company; and
3)	 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
7.	 Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the Company 
its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and jointly controlled companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, have in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March, 
2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Corporate Information
These statements comprise consolidated financial statements of Themis Medicare limited (CIN: 
L24110GJ1969PLC001590) (the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures 
(collectively, the 'Group' or the "Company') for the year ended March 31, 2025. The Holding company 
is a public company domiciled in India and is incorporated on May 31, 1969 under the provisions of the 
Companies Act applicable in India. Its shares are listed on two recognised stock exchanges in India. The 
registered office of the company is located at Plot No 69A, G.I.D.C Industrial Estate, Vapi district Valsad, 
Gujarat -396 195.
The Group is principally engaged in the activities pertaining to manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, 
especially in Formulation and API activity.
The financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on May 
20, 2025.

Significant Accounting Policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared and presented in accordance 
with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended by the Companies(Indian Accounting Standards)(Amendment) Rules, 2016 and 
the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act").
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the 
following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value or revalued amount:
-	 Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the 
classification(refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments),
-	 Employee defined benefit assets/(obligations) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of 
plan assets, plus actuarial losses, less actuarial gains and the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations, and
- 	Long term borrowings, except obligations under finance leases, are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method.
The Group adopted Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to Ind AS 1) from April 1, 2023. 
Although the amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, they 
impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements. 
The amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. 
The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting 
policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity specific accounting policy information that users 
need to understand other information in the financial statements.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard 
is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting 
policy hitherto in use.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2.2	Summary of significant accounting policies
(a)	 Principles of consolidation and equity accounting
(i)	 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The 
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to 
direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
The Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding 
together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. InterGroup transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 
of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to 
same reporting date as that of the parent Group, i.e., year ended on March 31. When the end of 
the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, 
for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial 
statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the 
subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
balance sheet respectively.
(ii)	 Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint 
control. This is generally the case where the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting 
rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after 
initially being recognised at cost.
(iii)	Joint arrangements
Under Ind AS 111 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either 
joint operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and 
obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The Group 
has investment in joint ventures.
Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see(iv) below), after 
initially being recognised at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.
2024    2025
118
(iv)	Equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of 
the investee in profit and loss, and the Group’s share of other comprehensive income of the 
investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and 
joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its 
interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
other entity.
The carrying amount of equity accounted investments are tested for impairment in accordance 
with the policy described in below.
(v)	 Changes in ownership interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of 
control as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results 
in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests 
to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the 
adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised 
within equity.
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of 
control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured 
to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value 
becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the 
retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted 
for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant 
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
(b)	 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Freehold land are stated at cost. The cost comprises purchase price, 
borrowing costs if capitalization criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset 
to its working condition for the intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in 
arriving at the purchase price.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
119
Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to 
the total cost of the item is depreciated separately. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their 
specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 
All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment is added to its book 
value only if it increases the future benefits from its previously assessed standard of performance. 
All other expenses on existing property, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and 
maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the statement of profit and 
loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition of property, plant and equipment which take 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate 
to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each 
balance sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is de-recognized 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain 
or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when 
the Property, plant and equipment is de-recognized.
Expenditure directly relating to construction activity is capitalized. Indirect expenditure incurred 
during construction period is capitalized to the extent to which the expenditure is indirectly related 
to construction or is incidental thereto. Other indirect expenditure (including borrowing costs) 
incurred during the construction period which is neither related to the construction activity nor is 
incidental thereto is charged to the statement of profit and loss.
Costs of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital work- in- 
progress.
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
Depreciation is calculated on straight line basis using the useful lives estimated by the management, 
which are equal to those prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. If the 
management's estimate of the useful life of a item of property, plant and equipment at the time of 
acquisition or the remaining useful life on a subsequent review is shorter than the envisaged in the 
aforesaid schedule, depreciation is provided at a higher rate based on the management's estimate 
of the useful life/ remaining useful life.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s 
useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable 
certainty that the company will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term. Leasehold land is 
amortised on a straight line basis over the balance period of lease.
The residual values are not more than 5% of the original cost of the asset.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of 
each reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable 
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
120
(c)	 Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are measured initially at cost. After initial recognition, 
an intangible asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment loss.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits from the 
specific asset to which it relates. An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal.
Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Amortisation methods and periods
Intangible assets comprising of trade marks are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life 
of ten years which is estimated by the management.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the amortisation period are reviewed at the end 
of each financial year and the amortisation method is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any.
(d)	 Research and development
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Development costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year 
it is incurred, unless a product’s technological feasibility has been established, in which case such 
expenditure is capitalised. These costs are charged to the respective heads in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the year it is incurred. The amount capitalised comprises of expenditure that can 
be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis for creating, producing and 
making the asset ready for its intended use. Fixed assets utilised for research and development are 
capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for Tangible Fixed Assets and 
Intangible Assets.
(e)	 Impairment of non financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When 
the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is 
used.

the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
121
Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. After impairment, depreciation 
is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in earlier accounting 
periods no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
(f)	 Foreign currency translation
(i)	 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee (INR), which is Group’s functional and 
presentation currency.
(ii)	 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are recognised in statement of 
profit or loss.
Foreign exchange differences regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in 
the statement of profit and loss, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses 
are presented in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within other gains/(losses).
(iii)	Group companies
The results and financial position of foreign operations that have a functional currency different 
from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
-	 assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet
-	 income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in 
which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and
-	 All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is sold, the associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit 
or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
(g)	 Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instruments.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
122
Initial Recognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related 
to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial 
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets
The Group classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) on the basis of 
following:
-	
the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and
-	
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
(i)	 Amortised Cost
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at amortised cost if both of the following 
conditions are met:
-	 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets 
in order to collect contractual cash flows and
-	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii)	 Fair Value through other comprehensive income
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following 
conditions are met:
-	 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
-	 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(iii)	Fair Value through Profit or Loss
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is 
measured at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI.
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised 
cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or ‘other financial liabilities’.
(i)	 Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is held for trading 
or are designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL. Gains or Losses on liabilities held for 
trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
123
(ii)	 Other Financial Liabilities:
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial 
liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest 
rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and 
points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, 
or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the 
end of each reporting period. The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit 
losses on financial asset. In case of trade receivables, the Group follows the simplified 
approach permitted by Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments for recognition of impairment 
loss allowance. The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track 
changes in credit risk. The Group calculates the expected credit losses on trade receivables 
using a provision matrix on the basis of its historical credit loss experience.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for 
amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain 
or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity 
is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in 
profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of 
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the 
balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
124
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
(h)	 Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as 
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a 
financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds 
received.
(i)	 Convertible financial instrument
Convertible instruments are separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of 
the contract.
On issuance of the convertible instruments, the fair value of the liability component is determined 
using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is classified as a 
financial liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until it is extinguished on 
conversion or redemption.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included 
in equity since conversion option meets Ind AS 32 criteria for fixed to fixed classification. Transaction 
costs are deducted from equity, net of associated income tax. The carrying amount of the conversion 
option is not remeasured in subsequent years.
Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible 
instrument based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the 
instruments are initially recognised.
(j)	 Taxes
(i)	 Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where 
the Group operates and generates taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit 
or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised 
in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
125
(ii)	 Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach, deferred tax is recognized 
on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to 
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
(iii)	Minimum alternate Tax
MAT payable for a year is charged to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. The 
Company recognizes MAT credit available in the statement of profit and loss as deferred tax 
with a corresponding asset only to the extent that there is probability that the Company will pay 
normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed 
to be carried forward. The said asset is shown as ‘MAT Credit Entitlement’ under Deferred Tax. 
The Company reviews the same at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent 
the Company does not have probable certainty that it will pay normal tax during the specified 
period.
(k)	 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for 
as follows:
Raw materials: cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Finished goods and work in progress: cost includes cost of direct materials and labour and a 
proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding 
borrowing costs. Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Traded goods: cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The net

the year ended 31st March, 2025

126
realizable value of work-in-progress is determined with reference to the selling prices of related 
finished products. Raw materials and other supplies held for use in production of finished 
products are not written down below cost except in cases where material prices have declined 
and it is estimated that the cost of the finished products will exceed their net realizable value.
(l)	 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed 
as revenue are inclusive of excise duty and net of returns, trade allowances, rebates, value added 
taxes and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow 
to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described 
below. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of 
customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company adopted Ind AS 115,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
using the cumulative catch-up transition method, applied to contracts that were not completed as 
of April 1, 2018. In accordance with the cumulative catch-up transition method, the comparatives 
have not been retrospectively adjusted
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in 
an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or 
services.
Recognising revenue from major business activities
(i)	 Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Revenue from the sale 
of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns 
and allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates.
(ii)	 Interest income
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR).
(iii)	Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is 
generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
(iv)	Export benefits
Export Benefits are accounted on accrual basis and recognised in the year of export.
(m)	Employee benefits
(i)	 Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be 
settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the 
related service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting 
period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
127
(ii)	 Other long-term employee benefit obligations
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 
months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are 
therefore measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of 
services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit 
credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting 
period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not 
have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.
(iii)	Post-employment obligations
The company operates the following post-employment schemes:
(a)	 defined benefit plans viz gratuity,
(b)	 defined contribution plans viz provident fund.
Gratuity obligations
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period 
less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related 
obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the 
defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee 
benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other 
comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes 
in equity and in the balance sheet.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan 
amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service 
cost.
Defined contribution plans
The Group pays provident fund contributions to publicly administered provident funds as 
per local regulations. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the 
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
the future payments is available.

the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
128
(iv)	Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the 
normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for 
these benefits.
(v)	 Share-based payments
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Employee Option Plan.
Employee options
The fair value of options granted under the Employee Option Plan is recognised as an employee 
benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
-	 including any market performance conditions
-	 excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions, and
-	 including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of 
the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises 
its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(n)	 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance 
of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if 
fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified 
in an arrangement.
(i)	 As a lessee
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases of 
property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.  
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred 
to the Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating 
leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease 
unless the payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to 
compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
(ii)	 As a lessor
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
ownership transfer from the Group to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance 
leases are recorded as receivables at the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease 
income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return 
on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
129
Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase in line 
with expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. 
The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.
(o)	 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be 
required to settle such an obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
as a finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimate.
A present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed 
as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation 
arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non 
-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Claims against the Group where the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, 
are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition 
of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, 
then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised.
(p)	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds and is measured with reference to the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable to the respective 
borrowing. Borrowing costs include interest costs measured at EIR and exchange differences arising 
from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest 
cost.
Borrowing costs, allocated to qualifying assets, pertaining to the period from commencement of 
activities relating to construction / development of the qualifying asset up to the date of capitalisation 
of such asset are added to the cost of the assets. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended and 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during extended periods when active development 
activity on the qualifying assets is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period which they are incurred.
(q)	 Segment Reporting - Identification of Segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which 
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the 
Group’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions for which discrete financial information is 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
130
available. Based on the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, the chief operating decision 
maker evaluates the Group’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.
(r)	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
-	
the profit attributable to owners of the Group
-	
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted 
for bonus elements in equity shares issued during the year
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per 
share to take into account:
-	
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity
-	
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(s)	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management.
(t)	 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for disposal:
Assets are classified as held for disposal and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell.
To classify any Asset as “Asset held for disposal” the asset must be available for immediate sale 
and its sale must be highly probable. Such assets or group of assets are presented separately in the 
Balance Sheet, in the line “Assets held for disposal”. Once classified as held for disposal, intangible 
assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.
(u)	 Current/non current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:
-	 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
-	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
131
-	 Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
-	 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
-	 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
-	 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
-	 It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
-	 There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation 
in cash and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
(v)	 Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no 
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed 
at the end of the reporting period.
(w)	Rounding of amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest 
Lakh as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
3	
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles 
of Ind AS requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense for the periods presented.
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning 
out to be different than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and 
judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each 
affected line item in the financial statements.
(i)	 Fair value measurement of Financial Instruments
When the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements 
cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using 
valuation techniques which involve various judgements and assumptions.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024    2025
132
(ii)	 Estimation of net realizable value for inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV).
NRV for completed inventory is assessed by reference to market conditions and prices existing at the 
reporting date and is determined by the Company, based on comparable transactions identified.
(iii)	Impairment of non - financial assets
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable 
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
(iv)	Recoverability of trade receivables
In case of trade receivables, the Company follows the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 
– Financial Instruments for recognition of impairment loss allowance. The application of simplified 
approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. The Company calculates the 
expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the basis of its historical credit 
loss experience.
(v)	 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment/intangible assets
The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment/intangible assets at the end 
of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future 
periods.
(vi)	 Valuation of deferred tax assets
The Company reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. 
The policy for the same has been explained under Note above.
(vii)	Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment medical benefits and the 
present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation 
involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These 
include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

The leave obligations cover the company's liability for sick and earned leave.
The amount of the provision of INR 27.10 Lakhs (March 31, 2024: INR 30.38 Lakhs) is presented as current, 
since the company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for any of these obligations.

The company provides for gratuity for employees in India as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. 
Employees who are in continuous service for a period of five years are eligible for gratuity. The amount 
of gratuity payable on retirement/ termination is the employees last drawn basic salary per month 
computed proportionately for 15 days salary multiplied by number of years of service.
The gratuity plan is a funded plan and the company makes contributions to recognised funds in India. 
The company does not fully fund the liability and maintains a target level of funding to be maintained 
over a period of time based on estimations of expected gratuity payments.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet and the movement in the net defined benefit obligation

The management assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalent, trade receivables, trade payables and 
other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short term 
maturities of these instruments.
The fair values of non current borrowings are based on discounted cash flows using  a current borrowing rate. 
They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, 
including own credit risk.
ii.	 Fair Value Hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognised and measure at fair value. To provide an indication about the reliability of 
the inputs used in determining fair value, the company has classified its financial instruments into three 
levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table:

There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the period.
Level 1 - Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed 
equity instruments, mutual funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity instruments which are 
traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at the reporting period. The mutual funds are 
valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2 - The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is 
included in level 2.
Level 3 - If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3.  
iii.	 Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Specific Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
- the use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments
- the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis
The fair value of unquoted equity instruments and unquoted bonds is not significantly different from their 
carrying value and hence the management has considered their carrying amount as fair value.
iv.	 Valuation processes
The finance department of the company includes a team that performs the valuations of financial assets and 
liabilities required for financial reporting purposes, including level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to 
the chief financial officer (CFO) and the audit committee (AC). Discussions of valuation processes and results 
are held between the CFO, AC and the valuation team at least once every three months, in line with the 
company's quarterly reporting periods.
40. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company's activity exposes it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Company's overall risk management 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
financial performance of the company. This note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and 
how the company manages the risk.
(A)	Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations leading to a financial loss. Credit risk 
arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets carried at amortised cost and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables.
i.	
Credit risk management
Credit risk has always been managed by the company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits 
and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the company grants credit terms 
in the normal course of business.
The company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess 
whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the company compares the risk of a default occurring 
on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers 
available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for  
the year ended 31st March, 2025
2024   2025
163
In general, it is presumed that credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition if the payments 
are more than 30 days past due.
A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty  fails to make contractual payments of when they 
fall due. This definition of default is determined by considering the business environment in which entity 
operates and other macro-economic factors.
(B)	Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become 
due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. The Company consistently generated sufficient cash flows from 
operations to meet its financial obligations. Also, the Company has unutilized credit limits with banks.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the company's liquidity position (comprising the undrawn 
borrowing facilities) and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, the 
company’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid 
assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external 
regulatory requirements.
Maturities of financial liabilities
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the 
earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay. In the table below, borrowings include both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest rates are floating rate, the undiscounted amount 
is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period.

(C)	 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of change in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk 
and other price risk such as commodity risk.
(i)	 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in 
foreign currency, which fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to 
the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the external commercial borrowings 
and export receivables.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows 
established risk management policies and standard operating procedures to mitigate the risks.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
The Company’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which 
expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. Company policy is to maintain most of its borrowings 
at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary. During March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024 , the company’s borrowings at variable rate were mainly denominated in USD.
The company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to 
interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows 
will fluctuate because of a change in market.

The exposure of the company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period 
are as follows:

(iii)	Commodity Price risk
The Group's operating activities involve purchase and sale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), 
whose prices are exposed to the risk of fluctuation over short periods of time. Commodity price risk 
exposure is evaluated  and  managed through procurement and other related operating policies. As 
of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the Company had not entered into any material derivative 
contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.
41. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
For the purpose of the company's capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium 
and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the 
Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.
The company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions 
and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company 
may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The 
company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The 
company includes within debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and 
cash equivalents.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Themis Medicare Limited
Report on the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Themis Medicare Limited (the 
“Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the Statement of Profit and Loss 
(including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flow 
for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as the “standalone financial statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, 
(“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as 
at March 31, 2025, and its profit, total comprehensive income, the changes in equity and its cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key 
audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matters
How was the matter addressed in our Audit
Revenue Recognition:
The company has numerous customers from different 
geographical and having different terms of engagement 
and conditions relating to Revenue recognition, the right 
of return, variable consideration and price adjustments.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when control 
of the products being sold is transferred to the customer 
and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations. 
The performance obligations in the contracts are fulfilled 
at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer 
acceptance depending on customer terms.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, after deduction of any trade 
discounts, volume rebates and any taxes or duties 
collected on behalf of the government such as goods and 
services tax, etc.
Our Audit Procedure Included:
We performed substantive testing by selecting samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year by verifying the underlying 
documents, which included goods dispatch notes and shipping 
documents.
We inspected, on a sample basis, key customer contracts to identify 
terms and conditions relating to goods acceptance and rebates and 
assessing the Company’s revenue recognition policies with reference 
to the requirements of the applicable accounting standards.
We assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition 
accounting policies, including those relating to rebates and 
discounts by comparing with applicable accounting standards.

Key Audit Matters
How was the matter addressed in our Audit
The company recognises revenue when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that 
future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
specific criteria have been met for each of the company’s 
activities as described below. The company bases its 
estimates on historical results, taking into consideration 
the type of customer, the type of transaction and the 
specifics of each arrangement.
We have performed alternate audit procedures to audit the 
existence of inventory as per the guidance provided in SA 501 
"Audit Evidence- Specific Consideration for selected items" and 
have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to issue our 
unmodified opinion on these standalone financial results.
Trade Payables
At 31 March 2025, the total trade payables balances 
included in Note No. 17 was Rs. 5,143.75 Lacs (Previous 
Year: Rs. 4,729.23 Lacs).
For the year ended March 31, 2025 letters seeking 
confirmation of balance/statement of account were sent 
to selected vendors for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
Independent confirmations were received from a few 
parties and necessary adjustments, if any, were made. 
Accordingly, it has been determined as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures in relation to trade payables included:
-	Obtaining an understanding of and assessing the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of key internal 
controls over the existence and performance of Procurement 
activities;
-	Selecting a sample of items of procurements made during the year 
ended 31st March 2025 and inspected underlying documentation 
to assess the Occurrence, Completeness, Authorization, Accuracy, 
Cut off and classification;
-	Obtaining confirmations and / or account statements from selected 
accounts payables and reconciling to the vendor accounts;
-	We assessed and validated the ageing profile of trade payables;
Confirmations have been sought from vendors and wherever 
received, the necessary adjustments required, if any, have been 
made. In respect of others, balance as per Books of Account has 
been adopted and no adjustments have been proposed.
Trade Receivables:
At 31 March 2025, the total receivables balances net 
of provisions included in Note 8 was Rs. 17,745.60 Lacs 
(Previous Year: Rs. 17,829.91 Lacs).
For the year ended March 31, 2025 letters seeking 
confirmation of balance/statement of account were sent 
to selected customers for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
Independent confirmations were received from a few 
parties and necessary adjustments, if any, were made. 
Accordingly, it has been determined as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures in relation to trade receivables included:
-	We assessed and validated the ageing profile of trade receivables;
-	We assessed recoverability on a sample basis by reference to cash 
received subsequent to year-end and issue of credit notes post 
year-end, as necessary;
-	Obtaining confirmations and / or account statements from 
selected customers and reconciling to the general ledger accounts;
-	We considered the appropriateness of judgements regarding 
provisions for trade receivables and assessed whether these 
provisions were calculated in accordance with the Company’s 
provisioning policies and / or whether there was evidence of 
management bias in provisioning, obtaining supporting evidence 
as necessary.
Confirmations have been sought from customers and wherever 
received, the necessary adjustments required, if any, have been 
made. In respect of others, balance as per the books of account 
has been retained and necessary adjustments were made in these 
Financial Statements for doubtful cases based on subsequent 
collections. Hence no further adjustments are warranted. However 
the management should take necessary steps to ensure 100% 
compliance with regard to third party direct confirmations.
Based upon the above, we satisfied ourselves that management has 
taken reasonable judgements that were materially supported by 
the available evidence in respect of the relevant receivable balances 
and also for doubtful recovery the provision has been provided. 
We did not encounter any issues through these audit procedures 
that indicated that provisioning in respect of trade receivables was 
inappropriate.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
•	 The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business 
Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and shareholder’s Information, but does not include the 
consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
•	 Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
•	 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial 
position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of 
the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statement that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial 
statements.
2024   2025
171
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that, a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the standalone financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

and is in the name of Indo French Time Industries Limited but 
conveyance is pending. The Company is in discussions with

(45 of 1988) and Rules made thereunder, and therefore the question of our commenting on whether 
the Company has appropriately disclosed the details in its financial statements does not arise.
(ii)	 (a)	 The inventory has been physically verified by the management during the year. In our opinion, 
the frequency of such verification is reasonable and procedures and coverage as followed by 
management were appropriate. No discrepancies were noticed on verification between the physical 
stocks and the book records that were 10% or more in the aggregate for each class of inventory.

Annexure “B” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 
143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of THEMIS MEDICARE LIMITED, (“the 
Company”) as of 31st March, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India and The Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial 
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control 
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
2024   2025
179
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the Company has, 
in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2025, based on 
the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Significant Accounting Policies
2.1	Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the company have been prepared and presented in accordance with Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
as amended by the Companies(Indian Accounting Standards)(Amendment) Rules, 2016 and the relevant 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act").
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and 
liabilities which have been measured at fair value or revalued amount:
-	
Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the 
classification(refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments),
- 	 Employee defined benefit assets/(obligations) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan 
assets, plus actuarial losses, less actuarial gains and the present value of the defined benefit obligations, 
and
- 	 Long term borrowings, except obligations under finance leases, are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method.
The Company adopted Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to Ind AS 1) from April 1, 2023. 
Although the amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, they 
impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements.
The amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. The 
amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, 
assisting entities to provide useful, entity specific accounting policy information that users need to 
understand other information in the financial statements.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard is 
initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.

Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2.2	Summary of significant accounting policies
(a)	 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Freehold land are stated at cost. The cost comprises purchase price, borrowing 
costs if capitalization criteria are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working 
condition for the intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total 
cost of the item is depreciated separately. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required 
to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful 
lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of 
the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and 
maintenance costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment is added to its book value 
only if it increases the future benefits from its previously assessed standard of performance. All other 
expenses on existing property, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and maintenance 
expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period 
during which such expenses are incurred. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition of property, plant and equipment which take 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they relate to 
the period till such assets are ready to be put to use.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance 
sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is de-recognized 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain 
or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the 
Property, plant and equipment is de-recognized.
Expenditure directly relating to construction activity is capitalized. Indirect expenditure incurred 
during construction period is capitalized to the extent to which the expenditure is indirectly related to 
construction or is incidental thereto. Other indirect expenditure (including borrowing costs) incurred 
during the construction period which is neither related to the construction activity nor is incidental 
thereto is charged to the statement of profit and loss.
Costs of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital work- in- progress.
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value
Depreciation is calculated on straight line basis using the useful lives estimated by the management, 
which are equal to those prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. If the management's 
estimate of the useful life of a item of property, plant and equipment at the time of acquisition or the 
remaining useful life on a subsequent review is shorter than the envisaged in the aforesaid schedule, 
depreciation is provided at a higher rate based on the management's estimate of the useful life/ 
remaining useful life.
2024    2025
186
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful 
life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty 
that the company will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term. Leasehold land is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the balance period of lease.
The residual values are not more than 5% of the original cost of the asset.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each 
reporting period. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if 
the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
(b)	 Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are measured initially at cost. After initial recognition, 
an intangible asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment 
loss.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits from the 
specific asset to which it relates. An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal.
Losses arising from retirement and gains or losses arising from disposal of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Amortisation methods and periods
Intangible assets comprising of trade marks are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of 
ten years which is estimated by the management.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the amortisation period are reviewed at the end of 
each financial year and the amortisation method is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any.
(c)	 Research and development
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Development 
costs of products are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year it is incurred, unless a 
product’s technological feasibility has been established, in which case such expenditure is capitalised. 
These costs are charged to the respective heads in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year it is 
incurred. The amount capitalised comprises of expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated 
on a reasonable and consistent basis for creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended 
use. Fixed assets utilised for research and development are capitalised and depreciated in accordance 
with the policies stated for Tangible Fixed Assets and Intangible Assets.
(d)	 Impairment of non financial assets
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable 
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to 
its recoverable amount.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024   2025
187
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. After impairment, depreciation is 
provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.
When there is indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in earlier accounting periods 
no longer exists or may have decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, to the extent the amount was previously charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(e)	 Foreign currency translation
(i)	 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the entity are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial 
statements are presented in Indian rupee (INR), which is entity’s functional and presentation 
currency.
(ii)	 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies at year end exchange rates are recognised in statement of profit or loss.
Foreign exchange differences regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs are presented in the 
statement of profit and loss, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
presented in the statement of profit and loss on a net basis within other gains/(losses).
(f)	 Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instruments.
Initial Recognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related to 
borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets
The Company classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) or fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) on the basis of 
following:
the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024    2025
188
(i)	 Amortised Cost
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions 
are met:
-	
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and
-	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii)	 Fair Value through other comprehensive income
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following 
conditions are met:
-	
the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and
-	
the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(iii)	Fair Value through Profit or Loss
A financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is 
measured at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI.
All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost 
or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or ‘other financial liabilities’.
(i)	 Financial Liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is held for trading or are 
designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL. Gains or Losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(ii)	 Other Financial Liabilities:
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received 
that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or 
discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end 
of each reporting period. The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on 
financial asset. In case of trade receivables, the Company follows the simplified approach permitted 
by Ind AS 109 – Financial Instruments for recognition of impairment loss allowance. The application 
of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. The Company 
calculates the expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix on the basis of its 
historical credit loss experience.

31st March, 2025
2024   2025
189
Derecognition of financial assets
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company 
recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. 
If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial 
asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss 
that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised 
in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal 
of that financial asset.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled 
or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an 
exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement 
of profit or loss.
Equity investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
Investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are carried at cost. Impairment recognized, 
if any, is reduced from the carrying value.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried 
as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is 
negative.
(g)	 Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as 
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a 
financial liability and an equity instrument.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds 
received.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024    2025
190
(h)	 Convertible financial instrument
Convertible instruments are separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the 
contract.
On issuance of the convertible instruments, the fair value of the liability component is determined 
using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. This amount is classified as a financial 
liability measured at amortised cost (net of transaction costs) until it is extinguished on conversion or 
redemption.
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included in 
equity since conversion option meets Ind AS 32 criteria for fixed to fixed classification. Transaction costs 
are deducted from equity, net of associated income tax. The carrying amount of the conversion option 
is not remeasured in subsequent years.
Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible 
instrument based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the 
instruments are initially recognised.
(i)	 Taxes
(i)	 Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from 
or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those 
that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the company 
operates and generates taxable income.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit 
or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in 
correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
(ii)	 Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach, deferred tax is recognized on 
temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, except when the deferred income tax arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the  deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024   2025
191
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set 
off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable 
entity and the same taxation authority.
(iii)	Minimum alternate Tax
MAT payable for a year is charged to the statement of profit and loss as current tax. The Company 
recognizes MAT credit available in the statement of profit and loss as deferred tax with a corresponding 
asset only to the extent that there is probability that the Company will pay normal income tax during 
the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. The said 
asset is shown as ‘MAT Credit Entitlement’ under Deferred Tax. The Company reviews the same at 
each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Company does not have probable 
certainty that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.
(j)	 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
Raw materials: cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Finished goods and work in progress: cost includes cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion 
of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Traded goods: cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. The net realizable value of work-in-
progress is determined with reference to the selling prices of related finished products. Raw materials 
and other supplies held for use in production of finished products are not written down below cost 
except in cases where material prices have declined and it is estimated that the cost of the finished 
products will exceed their net realizable value.
(k)	 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed 
as revenue are inclusive of excise duty and net of returns, trade allowances, rebates, value added taxes 
and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The company recognises revenue when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
specific criteria have been met for each of the company’s activities as described below. The company 
bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of 
transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Recognising revenue from major business activities
(i)	 Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods. Revenue from the sale of 
goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and 
allowances, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024    2025
192
(ii)	 Interest income
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR).
(iii)	Dividend income
Revenue is recognised when the company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is 
generally when shareholders approve the dividend.
(iv)	Export benefits
Export Benefits are accounted on accrual basis and recognised in the year of export.
(l)	 Employee benefits
(i)	 Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled 
wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related 
service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and 
are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.
(ii)	 Other long-term employee benefit obligations
The liabilities for earned leave and sick leave are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore 
measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services 
provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. 
The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have 
terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does not have 
an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period, 
regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.
(iii)	Post-employment obligations
The company operates the following post-employment schemes:
(a)	 defined benefit plans viz gratuity,
(b)	 defined contribution plans viz provident fund.
Gratuity obligations
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair 
value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government 
bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense 
in the statement of profit and loss.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024   2025
193
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive 
income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the 
balance sheet.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or 
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service cost.
Defined contribution plans
The company pays provident fund contributions to publicly administered provident funds as per local 
regulations. The company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been 
paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the contributions are 
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(iv)	Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the company before the 
normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these 
benefits.
(v)	 Share-based payments
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Employee Option Plan.
Employee options
The fair value of options granted under the Employee Option Plan is recognised as an employee 
benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the 
specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and 
service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or 
loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
(m)	Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement at the inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfillment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right 
to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
(i)	 As a lessee
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases of property, 
plant and equipment where the company, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to 
the company as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are 
charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the payments 
are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s 
expected inflationary cost increases.
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024    2025
194
(ii)	 As a lessor
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
transfer from the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are 
recorded as receivables at the Company’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income 
is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net 
investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
Lease income from operating leases where the company is a lessor is recognised in income on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase in line with 
expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. The respective 
leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.
(n)	 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be 
required to settle such an obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost. 
Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
A present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as 
a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising 
from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non -occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.
Claims against the Company where the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, 
are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then 
the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised.
(o)	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs that the Company incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds and is measured with reference to the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable to the respective 
borrowing. Borrowing costs include interest costs measured at EIR and exchange differences arising 
from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs, allocated to qualifying assets, pertaining to the period from commencement of 
activities relating to construction / development of the qualifying asset up to the date of capitalisation 
of such asset are added to the cost of the assets. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended and 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during extended periods when active development activity 
on the qualifying assets is interrupted.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period which they are incurred.

(p)	 Segment Reporting - Identification of Segments
An operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which 
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the 
company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions for which discrete financial information 
is available. Based on the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, the chief operating decision 
maker evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.
(q)	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
-	
the profit attributable to owners of the company
-	
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for 
bonus elements in equity shares issued during the year
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account:
-	
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity
-	
the weighted average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(r)	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-
term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral 
part of the Company’s cash management.
(s)	 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for disposal:
Assets are classified as held for disposal and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
To classify any Asset as “Asset held for disposal” the asset must be available for immediate sale and its 
sale must be highly probable. Such assets or group of assets are presented separately in the Balance 
Sheet, in the line “Assets held for disposal”. Once classified as held for disposal, intangible assets and 
PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.
(t)	 Current/non current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:
-	
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
-	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
-	
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or
-	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period
Notes to Financial Statements for the year ended  
31st March, 2025
2024    2025
196
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
-	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
-	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
-	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or
-	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period
The company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation 
in cash and cash equivalents. The company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
(u)	 Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no 
longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed 
at the end of the reporting period.
(v)	 Rounding of amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest Lakh 
as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.

Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will 
seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the company’s 
accounting policies.
This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning 
out to be different than those originally assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and 
judgements is included in relevant notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each 
affected line item in the financial statements.
Critical estimates and judgements
The areas involving critical estimates or judgements are:
-	
Estimation of current tax expense and payable – Note 12
-	
Estimated fair value of unlisted securities and Debt Instruments – Note 37
-	
Estimated goodwill impairment – Note 5
-	
Estimated useful life of intangible asset – Note 5
-	
Estimation of defined benefit obligation – Note 32
-	
Estimation of provision for warranty claims – Note 19
-	
Estimation of fair values of contingent liabilities and contingent purchase consideration in a business 
combination – Note 37
-	
Recognition of revenue – Note 21
-	
Recognition of deferred tax assets for carried forward tax losses – Note 12
-	
Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets – Note 38
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the company and 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The management assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalent, trade receivables, trade payables, 
and other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short 
term maturities of these instruments.
The fair values of non current borrowings are based on discounted cash flows using  a current borrowing rate. 
They are classified as level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, 
including own credit risk.
ii.	 Fair Value Hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial 
instruments that are recognised and measure at fair value. To provide an indication about the reliability of 
the inputs used in determining fair value, the company has classified its financial instruments into three 
levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table:

There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the period
Level 1 - Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed 
equity instruments, mutual funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity instruments which are 
traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at the reporting period. The mutual funds are 
valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2 - The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is 
included in level 2.
Level 3 - If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3.  
iii.	 Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Specific Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
- the use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments
- the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis
The fair value of unquoted equity instruments and unquoted bonds is not significantly different from their 
carrying value and hence the management has considered their carrying amount as fair value.
iv.	 Valuation processes
The finance department of the company includes a team that performs the valuations of financial assets and 
liabilities required for financial reporting purposes, including level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to 
the chief financial officer (CFO) and the audit committee (AC). Discussions of valuation processes and results 
are held between the CFO, AC and the valuation team at least once every three months, in line with the 
company's quarterly reporting periods.

38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company's activity exposes it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Company's overall risk management 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
financial performance of the company. This note explains the sources of risk which the entity is exposed to and 
how the company manages the risk.
(A)	Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations leading to a financial loss. Credit risk 
arises from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets carried at amortised cost and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables.
i.	
Credit risk management
Credit risk has always been managed by the company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits 
and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the company grants credit 
terms in the normal course of business.
The company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To 
assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the Company compares the risk of a default 
occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. 
It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information.
In general, it is presumed that credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition if the 
payments are more than 30 days past due.
A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty  fails to make contractual payments of when 
they fall due. This definition of default is determined by considering the business environment in which 
entity operates and other macro-economic factors.
(B)	Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become 
due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. The Company consistently generated sufficient cash flows from 
operations to meet its financial obligations. Also, the Company has unutilized credit limits with banks.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the company's liquidity position (comprising the undrawn 
borrowing facilities) and cash and cash equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows. In addition, the 
company’s liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid 
assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external 
regulatory requirements.

Maturities of financial liabilities
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the 
earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay. In the table below, borrowings include both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest rates are floating rate, the undiscounted amount 
is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period.

(C)	 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of change in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk 
and other price risk such as commodity risk.
(i)	 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in 
foreign currency, which fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to 
the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the external commercial borrowings 
and export receivables.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows 
established risk management policies and standard operating procedures to mitigate the risks.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
The Company’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which 
expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. Company policy is to maintain most of its borrowings 
at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary. During March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024, the company’s borrowings at variable rate were mainly denominated in USD.
The company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to 
interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows 
will fluctuate because of a change in market.
(a)	 Interest rate risk exposure
The exposure of the company’s borrowing to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period 
are as follows:

(iii)	Commodity Price risk
The Company's operating activities involve purchase and sale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 
(API), whose prices are exposed to the risk of fluctuation over short periods of time. Commodity price 
risk exposure is evaluated  and  managed through procurement and other related operating policies. 
As of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the Company had not entered into any material derivative 
contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

39. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
For the purpose of the company's capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium 
and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the 
Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.

and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company 
may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The 
company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The 
Company includes within debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, less cash and 
cash equivalents.
