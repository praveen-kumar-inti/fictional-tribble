Governance, leadership and oversight 
7. 
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
Since its inception, Balu Forge Industries Limited has been committed to environmental sustainability, prioritizing ESG 
principles well before they gained widespread recognition. 
One of the key challenges we face 
is the complexity of transitioning our existing infrastructure to more sustainable 
alternatives. This process requires significant investment 
in new technologies and the continuous adaptation 
of our 
operations. However, we are resolute in our commitment 
to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040 and transitioning 
to 100% renewable energy by 2035. These targets are ambitious, yet essential, as we align our practices with global 
climate change mitigation efforts. 
Water management is another critical area where we have set rigorous targets. By 2027, we aim to achieve 100% water 
recycling across our operations and reach Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) by 2030. These goals underscore our dedication 
to minimizing our environmental impact and preserving vital natural resources. 
Annual Report 2023-24
CORPORATE OVERVIEW 
STATUTORY REPORTS 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In addition 
to environmental targets, we are focused on social sustainability, particularly 
in fostering diversity and 
inclusion within our organization. We have set a target to increase women’s representation in leadership roles by 20% by 
2030. This is part of our broader effort to create an equitable and inclusive workplace, which we believe is fundamental 
to our long-term success. 
While we have made significant progress, 
we remain acutely aware of the challenges ahead. Managing 
the costs associated 
with technological innovations and ensuring that our suppliers adhere to the same high standards of sustainability are 
ongoing priorities. Our CSR Committee diligently monitors our progress 
in these areas, providing regular updates to 
stakeholders and ensuring that we remain on track to meet our goals. 
We are proud of what we have accomplished thus far, but we recognize that our journey 
is far from over. We will continue 
to push the boundaries of what is possible in ESG, driven by our commitment to creating 
a sustainable and prosperous 
future for all our stakeholders.
