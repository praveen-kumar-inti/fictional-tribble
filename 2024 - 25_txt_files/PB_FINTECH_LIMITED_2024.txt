Our team being our biggest 
strength the importance of 
Talent Management is very 
crucial for the success of the 
organization objectives.
We continue to invest and reinvest 
in organizational talent in the form 
of paid courses, in‐house training, 
soft‐skill sessions, at the time of 
joining and during the job tenure. 
Our HR policies are procedures are 
aligned to attract and retain the 
best talents.
The post‐Covid era has been 
about raising the bar when it 
comes to employee engagement. 
For example, at Policybazaar, the 
Jeeto Apna Ghar contest, which 
gives high performing employees 
a chance to win their own home, 
has been a key motivator for 
employees and has helped slash 
the attrition rate.

upon informal channels for 
their insurance and financial 
needs.
As part of our Community work 
we launched “Financial Literacy” 
program to 100 Final Year 
undergraduate students at each 
of the locations Gurgaon, Chennai, 
Kolkata and Mumbai. The total 
duration of the program was 20 
Hrs. in offline mode and with a

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
The company is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse work environment by adhering to its Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO) policy and its Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy. The EEO policy aligns with several key 
legislations, including The Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2017, The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) 
Act, 2019, and The HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act, 2017, along with related laws and regulations that focus on 
preventing discrimination. This policy’s primary aim is to 
ensure equal opportunities for all employees, promoting 
a discrimination-free environment throughout the 
employee lifecycle, from recruitment to retirement.
	
The company’s commitment to equality extends to 
preventing discrimination on the basis of HIV/AIDS, 
age, colour, disability, marital status, nationality, race, 
religion, gender, or sexual orientation. All employment-
related decisions, including recruitment, career 
development, training, and benefits, are made solely 
on the basis of qualifications and merit. The company 
ensures that employees are treated fairly and without 
bias, creating an environment that encourages diversity 
and equal opportunities for growth.
	
In line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 
2013, the company has implemented a POSH policy to 
prevent, prohibit, and address sexual harassment against 
female employees. The policy outlines a clear procedure 
for addressing complaints of sexual harassment at the 
workplace, ensuring a safe and supportive environment 
for all women personnel.
	
Additionally, the company offers an Employee Assistance 
Program (EAP) to support the mental and emotional 
well-being of its employees. Through a partnership with 
an external agency, 1 to1 Help, employees have access 
to professional, confidential counselling services. This 
service is available through regular sessions and is 
complemented by a variety of self-help resources, such 
as an online library and e-workshops on topics like 
mental wellness and stress management. All of these 
services are provided at no cost to employees.
	
To ensure that grievances related to Equal Employment 
Opportunity and Sexual Harassment are addressed 
fairly, the company has appointed various officers and 
committees. This includes:
•	
A Liaison Officer to oversee the recruitment of 
persons with disabilities in accordance with The 
Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
•	
An officer for grievance redressal and complaint 
resolution concerning transgender individuals and 
people affected by HIV and AIDS.
•	
An Internal Committee to handle complaints related 
to sexual harassment of women at the workplace.
	
Furthermore, the company has introduced several 
policies to support the cultural and psychological safety 
of its employees:
•	
A Work from Home Policy to provide flexibility and 
ensure employees’ work-life balance.
•	
A Loan Policy to support employees with financial 
assistance when needed.
•	
Employee Welfare Guidelines to ensure the well-
being of employees across all levels.

Workplace Privacy for Employees to safeguard their 
personal information and maintain a respectful work 
environment.

A Reward & Recognition Policy to appreciate 
and motivate employees for their hard work and 
achievements.

a supportive, inclusive, and safe working environment, 
in line with industry best practices, as reflected in the 
company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. These 
efforts ensure that employees are given the resources 
and protection they need to thrive both professionally 
and personally.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
To uphold its commitment to the company’s ESG vision and actively work toward reducing its carbon footprint, the 
organization has implemented a series of impactful and ongoing measures aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and 
sustainability. These initiatives, undertaken continuously and reinforced during the current year, include the following:
a. 	 Optimization of electricity usage and electrical equipment operations:
	
The company has undertaken a systematic approach to minimize energy consumption by rationalizing the use of 
critical electrical appliances. This includes improving the operational efficiency of air-conditioning systems, reducing 
energy use for office lighting, and managing equipment such as beverage dispensers and desktops to ensure they 
operate only when necessary, thereby avoiding unnecessary energy wastage.
b.	
Installation of LED lighting across all office floors:
	
As part of its energy efficiency strategy, the company has replaced traditional lighting systems with LED lights on 
all floors. These LED lights offer superior energy efficiency and significantly reduce heat emissions. Moreover, their 
design eliminates ultraviolet (UV) emissions, making them a more sustainable and environmentally friendly choice.
c.	
Temperature monitoring and air-conditioning system management:
	
To further optimize energy use, the company regularly monitors indoor temperatures and implements strict controls 
over air-conditioning systems. By maintaining ideal temperature settings and avoiding overcooling or overheating, the 
organization ensures that energy consumption is kept to a minimum while maintaining a comfortable environment for 
employees.
d.	
Usage of energy-efficient illumination fixtures:
	
The company has adopted advanced illumination systems that require less energy while delivering superior lighting 
quality. These fixtures not only reduce overall electricity consumption but also contribute to lower operational costs 
over time.
e.	
Deployment of VRV/VRF air-conditioning systems:
	
Recognizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies, the company has installed Variable Refrigerant 
Volume (VRV) and Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) air-conditioning systems across its premises. These systems are 
second-generation energy-efficient solutions, offering improved performance with reduced energy usage compared to 
conventional air-conditioning units.
f.	
Procurement of 5-star rated electrical appliances:
	
The company ensures that all electrical appliances procured for office use, including air conditioners, refrigerators, 
and other devices, are certified with a 5-star energy efficiency rating. These high-efficiency appliances consume 
significantly less electricity, reducing the overall energy demand and contributing to the company’s sustainability 
goals.

to minimize waste. All waste generated is responsibly 
sent to authorized collectors for recycling. In addition, 
we prioritize the reuse of all physical assets, including 
information systems hardware, to extend their lifecycle. 
When these assets reach the end of their useful life, 
electronic waste (E-waste) is carefully handed over to 
certified recyclers or collectors. Similarly, batteries and 
used oil generated through our operations are disposed 
of through approved vendors, ensuring environmentally 
safe handling and disposal.

PRINCIPLE 9 ‐ Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible 
manner
We are fully committed to prioritizing the needs of our 
consumers by transforming and simplifying previously 
complex offline processes through digitalization. Our efforts 
aim to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for 
consumers, making tasks such as policy renewals easier and 
providing real-time updates on services and claims requests. 
This enables consumers to track their progress and stay 
informed with minimal effort, greatly enhancing their overall 
experience.
To achieve this, we have incorporated cutting-edge 
technologies like chatbots and video calls into our operations. 
These tools not only allow us to engage with consumers 
more efficiently but also serve important roles in verification 
and fraud prevention. For instance, our WhatsApp chatbots 
are employed to send policy updates, help consumers stay 
informed, and schedule appointments with our advisors 
in a convenient manner. This automation streamlines 
communication, making it easier for consumers to access 
essential information.
In addition to these efforts, we have focused on streamlining 
processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, 
fraud detection, and motor claims by allowing quick video 
uploads and document submissions. This speeds up the entire 
process, reducing the time and effort typically involved in 
these tasks. As part of our ongoing innovations, we are also 
working toward introducing voice-assisted renewals, which 
will offer another convenient method for consumers to renew 
their policies without any hassle.
Our overarching strategy revolves around leveraging 
technology to automate and simplify tasks, offering self-
service options to our consumers, while still providing 
personal assistance when needed. This is supported by 
sales and service help via telecalls and online chats through 
our website and mobile app, ensuring that consumers have 
access to support at their convenience. Furthermore, we’ve 
expanded our support network by providing accessible offline 
stores where consumers can visit in person to schedule 
appointments and receive expert guidance from our advisors, 
ensuring that both digital and in-person support are available 
to meet their needs.

Scope and Approach

engaged by the management of PB Fintech Limited (“PBFL” 
or “the Company”), as an Independent Reasonable Assurance 
Provider of the Company’s Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR)  Core Matrices (refer to

Reporting Criteria
Our reasonable assurance covers the sustainability 
Information listed in Annexure-I of this report. The reporting 
boundary is disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosure of the BRSR, with exceptions noted under 
respective questions.
The criteria utilized by the Company to prepare the identified 
sustainability information are as follows:

Board of India (SEBI) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015, as amended;

Management Responsibilities
The Company’s Management is responsible for identification 
of key aspects, content and presentation of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with 
the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility includes the 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core 
Matrices which are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the 
requirements of independence and quality assurance set 
out in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements 
and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations in 
accordance with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption 
that the data and information provided by the company to us 
as part of our review have been provided in good faith and 
free from material misstatements. We were not involved 
in the preparation of any statements or data included 
in the Report except for Assurance Statement. Our firm 
applies International Standard on Quality Management and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
We apply SQC 1 for quality control in assurance and related 
services. 
Reasonable Assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error, 
and responding to the assessed risks as required by the 
circumstances.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team 
of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the 
disclosures presented within the Report and referenced 
information, and sampled the disclosures and were reviewed 
through the company’s customised sustainability information 
management system.
The procedures conducted were based on professional 
judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluation of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures, and reconciliation with underlying records. 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in executing the 
procedures outlined above, we:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the identified sustainability 
information and related disclosures;
•	
Acquired knowledge of the assessment criteria 
and assessed their adequacy for evaluating and/or 
measuring the identified sustainability information;
•	
Conducted inquiries with Company’s management, 
including the environment team, compliance team, 
human resources team, and other relevant personnel 
responsible for preparing the Report;
•	
Developed an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of key systems, processes, and 
controls for recording, processing, and reporting the 
identified sustainability information at the corporate 
office and other locations.
•	
Based on our understanding and the potential risks of 
material misstatement in the identified sustainability 
information, we determined the nature, timing, and 
extent of further procedures.
Independent Assurance Statement
•	
We tested the Company’s process for compiling 
sustainability information by comparing or reconciling it 
with the underlying records.
•	
We verified the consolidation of data from various 
plants and offices on a sample basis within the reporting 
boundary to ensure the completeness of the reported 
data.
We believe that the evidence we have gathered is both 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the identified sustainability indicators, based on 
the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with 
the International Standard for Assurance Engagements other 
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
(‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement 
as agreed with the Company. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether, in all material respects, the 
Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, 
and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the 
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an 
assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
Reasonable Assurance Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the company’s identified 
sustainability criteria as per BRSR core framework for the 
financial year ended 31st March 2025 are not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations
We have relied on the information, documents, records, data, 
and explanations provided to us by the Company for the 
purpose of our review. The assurance scope excludes:
•	
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the scope 
section above
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period
•	
Data related to Company’s financial performance, 
strategy and other related linkages expressed in the 
Report.

The reported financial data are based on audited financial 
statements issued by the Company’s statutory auditors 
which is subject to a separate audit process. We were not 
involved in the review of financial data from the Annual 
Report.
•	
The Company’s statements that describe expression of 
opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking 
statements provided by the Company and assertions 
related to Intellectual Property Rights and other 
competitive issues.
•	
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other 
than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria above.
•	
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and extent 
of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
•	
The procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation 
or calculation of data within IT systems.
