The Company is committed to conducting its business in an

CPIL is committed towards the preservation of human rights across the 
value chain.

6.	
Performance of the entity against the specific 
commitments, goals, and targets along with 
reasons in case the same are not met.
1.	
In alignment with the commitment to conduct business responsibly, CPIL 
consistently works to embed environmental sustainability. Timber logs 
being the Company’s primary raw material, it makes constant endeavours 
to control the excessive consumption of resources and its associated 
negative impacts. The Company also resorts to sustainable procurement 
practices by obtaining almost ~98% of its raw material requirements 
through agro-forestry practices. CPIL’s facilities consistently drives effort 
for optimal use of resources including reuse and recycling of its generated 
waste. The Company is currently generating waste wood which is 
recycled in-house to manufacture particle boards and MDF. Further, the 
waste wood that cannot be recycled is incinerated for use as fuel in boilers, 
replacing the use of conventional non-renewable fuels like coal. Other 
efforts such as, implementation of energy efficient equipment such as 
replacement of multiple Thermic Fluid Heaters (TFH) with a single high-
capacity modern energy efficient TFH to save on fuel and reduce emission 
in multiple facilities, introduction of SAP inventory management to track 
chemical purchase and avoid over stocking have resulted in considerably 
energy and emission footprint. 
2.	
CPIL has incorporated the relevant guidelines on Human Rights within 
its BRSR policy and therein established the expectations of the Company 
from its stakeholders including the Business Channel Partners, Investors, 
and Contractors to uphold human rights values. Within its sphere of 
influence, the Company makes efforts to raise human rights awareness 
across their value chain. During the reporting period, no reports of human 
rights violations were received by CPIL.
3.	
CPIL continues to follow the best practices as a part of its commitment to 
good corporate governance. For this, the Company has developed a Code 
of Conduct which intends to foster integrity and accountability across the 
organization and encompasses the Company’s commitment to corporate 
social responsibility and sustainable development, occupational health, 
safety, inclusive workplace, transparency, and legal compliance.

providing local farmers around its manufacturing facilities with subsidized saplings of plant varieties like eucalyptus and other 
trees around their field. Furthermore, CPIL is committed to optimize the use of alternative raw materials, limit non-renewable 
energy consumption, streamline its supply chain and focus on sustainable methods of distribution and transportation. It is

customer service, constant innovation, and embracing industry megatrends.
At CPIL, accountability and transparency are prioritised, and the Company has implemented various measures to ensure its 
conduct aligns with industry best practices. CPIL is delighted to announce about publishing its first Business Responsibility 
Report in accordance with SEBI’s prescribed framework. Through this report, the stakeholders will have a better insight into 
the Company’s commitment to developing long-term value for stakeholders and incorporating ESG into every facet of CPIL’s 
overall business approach.
The organization’s environmental responsibilities encompass the responsible usage of natural resources like fossil fuels, 
appropriate wastewater treatment, responsible waste management and such other measures to tackle the effects of climate 
change.
On the social front, CPIL prioritizes investment in employees, vendors, customers, and communities. The Company’s intranet 
portal ‘Centurion’ continues to serve as an interactive platform, bringing employees together and closer to the management 
besides keeping them informed of the activities of the Company. Besides this, the ‘Centurion Helpdesk’, a WhatsApp group, 
also facilitates the time-bound resolution of employee grievances.
The wood products industry faces several challenges including rising costs of raw materials, energy and transportation as well 
as increasing competition in the market. However, CPIL is committed to addressing these challenges and remains focused on 
continuous improvement with respect to environmental and social impacts due to business activities. To leverage its sustainable 
practices, CPIL aims to ensure 100% procurement of timber through agroforestry, partnering with local farmers and providing 
training for sustainable practices. Furthermore, CPIL has successfully reduced its coal consumption in operations by nearly 6% 
(YoY) through its substitution with biomass fuel, against an average 15% increase in the company’s production volume. CPIL 
endeavours to continue building its renewable energy profile and reducing carbon footprint by implementing various energy 
efficient equipment and practices across all operations. Further, the Company believes in sustainable business practices for 
long-term success and plans to invest in research and development for innovative solutions to the challenges faced.
CPIL conveys its deepest appreciation to all its stakeholders for their unwavering support and confidence in the company’s 
efforts as it encourages the company to keep striving for business excellence. Being driven to accelerate its efforts to emerge 
as a sustainability leader, CPIL looks forward to your continued appreciation and support for the future.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, the Company places a strong emphasis on incorporating sustainability into its procurement process. An effective inter-
department communication mechanism embedded in the SAP system enables the purchase department to act according 
to production and sales forecasts for the forthcoming periods to ensure optimum raw material procurement.
The central procurement team of the Company has integrated sustainable sourcing into their operations. They have 
implemented a comprehensive evaluation system for new vendors, considering various environmental and social factors 
such as human rights, health and safety, and air emissions.
Moreover, the Company places a major focus on plantation of timber and agroforestry materials, for sustainable sourcing 
of raw materials. In FY 2022-23, the Company distributed 20,49,600 samplings to 2,808 farmers around its manufacturing 
locations to plant eucalyptus and other trees around their fields. With this, the Company tries to encourage extensive 
plantations of fast-growing, short-rotation plant species close to its manufacturing facilities, particularly in Punjab and 
Tamil Nadu. Approximately 98 % of the raw materials procured by the company is through such agroforestry practices. 
Additionally, CPIL purchases face veneer instead of timber logs to ensure the sustainability of the raw material. The 
Company, through its Subsidiary, has set up a veneer processing unit in Gabon to take advantage of the availability of 
‘Okoume’ timber for meeting its face veneer requirements. Similarly, the company had backward integration strategies 
in place in Myanmar and Laos to guarantee the availability of raw materials, before the same got dis-continued. Along 
with increasing the amount of green cover and providing the farmers with a source of income, the agro-forestry practices 
adopted by the company can become a significant source of its sustainable raw material supply in the future.
Furthermore, in order to serve the dealers with reduced time and transportation costs, the Company has purposefully 
developed its distribution network. This has resulted in the better warehouse and inventory management. To reduce 
freight costs, the Company uses an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to manage its distribution strategy. These 
measures help CPIL to save money and time on transportation while also conserving the environment through reduced 
fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions. To lessen its dependency on fossil fuels, the Company deploys higher-
tonnage capacity trucks/ containers for transportation.
As a step towards developing a sustainable supply chain, Company largely procures its machinery, spare parts, 
consumables, and packing materials from medium and small-scale manufacturers/suppliers preferably located nearby its 
manufacturing facilities. CPIL also procures raw materials from various self-help organizations and conducts awareness 
sessions for its suppliers on social and environmental issues. Managerial and technical support is provided to suppliers to 
educate them on the practises and processes that could enable improving their productivity, output quality, delivery time, 
costs etc. In addition, a large portion of the Company’s production-line workforce comes from communities surrounding 
its factories.
	
b.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
~98% of input is sourced through agroforestry across all divisions, which indicates that the Company is actively prioritizing 
sustainable sourcing practices. At CPIL, sustainable sourcing practices include using certified products, reducing net 
deforestation, protecting the rights of indigenous people and local communities and promoting responsible land use.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for: (a) Plastics (including packaging), (b) E-waste, (c) Hazardous waste, and (d) other waste.
The Company’s products are typically not packed or laminated with plastic materials and majorly use paper packaging, 
minimizing the need for plastic reclamation, including packaging. Furthermore, the Company primarily serves B2B partners, 
such as dealers, sub-dealers, architects, and interior designers, who process their products to create finished goods for end 
consumers. Consequently, the Company does not directly engage in sensitization activities for the safe reclamation of products 
with end consumers. This is handled by the Company’s empanelled dealers and architects.
Plastics including packaging
Plastic waste generated at the facilities is duly disposed of through authorized vendors. 
Packaging plastic waste generated is minimal as only a small volume of the products is 
packed using polythene and are disposed of in a responsible manner.
E-waste
The E-waste generated through use of electronics for office and facility operations is 
disposed of through authorized recyclers.
Hazardous waste
The Company has assigned pockets within the facilities to aggregate and segregate 
hazardous waste generated and it is disposed of through the authorized recyclers registered 
with relevant regulatory authorities.
Other Non- Hazardous waste Most of the generated wood-based wastes as used as raw material for particleboard 
production. Any volume remaining, which cannot be used as raw material is consumed as 
fuel in the boilers for the generation of heat.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
CPIL generates very low volumes of plastic waste, as only a specific segment of the products manufactured (pre-laminates) 
use polythene as a part of packaging. Centuryply ensures minimal plastic consumption by mainly using paper packaging for 
majority of its product range. Further, the company uses pellets packing for its exported products. Any E-waste generated 
through the use of electronics used in the company’s offices or facilities is disposed of through authorized recyclers. The 
Company is yet to initiate compliance to the EPR Regulations.

Action Taken
No, CPIL has not conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its product or services. However, wood 
being biodegradable in nature and CPIL’s products having a long shelf life, there are no significant social or environmental 
concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of the products/services. 
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing 
industry) or providing services (for service industry).
The Company continuously drives effective waste management practices to recycle its products and reduce waste generation 
during production. The Company’s goal is to cut down on waste and lower consumption of virgin raw materials in production. 
Incidental waste of one sort or another result from the conversion of logs into veneer and then to plywood. The Company works 
to reduce the development of process waste using process technology and operational control techniques. Waste wood veneers 
are being joined together using cutting-edge technology to make them useful as raw materials, reducing waste. The Company 
also uses most of its wood-based wastes as raw material in manufacturing process of its product range.
The majority of the process waste is either used as secondary input in the production process or sold to authorised vendors for 
recycling.
 ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23 | 155 
Indicate input material
Recycled or re-used input material to total material 
The firewood waste generated during the production process, is either recycled into new products like particleboards and 
MDF or incinerated in the boilers for use as fuel for heat generation. The quantity of waste wood generated is provided 
under Principle 6. Other waste types (E.g., Plastic waste, E-waste etc.) generated are sold to authorized recyclers for end-
disposal (reuse/recycle). However, the Company is yet to initiate tracking of the quantity of waste recycled or reused by the 
recyclers out of the total waste transferred to them for disposal.

CPIL does not conduct assessment by entity or statutory authorities or third party. However, 
the Company has dedicated safety officers across all its facilities, who internally assess 
the on-ground implementation of health and safety practices at the facilities in alignment 
with the organizational policy and safety manual. The safety officers regularly monitor 
the availability and maintenance of safety devices and equipment like fire extinguishers 
at the facilities and ensure safe working conditions for employees.
Further, they are also responsible for addressing any events related to health and safety 
breach that may occur in the facilities. In such a case, the safety officer along with his 
team examines the issue and takes the necessary measures for its resolution, for e.g., 
providing first-aid to an employee or taking them to the in- house medical Centre as the 
need may be in case of an injury.
Working Conditions
15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on

regarding their working conditions and safety. Once a complaint is registered, CPIL’s plant authorities take prompt action 
and strive to resolve the issue within 48 hours. This ensures that employees feel heard, and their grievances are effectively 
addressed. In the event of an incident or accident, the Company follows a strict protocol. Within 24 hours, a preliminary report 
is prepared to provide an initial assessment of the situation. Subsequently, a detailed report is prepared, outlining details of the 
incident and including a comprehensive corrective action plan. The Company closely monitors the implementation of these 
corrective actions to ensure effective resolution and prevention of similar incidents in the future.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
CPIL is committed to climate action and to creating a positive impact on the environment and community around which it 
operates. To achieve its commitment, the Company has adopted multiple sustainable measures including increasing renewable 
energy consumption in operations, adopting energy-efficient technologies, minimisation and re-use of production waste etc. 
Such measures have in turn contributed to reducing the GHG emissions from the operations.
The Company makes conscious efforts to upgrade its facilities to positively contribute towards energy efficiency, reduce non-
renewable energy consumption and optimize energy costs. Some of the initiatives undertaken by CPIL in this regard include:
Technological Interventions:
•	
Introduction of High-Capacity Veneer Dryer and Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) to replace manual glue spreaders, reducing 
heat loss from the process and improving energy efficiency.
•	
Installation of rail lines and assembly conveyor lines to reduce fuel consumption associated with forklift operations.
•	
Installation of closed loop pipelines to minimize wastage of chemicals during transportation.
•	
Implementation of chippers at the energy plant to increase fuel efficiency.
 ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23 | 167 
•	
Replacement of multiple Thermic Fluid Heaters (TFH) with a single high-capacity modern energy efficient TFH to save on 
fuel and reduce emission in multiple facilities. Example: Joka and Karnal, have replaced three of their conventional TFH 
of 15 Lac kcal capacity with a single highly efficient TFH of 60 Lac kcal capacity.
•	
Installation of DG synchronization panels to automate DG set operations and decrease diesel consumption.
•	
Optimization of power consumption using capacitors, achieving higher power factors and reducing energy waste. Example: 
Joka facility has achieved a power factor of 99% with the support of capacitors in its circuit system.
•	
Replacement of screw compressed starters with VFD compressors for improved energy efficiency.
•	
Installation of energy-saving fans on dryers to consume less energy compared to conventional fans.
•	
Installation of AC drives on boilers to regulate motor speed according to the boiler’s load, resulting in reduced energy 
consumption.
Alternate energy integration:
•	
Installation of solar panels and concentrated solar thermal (CST) technologies for heating water and thermic fluids, 
integrating them with existing boilers and heating systems.
•	
Adoption of electric forklifts, replacing diesel forklifts, to enable less emission intensive logistics systems.
•	
Introduction of 4 Electric Vehicles (EVs) for logistic purposes.
•	
Reduction in consumption of coal by almost 6% (YoY) despite an increase of average 15% in production due to replacement 
of coal with biomass fuel.
Process Optimization:
•	
Redesign of buildings to maximize the utilization of natural light and minimize electricity usage during the daytime.
•	
Use of heat exchangers to improve the output of refiner and press machines, optimizing energy usage and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.
•	
Implementation of laser-guided lights at panel assembly tables for accurate dimensions, reducing wear and tear of edge 
trimming machines.
•	
Adoption of auto sensing pneumatic pressure control on glue spreaders to prevent fluctuations, reduce material loss, and 
increase machine service life.
Facility upgradation:
•	
CPIL’s Head Office (HO) is a Platinum LEED certified building, being cognizant of the need to regulate the energy footprint 
of its buildings, the Company make conscious efforts to prioritize leasing buildings that are LEED certified.
CPIL believes that energy efficiency alone cannot support the Company’s objective of lowering the GHG emissions. 
Hence the Company also adopts other initiatives such as reducing its dependency on fossil fuel by using cleaner fuel 
and implementing captive solar power plants. CPIL has also installed rooftop solar photo-voltaic panels across all its 
facilities in India for power generation and reduction of dependency on grid electricity and other non-renewable energy 
sources. Currently, 13% of the Company’s total electricity is generated from renewable sources. To contribute towards 
the renewable mix in the country’s grid, CPIL sells the excess renewable energy to the grid that would otherwise be lost.
Furthermore, CPIL is driving efforts to recycle its process waste into new products or re-use it as raw material in production 
activities. For example, the Company is currently generating waste wood which is recycled in-house to manufacture 
particle boards and MDF. Further, the waste wood that cannot be recycled is incinerated for use as fuel in boilers, replacing 
the use of conventional non-renewable fuels like coal. Reducing consumption of virgin raw materials like fossil fuels with 
secondary raw materials is positively impacting the GHG emission levels of the company. Currently in the reporting period, 
the Joka facility has replaced 40% of its fossil fuel usage through use of fire-wood waste.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
CPIL has established a robust waste management system to reduce, reuse and recycle its generated waste. The Company 
disposes its hazardous waste through government authorized vendor. CPIL produces very low quantity of non-hazardous waste 
material which is handled by authorized and local waste collectors. Furthermore, the Company is always at the look out 
of innovative methods to optimize the reuse of its generated waste. For example, waste wood veneers generated in CPIL’s 
decorative division, which cannot be used due to dimensional incompatibility are joined together by using modern technology 
for reuse as raw materials. CPIL also ensures complete usage of chemicals and hence have zero landfill policy for chemicals 
used such as Urea-Formaldehyde.
As a market leader in the timber-based industry, the Company’s biggest challenge is working with chemicals like Formaldehydes 
and phenols. CPIL is continually driving efforts to reduce the consumption of these hazardous chemicals to create a minimal 
negative impact on the environment and community at large. As a part of which, the Company reduces/controls formaldehyde 
emission from plywood and High-Pressure Laminate (HPL) by improved glue formulation. CPIL has also developed CARB Resin 
without affecting the existing mechanical properties of CARB Product and in compliance with the formaldehyde emission test 
standard JIS A 1460.
Further, the Company trains its personnel on chemical safe handling and spills. As research and technological advancements 
accelerate, it is continuously exploring alternatives to these chemicals for use in production.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?
CPIL is a timber-based Company. ~98% of the Company’s wood-based raw materials are sourced from sustainable agro-forests 
and plantations that are studied to not cause adverse impact on the environment. The Company has begun sourcing its timber-
based raw material veneer from Gabon, the veneers are made from FSC certified forests housing “Okoume” trees. These trees 
grow as part of the plantation forests in Gabon are short-rotation timber species, which enables it to harvest timber in a safe 
and sustainable manner without depleting resources. These forests are carefully maintained with conscious care towards soil 
health, weed control and pest control. Thus, ensuring environmental sustainability in addition to good quality raw material 
that contributes to the continued economic sustainability of CPIL.
However, for wood sourced from local India farmers, understanding the repercussions of modern agriculture on soil health 
and water table, the Company takes pro-active steps to train its vendors and their farmers on sustainable plantation practices 
and requirements. CPIL also has initiated electrification of its logistics and transport assets, not only by introducing electric 
vehicles for transportation but also in its warehouses in the form of electric forklifts. To conclude, CPIL has not observed any 
significant adverse impact caused to the environment due to activities across the Company’s value chain. Going forward, 
Company also aims to extend these expectations for sustainable operations to its franchisees.

(a)	 Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers 
comprising marginalised/vulnerable groups? (Yes/No)
While the Company encourages practices to procure its raw material requirements from suppliers comprising marginalised/
vulnerable groups like those from poor economic backgrounds, it is yet to develop a preferential procurement policy for 
the same.
	
(b)	 From which marginalised / vulnerable groups do you procure?
CPIL encourages farmers around its manufacturing locations to plant eucalyptus and other trees around their field. The 
Company is also promoting large-scale plantations of fast growing and short-rotation plant species in the vicinity of the 
Company’s manufacturing facilities, particularly in Punjab and Tamil Nadu. Through such agro-forestry measures, the 
Company is procuring nearly ~98% of its timber requirements. This is also great source of income for the farmers who 
come from poor economic backgrounds.
	
(c)	 What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?
CPIL presently has a well-established system to track their sustainable procurement and are currently meeting ~98% 
of its timber requirements through agro-forestry, However CPIL is yet to track the percentage of total procurement from 
marginalized and vulnerable groups.

PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a 
responsible manner
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
Consumer satisfaction is an important indicator of business growth and sustainability and CPIL is committed to continuously 
meet customer expectations. The Company connects with its customers through multiple mediums. As the business is primarily 
B2B in nature, the Company regularly interacts with its empanelled dealers and architects to learn about any concerns they 
may have related to the product quality or business arrangements. Feedback of the end-consumers on the product quality is 
also obtained from the Company’s B2B partners. CPIL’s CFS division also carries out shipping lines’ surveys. The Company has 
implemented a formal grievance redressal mechanism to record all consumer grievances and provide appropriate resolutions. 
The Company receives consumer complaints and feedbacks from numerous empanelled dealers and architects on all relevant 
issues related to product quality. All complaints are resolved by the marketing and sales team, however any complaint that 
requires escalation is raised to the zonal in-charge appointed for each product line (Laminates, Plywood, Particle board, MDF, 
decorative veneer, New Age Products).
2.	
Turnover of products and/services as a percentage of turnover from all products/service that carry information

The Company majorly operates as a B2B business, wherein its products are sold through 
dealers to architects and civil contractors as well as to other industries to be converted 
into finished products. The Company makes all essential information available to the buyer 
upon purchase.
Considering that NAP (New Age Products) is a special variety of products, 100% of all 
products carry information on the product itself.

breaches. The framework is crucial in safeguarding the business processes against potential security breaches and preventing

2.	
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services.
CPIL makes all essential information about safe and responsible usage of its products available to the buyer upon purchase. 
Considering that NAP (New Age Products) is a special variety of products, 100% of all products carry information on the 
product itself. CPIL adheres to all norms of product labelling and display of information as required under relevant regulations. 
The Company also provides the requisite information and safety guidance which are specific to products. It must be noted 
that most of the Company’s products are used as intermediate products which is then further processed to make the finished 
products for use of end-consumers. Hence, the Company does not directly engage in any sensitization activities on safe and 
responsible usage of products with end-consumers. This is taken care of by the Company’s empanelled dealers and architects.
 ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23 | 177 
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
The Company is in continual dialogue with its customers through social media and news publications and all notable changes 
deemed necessary for communication are reported through press conferences and social media pages.
4.	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey about consumer 
satisfaction relating to services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a 
whole? (Yes/No)
The Company communicates product-related information to its B2B partners upon purchase, as the Company produces mostly 
intermediate products which are then processed into finished products and the company does not directly interact with end-
consumers. Hence the above question regarding the display of product information is not relevant for the company.
As a part of understanding the changing needs of the customers and collecting feedback on the existing products and services, 
the Company ensures constant communication with the dealers, retailers as well as architects and builders through its 
well-established marketing and sales teams for all product lines of the Company. In addition, CPIL also conducts an annual 
consumer satisfaction survey for its product lines along with its CFS division carrying out surveys with the shipping lines, to 
whom they cater. The CFS division also has a portal for feedback registration on its website.
