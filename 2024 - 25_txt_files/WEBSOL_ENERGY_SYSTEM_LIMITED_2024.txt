27.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications, as per the following format; Material topics are those that have a significant impact on our 
ability to create value for our stakeholders and are influenced by the economic, social, and environmental context in which we 
operate. We have the following material topics:
Material issue

Indicate whether 
risk or
opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Energy Management Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Continued 
reliance 
on 
conventional grid power may 
impact 
emission 
intensity 
and 
long-term 
sustainability 
positioning.
Opportunity: 
Strengthening 
energy efficiency and renewable 
adoption 
reduces 
operational 
costs and supports climate goals.
We are improving energy 
performance through LED 
lighting and energy-efficient 
motors, 
while 
actively 
planning the adoption of 
rooftop solar to diversify our 
energy mix and reduce grid 
dependency.
Positive and Negative
Waste Management
Risk
Effective waste management is 
essential for ensuring regulatory 
compliance 
and 
maintaining 
stakeholder trust, particularly in 
handling hazardous materials like 
ETP sludge and oil-laden waste.
We are mitigating these 
risks 
by 
implementing 
robust waste management 
systems, 
incorporating 
best 
practices 
like 
Form 
10 
tracking, 
and 
partnering 
with 
certified 
disposal 
contractors 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
and 
environmental stewardship.

(Indicate positive or

Employee Welfare
Opportunity
Employee welfare is crucial for 
ensuring a safe, inclusive, and 
productive 
work 
environment. 
It directly influences employee 
satisfaction, 
retention, 
and 
performance, making it essential 
to 
long-term 
organizational 
success.
Positive
Water Management
Opportunity
Water 
management 
is 
vital 
for 
Websol, 
supporting 
both 
environmental sustainability and 
operational efficiency. Reducing 
dependence on freshwater not 
only 
supports 
environmental 
goals but also ensures long-term 
operational resilience.
Positive
Occupational Health 
and Safety
Opportunity
Ensuring a safe and healthy 
workplace is vital for Websol to 
protect employees and maintain 
business 
continuity. 
Gaps 
in 
safety practices can lead to legal 
liabilities, workforce disruptions, 
low morale, and in severe cases, 
impact overall operations.
Positive
Diversity & Inclusion
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Evolving 
workplace 
expectations underscore the need 
for improved gender diversity 
and inclusivity. Limited workforce 
diversity may constrain innovation, 
collaboration, and alignment with 
evolving stakeholder expectations.
Opportunity: 
Infrastructure 
enhancements like ramp access 
promote inclusivity and reinforce 
the Company’s commitment to an 
accessible and respectful work 
environment.
We are working to improve 
diverse 
representation 
across roles and functions, 
while reinforcing inclusion 
through training, inclusive 
hiring 
practices, 
and 
employee 
engagement 
initiatives.
Positive and Negative
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Corporate governance is crucial 
for ensuring transparency, ethical 
practices, 
and 
accountability. 
Strong governance builds trust 
with 
stakeholders, 
improves 
operational efficiency, and fosters 
a culture of responsibility.

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or

GHG Emission
Risk
Effective 
management 
of 
GHG emissions is critical for 
minimizing environmental impact 
and complying with regulations. 
Monitoring emissions in real-time 
ensures timely actions and better 
control over emission levels.
While quarterly third-party 
assessments and annual 
pollutant 
measurements 
are in place, the absence of 
real-time stack monitoring 
for PM, SOx, and NOx 
emissions 
may 
limit 
immediate 
detection 
of 
emission fluctuations.
Negative
Product Quality and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Evolving expectations on 
sustainability 
and 
long-term 
product 
performance 
call 
for 
deeper 
lifecycle 
insights 
and 
supplier 
alignment 
to 
ensure 
consistent quality.
Opportunity: Strong quality control 
systems and adherence to global 
safety norms enhance brand trust 
and market access.
We ensure product reliability 
through quality control at 
every stage and comply 
with 
global 
safety 
and 
sustainability 
standards. 
We 
are 
addressing 
gaps 
by 
implementing 
lifecycle 
assessments 
(LCA), enhancing vendor 
sustainability 
training 
to 
ensure consistent product 
quality and BIS Certification. 
Positive and Negative
Cyber Security
Risk
Cybersecurity 
is 
critical 
for 
safeguarding sensitive data and 
maintaining business continuity. 
Without 
robust 
policies 
and 
awareness 
programs, 
the 
company may be exposed to 
increased risks of cyberattacks 
and data breaches.
We are actively working to 
enhance our cybersecurity 
posture 
by 
developing 
robust 
policies 
and 
procedures, 
alongside 
implementing 
training 
programs for employees 
and vendors to strengthen 
data security and reduce 
vulnerabilities.

Employees report via written communication or email to the 
Audit Committee Chair, Compliance Officer, or MD/CEO—
anonymously if needed. On receipt, the Compliance Officer 
acknowledges the concern and initiates an inquiry, typically 
completing it within 90 days, with quarterly updates to the 
Audit Committee. If the Compliance Officer is implicated, 
escalation is made to the MD/CEO. The Audit Committee 
oversees proceedings, guiding actions and ensuring 
confidentiality. Records of complaints and investigations 
are maintained securely until closure. Once closed—after 
disciplinary or legal action—the resolution is reported in the 
next Committee meeting. Employees acting in good faith are 
protected from retaliation; any retaliation must be reported 
within 3 months. Misuse of the policy triggers strict action.

statutory compliances. This independent stance underscores the Company’s capacity to navigate the business landscape while
