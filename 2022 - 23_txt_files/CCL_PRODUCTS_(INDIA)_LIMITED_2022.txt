Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation. 
Yes, the Company's efforts were focused on developing energy-efficient processes for instant coffee production, 
which involved selecting advanced profile roasters and incorporating waste heat recovery systems to optimize 
roasting and drying processes. 
ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge) Technologies were chosen to minimize waste generation during instant coffee 
production and explore innovative methods for reusing or recycling wastewater and by-products. Technologies 
such as membrane filtration or reverse osmosis were employed to reduce water usage. 
A state-of-the-art pilot plant has been commissioned to reduce the batch size, thereby decreasing the 
environmental impact. The Company has 490 KLD ZLD in operation.
