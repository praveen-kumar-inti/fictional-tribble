Performance of the entity against the specific

is continuously monitored by designated ESG committee 
and measures for reducing the overall GHG emissions are 
continuously implemented. In addition, we have also revised the 
approach and methodology for estimating emissions.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON IDENTIFIED 
SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION IN NIPPON LIFE INDIA ASSET MANAGEMENT 
LIMITED’S BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
To the Board of Directors of Nippon Life India Asset Management Limited 
1.	
We have undertaken to perform a reasonable assurance engagement, for Nippon Life India Asset 
Management Limited (“the Company”) vide our engagement agreement dated December 04, 2024 
in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed in the “Identified Sustainability Information” 
paragraph below in accordance with the criteria stated in the “Criteria” paragraph below. The Identified 
Sustainability Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) 
of the Company for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”). This engagement was 
conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and specialists.
Identified Sustainability Information
2.	
The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended March 31, 2025 is BRSR Core (sub-set of BRSR), 
the attributes of which are summarised in Appendix 1 to this report. The Reporting Boundary for BRSR is on 
standalone basis as disclosed under Question No. 13 of Section A: General Disclosures of the BRSR. 
3.	
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31,2025 information 
only and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements 
included in the BRSR (i.e. non- BRSR Core attributes) and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.  
Criteria
4.	
The Criteria used by the company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under: 
	
i.	
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended; 
	
ii.	
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master 
Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 and Industry Standard on 
Reporting of BRSR Core per SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated December 
20, 2024.
Management’s Responsibility 
5.	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Identified Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of BRSR, disclosing environmental 
information basis operational control approach, taking into account applicable laws and regulations 
including the SEBI circular, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification 
of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. The Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s compliance with the requirements of LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in 
relation to the BRSR Core.
171
Inherent limitations
6.	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities. 
7.	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject 
to inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint, 
embracing circularity (waste management). Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our 
opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and attributes.  
Our Independence and Quality Control 
8.	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/
CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the required 
competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
9.	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and 
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility 
10.	 Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information 
listed in Appendix 1 based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
11.	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance 
Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Reporting Criteria. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the 
assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances. 
12.	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. 
	
Below is the informative summary of the procedures performed by us: 
•	 Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures. 
•	 Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or 
measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information.

finance team, human resource, administration, procurement team amongst others and those with the 
responsibility for managing the Company’s BRSR.

roles and responsibilities of the concerned team members.

controls for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information on 
sample basis of different offices. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to 
the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures

Statutory Reports
that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal controls. 
•	 Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may 
be materially misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures. Performed 
substantive testing on a sample basis of the Identified Sustainability Information to verify that the data 
had been appropriately measured with the underlying documents recorded, collated and reported. 
This includes reconciling the Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records and 
recalculation on a sample basis. 
•	 Where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the 
information in the audited standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 
31, 2025 and the underlying trial balance. 
•	 Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements made by 
the management in the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information. 
•	 Obtained representations from Company’s management. 
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion.

independent assurance report dated June 12, 2025 thereon. 
15.	 Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our assurance engagement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified Sustainability Information or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard. 
Opinion
