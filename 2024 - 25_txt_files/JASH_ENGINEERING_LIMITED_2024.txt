Jash

We have designed our plants to 
be suitable for “Zero Water 
Discharge” and so we treat all our 
waste water and after treatment 
use the treated water. 
We have implemented a Rain 
water harvesting system, an area 
of which is 65000 sq feet and 
depth is 6 feet and also planted 
2,000 sapling plants for the

may also result

Therefore,

Jash’s safety and health 
responsibilities are driven by our 
commitment to zero harm to the 
people we work with and the 
community at large. We care for 
our employees and are among the 
best paymasters in our city and 
industry. All of our employees are 
covered under PF and ESIC plans

addition to this, we provide all of 
our staff with Mediclaim policy as
