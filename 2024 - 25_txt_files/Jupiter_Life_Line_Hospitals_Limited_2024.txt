1.
Patient health

being
Risk

•   Effective implementation of 
Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) 
systems
•   Sustainable rainwater 
harvesting and water

regulatory sanctions and 
reputational harm.
•   Rigorous adherence

management protocols
•   Collaborative initiatives with 
authorised waste handlers
•   Regular audits and training
Negative -
Mishandling waste can 
result in regulatory 
fines, litigation, and

information becomes 
critical as healthcare data 
increasingly transitions to 
digital formats, helping to 
prevent breaches, maintain 
trust, and ensure regulatory 
compliance.

infrastructure
•   Periodic vulnerability 
assessments

to significant fines, 
reputational damage, 
and loss of patient trust.
7.

and transition risks (policy 
shifts), potentially affecting 
hospital infrastructure, 
supply chains, and insurance 
costs.
•   Climate-resilient 
infrastructure development
•   Vigilant reduction of carbon 
footprint through renewable 
energy and resource 
conservation initiatives

efficiency.

model ensures long-term 
sustainability, enabling 
the Company to withstand 
market shifts, pandemics,

staff with the necessary skills and awareness. The Committee also leads routine facility audits to ensure continuous 
compliance and readiness.
 	
Additionally, staff members undergo health screenings both at the time of joining and on an annual basis to protect

oversees the planning and implementation of health and safety measures. With guidance from the Infection Control 
team, healthcare staff strictly follow standard precautions during all patient care activities.
 	
 The team regularly analyses incident reports, near-misses, and accidents to identify hazards and assess risks, driving 
continuous improvement. Infection control measures are especially focussed on high-risk areas, including operating 
theatres, the central sterile services department, casualty wards, and intensive care units (ICUs).
 c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Yes/No)
 	
 Yes, any work-related hazards can be reported to JLHL’s Safety Committee. A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is carried out 
for each incident, and the findings are utilised to strengthen and improve processes.
 d)	 Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)
 	
 Yes, JLHL provides a wide range of benefits to its employees. These include health insurance, annual medical check-
ups, and vaccinations. In addition, employees also receive complimentary consultations and maternity benefits. A 50% 
concession on healthcare is available to both staff and their dependants.

discrimination and harassment. The Company’s Whistleblower Policy, available at https://www.jupiterhospital.com/
wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Whistle-Blower-Policy-1.pdf, allows individuals to report concerns safely, without fear of 
retaliation.
	
 The policy ensures the confidentiality of the complainant’s identity and strictly prohibits any form of victimisation. 
Any reports of retaliation are treated as separate protected disclosures and are thoroughly investigated. The Audit 
Committee monitors the implementation of these protective measures, ensuring a safe and ethical work environment 
for all.

DOES THE ENTITY HAVE ANY PROJECT RELATED TO REDUCING GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSION? IF YES, 
THEN PROVIDE DETAILS.
	
Yes, JLHL has implemented comprehensive projects focussed on reducing GHG emissions, primarily at its Pune facility, 
which holds the BEEP certification (2014) and NEERMAN Award (2022) for excellence in energy efficiency and sustainability. 
Key initiatives and insights include:
	
-	
Boiler Replacement: Diesel-fired boilers were replaced with electric heat pumps, eliminating fossil fuel combustion 
and significantly lowering carbon emissions.
	
-	
Advanced Cooling Solutions: The facility installed energy-efficient water-cooled chillers (both screw and scroll 
types) featuring Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) and microprocessor controls. These chillers operate with high 
Coefficient of Performance (COP) values up to 6.4 and Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) as low as 0.3269, enabling 
optimised energy consumption across varying load conditions.
	
-	
Pumping Systems: Deployment of VFD-modulated chilled water pumps allows dynamic adjustment of flow rates 
based on real-time cooling demand, avoiding energy wastage and reducing power consumption.
	
-	
Building Envelope Improvements: Insulated roofs and double-glazed windows reduce heat gain, lowering the 
energy required for cooling, thereby indirectly cutting GHG emissions.
	
-	
Renewable Energy Integration: To enhance energy sustainability, windmills were installed to supplement power 
requirements. These instalments have resulted in a significant reduction of 6,747.36 metric tonnes of CO₂ equivalent 
in FY 2024-25 by lowering dependence on grid electricity.
	
-	
Lighting and HVAC Controls: Automated lighting in common areas and precise temperature/humidity control in 
operation theatres (maintaining 18–21°C with humidity under 60% RH) ensure comfort while minimising electricity use.
	
-	
Cooling Tower Upgrades: High-capacity, VFD-equipped cooling towers improve heat rejection efficiency, 
contributing to lower energy use in HVAC systems.

1
Installation of 
energy-efficient 
water-cooled 
screw chillers
Installed 2 KEHEMS make 350TR water-cooled screw 
chillers equipped with rotary screw semi-hermetic 
compressors, flooded evaporators, and VFD-based 
microprocessor controls. These chillers offer high 
efficiency (COP 6.4, IPLV 0.3269) and superior load 
adaptability.
Reduced energy consumption per 
cooling tonnage, improved operational 
efficiency, and significantly lowered 
emissions associated with cooling 
operations. Enhanced overall building 
energy performance.
2
Installation of 
energy-efficient 
scroll chillers
Procured and installed 2 KEHEMS make 45TR 
water-cooled scroll chillers featuring inverter scroll 
compressors and VFDs for improved part-load 
performance (COP 5.54, IPLV 0.491). Delivered in 
April 2025.
Enhanced energy efficiency during 
partial loads, leading to optimised 
electricity usage and reduced carbon 
emissions. Supports transition to 
greener HVAC infrastructure.
3
Deployment of 
VFD-controlled 
chilled and 
condenser 
water pumps
Installed Armstrong make 30KW secondary and 
15KW primary chilled water pumps with zone-wise 
VFD modulation and system detection controllers for 
screw chillers. Additional Armstrong pumps installed 
for scroll chiller system. 
Enabled dynamic flow control, reduced 
pump energy usage, and contributed 
to overall HVAC system optimisation. 
Supports energy conservation and 
demand-side efficiency management.
4
Upgrade of 
cooling towers 
to energy-
efficient models
Installed 3 Baltimore Aircoil cooling towers with 
1,792 kW heat rejection capacity each, featuring 
VFD-controlled fan motors and smart control panels. 
Improved heat rejection efficiency, 
reduced water and energy 
consumption, and contributed to 
the reduction of HVAC system load. 
Lowered environmental footprint and 
improved operational reliability.
