MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE
We are happy to report that AICL has continued to demonstrate phenomenal results in the 
FY24 compared to FY23. We have reported a 15.80% % year-on-year (YoY) jump in Bitumen 
volume at 4.91 Lakh MT. Our EBIDTA has increased by 23.07 % at ` 177.94 crore and we 
reported PAT of ` 109.22 crore with an increase of 18.38%. We are committed to serve 
our nation by being an integral part of Indian Infrastructure development. We function as 
an Infra-ancillary for the transport & logistics segments because of our powerful logistical 
assets & infrastructure. We continue our stand of being the largest bitumen player in the 
private sector in India. Our performance has seen a steady growth journey year on year and 
this has led us to have continual strategic expansion plans to grow our capacities. We now 
own a fleet of 10 large vessels having total capacity of around 1,02,049 MT which are used 
in importing raw bitumen from oil producing countries. In Budget 2023 Road ministry got 
a 36% hike in allocation at ` 2.7 lakh Cr for 2023-24, to help the ministry meet the 25,000-
km road development target announced in the 2022-23 Budget. This development pace is 
creating a huge demand for road materials, thereby our responsibilities of catering Bitumen 
has further increased. The market opportunity is tremendous and we have captured almost 
20%-30% of the bulk market share in Bitumen in the private sector. Expecting strong growth 
in infrastructure activity and based on the current market trend and order pipeline, we have 
a strong guidance of sustainable long-term growth.

Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
BULK BITUMEN TRANSPOTATION
We are the pioneers of logistics in Bitumen, which is 
predominantly used in road construction business. It can 
be procured either in bulk or in packed form. In either case 
the product has to be dispatched to the construction site 
or  to the storage facilities of our industrial consumers. The 
bulk bitumen is transported via specially designed tankers 
that are insulated and have pumping facility for loading 
and unloading the bitumen. Most of our Bitumen tankers 
are under contract with major oil companies in India like 
HPCL, BPCL and IOCL and by other major consumers of 
the product.
BULK LPG TRANSPOTATION
We are amongst the leading transporters of LPG in India, 
which is the most widely used fuel for domestic as well as 
industrial purposes. While we already own a large fleet 
of tankers, we also hire tankers on long term contracts to 
cater to the demand from customers LPG is mainly sourced 
from domestic refineries and via bulk imports. Bulk LPG is 
mainly transported from the source to the industrial user or 
to their bottling plants through specially designed tankers 
LPG, being highly inflammable, require tankers that take 
care of all safety aspects while loading, transporting and 
unloading. Most of the LPG tankers are under contract 
with major oil companies like HPCL, BPCL and IOCL.
POWER GENERATION THROUGH WIND MILLS
The Company has diversified into Non-Conventional 
energy generation by installing wind mills at Rajasthan 
and Maharashtra, keeping in view of the likely shortage of 
energy resources in future. Your Company has one Windmill 
at Dhulia, Maharashtra and one in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.
AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRE OF ASHOK LEYLAND
We own a large fleet of tankers which necessarily calls 
for regular periodic checks and maintenance. As also, 
our entire fleet of tankers comes from the Ashok Leyland 
stable. Both these factors influenced our decision to set up 
an authorized service center, for Ashok Leyland vehicles, 
within the company. Not only does this ensure a timely 
turnaround of the fleet serviced but is an economically 
beneficial proposition for the company. We have our own 
workshop and maintenance facilities at strategic locations 
like Mumbai, Baroda and Jodhpur.

ANNEXURE - V
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Please note that disclosures given in this Annexure - 
Management Discussion and Analysis’ (MD&A) are 
meant to ensure that there is transparency in Company’s 
financial performance. It digs into balance sheets, 
income statements, and cash flows. This helps investors 
understand what’s behind the company’s financial health 
and its chances for success in the future. They enable our 
investors to evaluate the Company and make informed 
investment decisions. Financial statements alone are not 
sufficient to judge a Company’s current performance and 
predict the future performance. The ordinary investor needs 
narrative explanations to have a better understanding of 
the performance and the environment in which the firm 
operates. MD & A fulfills this objective. It gives the investor 
an opportunity to look at the Company through the eyes 
of management by providing both a short and long-term 
analysis of the business of the Company.
Some statements in this discussion describing the 
projections, estimates, expectations or outlook may 
be forward looking. Actual results may, however, differ 
materially from those stated, on account of various factors 
such as changes in government regulations, tax regimes, 
economic developments within India and the countries 
within which your Company conducts its business, exchange 
rates and interest rates fluctuations, impact of competition, 
demand and supply constraints, etc.

Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) constructed 12,349 
km of national highways in 2023-24, the second highest so 
far, compared to 10,331 km in 2022-23,” the oil ministry said 
in its industry demand analysis.
More than 40% of bitumen consumed in the country is 
imported. India paid $1.3 billion for bitumen imports in FY24, 
8% more than the previous year. In volume terms, bitumen 
accounts for about 4% of total domestic consumption of 
refined products.
Bitumen consumption has gained pace in recent years in 
line with increasing road construction activity. Average 
annual consumption in the last five financial years between 
2019-20 and 2023-24 was 7.7 MMT, up from an average of 
5.94 MMT.
Last fiscal, western India was the largest consumer of 
bitumen and the East the smallest. Bitumen is the preferred 
material for road building although cement is also being 
increasingly used for making concrete roads.
Increase in road construction activities fuels the demand 
for bitumen. Bitumen is processed into asphalt for road 
construction. Asphalt is a mixture of rock aggregates and 
bitumen. Bitumen serves as a binding agent and improves 
the stability of asphalt. Depending on the type of bitumen 
or composition of the mixture used, asphalt roads can be 
made suitable for regions with different climatic conditions 
or various levels of operational demands. Asphalt is also 
used for airport runways, parking decks, and working areas 
in ports. In addition, Indias recent passed budget includes 
expenditure on development of National Highways, including 
projects relating to expressways, two-laning of highways, 
under the National Highways Development Project, six-laning 
of crowded stretches of the Golden Quadrilateral, a special 
program for the development of road connectivity in Naxal 
affected areas, development of Vijayawada Ranchi road, 
and for providing last mile connectivity, which is anticipated 
to drive the growth of India bitumen market. Furthermore, 
bitumen adhesive is widely used in the construction industry 
for roofs. 
It is a cold applied adhesive for bonding bituminous roofing 
felts to asphalt, felt, metal, and concrete. Bitumen adhesive 
has physical properties that includes toughness, flexibility, 
and forms adhesive and cohesive film and provides good UV 
resistance. Owing to growth in construction industry due to 
rapid urbanization and launch of government initiatives such 
as Housing for All that includes construction of houses for 
urban poor is expected to drive the growth of the bitumen 
market across the country. growth in the construction industry 
due to growth in population across the cities and demand for 
new houses led to increase in demand for bitumen across the 
country. In addition, government initiatives such as Pradhan 
Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) that includes construction of 
houses for poor people living in both rural andurban   areas 
is likely to increase the demand for bitumen; thereby, driving 
the growth of the Indian bitumen market. However, human 
health & environmental issues associated with bitumen, 
fluctuating international crude oil prices, and increase in 
use of alternative of bitumen such as concrete in roadway 
construction applications are expected to restrain the growth 
of the market. Moreover, development of bio-based bitumen 
and EME (Enrobés á Module Elevé) binder is anticipated to 
provide lucrative opportunities for further development of 
the market.

in roadway construction application restrain the growth 
of the market across the India. Moreover, development of 
bio-based bitumen and EME (Enrobs Module Elev) binder 
is anticipated to provide lucrative opportunities for further 
development of the market.
The India bitumen market covered in the study includes 
paving grade bitumen, oxidized bitumen, polymer modified 
bitumen, and bitumen emulsions. By end-use industry,

OUR OPERATIONS – BUSINES SEGMENTS
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Ltd (AICL) is an integral part 
of Ancillary Infra Industry and is engaged in the business 
of (i) manufacturing and trading of Bitumen and Allied 
products used heavily in infrastructure projects (ii) providing 
Logistics for Bulk Bitumen and LPG through its own 
Specialized Tankers and (iii) also generates power through 
Wind Mills. These businesses are of seasonal nature due to 
which revenue gets varied
MANUFACTURING 
OF 
BITUMEN 
& 
BITUMINOUS PRODUCTS
AICL has its manufacturing and storage units at Taloja, 
Belgaum, Baroda, Hyderabad, Cochin (through its wholly 
owned subsidiary – Bituminex Cochin Private Limited) and 
at recently added unit at Pachpadra City, Dist. Barmer, 
(Rajasthan). Further, the Company has started full fledged 
operations  at its recently established  manufacturing 
and storage facilities of Bitumen and other value added 
Bituminous products at Guwahati, Assam and which would 
endeavor to expand and develop Bitumen trade in Eastern 
states as Bitumen is extensively used in infrastructure 
projects more specifically in road construction projects 
initiated by the State Government.
BULK BITUMEN STORAGE FACILITIES
AICL has Bulk Bitumen Storage facilities to effectively handle 
and market bitumen imports at Mumbai, Maharashtra, 
Vadodara, Gujarat,  Karwar,  Haldia, West Bengal, Dighi 
(Company 
Owned), 
Maharashtra, 
Hazira 
(Loading) 
and Mangalore.
BULK BITUMEN TRANSPORTATION
AICL has its own a large fleet of specialized Bitumen Tankers 
for transportation of Bitumen to its valued customers at 
their locations on their request. It can be procured either 
in bulk or in packed form. In either case the product has 
to be dispatched to the construction site or  to the storage 
facilities of our industrial consumers. The bulk bitumen is 
transported via specially designed tankers that are insulated 
and have pumping facility for loading and unloading the 
bitumen. Most of our Bitumen tankers are under contract 
with major oil companies in India like HPCL, BPCL and IOCL 
and by other major consumers of the product.
BULK  LPG  TRANSPOTATION
AICL is also  one of the leading transporters of LPG in India, 
which is the most widely used fuel for domestic as well as 
industrial purposes. Though it has its own a  large fleet 
of tankers, it also hires tankers on long term contracts to 
cater to the demand from customers LPG is mainly sourced 
from domestic refineries and via bulk imports. Bulk LPG is 
mainly transported from the source to the industrial user or 
to their bottling plants through specially designed tankers 
LPG, being highly inflammable, require tankers that take 
care of all safety aspects while loading, transporting and 
unloading. Most of the LPG tankers are under contract with 
major oil companies like HPCL, BPCL and IOCL.
POWER GENERATION THROUGH WIND 
MILLS
AICL 
has 
diversified 
into 
Non-Conventional 
energy 
generation by installing wind mills at Rajasthan and 
Maharashtra, keeping in view of the likely shortage of 
energy resources in future. It has one Windmill at Dhulia, 
Maharashtra and one in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.
AUTHORIZED 
SERVICE 
CENTRE 
OF 
ASHOK LEYLAND
AICL owns a large fleet of tankers which necessarily calls 
for regular periodic checks and maintenance. As also, 
our entire fleet of tankers comes from the Ashok Leyland. 
Both these factors influenced our decision to set up an 
authorized service center, for Ashok Leyland vehicles, 
within the company. Not only does this ensure a timely 
turnaround of the fleet serviced but is an economically 
beneficial proposition for the company. It has also its own 
workshop and maintenance facilities at strategic locations 
like Mumbai, Baroda and Jodhpur.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To The  Members  of Agarwal  Industrial Corporation 
Limited
Report on the Standalone Financial Statements
1. 
We have audited the Standalone financial statements 
of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Standalone Balance 
Sheet as at 31st March, 2024, and the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including other 
comprehensive income), the Standalone Statement 
of Changes in Equity and the Standalone Cash 
Flow Statement for the year then ended and, notes 
to the standalone financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
2. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at 31st March, 2024, and its profit and 
other comprehensive income, the changes in equity 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis of Opinion
3. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
4. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
5.
The Key Audit Matter
How was the matter addressed in our audit
Revenue is one of the key profit drivers and is therefore susceptible 
to misstatement. Cut-off is the key assertion insofar as revenue 
recognition is concerned, since an inappropriate cut-off can result 
in material misstatement of result for the year.
Our audit procedures with regard to revenue recognition included 
testing controls, automated and manual, around dispatches / 
deliveries, inventory reconciliations and circularization of receivable 
balances, substantive testing of cut-off and analytical review 
procedure.
Information other than the standalone financial 
statements and auditors’ report thereon
6. 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the 
Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report 
including Annexures to Board’s Report, Corporate 
Governance, but does not include the standalone 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
7. 
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
8. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
9. 
The Company’s management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the matters stated in section 
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these standalone financial statements that give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit and 
other comprehensive income, changes in equity 
and cash flows of the Company in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. 
This responsibility also includes the maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provision of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and for preventing and detecting the frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
90
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
10. In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board 
of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these standalone financial statements.
12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also :
	
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls.
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
controls relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate 
internal financial controls system in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
in the standalone financial statements made 
by management.
 
• 
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
13.	 Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
standalone financial statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
standalone financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the standalone financial statements.
14. We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
15. We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
16. From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated

in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

that the Company has paid remuneration to its 
directors during the year in accordance with the

from the directors as on 31st March 2024, taken 
on record by the Board of Directors, none of the 
directors is disqualified as on 31st March 2024, 
from being appointed as a director in terms of

iv)	
(a)	 The Management has represented that, 
to the best of their knowledge and belief, 
as disclosed in the notes to the accounts, 
no funds have been advanced or loaned 
or invested (either from borrowed funds

any other person(s) or entity(ies), including

guarantee, security or the like on behalf of

(b) 	 The Management has represented, that,

members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited on 
the standalone financial statements for the year ended on

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s 
Report
Referred to as ‘Annexure B’ in paragraph 19(f) of the 
Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the 
members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited on 
the standalone financial statements for the year ended on 
31st March 2024.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
1. 
We have audited the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of Agarwal Industrial Corporation 
Limited (“the Company”) as on 31st March 2024 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on 
that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
2. 
The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
internal 
financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the Guidance Note”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
3. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and prescribed 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
the ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls over financial 
reporting was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
6. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of standalone 
financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting
7. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the 
date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
during the reporting period. The recognition, 
measurement, classification or disclosure of an 
item or information in the financial statements is 
made relying on these estimates. The estimates 
and judgments used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continuously evaluated 
by the management and are based on historical 
experience and various other assumptions and 
factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the management believes to be reasonable 
under the existing circumstances. Actual results 
may differ from those estimates. Any revision to 
accounting estimates is recognised prospectively 
in current and future periods.
 
 
Critical accounting judgments and key source of 
estimation uncertainty
	
	
The Company is required to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.

and 
measurement 
of 
defined benefit obligations, key actuarial 
assumptions  - refer note 14 below.
 
 
(b) Estimation of current tax expenses and

price, 
including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates, any directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use and estimated costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the item 
and restoring the site on which it is located.
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
105
 
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, then 
they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment. 
Subsequent expenditure and subsequent costs 
are included in the assets carrying amount or 
recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate 
only if it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Company and that the cost of the item can be 
reliably measured.
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined 
by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. 
These are included in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
 
 
Assets that are subject to depreciation and 
amortization are reviewed for impairment, 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate 
that 
carrying 
amount 
may 
not 
be recoverable.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment which are not 
ready for intended use as on the date of Balance 
Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
	
4.	 Intangible assets
 
 
Intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
	
5.	 Depreciation and Amortization
	
	
(a)	 Property plant and equipment (PPE)
 
 
 
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata 
basis on the straight line method based 
on estimated useful life prescribed under 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.
	
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and method 
of depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment is reviewed at each financial 
year 
end 
and 
adjusted 
prospectively, 
if appropriate.
	
	
(b)	 Intangible assets
	
	
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed as either finite or indefinite. 
Finite-life intangible assets are amortised 
on 
a 
 
straight-line 
basis 
over 
the 
period of their expected useful lives.
The 
amortisation 
period 
and 
the 
amortisation method for finite life intangible 
assets is reviewed at each financial year end 
and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
For indefinite life intangible assets, the 
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether it continues, 
if not, it is impaired or changed prospectively 
on the basis of revised estimates.
	
6.	 Investment Properties
	
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both, and that is 
not occupied by the Company, is classified as 
investment property. Investment property is 
measured at its cost, including related transaction 
costs and where applicable borrowing costs less 
depreciation and impairment if any.
 
 
Depreciation on Investment Property is provided 
using the written down value method based on 
the useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
7.	
Financial Instruments
	
	
Financial assets - Initial recognition
 
 
Financial assets are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions 
of 
the 
instruments. 
On 
initial 
recognition, a financial asset is recognised at 
fair value, in case of Financial assets which are 
recognised at fair value through profit and loss 
(FVTPL), its transaction cost are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. In other cases, the 
transaction cost are attributed to the acquisition 
value of the financial asset.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently classified and 
measured at:
 
 
 - 
amortised cost
 
 
 - 
fair value through profit & loss (FVTPL)
 
 
 - 
fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
The above classification is being determined 
considering the:
 
 
(a) the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
 
 
(b) the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
 
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period 
the company changes its business model for 
managing financial assets.
	
	
(i)	
Measured at amortised cost
 
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost if these financial assets 
are held within a business whose objective 
is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual 
terms of the financial asset that give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
106
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
	
	
(ii)	 Measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
 
 
 
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI, 
if these financial assets are held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows 
that give rise on specified dates to solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding and by selling 
financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Interest income measured 
using the Effective Interest Rate method and 
impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On 
derecognition, cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to ‘other income’ in the 
Statement of Profit and  Loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Measured at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
 
 
 
Financial 
assets 
other 
than 
equity 
instrument are measured at FVTPL unless it 
is measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI 
on initial recognition. Such financial assets 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
in fair value, including interest income and 
dividend income if any, recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Equity instruments
 
On initial recognition, the Company can make an 
irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument 
basis) to present the subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income pertaining to 
investments in equity instruments. This election is not 
permitted if the equity investment is held for trading. 
These elected investments are initially measured at 
fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain or loss 
is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss on 
disposal of the investments.
 
Dividends on these investments in equity instruments 
are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the Company’s right to receive the dividends is 
established, it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the dividend will flow to the entity, the 
dividend does not represent a recovery of part of cost 
of the investment and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably. Dividends recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss are included in the ‘Other income’ 
line item.
	
Impairment
 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that 
are measured at amortised cost and at FVTOCI. The 
credit loss is difference between all contractual cash 
flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects 
to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the 
original effective interest rate. This is assessed on 
an individual or collective basis after considering all 
reasonable and supportable including that which is 
forward looking.
 
The Company’s trade receivables or contract revenue 
receivables do not contain significant financing 
component and loss allowance on trade receivables 
is measured at an amount equal to life time 
expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being 
simplified approach for recognition of impairment 
loss allowance.
 
Under simplified approach, the Company does not 
track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on the lifetime 
ECL at each reporting date right from its initial 
recognition. The Company uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance on the 
portfolio of trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates 
over the expected life of the trade receivable and 
is adjusted for forward looking estimates. At every 
reporting date, the historical observed default rates 
are updated and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed.
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Company recognises 12–months expected credit 
losses for all originated or acquired financial assets 
if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its initial 
recognition. The expected credit losses are measured 
as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on 
financial asset increases significantly since its initial 
recognition. If, in a  subsequent period, credit quality 
of the instrument improves such that there is no 
longer significant increase in credit risks since initial 
recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing 
impairment loss allowance based on 12 months ECL. 
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in 
Statement of Profit and Loss. For equity instruments 
and financial assets measured at FVTPL, there is no 
requirement of impairment testing.
	
Derecognition
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or it transfers rights to receive cash flows 
from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it 
has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained

substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the Company 
continues to recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the Company’s continuing involvement.
In that case, the Company also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Company 
has retained.
	
Financial Liabilities
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for 
all financial liabilities not carried at fair value through 
profit or loss.
 
The Company’s financial liabilities includes trade 
and other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts.
	
Subsequent measurement : Financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) 
method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value with 
all changes in fair value recognised in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
	
Loans & Borrowings: After initial recognition, interest 
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using EIR method. Gains 
and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the 
liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR 
amortization process.
	
Financial Guarantee Contracts : Financial guarantee 
contracts issued by the Company are those contracts 
that requires payment to be made or to be reimbursed 
to the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance 
with the term of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair 
value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.”
	
De-recognition
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
	
Derivative financial instruments
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge 
its  foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
	
8.  	 Fair Value Measurement
 
 
The Company measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives, investments at fair value at 
each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
 
(a) In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
 
 
(b) In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability.
 
 
The 
principal 
or 
the 
most 
advantageous 
market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured 
using 
the 
assumptions 
that 
market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling 
it to another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use. The 
Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable 
inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
108
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
 
 
(i) 
Level 1-Quoted (unadjusted) market prices 
in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities.
 
 
(ii) 
Level 2-Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
 
 
(iii) Level 3-Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised 
in the financial statements on a recurring 
basis, the Company determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in 
the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Company has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
	
9. 	 Inventory
 
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost is computed on First-in-
First-Out (FIFO) basis. Cost of finished goods and 
work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. The net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
	
10.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
 
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and 
Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand 
deposits with banks and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value where 
original maturity is three months or less.
	
11.	 Foreign Currency Transactions
	
	
a)	
Initial Recognition
 
 
 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions 
settled during the year are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss of the year.
	
	
b)	
Measurement of Foreign Currency Items at 
the Balance Sheet Date
 
 
 
Foreign currency monetary items of the 
Company are restated at the closing 
exchange rates.  Non monetary items are 
recorded at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date of the transaction.  Exchange 
differences arising out of these transactions 
are charged to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
12.	 Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured at the value of the 
consideration 
received 
or 
receivable. 
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of 
returns, trade allowances, rebates, discounts, 
loyalty 
discount, 
value 
added 
taxes 
and 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The Company recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured, 
it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and specific criteria have 
been met for each of the Company’s activities as 
described below :
	
	
Sale of Goods
 
 
Revenues are recognized at a point in time when 
control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually 
upon either at the time of dispatch or delivery. 
In case of export sale, it is usually recognised 
based on the shipped-on board date as per bill 
of lading.
	
	
Rendering of Services
 
 
Income from services rendered is recognised 
based on agreements /arrangements with the 
customers as the service is performed / rendered.
	
	
Interest
 
 
Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the amount outstanding 
and the interest rate applicable and based on 
Effective interest rate method.
	
	
Dividend
 
 
Dividend Income is recognized when right to 
receive the same is established.
	
13.	 Investment in subsidiaries
	
	
Investments in equity shares of subsidiaries are 
recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment 
at each reporting date. Where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying amount of 
the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount. On 
disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the 
difference between net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amounts are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

14.	 Employee Benefits
	
	
The Company has provided following post-
employment plans:
 
 
(a) Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
 
 
(b) Defined 
contribution 
plans 
such 
as 
Provident fund
	
	
a)	
Defined-benefit plan
 
 
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period 
less fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligations is calculated annually 
by actuaries through actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method.
The Company recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation 
as an expense in the statement of profit 
and loss:
 
 
 
(a) Service costs comprising current service 
costs, past-service costs, gains and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
 
 
 
(b) Net interest expense or income
 
 
 
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net balance 
of the defined benefit obligation and fair 
value of plan assets. This cost is included in 
employee benefit expenses in the statement 
of the profit & loss.
 
 
 
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses arising from
 
 
 
(a) Re-measurement of Actuarial (gains)/
losses
 
 
 
(b) Return on plan assets, excluding amount 
recognized in effect of asset ceiling
 
 
 
(c) 
Re-measurement arising because of 
change in effect of asset ceiling are 
recognised in the period in which they 
occur directly in Other comprehensive 
income. 
Re-measurement 
are 
not reclassified to profit or loss in 
subsequent periods.
 
 
 
 
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of 
judgment 
in 
relation 
to 
various 
assumptions 
including 
future 
pay 
rises, inflation and discount rates and 
employee and pensioner demographics. 
The 
Company 
determines 
the 
assumptions 
in 
conjunction 
with 
its 
actuaries, 
and 
believes 
these 
assumptions to be in line with best 
practice, but the application of different 
assumptions could have a significant 
effect on the amounts reflected in the 
income statement, other comprehensive 
income and balance sheet. There may 
be 
also 
interdependency 
between 
some of the assumptions.
	
	
b)	
Defined-contribution plan
 
 
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident 
fund, 
the 
Company 
pays 
pre-defined 
amounts to separate funds and does not 
have any legal or informal obligation to pay 
additional sums. Defined Contribution plan 
comprise of contributions to the employees’ 
provident 
fund 
with 
the 
government, 
superannuation fund and certain state 
plans like Employees’ State Insurance and 
Employees’ Pension Scheme. The Company’s 
payments to the defined contribution plans 
are recognised as expenses during the 
period in which the employees perform the 
services that the payment covers.
	
15.	 Taxes on Income
 
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent 
it relates to items directly recognized in equity or 
in other comprehensive income.
 
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit 
due to temporary differences between accounting 
and tax treatments, and due to items that are 
never taxable or tax deductible. Tax provisions 
are included in current liabilities. Interest and 
penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the 
tax charge. The Company offsets, the current tax 
assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) 
where it has a legally enforceable right and where 
it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a 
net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on 
net basis.
 
 
Deferred income tax is recognized using the 
balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary 
differences 
arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount in financial statements. 
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilized. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
where it is more likely than not that the assets 
will not be realised in the future.
 
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
110
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
to be utilized.  Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 
 
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
16.	 Borrowing Cost
 
 
General and specific borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets 
are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, 
during the period till all the activities necessary to 
prepare the Qualifying assets for its intended use 
or sale are complete during the period of time that 
is required to complete and prepare the assets 
for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
	
17.	 Segment Reporting
 
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating decision maker.
	
18.	 Earnings Per Share
 
 
Basic earnings per shares are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. For the purpose 
of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net 
profit or loss for the period attributable to the 
equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period 
is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
	
19.	 Measurement of EBITDA
	
	
The Company has opted to present earnings 
before interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) as a separate line item 
on the face of the Statement of Profit and Loss 
for the period. The Company measures EBITDA 
based on profit/(loss) from continuing operations.
	
20.	 Leases
	
	
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116-Leases 
using the modified retrospective method. The 
Company has applied the standard to its leases 
with the cumulative impact recognised on the 
date of initial application.
 
 
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for Land, Buildings and Plant 
& Machinery. The Company assesses whether 
a contract is or contains a lease, at inception 
of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
 
 
(a)  the contract involves the use of an 
identified asset
	
	
(b)	 the Company has substantially all of the 
economic benefits from use of the asset 
through the period of the lease and
 
 
(c) 
the Company has the right to direct the use 
of the asset.
 
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short 
term leases) and leases of low value assets. For 
these short term and leases of low value assets, 
the Company recognises the lease payments as 
an operating expense on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease.
 
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement  date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated from the commencement date 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing 
rates. 
The 
lease 
liability 
is 
subsequently 
remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to 
reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments 
made. A lease liability is remeasured upon the 
occurrence of certain events such as a change 
in the lease term or a change in an index or 
rate used to determine lease payments. The 
remeasurement 
normally 
also 
adjusts 
the 
leased assets.
STATUTORY REPORTS

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
111
 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and 
lease payments have been classified as financing 
cash flows.
	
21.	 Current / non current classification
	
	
The Company presents assets and liabilities 
in the balance sheet based on current / non-
current classification.
 
 
An asset is treated as current when it is:
 
   
- 
Expected to be realised or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
 
  
- 
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
 
   
- 
Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
 
  
 - 
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
 
 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
 
 
A liability is current when:
 
 
- 
It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
	
	
-	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
 	
-	
It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
 
  
- 
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
 
 
The company classifies all other liabilities as non-
current.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
 
 
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
company has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
22.	 Events after reporting date
 
 
Where events occurring after the Balance Sheet 
date provide evidence of conditions that existed 
at the end of the reporting period, the impact 
of such events is adjusted within the Financial 
Statements. Otherwise, events after the Balance 
Sheet date of material size or nature are 
only disclosed.
	
23.	 Provisions, 
Contingent 
Liabilities 
and 
Contingent Assets
 
 
A  provision is recognised if, as a result of a 
past event, the company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation.
 
 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company 
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the future obligations under the contract.
 
 
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made 
where there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may probably not require an 
outflow of resources or an obligation for which 
the future outcome cannot be ascertained with 
reasonable certainty. When there is a possible 
or a present obligation where the likelihood of 
outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
 
 
Contingent assets are neither recognized nor 
disclosed in financial statements.

Assumptions	
	
	
	
	
 
With the objective of presenting the plan assets and plan liabilities of the defined benefits plans  at their fair value 
on the balance sheet, assumptions under Ind AS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
As at 
31st March 2024
As at 
31st March 2023
Financial Assumptions
Discount rate
7.12%
7.38%
Salary Escalation Rate
5.00%
5.00%
E.	 Sensitivity	 	
The sensitivity of the overall plan liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are:
 I in lakhs 
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in 
assumption
Increase in 
assumption
Decrease in 
assumption
Discount rate
1.00%
 72.73 
 91.17 
Salary Escalation Rate
1.00%
 89.64 
 73.27 
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is 
based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity 
to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the 
previous period.

41 Financial instruments
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1. 
Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current 
liabilities, short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely 
due to short term maturities of these instruments.
2. 
Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on parameters 
such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this  evaluation, allowances 
are taken to account for expected losses of these receivables. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments is not 
materially different from their carrying amounts.
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

Fair value estimation
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
(Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
• 
Level 1:Quoted prices for identical instruments
• 
Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
• 
Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is 
summarised below:

42 Financial risk factors
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, advances and  trade and other payables. 
The  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations and to provide to support its operations. 
The Company’s principal financial assets include loans, trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that 
derive directly from its operations.
 
The Company’s activities exposes it to Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and Credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised as below.
	
(a)	 Liquidity risk
 
 
The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that 
are settled by delivering cash or  another financial asset. Liquidity risk management implies maintenance 
sufficient cash including availability of  funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to 
meet the obligations as and when due.
 
 
The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its short term and long term liabilities as and when due. Anticipated future cash flows are expected to be 
sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements of the Company.

(b)	 Market risk
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and 
other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk 
includes investment, deposits, foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company’s treasury team 
manages the Market risk, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market 
risk management.
	
	
(i)	
Foreign currency risk
 
 
 
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company has foreign currency loan and trade payables 
and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk. The exchange rates have been volatile in the recent 
136
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited

years and may continue to be volatile in the future. Hence the operating results and financials of the 
Company may be impacted due to volatility of the rupee against foreign currencies.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
 
 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.  According to the Company, interest rate risk exposure is only 
for floating rate borrowings. The Company is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk, since the 
borrowings of the Company are on Fixed interest rate basis.
	
	
(iii)	 Commodity risk
 
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil. Volatility in Crude Oil prices, Currency 
fluctuation of Rupee vis-à-vis other prominent currencies coupled with demand–supply scenario in the 
world market affect the effective price and availability. The Company manages this risk by widening its 
source base, appropriate contracts and commitments and well planned procurement.
	
(c)	 Credit risk
 
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Company is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily 
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and other financial instruments.
Credit risk is managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 
monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course 
of business.

AGARWAL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION LIMITED
148
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To The Members of Agarwal  Industrial Corporation Limited
Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements 
of 
Agarwal 
Industrial 
Corporation 
Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Group”) and its 
subsidiaries, Bituminex Cochin Private Limited, AICL 
Overseas FZ LLC, Agarwal Translink Private Limited 
and AICL Finance Private Limited (the holding Group 
and its subsidiaries constitute “the Group”), which 
comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st 
March 2024, and the consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including other comprehensive income), the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year 
then ended and, notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial 
statements”).
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state 
of affairs of the Group as at 31st March 2024, and of its 
consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated 
cash flows statement for the year ended on that date.
Basis of Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
5.
The Key Audit Matter
How was the matter addressed in our audit
Revenue is one of the key profit drivers and is therefore susceptible 
to misstatement. Cut-off is the key assertion insofar as revenue 
recognition is concerned, since an inappropriate cut-off can result 
in material misstatement of result for the year.
Our audit procedures with regard to revenue recognition included 
testing controls, automated and manual, around dispatches / 
deliveries, inventory reconciliations and circularization of receivable 
balances, substantive testing of cut-off and analytical review 
procedure.
Information other than the financial statements 
and auditors’ report thereon
6.	
The Holding Company’s management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Holding Company’s 
Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
7. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
8.	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the course of our audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
9.	
The Holding Company’s management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the matters stated in 
section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a 
true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, 
consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance

with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The 
respective management and board of directors of the 
companies included in the group for maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provision of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each 
company and for preventing and detecting the frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
10. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
respective management and Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the group are responsible 
for assessing the ability of each company to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the respective board of 
directors intends to liquidate the company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the group is also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
11.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
12.	 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also :
	
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud 
is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls.
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
controls relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on internal financial controls with reference to 
the consolidated financial statements and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls based 
on our audit.
	
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements made 
by management.
	
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, 
whether 
a 
material 
uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
	
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
 
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of such 
entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, of which we are the independent 
auditors. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of 
financial information of such entities. For the 
other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements, which have been audited 
by other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are 
further described in the section titled ‘Other 
Matters’ in this audit report.

Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
	
	
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us 
along with the consideration of audit reports of 
the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
13.	 Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually 
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
14.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
15.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
16.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh 
the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
17. We did not audit the financial statements of 
Bituminex Cochin Private Limited and AICL Overseas 
FZ-LLC, subsidiaries included in the consolidated 
financial statements, whose financial statements 
reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustment)

25,719.33 lakhs, total net profit after tax (before

statements. These financial statements have been 
audited by other auditors whose reports have been 
furnished to us by the Management and our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as 
it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms 
of sub-sections (3) and (11) of Section 143 of the Act, 
in-so-far as it relates to aforesaid subsidiaries, is 
based solely on the report of the other auditors.
18. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, 
and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of 
the above matters with respect to our reliance on the 
work done and the reports of the other auditor.
Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

respective directors during the year in accordance 
with the provisions of and limits laid down under

20.	 As required by section 143(3) of the Act, based on 
our audit and on the consideration of reports of the 
other auditors on separate financial statements of 
such subsidiaries as were audited by other auditors, 
as noted in the ‘Other Matters’ paragraph, we report, 
to the extent applicable, that:

required by law relating to preparation of the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements

c)	
The Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss including other 
comprehensive income, Consolidated Statement 
of Change in Equity and the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement dealt with by this Report are in 
agreement with the relevant books of account 
maintained for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements.
	
d)	
In our opinion, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements comply with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act.

On the basis of written representations received 
from the directors of the Holding Company as on

Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s 
Report
Referred to as ‘Annexure A’ in paragraph 20(f) of the 
Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the 
members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited on 
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
on 31st March, 2024.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
1. 
We have audited the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of Agarwal Industrial Corporation 
Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary 
company which are incorporated in India, as on 31st 
March, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended and as on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
2.	
The Respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary company incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the Guidance Note”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Holding Company’s internal financial controls over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note 
and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
the ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls over financial 
reporting was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor 
of the subsidiary company incorporated in India, in 
terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph 9 
of the Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Group’s internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
6. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting
7.	
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary company incorporated in India, have, in 
all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and such 
internal financial controls over financial reporting 
were operating effectively as at 31st March 2024, 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company and its subsidiary 
company incorporated in India considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note.
Other Matter
9.	
Our aforesaid report under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
insofar as it relates to its subsidiary company 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding 
reports of the auditors of such company incorporated 
in India.
10. Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matters.

1	 (B). MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	
1.	 Basis of Preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements
 
 
These consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred to as 
the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies

measured at Fair value (refer note 7 below)
 
 
(ii)  Defined benefit employee plan (refer note 13

its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee.

that give it the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities of the investee)
	
	
(b)	 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee
	
	
(c)	
The ability to use its power over the investee

the group obtains control over the subsidiary 
and ceases when the Group losses control of 
the subsidiary.

Consolidatation Procedure
	
	
Subsidiaries
	
	
(a)	 Combine, on line by line basis like items of 
assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows of the Parent with those of 
its subsidiaries.
	
	
(b)	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of 
the Parent’s investment in each subsidiary 
and the Parent’s portion of equity of 
each subsidiary. Business combinations 
policy explains how to account for any 
related goodwill.
	
	
(c)	
Eliminate in full intra-group assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
Cash flows relating to transactions between 
entities of the group (profits or losses 
resulting from intra-group transactions that 
are recognised in assets, such as inventory 
and property, plant and equipment (PPE), 
are eliminated in full). Intra-group losses 
may indicate an impairment that requires 
recognition in the consolidated financial 
statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies 
to temporary differences that arise from the 
elimination of profits and losses resulting 
from intra-group transactions.
 
 
(d) Profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income are attributed to 
the owners of the Parent Company and 
to 
the 
non-controlling 
interests. 
Total 
comprehensive 
income 
of 
subsidiaries 
is attributed to the owners of the Parent 
Company 
and 
to 
the 
non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance.
	
	
(e)	 Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of the 
Group uses accounting policies other than 
those adopted in the consolidated financial 
statements for like transactions and events 
in 
similar 
circumstances, 
appropriate 
adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s financial statements in preparing 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
to ensure conformity with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
	
	
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in 
existing subsidiaries
	
	
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in 
subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiaries are accounted for 
as equity transactions. The carrying amounts 
of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any 
difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the 
fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognised  directly in equity and attributed to 
owners of the group.
	
	
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, 
a gain or loss is recognised in consolidated 
statement of profit and loss and is calculated 
as the difference between (i) the aggregate of 
the fair value of the consideration received and 
the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the 
previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any 
non-controlling interests.
 
 
The 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
presented in INR, the functional currency of the 
Group and is rounded off to the nearest lakhs 
except otherwise indicated.
	
2.	
Use of Estimates and judgments
 
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements requires the Management to make, 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities 
as at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses during the reporting period. The 
recognition, 
measurement, 
classification 
or 
disclosure of an item or information in the 
financial statements is made relying on these 
estimates. The estimates and judgements used 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements 
are 
continuously 
evaluated 
by 
the management and are based on historical 
experience and various other assumptions and 
factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the management believes to be reasonable 
under the existing circumstances. Actual results 
may differ from those estimates. Any revision to 
accounting estimates is recognised prospectively 
in current and future periods.
	
	
Critical accounting judgements and key source 
of estimation uncertainty
	
	
The Group is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.

3.	 Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
	
	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at 
acquisition cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
The cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment 
comprises 
its 
purchase 
price, 
including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates, any directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use and estimated costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the item 
and restoring the site on which it is located.
 
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, then 
they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment. 
Subsequent expenditure and subsequent costs 
are included in the assets carrying amount or 
recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate 
only if it is probable that the future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Group and that the cost of the item can be 
reliably measured.
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined 
by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. 
These are included in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
	
Assets that are subject to depreciation and 
amortization are reviewed for impairment, 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate 
that 
carrying 
amount 
may 
not 
be recoverable.
	
	
Property, plant and equipment which are not 
ready for intended use as on the date of Balance 
Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress.
	
4.	 Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
	
5.	 Depreciation and Amortization
	
	
(a)	 Property plant and equipment (PPE)
	
	
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata 
basis on the straight line method based 
on estimated useful life prescribed under 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 
The Group, based on technical assessment 
made by technical experts, have estimated 
the useful live of 35 years of ocean going 
bulk carriers ship from their making year 
which, managment belives is realistic and 
reflect fair approximation of the period over 
which ships are likely to be used.
	
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and method 
of depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment is reviewed at each financial 
year 
end 
and 
adjusted 
prospectively, 
if appropriate.
	
	
(b)	 Intangible assets
	
	
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed as either finite or indefinite. 
Finite-life intangible assets are amortised 
on 
a 
 
straight-line 
basis 
over 
the 
period of their expected useful lives.
The 
amortisation 
period 
and 
the 
amortisation method for finite life intangible 
assets is reviewed at each financial year end 
and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
For indefinite life intangible assets, the 
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether it continues, 
if not, it is impaired or changed prospectively 
on the basis of revised estimates.
	
6.	 Investment Properties
	
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not 
occupied by the Group, is classified as investment 
property. Investment property is measured 
at its cost, including related transaction costs 
and where applicable borrowing costs less 
depreciation and impairment if any.
	
	
Depreciation on Investment Property is provided 
using the written down value method based on 
the useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
7.  	 Financial Instruments
	
	
Financial assets - Initial recognition
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instruments.  On initial recognition, a 
financial asset is recognised at fair value, in 
case of Financial assets which are recognised 
at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), its 
transaction cost are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss. In other cases, the transaction 
cost are attributed to the acquisition value of the 
financial asset.
	
	
Subsequent measurement
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently classified and 
measured at:
	
	
 -	
amortised cost
 
 
 - 
fair value through profit & loss (FVTPL)
	
	
 -	
fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
 
 
The above classification is being determined 
considering the:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
163
 
 
(b) the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
 
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period the 
group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
	
(i)	
Measured at amortised cost
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, if these financial assets 
are held within a business module whose 
objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset that 
give rise on specified date to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	 Measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI, 
if these financial assets are held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows 
that give rise on specified dates to solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding and by selling 
financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Interest income measured 
using the Effective Interest Rate method and 
impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On 
derecognition, cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to ‘other income’ in the 
Statement of Profit and  Loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Measured at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
	
	
	
Financial 
assets 
other 
than 
equity 
instrument are measured at FVTPL unless it 
is measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI 
on initial recognition. Such financial assets 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
in fair value, including interest income and 
dividend income if any, recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Equity instruments
	
	
On initial recognition, the Group can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments. This election is not permitted if 
the equity investment is held for trading. These 
elected investments are initially measured at fair 
value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain or 
loss is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and 
Loss on disposal of the investments.
	
	
Dividends on these investments in equity 
instruments are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the Group’s right to receive 
the dividends is established, it is probable that 
the economic benefits associated with the 
dividend will flow to the entity, the dividend 
does not represent a recovery of part of cost of 
the investment and the amount of dividend can 
be measured reliably. Dividends recognised in 
Statement of Profit and Loss are included in the 
‘Other income’ line item.
	
	
Impairment
	
	
The Group recognises a loss allowance for 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets 
that are measured at amortised cost and at 
FVTOCI. The credit loss is difference between 
all contractual cash flows that are due to an 
entity in accordance with the contract and all 
the cash flows that the entity expects to receive 
(i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original 
effective interest rate. This is assessed on an 
individual or collective basis after considering all 
reasonable and supportable including that which 
is forward looking.
	
	
The Group’s trade receivables or contract 
revenue receivables do not contain significant 
financing component and loss allowance on 
trade receivables is measured at an amount 
equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected 
cash shortfall, being simplified approach for 
recognition of impairment loss allowance.
 
 
Under simplified approach, the Group does not 
track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on the lifetime 
ECL at each reporting date right from its initial 
recognition. The Group uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance on the 
portfolio of trade receivables. The provision 
matrix is based on its historically observed 
default rates over the expected life of the trade 
receivable and is adjusted for forward looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
 
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Group recognises 12–months expected credit 
losses for all originated or acquired financial 
assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of 
the financial asset has not increased significantly 
since its initial recognition. The expected credit 
losses are measured as lifetime expected 
credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset 
increases significantly since its initial recognition. 
164
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
If, in a  subsequent period, credit quality of the 
instrument improves such that there is no longer 
significant increase in credit risks since initial 
recognition, then the Group reverts to recognizing 
impairment loss allowance based on 12 months 
ECL. The impairment losses and reversals are 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. 
For equity instruments and financial assets 
measured at FVTPL, there is no requirement of 
impairment testing.
	
	
De-recognition
 
 
The Group derecognises a financial asset 
when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire, or it transfers 
rights to receive cash flows from an asset, it 
evaluates if and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Group 
continues to recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.
In that case, the Group also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Group 
has retained.
	
	
Financial Liabilities
	
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value net of transaction costs 
for all financial liabilities not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.
 
 
The Group’s financial liabilities includes trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts.
	
	
Subsequent measurement : Financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) 
method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value 
with all changes in fair value recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Loans & Borrowings : After initial recognition, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through EIR amortization process.
	
	
Financial Guarantee Contracts : Financial 
guarantee contracts issued by the Group are 
those contracts that require payment to be made 
or to be reimbursed to the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the specified debtor fails to make 
payment when due in accordance with the term of 
a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, 
adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
	
	
De-recognition
 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments
 
 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to 
hedge its  foreign currency risks. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair 
value recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the Balance 
Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
8.	 Fair Value Measurement
 
 
The Group measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives, investments at fair value at 
each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
	
	
(a)	 In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
	
	
(b)	 In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability.
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group. The fair value 
of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
165
 
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable 
inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
	
	
(i)	
Level 1-Quoted (unadjusted) market prices 
in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities
	
	
(ii)	
Level2 -Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
	
	
(iii)	 Level 3-Valuation 
techniques 
for 
which 
the lowest level input that is 
significant 
to 
the 
fair 
value 
measurement 
is 
unobservable.
For 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
that 
are recognised in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers 
have 
occurred 
between 
levels 
in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) 
at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities 
on the basis of the nature, characteristics and 
risks of the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
9.	
Inventory 
	
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost is computed on First-in-
First-Out (FIFO) basis. Cost of finished goods and 
work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. The net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
	
10.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
	
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and 
Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand 
deposits with banks and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value where 
original maturity is three months or less.
	
11.	 Foreign Currency Transactions
	
	
a)	
Initial Recognition 
	
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions 
settled during the year are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss of the year.
	
	
b)	
Measurement of Foreign Currency Items at 
the Balance Sheet Date
	
	
	
Foreign currency monetary items of the 
Group are restated at the closing exchange 
rates.  Non monetary items are recorded at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction.  Exchange differences 
arising out of these transactions are charged 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
c)	
Translation of Financial Statements of 
foreign entities
	
	
	
On Consolidation, the assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations are translated into Indian 
Rupees at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date and their statements of profit 
and loss are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
For practical reasons, group uses an average 
rate to translate income and expenses 
items. The exchange difference arising on 
translation for consolidation are recognised 
in Consolidated Statement of OCI.
	
12. 	Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured at the value of the 
consideration 
received 
or 
receivable. 
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of 
returns, trade allowances, rebates, discounts, 
loyalty 
discount, 
value 
added 
taxes 
and 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The Group recognizes revenue, whenever control 
over distinct goods or services is transferred to 
the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to 
direct the use of the transferred goods or services 
and obtains substantially all of the remaining 
benefits, provided a contract with enforceable 
rights and obligations exists and amongst others 
collectability of consideration is probable taking 
into account customer ’s creditworthiness. It 
is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and specific criteria have 
been met for each of the Group’s activities as 
described below.
166
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
	
	
Sale of Goods
	
	
Revenues are recognized at a point in time when 
control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually 
upon either at the time of dispatch or delivery. 
In case of export sale, it is usually recognised 
based on the shipped-on board date as per bill 
of lading.
	
	
Rendering of Services
	
	
Income from services rendered is recognised 
based on agreements /arrangements with the 
customers as the service is performed / rendered.
	
	
Interest
	
	
Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the amount outstanding 
and the interest rate applicable and based on 
Effective interest rate method.
	
	
Dividend
	
	
Dividend Income is recognized when right to 
receive the same is established.
	
13. 	Employee Benefits
	
	
The 
Group 
has 
provided 
following 
post-
employment plans:
 
 
(a) Defined benefit plans such as gratuity and
 
 
(b) Defined 
contribution 
plans 
such 
as 
Provident fund
	
	
a)	
Defined-benefit plan
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period 
less fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligations is calculated annually 
by actuaries through actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method.
The Group recognises the following changes 
in the net defined benefit obligation as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss:
	
	
	
(a)	 Service costs comprising current service 
costs, past service costs, gains and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
 
 
 
(b) Net interest expense or income
	
	
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation 
and fair value of plan assets. This cost is 
included in employee benefit expenses 
in the statement of the profit & loss.
	
	
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial gains 
and losses arising from
	
	
(a)	 Re-measurement of Actuarial (gains)/losses
	
	
(b)	 Return on plan assets, excluding amount 
recognized in effect of asset ceiling
	
	
(c)	
Re-measurement arising because of change 
in effect of asset ceiling
	
	
	
are recognised in the period in which they 
occur directly in Other comprehensive 
income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment 
in relation to various assumptions including 
future pay rises, inflation and discount rates 
and employee and pensioner demographics. 
The Group determines the assumptions in 
conjunction with its actuaries, and believes 
these assumptions to be in line with best 
practice, but the application of different 
assumptions 
could 
have 
a 
significant 
effect on the amounts reflected in the 
income statement, other comprehensive 
income and balance sheet. There may be 
also interdependency between some of 
the assumptions.
	
	
b)	
Defined-contribution plan
 
 
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident 
fund, the Group pays pre-defined amounts 
to separate funds and does not have any 
legal or informal obligation to pay additional 
sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise 
of contributions to the employees’ provident 
fund with the government, superannuation 
fund and certain state plans like Employees’ 
State Insurance and Employees’ Pension 
Scheme. The Group’s payments to the 
defined contribution plans are recognised 
as expenses during the period in which the 
employees perform the services that the 
payment covers.
	
14 .	Taxes on Income
	
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent 
it relates to items directly recognized in equity or 
in other comprehensive income.
 
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit is different from accounting 
profit due to temporary differences between 
accounting and tax treatments, and due to 
items that are never taxable or tax deductible. 
Tax provisions are included in current liabilities. 
Interest and penalties on tax liabilities are 
provided for in the tax charge. The Group offsets, 
the current tax assets and liabilities (on a year 
on year basis) where it has a legally enforceable 
right and where it intends to settle such assets 
and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the 
assets and liabilities on net basis.
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
167
	
	
Deferred income tax is recognized using the 
balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary 
differences 
arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount in financial statements. 
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilized. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
where it is more likely than not that the assets will 
not be realised in the future.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred income tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
to be utilized.  Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
15.	 Borrowing Cost
 
 
General and specific borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets 
are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, 
during the period till all the activities necessary to 
prepare the Qualifying assets for its intended use 
or sale are complete during the period of time that 
is required to complete and prepare the assets 
for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
	
16.	 Segment Reporting
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision maker of the 
Parent Company.
	
17.	 Earnings Per Share
	
	
Basic earnings per shares are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. For the purpose 
of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net 
profit or loss for the period attributable to the 
equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period 
is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
	
18.	 Measurement of EBITDA
	
	
The group has opted to present earnings before 
interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) as a separate line item on 
the face of the Statement of Profit and Loss for 
the period. The Group measures EBITDA based 
on profit/(loss) from continuing operations.
	
19.	 Leases
	
	
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116-Leases using 
the modified retrospective method. The Group 
has applied the standard to its leases with the 
cumulative impact recognised on the date of 
initial application.
	
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for Land, Buildings and Plant 
& Machinery. The Group assesses whether a 
contract is or contains a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Group assesses whether:
	
	
(a)	 the contract involves the use of an 
identified asset
	
	
(b)	 the Group has substantially all of the 
economic benefits from use of the asset 
through the period of the lease and
	
	
(c)	
the 
Group 
has 
the 
right 
to 
direct 
the 
use 
of 
the 
asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, 
the Group recognises a right-of-use asset 
(“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a 
lessee, except for leases with a term of 
twelve months or less (short term leases) 
and leases of low value assets. For these 
short term and leases of low value assets, 
the Group recognises the lease payments 
as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
	
	
	
The 
right-of-use 
assets 
are 
initially 
recognised at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior 
to the commencement  date of the lease 
plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated from the commencement 
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.

Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
	
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates. The lease liability is 
subsequently remeasured by increasing the 
carrying amount to reflect interest on the 
lease liability, reducing the carrying amount 
to reflect the lease payments made. A lease 
liability is remeasured upon the occurrence 
of certain events such as a change in the 
lease term or a change in an index or rate 
used to determine lease payments. The 
remeasurement normally also adjusts the 
leased assets.
	
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet 
and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
	
20.	 Current / non current classification
	
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in 
the balance sheet based on current / non-
current classification.
	
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
	
-	
Expected to be realised or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle
	
	
-	
Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
	
-	
Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
	
	
-	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
 
 
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
A liability is current when:
	
	
-	
It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
	
	
-	
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
	
-	
It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
	
	
-	
There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
 
 
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-
current.
 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
	
21.	 Events after reporting date
	
	
Where events occurring after the Balance Sheet 
date provide evidence of conditions that existed 
at the end of the reporting period, the impact 
of such events is adjusted within the Financial 
Statements. Otherwise, events after the Balance 
Sheet date of material size or nature are 
only disclosed.
	
22.	 Provisions, 
Contingent 
Liabilities 
and 
Contingent Assets
	
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a 
past event, the group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation.
	
	
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived 
by the Group from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract.
	
	
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made 
where there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may probably not require an 
outflow of resources or an obligation for which 
the future outcome cannot be ascertained with 
reasonable certainty. When there is a possible 
or a present obligation where the likelihood of 
outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
	
	
Contingent assets are neither recognized nor 
disclosed in financial statements.

Plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement (subject to completion of five years of 
continuous employment), death, incapacitation or termination of employment that are based on last drawn salary 
and tenure of employment. Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial valuation on the 
reporting date.

D.	 Assumptions
 
With the objective of presenting the plan assets and plan liabilities of the defined benefits plans  at their fair value 
on the balance sheet, assumptions under Ind AS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
 I in Lakhs 
As at 
31st March, 2024
As at 
31st March, 2023
Financial Assumptions
Discount rate
7.08 to 7.12 %
7.34 to 7.38 %
Salary Escalation Rate
5.00%
5.00%
E.	 Sensitivity
	
The sensitivity of the overall plan liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are:
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in 
assumption
Increase in 
assumption
Decrease in 
assumption
Discount rate
1.00%
 93.70 
 116.96 
Salary Escalation Rate
1.00%
 115.56 
 94.09 
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is 
based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity 
to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the 
previous period.

41 Financial instruments
 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1.	
Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current 
liabilities, short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely 
due to short term maturities of these instruments.
2. 
Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Group based on parameters 
such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this  evaluation, allowances 
are taken to account for expected losses of these receivables. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments is not 
materially different from their carrying amounts.
	
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments 
by valuation technique:
	
Level 1:	 Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are 
observable, either directly or indirectly.
 
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based 
on observable market data.

Fair value estimation
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
(Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
•	
Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments
•	
Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
•	
Level 3: Inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is 
summarised below:

42	 Financial risk factors
 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, advances and  trade and other payables. 
The  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide to support its operations. 
The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that 
derive directly from its operations.
	
The Group’s activities exposes it to Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and Credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised as below.
(a)	 Liquidity risk
 
The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or  another financial asset. Liquidity risk management implies maintenance sufficient 
cash including availability of  funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet the 
obligations as and when due.

Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annual Report 2023-24
 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
short term and long term liabilities as and when due. Anticipated future cash flows are expected to be sufficient to 
meet the liquidity requirements of the Group.

(b)	 Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk,  currency risk and other 
price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk includes 
investment, deposits, foreign currency receivables and payables. The Group’s treasury team manages the Market 
risk, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management.
	
(i)	
Foreign currency risk
 
 
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group has foreign currency borrowing and trade payables and is 
therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk. The exchange rates have been volatile in the recent years and may 
continue to be volatile in the future. Hence the operating results and financials of the Group may be impacted 
due to volatility of the rupee against foreign currencies.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.  According to the Group, interest rate risk exposure is only for 
floating rate borrowings. The Group is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk, since the borrowings 
of the Group are on Fixed interest rate basis.
	
(iii)	 Commodity risk
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil. Volatility in Crude Oil prices, Currency 
fluctuation of Rupee vis-à-vis other prominent currencies coupled with demand–supply scenario in the world 
market affect the effective price and availability. The Group manages this risk by widening its source base, 
appropriate contracts and commitments and well planned procurement.
(c)	 Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily 
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and other financial instruments.
Credit risk is managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring 
the credit worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business.
