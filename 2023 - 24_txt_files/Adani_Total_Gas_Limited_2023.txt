Governance, leadership and oversight 
7. 	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
ATGL is joint venture company of Adani Group, India and Total Energies, France. ATGL strongly believes that 
embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles in its business operations is not only a 
responsibility but an essential part of our DNA. Adherence to these principles helps build resilience, transform 
culture and long-term value creation to systematically identify opportunities, manage risks, and secure the 
interest of all our stakeholders.  
	
In today’s world sustainability isn’t just an option; it’s a fundamental requirement. Sustainability is woven into 
the fabric of our values, emphasising environmental stewardship, social accountability, strong governance, and 
economic vitality at ATGL, corporate governance comprises rules, practices, processes, and policies by which 
the Company is managed. The spirit of governance balances the interests of all stakeholders (shareholders, 
management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government, and community). The result is that governance 
is not incidental but integral to the existence of the organisation. The Company’s governance practice is 
supported by committees (statutory committee and as well as non-statutory committees) to which certain 
Board responsibilities are delegated and these committees report to the Board.
	
Being in the business of natural gas distribution Safety of our people and public in general is immensely 
important for us. It is not just a priority, but a core value for us. Safety is one of our strong pillars of sustainability. 
We prioritise reducing carbon emissions by solarisation, reducing methane emissions, promoting renewable 
energy i.e. Bio-CNG and E-mobility.  ATGL has mapped all their GHG emissions and is continuously working to 
minimise it. Methane leak detection survey and repair has been conducted for all its MDPE network to reduce 
fugitive emissions of methane. ATGL has been Solarising all locations by putting rooftop solar plant. Energy 
efficiency audits have been conducted across all offices/ CGS/CNG stations and energy saving proposals are 
being implemented.  All these efforts would help to reduce GHG emission (both scope 1 &2) significantly.
	
We’re committed to social responsibility through various initiatives such as promoting health and safety, engaging 
with communities, fostering education, and championing diversity and inclusion. Our unique Greenmosphere 
initiative epitomises our dedication to creating a low-carbon society by mass plantation, spreading awareness 
among green millennium.
A Biodiversity Park (ATGL Forest) has been developed at Gota, Ahmedabad covering 10 acres of land, where more 
than 2 lakhs trees have been planted and created a oxygen park for city. Considering the climate change factor, 
ATGL has been working towards low carbon gas retail and initiated Bio gas, Electric vehicle charging and will 
explore blending Green Hydrogen pilot studies for future proofing its business.
	
Our overarching goal is to foster lasting economic prosperity while forging a sustainable and equitable future 
for everyone involved.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end

its operations. All the wastes are identified for recycling/disposing as per Pollution Control Board Norms
	
The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. The hazardous wastes 
are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and 
best industry practices. Hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner through authorised 
vendors for recycling as required by regulation. Category wise waste disposal has been briefed in principle 6. 
Apart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams scrap metal, packaging 
waste, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard, and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the 
generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible.
	
All our businesses are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible
4.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
1)	
Solarisation:
	
	
ATGL commissioned its first solar plant in its city gas station situated in Ramol, Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India) 
which yields 89 Kw of renewable energy every single day. Till date 51 sites of ATGL have the provision of PV 
panels yielding 898 Kw which will extended to more than 1.5 Mw in the coming year. The aim of the initiative 
is to minimise emissions.
	
2)	
Energy Audit:
	
	
27 Electrical Energy Audit has been performed across sites of ATGL (CNG stations, City Gas Stations 
and Offices). Each site was evaluated with an objective to conserve electricity. Several energy saving 
recommendations like Installation of LED lights, AC energy saver, Occupancy sensors, Timer etc are being 
implanted, based on their viability and feasibility. This initiative is being promoted to ATGL customers as well.
	
3)	
Decarbonisation of Fleets:
	
	
All ATGL owned and contracted transport including Transport LCV/HCV cascade, office, Area Emergency 
Office Vehicles have been converted from HSD to CNG. Around 380 of LCVs are now CNG powered. ATGL is 
exploring low carbon alternatives like E-Vehicles and Hydrogen powered trucks to substitute fossil fuels
	
	
This leap of ATGL is to minimise the predominant emissions.
	
4)	
Methane Leak Detection & Repair:
	
	
The Leak Detention and Repair (LDAR) programme was implemented to comply with environmental 
regulations for reducing the methane emissions into the environment. 3,376 km of leak detection study 
conducted at Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Khurja by Area Emergency office staffs and by an external Third party. 
The identified leaks are being fixed as Methane is 25 times higher in GHG emissions compared to CO2. 
This initiative was implemented to reduce minimise business’s emissions.

applicable regulation on natural resources, waste and land along with implementation of technologies to reduce 
specific waste generation and toxicity.
	
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner through authorised vendors for recycling as required by regulation.
	
We have replaced hazardous odorant Ethyl Mercaptant to less hazardous chemical Scentinel S20 as an Odorant 
We have adopted milkman concept (delivery through tanker on need basis) for delivery of our odorant chemical
