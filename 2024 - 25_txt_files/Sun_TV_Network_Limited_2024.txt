Given the nature of our business, opportunities for product reuse or recycling are inherently limited.  
 
 
However, the Company remains committed to responsible waste management and has adopted the 
 
 
following environmentally conscious practices across key waste categories:  
 
 
(a) Plastics (including packaging): The Company engages professional vendors to manage the 
 
 
 
segregation of wet and dry waste generated during operations. This waste is either composted or 
 
 
 
recycled using eco-friendly methods.  
 
 
(b) E-waste: Items such as computers, accessories, scanners, batteries, and air conditioners are 
 
 
 
categorized as e-waste and are responsibly disposed of through certiﬁed and registered e-waste  
 
 
 
management vendors. 
 
 
(c) Hazardous waste: As the Company’s  operations do not involve the handling or generation of hazardous 
 
 
 
waste, this category is not applicable. 
 
 
(d) Other waste:  No additional waste streams are generated apart from those listed above, reﬂecting the  
 
 
 
low-impact nature of our oﬃce-based operations.
