24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk, 
along with its financial implications, as per the following format:
	
Materiality assessment is the process of determining topics (issues) that can impact economic, environmental, social and governance 
attributes in banking operations. It has the potential to influence the decisions of stakeholders, who are willing to partner like 
customers, shareholders, lenders and investors. The preliminary step in materiality assessment is to identify and consult with the 
right set of stakeholders (or representatives) who can provide useful insights. The materiality assessment process includes –
a)	
Identification of sector specific material topics: The process involves identifying relevant peer companies across the banking 
sector and mapping standards like Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (‘UN SDGs’), 
International Integrated Reporting Council (‘IIRC’) requirements, to understand the appropriate material topics.
b)	
Identification of external stakeholders: The Bank assesses the impact of its banking operations on its investors, customers, 
employees, community, regulatory bodies, government, value chain partners, media, civil and societies to evaluate ways to further 
improve stakeholder value creation.
c)	
External stakeholder consultation: The Bank liaisons with external stakeholders and seeks their perception and comments on the 
identified material topics. Such material topics are further prioritized basis of the importance it holds to each stakeholder group and 
their feedback.
d)	
Prioritization of material topics relevant to the Bank: External stakeholder responses are first assessed and collated. The collated 
material topics are categorized into low, medium and high categories and finally the materiality map is finalized post consultation 
with the decision-making committee and senior leadership team.
	
The Bank remains committed towards implementing relevant policies to ensure responsible banking conduct and undertake required 
sustainability initiatives. Based on the prioritized material topics, the Bank has identified relevant risks and opportunities that are 
mentioned below. This report includes information, which is material to all stakeholders of the Bank, and it presents an overview of 
the Bank’s businesses and associated activities. The Bank discloses matters that substantially impact or affect the Bank’s ability to 
create value. To ensure effective mitigation of identified risks, the Bank carries out a materiality analysis, to identify topics material to 
the Bank and its stakeholders. The sensitivity of an issue to stakeholders and the Bank, in terms of importance, forms the basis of the 
materiality analysis, which in turn guides the processes for identifying, managing, and devising specific action plans for addressing 
these material aspects. Every material topic is taken into account, and the Bank has policies and procedures in place to address these 
topics in order to create sustainable growth and long-term value.

Financial Implications
1.
Climate 
Change 
Related Risks
Risk
•	
Climate-related risks refer to the 
potential risks that may arise from 
climate change or from efforts to 
mitigate climate change, its impact 
and the economic and financial 
consequences.
•	
It can impact the financial sector 
through two broad channels - physical 
risks and transition risks.
•	
Physical Risk: The physical impacts 
from climate change will feed through 
to an economy in a various ways, 
including damages to physical assets 
through extreme weather, reduced 
agricultural productivity, heat-related 
health and medical issues, and loss of 
biodiversity.
•	
Transition Risk: It refers to the 
risks arising from the process of 
adjustment towards a low-carbon 
economy. 
A 
range 
of 
factors 
influences this adjustment, including 
changes in climate related policies 
and regulations, the emergence 
of 
newer 
technologies, 
shifting 
sentiments 
and 
behaviour 
of 
customers. The process of transition, 
i.e., reducing carbon emissions may 
have a significant impact on the 
economy.
•	
The uncertainty about the timing 
and severity of climate related risk 
like physical risk and transition risk 
threatens the safety, soundness and 
resilience of regulated entities (REs) 
and in turn it affects the overall 
stability of the financial system.
•	
Financial, reputational, regulatory 
and market risk implications are 
becoming increasingly prominent 
with increased threat of climate 
change such as but not limited to 
floods, droughts, erratic rainfall, 
supply chain disruptions, change in 
market perception and shift towards 
more 
environmentally 
friendly 
products and services.
•	
The Bank has a robust governance 
structure to develop climate 
related risk mitigation strategy, 
ensure effective implementation 
of the identified levers and 
monitor 
performance 
against 
such risks at regular intervals.
•	
The Bank ensures that climate 
related risks like water risk 
assessment outcomes, emission 
and 
energy 
consumption 
portfolios are properly reflected 
in all financial decisions such 
as in Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment 
Process 
(ICAAP)* 
and conduct stress testing or 
vulnerability analysis.
	
*(ICAAP under Basel accord – a 
mechanism to ensure institutions 
strategic focus, business plan and 
internal procedures for ensuring 
adequate possession of long-
term capital resources to cover all 
material risks.)
•	
The Bank is deliberating to embark 
on a journey of advocating 
sustainability in its value chain, 
such as assessment of GHG 
emission footprint of its lending 
portfolio, 
lender’s 
customer 
targets and commitments on ESG 
resource optimization, evaluating 
quantum of collateral positioned 
in high-risk flood / drought 
prone areas, checking green 
building certifications of real 
estate portfolios, social inclusivity 
of corporates, SME & MSME 
customers.
•	
Within its operation, the Bank 
is considering greening of the 
branches 
and 
data 
centres, 
eliminating the use of paper 
in the operations, introducing 
option of e-receipts on registered 
mobile numbers at their ATMs, 
evaluating options of switching 
over to renewable energy for 
sourcing power gradually and 
future proofing operations against 
regulatory requirements.
Negative financial 
implications:
•	
Financial/Credit risk: 
Rising frequency and 
severity of extreme 
weather events can 
impair the value of 
assets held by the 
Banks’ customers, or 
impact supply chains 
affecting customers’ 
operations and 
profitability and lead 
to higher loan defaults 
and NPAs.
•	
Market risk: 
Increased volatility in 
investments because 
of shifts in investor 
preferences or climate 
induced adverse 
effects might lead 
to decline in lending 
portfolio valuation.
•	
Reputational risk: 
Failure to address the 
challenging climate 
change vulnerabilities 
will affect stakeholders’ 
trust resulting in loss of 
customer base.

Regulatory 
& Statutory 
Compliance
Risk
•	
Financial 
institutions 
face 
expanding regulatory and reporting 
requirements to ensure transparency 
in their operations for building 
stakeholder 
confidence 
and 
benchmarking themselves against 
the best practices in Corporate 
Governance.
•	
Growing footprint has accelerated 
the hiring process with increased 
manual interventions across various 
banking operations. Thus, there is 
risk of unintended slippages resulting 
in non-compliance.
•	
The Bank has a robust due 
diligence 
mechanism 
for 
monitoring 
transactions, 
performing customer background 
checks and evaluating all lending 
decisions for tackling litigation 
matters timely.
•	
Similarly, the Bank’s, processes, 
policies, 
procedures, 
systems 
and tools ensure that there are 
no regulatory non- compliances 
arising in its operations. The Bank 
also obliges with all statutory 
reporting requirements.
Negative financial 
implication:

regulatory laws may 
result in substantial fines, 
penalties and cause 
damage to the Bank’s 
reputation.
7.
Business 
Ethics & 
Governance
Risk
Corporate conduct and ethical practices 
are central to safeguard reputation and 
business success of financial institutions.
•	
By adopting a strong ethical 
culture, the Bank maintains its 
reputation as a trusted financial 
institution.
•	
Effective governance practices 
help in minimising its exposure to 
business and ethics related risks 
like fund embezzlement, insider 
trading and money laundering. 
The Bank takes control of their 
compliance 
mechanism 
and 
monitors performance diligently 
and periodically.
Negative financial 
implication:
•	
The Bank will incur 
legal expense resulting 
from breach of 
maintaining ethical and 
governance standards.
•	
Customer preference 
might get influenced if 
they perceive that the

diligence may result in 
higher fraud funding 
and greater loan 
defaults.
8.

The Bank has developed a robust 
crisis management framework to 
respond to trying situations and 
provide training to all executives, 
board 
members 
and 
key 
employees on how to tackle such 
situations.
Negative financial 
implication:

management practices 
might lead to unanticipated 
losses on account of 
market disruptions, change 
in policy, data service 
disruptions.
9.

Bank must comply with data protection 
and 
privacy 
regulations

that customer data is kept secure and 
confidential to avoid any penal measures 
such as fines, and penalties.

Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
As the economy progresses, we need to 
include weaker sections of the society. 
This section includes women, rural India, 
people moving up the economic ladder 
and people having new banking need; 
thus, these new segments will help to 
build tomorrow’s economy hence their 
needs should be addressed.
-
Positive financial 
implication:

financial products to 
individuals and businesses 
to those who are currently 
excluded from the

will provide deeper market 
penetration and will

growth potential.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets, and 
achievements
	
Dear Shareholders,
 	
The global banking sector is increasingly recognising the importance of ESG considerations in the operations, owing to its inherent 
risk mitigation, growth and innovation spurring capacity. During the climate conference, members of the Glasgow Financial Alliance 
for Net Zero (GFANZ), representing more than 450 of the world’s biggest banks and pension funds across 45 countries, committed 
to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The growing trends of green bonds, sustainability bonds, social & SDG bonds, ESG loans, and 
financed emissions have led to a significant revolution in sustainability-linked financial instruments. The Bank recognises that, in 
the Indian context, ESG considerations are still emerging and there is a need for greater awareness and action. Your Bank, however, 
remains focussed on being a part of the transformation such as enhanced regulatory stringency, greater investor enquiry on financial 
institution robustness and increased customer awareness on ESG products, among others.
	
The macroeconomic environment has become challenging as companies are paving their way into ESG transition. They are dealing 
with inflated prices of energy, carbon, and commodities over a longer period of time than first envisaged. The Bank is focussed on 
working on sustainable initiatives, investing in green energy, digitalisation, increasing energy efficiency, water conservation efforts, 
sustainable product design, improved human well-being and social equity. All of these initiatives are driving ‘greenflation’ (long-term 
structural inflationary pressures), which weighs on companies’ profit margins and is also challenging politics and society – especially 
when corporates are passing on their higher input costs to end consumers. Your Bank remains committed to providing the most 
optimum transition strategy to the stakeholders and lowering the pressure on access to capital and cost of capital advocating 
adherence to all regulatory requirements to ensure adequate liquidity in the economy.
	
As a responsible Bank, your Bank focuses on overcoming the challenges of affordability and reachability, and incentivising the 
unbanked, not-so-developed communities and promote financial literacy. The Bank prioritises the social and economic well-being of 
the stakeholders and thus offers various initiatives and programmes to support communities. The Bank takes pride in its commitment 
in upholding high standards of business responsibility and sustainability.
	
The Bank’s aim is to contribute responsibly towards the ESG transition journey by evaluating all significant environmental and social 
impact on its operations and incorporating the concept of sustainability in the Bank’s value chain. Such trends may include greater 
disclosures on non-financial products and other metrics, accounting for the quantum of purchased electricity, the use of diesel 
generator sets at branches, along with the use of paper in banking forms, statements, and value human capital. The Bank has 
embraced the era of digitalisation and has undertaken strategic initiatives to make processes more seamless, agile, and efficient. 
Moreover, as a responsible Indian corporate, the Bank has embarked on a journey towards Net Zero and is currently in the process 
of evaluating the baseline GHG emission and remodifying its strategies and processes to align with India’s commitment towards Net 
Zero Green House Gas (GHG) Emissions by 2070.
	
It is a great pleasure to announce the release of the Bank’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which is based on the 
prescribed SEBI guidelines and adheres to the core elements of the NGRBC principles. BRSR is the next step towards sensitising 
greater scrutiny of corporate sustainability efforts by investors, regulators, financial rating agencies and the broader public to assess 
the robustness of processes and procedures, internal control mechanism of non-financial performance. Having understood that, 
Bandhan Bank’s journey to become a responsible banker of the future focusses on ensuring all its stakeholders and value chain 
partners utilise natural resources in a manner that it creates value for the future generations.

(i) the Chief of Internal Vigilance (‘CIV’) and (ii) the Disciplinary Committee which bears the responsibility of (a) investigating any 
alleged or proven misconduct employees by an employee and (b) taking necessary punitive actions, respectively.
	
The Bank is extremely strict in taking measures against wrongdoings, misconduct and cases of bribery and corruption, adhering to 
its zero-tolerance practice. Furthermore, the CIV takes measures to prevent bribery by conducting periodic reviews and checks on 
high-value purchases made by the Bank, scrutinizing assets held or declared by senior management and employees and probing 
into any reported cases of conflicts of interest involving employees. These measures ensure 100% compliance from all employees, 
as the Bank strives towards zero cases of non-compliance. The CIV apprises the MD & CEO about the monthly vigilance activities and 
submits the report to the Audit Committee of the Board.

NA
NA
The Bank is a service provider and a regulated entity and operates as per the Banking 
Regulations. Therefore, the scope of Capex to improve environmental and social impacts is not 
material to the Bank. However, the Bank has taken several environmental and social initiatives, 
as mentioned below.
Environmental – The Bank has transitioned effectively into a digital banking ecosystem. This 
has helped the Bank in reducing its usage of paper across its branches and operations. The 
Bank has also invested in various innovative technologies and IT transformations across all 
its branches. The bank has launched a Fully Digital Saving Account Neo+. The pilot for Neo+ 
Account with vKYC has been launched in August 2022 across select branches and online 
customers. The Bank has also launched its all new Corporate Banking platform. Our new and 
improved CIB platform was launched in May 2022 and this platform has won the Award for 
‘Best Digital Channel/Platform Implementation’ (December 2022) by IBS Intelligence.
The energy efficient lighting system and water-saving technology have led to a reduction of 
power and water usage. The seamless transactions through mobile and net banking have led 
to reduction in commuting time to the branches, thereby considerably reducing vehicular 
emission and cost from commutation and energy consumption.
Social – The Bank has established banking outlets catering to the underbanked rural and 
semi-urban areas leading to greater financial inclusion in the remote areas. The Bank has 
brought banking to the doorsteps of marginalised and economically backward communities 
through these Business Units. The Bank has taken several initiatives of financial literacy and 
financial empowerment amongst vulnerable groups such as rural housewives, and women 
entrepreneurs, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access for all sections of society, to banking 
services.
During the pandemic and post-pandemic restrictions, many of the customers of your Bank lost 
their livelihoods, which made them financially vulnerable. To strengthen the customers, your 
Bank came up with products specifically designed for these situations and ensured that the 
customers get the maximum financial assistance during the toughest time in their lives.
To overcome digital-based challenges, the Bank is providing training to enhance customer 
awareness on the benefits of digital payments and various other aspects, such as seeding bank 
accounts with mobile numbers and Aadhaar.
During the FY under review, your Bank launched the first of its kind ‘Android PoS’, a testament 
to the commitment to providing innovative and customer-centric solutions to merchants and 
promoting digital payments in remote areas.
2.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
No. Owing to the nature of the banking products and services offered, sustainable sourcing may not be a significant material topic 
for the Bank. However, the Bank endeavours to integrate sustainability in the supply chain(s) for its products and services across its 
business portfolio.
	
The Bank’s supply chain includes outsourced agencies, third-party service providers, transporters, suppliers of materials and capital 
goods, franchisees, dealers and distributors. The Bank recognizes the need to work closely with the suppliers to reduce waste, 
improve efficiency and reduce carbon footprint and continuously work towards ensuring greater integration of environmental 
factors in its procurement practices.
	
The Bank has developed a dedicated policy on sustainable sourcing as part of its commitment to BRSR Principle 2. The policy 
encourages the Bank to raise awareness of supply chain members to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The CSR&SCB 
shall oversee the compliance with the policy.

(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging),
	
(b) 	 E-waste,
	
(c) 	 Hazardous waste, and
	
(d) 	 Other waste.
	
The products and services offered by the Bank do not entail the usage of a high quantum of plastic or any hazardous material. Hence, 
owing to the insignificant footprint, the reclamation for reusing and recycling is not material to the Bank.
a)	
Plastics – The plastic usage in the products is minimal, hence, reclamation of plastics is not applicable.
b)	
E-waste – E-waste generated from the banking operations across all offices and branches are responsibly disposed of by third-
party service providers.
c)	
Hazardous Waste – Owing to the nature of the operations as a banking facility, there isn’t much scope for the generation of 
hazardous waste from the Bank’s branches and offices that are owned and controlled by third parties.

Yes. The HR policy of the Bank incorporates the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) for 
addressing issues related to sexual harassment. An Internal Committee (IC) consisting of one Presiding 
Officer and three members is constituted at the head office to enquire into and provide redressal of 
Sexual Harassment complaints. The composition of the IC consists of at least one external member 
and one-half of the total member are women officials. In addition to POSH, the Bank has also built an 
in-house grievance redressal system and is available in the HRMS portal of the Bank. The grievance 
redressal mechanism lays down guidelines that need to be followed by the organization, which include 
the following:
Conflict Resolution
An employee who feels that he or she is being subjected to harassment should first, where possible, 
make his / her disapproval clearly known to the individual(s) concerned and ask that the behaviour be 
stopped. If there is no apparent change in the behaviour of the respondent, the employee concerned 
can make use of either an informal or formal resolution process for redressing their complaint.
Freedom from Retaliation
A person who in good faith brings a complaint of harassment against another person, shall not be 
subjected to any form of retaliation. The Bank prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a complaint 
in good faith, and retaliation in itself constitutes misconduct subject to disciplinary action. Discriminating 
against an employee who has made a complaint of harassment or deleteriously affecting the terms and 
conditions of employment or work environment of the employee will be construed as retaliation.
Confidentiality
All employees who are aware of a harassment complaint, or involved in its resolution, must recognize 
the seriousness of the situation and respect the sensitivity and confidentiality that must be accorded 
to the matter. The employees must refrain from discussing the complaint amongst themselves or with 
anyone who does not have a ‘need to know’. Every effort will be made to preserve the dignity and self-
respect of the parties to the complaint.
Action against false complaints
False or malicious complaints can seriously damage a person’s reputation, career, and relationships. If 
anyone makes a false or malicious complaint of harassment and it is so established after a thorough and 
proper investigation, the complainant will face disciplinary action, depending on the situation.

Completeness - understanding the stakeholders’ key concerns and expectations.
•	
Responsiveness - responding coherently and speedily to such issues and concerns.
	
The key stakeholder groups include the Central and State Governments, regulatory/statutory agencies, media, shareholders, clients, 
employees, local communities, channel partners, and suppliers. Attributes including dependency, accountability, immediacy, and 
influence are used to identify stakeholders. The engagement strategy recognizes the individuality and distinct set of priorities of each

day business and operations of the Bank. In view of the Bank’s sustainability objectives, business strategies, operational policies,

recommended the CSR programmes targeting societal development by conducting studies on CSR intervention area identification. 
Based on these studies, the curated CSR programmes are run by CSR Project Implementing Agency (‘PIA’).
	
Each programme of the PIA has been devised to bring about far-reaching effects in the fields of education, health, livelihood 
promotion, sustainable livelihood development, climate action, financial literacy, skill development and employment generation.
