Chairman’s 
Message
Dear shareholders,
H. V. Goenka
Chairman
H. V. Goenka
Chairman
Zensar rose to 
the challenge and 
strengthened its portfolio 
of innovative solutions 
while streamlining the 
cost structure to improve 
operating margins. This 
not only positioned us 
optimally to capitalize on 
emerging opportunities 
but also empowered our 
teams to evolve in line 
with a changing digital 
ecosystem. 
As we leverage our core capacities 
to shape the digital transformation 
of enterprises, we are determined to 
ensure service excellence and consistent 
value creation for stakeholders.
Ongoing macroeconomic 
uncertainties globally and a 
demanding business landscape 
characterized by decreased 
consumer spending, tested industry 
resilience to a fair degree in the past 
year. Zensar rose to the challenge 
and strengthened its portfolio 
of innovative solutions while 
streamlining the cost structure to 
improve operating margins. This 
not only positioned us optimally to 
capitalize on emerging opportunities 
but also empowered our teams 
to evolve in line with a changing 
digital ecosystem. 
Our dedication to client-centric 
practices, exemplified by our 
experience, engineering, and 
engagement approach, continued to 
yield promising results. Our ongoing 
conversations with clients reflect 
positivity, instilling confidence in our 
ability to achieve growth aligned with 
industry projections.
With ongoing efforts to foster growth 
and innovation, we are proactively 
multiskilling our people through 
our Service Line Academies as part 
of a talent transformation journey. 
These academies, established 
within our industry services groups, 
aim to upskill our people and help 
them quickly adapt to the digital 
ecosystem’s changing realities. 
We have successfully developed a 
robust talent pool of home-grown 
experts through immersive programs 
tailored to solution architecture, 
product, and program management. 
Additionally, our AI academy has 
played a pivotal role in empowering 
our engineers and data scientists 
with advanced skills to make the 
most of generative AI.
As a responsible organization, 
environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) initiatives are 
integral to our corporate ethos. 
During the year, our concerted 
efforts have enabled remarkable 
improvements across ESG 
parameters, recognized by rating 
agencies such as EcoVadis and the 
Corporate Sustainability Assessment 
by S&P Global as improvements 
in our ESG scores. Additionally, I 
am happy to announce our official 
commitment to align with the 
Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), reiterating our dedication 
to walk on a clearly defined 
pathway to mitigate the impacts of 
climate change and strengthen the 
foundation for a sustainable future.
Looking ahead, our proficiency in 
crafting new-age digital experiences 
and enhancing customer 
engagement continues to broaden 
our horizons and lend us the ability 
to deliver agile and impactful 
solutions. As we leverage our core 
capacities to shape the digital 
transformation of enterprises, we 
are determined to ensure service 
excellence and consistent value 
creation for stakeholders. With 
our eyes firmly fixed on strategic 
growth options, we continue to 
keep our doors open to acquisitions 
and partnerships. 
I would like to thank our clients and 
partners for their continued support 
and our esteemed shareholders for 
their trust in Zensar’s capabilities 
as we navigate the near-term 
challenges and together create 
a stronger Zensar.

In Conversation 
with the CEO and 
Managing Director
Dear shareholders,
Manish Tandon 
Chief Executive Officer 
and Managing Director
During the year under 
review, we were 
recognized for excellence 
across our capabilities. 
Of note is that we were 
selected as a Leader 
in Data and Analytics 
Services for Mid-Market 
Enterprises. 
In a nod to our technical marketing and 
consulting expertise, we were also chosen 
as an agency of record for a major global 
technology company. This broad-based 
acknowledgment speaks to our clients’ 
deep trust in us. 
It is an honor to present our Annual 
Report for FY 2024 on behalf of the 
Board of Directors. I am delighted 
to share that in a year marked by 
macroeconomic challenges, we 
have executed our strategy well and 
delivered a resilient performance. 
Operating in a dynamic market, 
we continued to evolve and adapt, 
positioning Zensar as a robust and 
agile player in the IT industry. 
We did this by embracing our 
core philosophy of experience-led 
everything, which emphasizes not 
just the technology behind our 
products and services, but also the 
people who use them. Anchored by 
our 3Es – experience, engineering, 
and engagement, this approach 
allows us to maintain an end-to-end 
focus on each client’s business, 
priorities, and users.
Despite its challenges, the current 
global economic landscape has 
presented notable potential for 
growth and innovation. While 
specific sectors, including BFSI, 
manufacturing, and consumer 
services, continue to face 
geopolitical and macroeconomic 
hurdles, we remain vigilant in 
collaborating with our clients and 
mitigating adverse impacts to seize 
emerging opportunities.
I am also pleased to report that 
our presence in Europe and South 
Africa has grown, marked by wins 
across existing and new clients. 
Our commitment to designing 
superior digital experiences and 
engineering solutions that drive 
client engagement continues 
to be well-received.
During the year under review, we 
were recognized for excellence 
across our capabilities. Of note is 
that we were selected as a Leader in 
Data and Analytics Services for Mid-
Market Enterprises. In a nod to our 
technical marketing and consulting 
expertise, we were also chosen as an 
agency of record for a major global 
technology company. This broad-
based acknowledgment speaks to 
our clients’ deep trust in us. 
Executing targeted 
strategies
To position ourselves as the 
preferred partner for our clients, we 
continue to diversify our customer 
base, broaden our market reach, and 
nurture enduring relationships. As 
we look ahead, we see the following 
strategies as drivers of future growth:
1.	
Focus on clients: Augmenting 
our focus on client-centricity, 
we have developed a robust 
go-to-market strategy that 
aligns with our 3Es – experience, 
engineering, and engagement.
2.	 Enhance sales: To continue 
boosting sales, we have 
established a new platform for 
the sales function, comprising 
strategic alliances, pre-sales, 
and inside sales operations. 
We are also making targeted 
efforts to foster strategic 
partnerships and leveraging 
leading cloud platforms to 
support sustained growth.
3.	 Expand service lines: We remain 
steadfast in our dedication 
to capturing both mind and 
market share through strategic 
investments in our service lines. 
We have added service lines with 
key offerings from enterprise-as-
a-service (ESAAS) and advanced 
engineering services (AES). 
4.	 Build capabilities: Transforming 
talent through advanced skill 
development remains a top 
priority. Throughout FY 2024, we 
launched immersive programs 
to enrich our employees’ 
abilities in critical domains 
such as solution architecture, 
product management, and 
program management.

Looking back at FY 2024
In FY 2024, our profitability 
surged despite a volatile macro 
environment. Our EBITDA margin 
has substantially improved year-on-
year, reaching 17.8% for FY 2024, and 
we are now investing in avenues for 
sustainable growth to maintain this 
momentum. These developments 
can be attributed to the successful 
implementation of cost optimization 
and operational efficiency programs.
Our year-on-year services revenue 
growth stands at 1.0% in US $ terms, 
with notable increases observed in 
the banking and finance services 
sectors, which grew by 9.3%. 
Additionally, our strong performance 
extends to crucial markets such as 
the UK, Europe, and South Africa, 
where we continue to experience 
robust growth. Our order wins 
remains healthy during FY 2024 
amounting to TCV (Total Contract 
Value) of USD 698 million, fueled 
by consistent acquisition of new 
clients, showing steady growth over 
the previous year. Additionally, client 
centricity remains a core tenet for 
us, and in FY 2024, we achieved 
our highest ever client satisfaction 
score. Our score surpassed the 
industry median and placed us 
in the top quartile.
Our sustainability journey
Through the fiscal year, we 
made significant strides in our 
sustainability efforts. Anchored 
by our environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) charter, we 
implemented multiple initiatives 
integrating innovation and 
technology as the engine to drive 
sustainability forward. With an 
emphasis on quantifiable change, we 
adopted sustainability measures like 
virtualisation, cloud migration, green-
labeled hardware procurement, and 
more effective energy management. 
We also substantially improved 
our energy consumption profile, 
adopting renewable energy options 
that increased our global share of 
green energy to 31.5% compared to 
18.0% in the prior year. 
For our employees, we launched 
various programs centered on 
holistic well-being as well as 
skill development in emerging 
technologies. These themes 
were also part of our community 
development initiatives promoting 
technology-based education and 
employment planning.  
Gaining the lead
Our objective is clear: We aim to 
rank in the top 25% of industry 
performers consistently. Each year, 
we redouble our efforts, diligently 
using innovative thinking and 
smart collaboration to achieve 
meaningful outcomes for our clients 
and ourselves. We recognize that 
our success is intrinsically linked 
to that of our clients, so ensuring 
client-centricity remains our 
foremost priority. 
As we advance, we will invest in our 
long-term growth by continually 
expanding our reach, refining our 
services, and building future-ready 
talent. Embracing experience-
led everything as our guiding 
principle, we are poised to navigate 
challenges, seize opportunities, and 
deliver unparalleled experiences 
and solutions that are value-
driven, environmentally conscious, 
and human-centered.
In closing, I extend my heartfelt 
gratitude to our valued partners, 
patrons, and customers, as well 
as the communities in which we 
operate. Your cooperation and 
trust are instrumental in driving 
our success. I would also like to 
thank my colleagues whose shared 
commitment to customer-centricity 
enables us to thrive.

Chief Executive Officer and

Governance
Sound governance in word and deed
Adhering to a robust corporate governance framework, our 
governance practices at Zensar ensure that we uphold the values of 
accountability, transparency, and fairness across the board. We have a 
decision-making process rooted in empowerment and meritocracy — 
which further helps us cultivate an organizational culture that fosters 
strong stakeholder stewardship. This approach has enabled us to 
ascertain the successful execution of our strategies, compliance, risk 
management, and sustainability.
Our corporate governance framework
Board diversity and 
independence
Our Board’s composition reflects 
a blend of independence, 
strong competencies,  diversity, 
leveraging varied perspectives, and 
encouraging innovation, which, in 
turn, improves decision-making 
processes. Board diversity plays a 
critical role in improving corporate 
governance and effective decision-
making due to the diverse nature 
of perspectives, experiences, and 
backgrounds. Regular monitoring 
by Board members ensures that 
our governance framework is 
consistently updated to comply 
with regulatory changes and 
adapt to the evolving business 
landscape. The active engagement 
of Independent Directors with 
impartial views significantly bolsters 
our governance while steering the 
organization. The role of the Board, 
with broader industry perspectives in 
approving policies and supervision 
of implementation by the 
Management, remains vital from a 
governance perspective. 
Operating ethically, and 
ensuring transparency and 
compliance
We have instituted a comprehensive 
set of policies and procedures, to 
ensure adherence to all applicable 
laws and regulations globally. 
These policies are aimed at 
preventing corruption, combating 
money laundering, and ensuring 
data privacy. Our approach also 
encompasses regular training 
and effective communication to 
foster a deep understanding and 
commitment to these principles 
among all employees.
To abide by the highest standards 
of integrity, we also have in place 
an internal audit mechanism for 
reporting and continuous monitoring 
of the effectiveness of relevant 
policies and standards.
Adhering to policies and 
standards
Our dedication to ethical conduct 
is evident in our ongoing efforts to 
sensitize employees about various 
facets of the same. Through regular 
updates, training, and the active 
participation of senior executives, we 
reinforce the importance of adhering 
to our code of ethics and company 
standards. 
A structured disciplinary process, 
coupled with continuous monitoring 
and periodic policy reviews, ensures 
that our governance practices 
remain effective and aligned with 
our core values. Employees can 
anonymously report any suspected 
wrongdoing or concerns through 
different channels, including a 
whistleblower mechanism. We 
ensure confidentiality and protect 
those who report potential breaches. 
Consistently improving our 
policies
Our approach to policy development 
involves identifying areas for 
improvement by engaging with 
relevant stakeholders, ensuring 
clear communication, and providing 
the requisite training. This dynamic 
process enables us to effectively 
adapt to changing requirements 
and feedback as well as implement 
policies that support a high-
performance work environment. We 
believe that there is always room for 
improvement. In line with this, we 
periodically update our policies and 
monitor our compliance with best 
practices.
Effective ESG monitoring
Zensar has a Chief Sustainability 
Officer (CSO) to govern the ESG 
charter, who reports directly to the 
Senior management and Board 
level sustainability committee. The 
Board has constituted a dedicated 
Sustainability and Corporate 
Social Responsibility (SCSR) 
Committee that plays a pivotal 
role in formulating and reviewing 
our sustainability policy. This 
Committee is also responsible for 
supervising that the operations align 
with environmental, social, and 
governance principles. By regularly 
reviewing our sustainability goals 
and strategies, the Committee helps 
to ensure that we follow the set ESG 
charter and underlying ecosystem.

Becoming an  employer

Empowering policies and practices
Diverse leadership
Diversity in hiring 
Embracing diversity, 
equity, and inclusion
Our targeted initiatives include:
We aim to adapt to a dynamic 
work culture that champions 
innovation, integrity, and 
inclusivity. To achieve this 
objective, we strive to create a 
motivated workforce that remains 
committed to fulfil organizational 
objectives. Our Happiness 
Framework goes beyond 
traditional surveys. It measures 
well-being across six key areas  of 
work-life, connectedness, growth, 
value, culture, and purpose, 
fostering a work environment 
where everyone feels a sense of 
value. This, in turn, significantly 
enhances employee engagement 
and provides insights into 
our team’s overall growth and 
passion for their work.
We have introduced a Chief Listening 
Officer, a generative AI-enabled tool, 
to enhance our understanding and 
responsiveness to employee needs. 
Additionally, we have doubled our 
investment in employee engagement 
to enhance productivity and ensure 
the well-being of our people.  
We have overhauled our people 
policies and practices to remain 
relevant and create a favorable 
environment for our people. From 
improving our grievance redressal 
mechanisms to introducing new 
platforms like the Grievance Council 
We strive to create a leadership 
cadre that mirrors the diverse 
communities we serve. Our Global 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(DE&I) Council and employee 
resource groups embody our 
strategic approach to leadership 
diversity. This Council, guided by an 
Advisory Board, is instrumental in 
implementing our diversity strategy 
and monitoring progress across 
the organization. 
We strive to be an equal opportunity 
employer and aim to conduct merit-
based recruitments. Our Zenrich 
program encourages referrals 
from existing employees and 
aligns with our goal of achieving 
35% workforce diversity by FY27. 
Additionally, our ‘Returnee Program 
for Women in Tech’ focuses on 
hiring and grooming women for 
leadership roles, reflecting our 
commitment to gender equality in 
the technology sector. 
At Zensar, we encourage diversity, 
equity, and inclusion. It allows us to 
create equal opportunities for people 
from different backgrounds. Besides, 
it enables us to benefit from diverse 
perspectives that lend a competitive 
edge to our offerings.  
Our CEO Statement of Support 
endorses the UN Women’s 
Empowerment Principles, guiding us 
to ensure inclusivity and sustainability 
across all our initiatives. We embrace 
the seven steps outlined by UN 
Women, benefiting not only women, 
but inclusion of all diversities.

In a rapidly transforming digital

importance on attracting and 
nurturing talent adept at steering

We aim to fortify our leadership

we offer opportunities for enrolling 
in various courses focused on

We continue to focus on accelerated

identifying critical positions and 
potential leaders through a rigorous 
process. This effort is enhanced by 
ongoing reviews of development 
plans for successors, ensuring 
they align with strategic roles. 
Furthermore, the ability of our 
leaders to transition seamlessly 
across different functions has 
been a focal point.
Through our comprehensive 
Organization Management Review 
(OMR), conducted annually, we have 
successfully identified and mapped 
the development needs of our 
leaders across all levels, from Vice 
Presidents and above, to specific 
units requiring specialized attention. 
This extensive analysis, incorporating 
feedback from various channels 
through appraisals, development 
centers and 360-degree reviews, 
has culminated in the development 
of personalized, long-term action 
plans for each identified leader, 
spanning over the course of 
the next two years.
At Zensar, we are committed to 
upholding human rights, ensuring 
every individual is treated with 
the utmost respect, fairness, and 
dignity. We operate with integrity 
and responsibility, recognizing the 
significance of human rights in our 
business practices. Our collaboration 
with UN agencies and international 
organizations underscores our 
dedication to inclusive practices, 
earning us accolades for advancing 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) 5 and 10 — gender equality 
and reduced inequalities.
As signatories of the UN Global 
Compact, we embed its principles 
into our core strategies, operations, 
and culture, promoting human 
dignity, ethical conduct, and 
sustainable resource use. 
We recognize the rights of 
our employees to assemble, 
communicate, and form associations, 
respecting their choices within our 
organizational framework. Through 
Internal Associate Resource Groups 
and adherence to local laws, we 
ensure collective representation 
and foster an environment of 
inclusivity and respect.
At Zensar, we believe in empowering 
our employees to take charge of their 
professional development, nurturing 
a culture that celebrates continuous 
learning as a cornerstone of our 
Employee Value Proposition (EVP). 
We place a strong emphasis on skill 
enhancement and career growth, 
adopting innovative approaches 
such as ‘gamified learning’. This 
includes ideathons, hackathons, 
innovation challenges, and design 
thinking workshops, all aimed at 
disrupting traditional thinking and 
developing creative solutions.
This program prepares new 
graduates for corporate life, covering 
essential skills like teamwork and 
communication, through a two-day 
immersive experience.
ZenLearn is an adaptive learning 
platform offering a variety of 
resources like courses, videos, and 
eBooks that can be accessed from 
any device. It supports continuous 
and personalized learning.
Focused on vital soft skills and 
behavioral competencies, these 
programs offer practical, expert-led 
training sessions in both live and 
virtual formats, emphasizing real-
world applications.
ZenMasters are internal leaders 
and top performers who facilitate 
learning and share knowledge to 
enhance the organization’s training 
capabilities and customize content 
for specific needs.
DAPs are personalized learning 
paths that align with project needs 
and client-specific requirements, 
leveraging on-the-job experiences 
for practical skill development.
Recognizing the diverse needs of our 
employees, we conducted weekly 
wellness sessions via MS Teams 
and Zoom, covering a wide range 
of topics from stress management 
to financial planning. To ensure 
employee wellness, we also initiated 
yoga sessions at our offices.
We have implemented a well-
defined risk assessment process 
for identifying potential hazards 
at the workplace and developed 
measures to mitigate them. This 
year, we have made significant 
strides in addressing ergonomics-
related health issues, such as dry 
eye syndrome and carpal tunnel 
syndrome, through targeted 
awareness and wellness sessions. 
Additionally, our selection criteria 
for office furniture and adherence to 
health and safety checklists minimize 
workplace hazards. 
Our eLearning model for employees, 
coupled with regular evacuation 
and fire safety drills, prepares 
our people to effectively respond 
to emergencies. Additionally, 
we conduct monthly awareness 
sessions and adhere to specialized 
training schedules for our 
support staff, emphasizing the 
importance of safety.
Understanding the importance of 
regular health checks, we revised 
our Annual Health Check-up Program 
by lowering the eligibility age from 
40 to 35 years. This step leads to 
early detection and prevention of 
several health issues and provides 
our people access to necessary 
healthcare services. The availability 
of in-house doctors across all 
locations ensures timely medical 
advice and intervention.
At Zensar, we believe in nurturing 
talent and encouraging people 
to reach their full potential. It not 
only ensures professional growth 
but also acts as a precursor for 
holistic development.

Unlocking potential with 
career development
Performance management
We have a diverse array of initiatives 
that cater to different learning styles 
and career aspirations, including 
role-specific development and 
specialization opportunities. 
In the last fiscal year, we shifted 
our focus toward qualitative and 
developmental feedback as part 
of our performance management 
framework. To ensure timely 
feedback for our employees, we 
introduced project end appraisals in 
the second half of FY24.
Special consideration was given to 
those returning from parental leaves, 
ensuring fairness and inclusion. 
Through our dashboards, we are 
trying to eliminate the unconscious 
bias of managers and ensure they 
maintain fairness in performance 
reviews of employees irrespective of 
their geographical locations, grades, 
skillsets, genders, etc.
At Zensar, we are facilitating 
professional growth and global 
exposure for our employees. Our 
dedicated Global Mobility team 
ensures seamless transitions 
for employees to international 
client locations, adhering to each 
country’s immigration laws. This 
process includes visa filing, work 
permit stamping, and relocation 
benefits, alongside country-
specific inductions. 
Managers were encouraged 
to engage in open discussions 
with their teams, focusing on 
‘What went well’ and ‘What could 
have been done better’, thereby 
facilitating a more transparent 
and supportive environment.
To support this shift, we 
implemented a series of 
orientation sessions for 
managers. These sessions were 
designed to equip leaders with 
the skills necessary to deliver 
effective feedback, tailored 
to positive achievements and 
areas of improvement. The 
objective was to offer feedback 
that was not only affirming but 
also constructive.
Recent key initiatives include:
	 Automation of the 
Global Mobility function 
across all locations
	 In-house management of 
work permit applications 
for cost efficiency
	 Streamlining of mobility and 
immigration policies

and recognition to manage talent.
Our robust Assessment Center, 
featuring advanced tools like 
TechGig, serves as a vital 
mechanism for identifying individual 
competencies and areas of 
improvement. This platform enables 
us to identify specific skill gaps and 
facilitates targeted interventions 
through our training programs.
Feedback from managers on skill 
development and performance is 
crucial for evaluating the success of 
training. It enhances performance 
and improves skillsets.
Key initiatives:
	 Introduction of flexi-benefits 
to cater to our multi-
generational workforce
	 Creating a development 
framework that takes into 
account wellness aspects as well
	 Delivering wellness propositions 
using gamified solutions 
and behavioral nudges
	 Leveraging Gen AI to deliver an 
engaging recognition offering
	 Assessing the impact of

engagement, and retention
	 Revamping job architectures 
and our PPP (policies, 
processes, people) ecosystem
Development Action Plan (DAP)
All internal assessments are 
linked directly to Development 
Action Plans (DAPs). It enables 
personalized learning paths with 
a collaborative dialog between 
employees and their managers. 
Regular reviews and tracking 
of employees’ progress against 
goals and milestones outlined in 
their DAPs provide insights into 
the effectiveness of the training 
programs. The infusion of data-
driven insights from performance 
assessments into the DAP process 
has been instrumental in identifying 
precise skill gaps, thus helping in the 
development of customized plans 
that benefit individuals as well as 
the organization.

Long-term priorities
Brand building
Improving brand 
awareness
At Zensar, we understand that our 
intellectual capital - our brand, our 
knowledge, and our people - is at the 
core of our competitive advantage.  
Our commitment to improving brand 
awareness during the year was 
focused on three key areas:
We aim to make significant strides in enhancing our brand visibility and 
creating brand ambassadors, driven by a multifaceted strategy aimed at 
amplifying our presence internally and externally.
1 	 Website campaigns
Our website served as the primary 
touchpoint for stakeholders, 
showcasing our achievements in 
events, success stories, project wins, 
and awards.
2 	 Thought leadership 
campaigns
Through a series of campaigns, we 
highlighted our retail expertise and 
CSR initiatives, led by RPG Group 
leaders.
3 	 Corporate branding efforts
By revamping our brand videos to 
feature our leaders and employees, 
we reinforced our foundational 
belief in prioritizing people. It further 
strengthened our brand appeal.
Empowering informed 
advocacy
By engaging with industry 
leaders through initiatives such 
as Lunch and Learns, joint go-to-
market strategies, and prominent 
participation in industry events, 
we will not only bolster our 
brand’s visibility but will also 
position ourselves as thought 
leaders. Our active engagement 
in responding to RFIs (requests 
for information) and securing key 
reports will further cement our 
reputation as a trusted advisor 
in the marketplace.
Hyper-personalization for 
high-value segments
We will tailor targeted 
campaigns for high-value 
segments, which will enable 
us to demonstrate a deep 
understanding of our clients’ 
unique needs, thereby 
enhancing our brand’s 
value proposition.
Cultivating leadership 
connections
We will leverage the power 
of storytelling in our 
communications, creating 
emotional resonance that 
strengthens our brand appeal. 
Through these narratives, 
our leadership will build and 
maintain influential connections 
with Third-Party Administrators 
(TPAs) and industry influencers.
Building internal brand 
champions
Through comprehensive 
internal training programs on 
topics like ESG (Environmental, 
Social, and Governance), 
Generative AI, and Diversity, 
Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), we 
will empower our employees 
to become knowledgeable 
brand advocates. This initiative 
will not only amplify our brand 
message but will also cultivate 
a unified voice that resonates 
internally and externally.
	 Increased website traffic 
	 Generated notable 
number of Marketing 
Qualified Leads (MQLs)
	 Increased engagement with 
the industry through thought 
leadership articles, fireside 
chats and participation in 
partner events like Re-invent
	 Recognized 
in Analyst Awards 
	 Improved performance 
in surveys conducted by 
major analyst firms such 
as ISG, Avasant, Everest 
Group, and Gartner

People-driven innovation
Innovation framework
Our commitment to fostering an 
environment that rewards creativity 
and new ideas has enabled us to 
focus on research-driven solutions 
that not only meet but exceed 
client expectations. This ethos of 
innovation is cultivated through 
a robust framework designed to 
encourage our employees to explore, 
learn, and apply their knowledge to 
solve real issues.
By establishing a robust framework 
that rewards creativity and practical 
innovation, we have cultivated a 
workspace where every challenge 
is met with a forward-thinking 
solution. Our approach to workforce 
transformation is centered on 
cultivating a diversified skill set 
among our employees. It includes:
Our innovation framework is 
engineered to demonstrate our 
efficiency. By participating in 
technology forums, including 
talks and paper presentations, we 
interact with thought leaders and 
the broader technology community. 
Furthermore, our in-house asset 
development capability enables us to 
offer competitive pricing and scale 
solutions swiftly.
We have implemented a Continuous 
Listening Score system to capture 
client feedback on a quarterly basis, 
aligning our innovations directly 
with client needs and elevating the 
value of our solutions.
Developing I, T, and Pi-shaped 
professionals
We prioritize depth and breadth 
in our talent development 
programs. By nurturing deep skills 
in specific domains (I-shaped), 
broad understanding with expert 
knowledge in one area (T-shaped), 
and dual deep expertise with broad 
interdisciplinary knowledge (Pi-
shaped), we develop versatile and 
highly capable teams.
Embracing new technologies
In a rapidly evolving industry, 
relevance is synonymous with 
adaptability. Through in-house 
training and development of 
practical assets, we empower our 
workforce to not just understand 
but innovate with the help of latest 
technological advancements.
Knowledge sharing and 
continuous learning
Our commitment to intellectual 
growth extends beyond formal 
training. Regular knowledge-sharing 
sessions, mentorship programs, and 
opportunities for research foster a 
culture of continuous learning and 
intellectual curiosity.

Zensar Velocity Stack
The Zensar Velocity Stack 
encompasses reusable components, 
reference architectures, and 
solutions. Used for different projects, 
it facilitates a seamless flow of 
real-world feedback through our 
communities and guilds, enabling 
us to refine and strengthen our 
intellectual property. This iterative 
process not only enhances the 
solutions we offer but also amplifies 
the value delivered to our clients.
Streamlining innovation
We have built a platform where we 
can track ideas from their ideation 
stage to the minimum viable 
product (MVP) stage to translate 
ideas into action.
This journey from concept to 
creation is streamlined through a 
four-step methodology:
	 Idea submission
	 Idea discovery
	 Proof of concept (PoC)
	 MVP development
Each stage involves key stakeholders 
such as idea owners, vertical heads, 
the funding board, technical teams, 
and the steering committee, thereby 
creating a rich ecosystem of diverse 
insights and expertise.
Our system is underpinned by a 
rigorous, workflow-based decision-
making protocol, granting our 
leadership teams the authority to 
evaluate the progression of ideas. 
This ensures that initiatives with the 
highest potential for impact and 
innovation reach fruition. 
Innovation festival
The RPG Innovation Festival is 
a flagship initiative at both the 
Company and Group level that 
significantly enhances our innovation 
quotient. Spearheaded by the Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO), this 
systematic effort not only fosters 
a culture of creativity and forward-
thinking but also culminates in 
the filing of patents for the most 
promising ideas and solutions. The 
festival features multiple rounds 
of evaluation by diverse panels, 
providing employees with a unique 
opportunity to present their 
innovative concepts directly to the 
top management. Furthermore, 
we leverage crowd sourcing to tap 
into the collective intelligence of 
our workforce, running hackathons, 
ideathons, and innovation festivals 
aimed at harvesting a wide array of 
new ideas and solutions.
Guilds and communities
We place a strong emphasis on 
knowledge sharing, both internally 
and with external stakeholders, 
including clients and academia. This 
exchange of insights is pivotal in co-
creating and co-owning intellectual 
property (IP), products, services, and 
solutions. By leveraging synergies 
with technology providers, vendors, 
and startups, we are able to deliver 
impactful outcomes. We encourage 
iterative experimentation and value 
feedback from members throughout 
the innovation life cycle. All service 
lines and industry solution groups 
within Zensar have developed mature 
guilds and communities focused on 
the latest offerings in their respective 
domains. These groups regularly 
engage in “cadence connects” – 
sessions dedicated to discussing 
initiatives and IP enhancement 
projects, identifying resources for 
project execution.

Environmental 
Management System
We have taken significant strides 
toward minimizing our environmental 
impact, integrating sustainable 
practices across our infrastructure. 
All new office sites are recognized 
with the IGBC Green Interior 
Platinum Rating, highlighting our 
commitment to energy-efficient 
architectural designs.
Our efforts are not limited to 
new offices; upgrades to existing 
facilities are also aligned with 
stringent environmental standards.  
Our proactive approach has also 
translated into the implementation 
of energy-efficient IT infrastructure. 
Besides, we have reduced energy 
consumption by 4% at all India 
locations through improved building 
envelopes, optimized lighting, and 
air conditioning systems. 
Notably, our Cessna and EON-II 
facilities have already earned an 
IGBC Platinum Green Interiors 
certification, and plans are underway 
to add another similarly certified 
office by next year.
We have implemented significant 
energy conservation measures and 
developed a systematic approach to 
prioritize our focus areas. 
	 Identifying the top three 
highest energy-consuming 
assets across all loads
	 Determining if specific 
equipment, infrastructure, 
building, or floor is 
being used exclusively
	 Noting any changes or 
increases in the occupancy of 
a floor or building
	 Assessing the top three 
energy-consuming pieces of 
infrastructure or equipment from 
existing inventory
Through this strategic approach, we 
established a baseline and set targets 
to reduce energy consumption. An 
in-depth study has been carried out 
for the higher energy consumption 
assets, and appropriate actions 
were implemented to get optimum 
use and ensure the conservation 
of energy without affecting the 
required output. Inefficient assets 
are being replaced, upgraded, and 
retrofitted with more energy-efficient 
alternative equipment. Continuous 
monitoring, regular evaluations, and 
proactive actions have significantly 
contributed to our energy-saving 
efforts. Additionally, we optimized 
seat allocations, ensuring that areas 
with 50% occupancy remained 
operational, and relocated 
employees from less occupied areas.

opted for 100% LED lights and 
precise control of air conditioning 
operations, that significantly 
minimize our ecological footprint.  
Our commitment to sustainability is evident across our global operations, 
with a major focus on optimizing energy usage. Notably, the Pune campus 
accounts for 57% of Zensar’s total energy footprint, with additional 
contributions of 27% from other leased offices in India and 16% from 
overseas facilities. We will continue to focus on a range of energy 
conservation measures, including retrofits, infrastructure upgrades, 
automation, and stringent operational controls aimed at reducing energy 
consumption across our facilities.
Chiller system 
integration
The Fuji and Rockies buildings 
at the Pune campus had 
independent HVAC chiller 
systems, requiring operation of 
both chillers due to customer-
specific network needs, leading 
to high energy use.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
By integrating the chilled water 
pipelines between the two 
buildings and operating a single 
chiller from the Fuji building, 
the initiative now supports 
the cooling requirements 
of both buildings with the 
flexibility for independent 
operation when necessary, 
resulting in an estimated annual 
saving of 75,000 kWh.
Air handling units retrofit 
Air handling units, particularly 
AC fans, consume significant 
amount of energy in commercial 
buildings, accounting for 50% of 
HVAC energy usage.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
The transition to electronically 
commutated (EC) fans from 
conventional fans achieved 
more than 57% energy savings, 
reducing annual energy 
consumption by 9,361 kWh.
Energy-efficient water 
pump systems
The existing water pumps were 
outdated and inefficient, designed 
for past operational requirements.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
Redesigning and replacing these 
with modern, energy-efficient 
pumps tailored to current needs 
resulted in an annual energy 
savings of 20,142 kWh.
Sensor controls in HVAC 
units
The VRV-based HVAC systems 
used at Zensar had multi-split and 
cassette units running continuously, 
often without occupancy, leading to 
unnecessary energy consumption.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
Integrating these units with 
occupancy and motion sensors 
to automatically turn off when 
not in use has saved 10%-
20% of the energy typically 
consumed by these systems.
Replacement of air-
conditioning systems
Different areas within the campus 
had varied cooling requirements, 
with some old AC systems being 
inefficient and oversized.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
By replacing and isolating specific 
zones, particularly isolating the 
UPS and panel room, the initiative 
resulted in cooling efficiency and 
in some cases, resulted in the use 
of optimally sized AC units. These 
efforts saved a total of 17,832 
kWh energy annually.
Adapting air-conditioning 
strategies
The shift to hybrid working models 
affected daily office occupancy, 
making continuous operation 
of central air conditioning 
systems inefficient.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
Adaptive use of independent AC 
units in key areas reduced reliance 
on central systems, achieving 
savings of 7,434 kWh annually.
Optimizing UPS systems 
With a reduced need for large UPS 
systems due to the adoption of 
laptops with built-in batteries and 
consolidation of office spaces, 
existing UPS systems were 
oversized and inefficient.
 Upgrades  
 implemented 
Removal of unnecessary UPS 
capacity and the shift to stabilized 
raw power for workstations saved 
additional power consumption, 
contributing to overall 
energy efficiency.
Some of the energy-efficiency initiatives 
undertaken at the Pune campus:
Energy-efficient data centers
Our efforts to enhance data center 
efficiency have resulted in significant 
power consumption reduction. By 
implementation of virtualisation 
technologies, implementation of 
hot/cold aisles, and upgradation 
of IT hardware, we have enhanced 
the efficiency of our data centers. 
It has also resulted in considerable 
power savings. Our operational 
infrastructure has also been 
optimized to enhance energy 
efficiency. Besides, to save energy, 
we have implemented policies to 
ensure optimum usage of laptops 
and monitors during idle periods.

Use of renewable energy
Encouraging recycling
Our renewable energy initiatives 
have achieved notable progress, 
particularly in reducing reliance on 
fossil fuels and promoting green 
energy solutions. At our Pune 
campus, a rooftop solar plant with a 
capacity of 350 kWp is now fulfilling 
approximately 16% of our total power 
needs. Additionally, the use of solar 
water heaters for vessel cleaning 
has drastically reduced the energy 
required for heating water.
Our investment in renewable energy 
sources, such as rooftop solar power, 
green energy procurement, and 
solar water heaters, continues to 
expand. In FY24, the contribution 
of renewable energy reached 31.5% 
across our offices. Furthermore, the 
integration of 70% of CNG cabs into 
our fleet has substantially cut down 
our fuel requirements.
Anchored in our commitment to 
sustainability, we implement the 3-R 
philosophy of Reduce, Reuse, and 
Recycle across all our operations. 
This holistic approach enables 
us to manage waste responsibly 
and significantly minimize our 
environmental imprint.
As part of our broader waste 
reduction strategy, we have 
introduced an Organic Waste 
Converter (OWC) at our Pune owned 
facilities. It recycles waste generated 
from our offices and converts it into 
compost for agricultural use. By 
doing so, we not only reduce the 
volume of waste sent to landfills but 
also contribute to the regeneration 
of soil health, closing the loop on our 
ecological footprint.

The OWC system, installed in a 650 sq ft area within the green belt, 
has the capacity to process 500 kg of biodegradable waste daily. 
This system first shreds the waste, then mixes it in the composter, 
and finally cures it on racks, significantly reducing the composting 
process from the traditional 130-150 days to just 20 days. 
	 No biodegradable waste disposed of outside the campus.
	 Monthly production of 200 kg of compost, achieved even at 25% 
maximum occupancy.
	 Streamlined waste management processes through the initiative.
	 Efficient use of space, with only 650 sq ft utilized versus the 
typical 1900 sq ft required.

Electronic waste poses a unique challenge to the environment. As a result, we 
remain mindful of its proper disposal and handling. We have taken decisive 
steps by diverting over 1,133 end-user assets to government-authorized 
e-waste vendors for their safe disposal. Through these efforts, the recovery of 
valuable materials that can be repurposed takes place, thereby reducing the 
demand for new raw materials and lessening our environmental impact. 
We prioritize air quality monitoring 
as a critical measure for enhancing 
air quality, safeguarding 
community health, and adhering 
to environmental regulations. 
We collaborate exclusively with 
vendors accredited by the National 
Accreditation Board for Testing and 
Calibration Laboratories (NABL) in 
accordance with ISO 17025:2017 
standards for indoor air quality 
* We engaged with a third party to validate GHG inventory for our SBTi commitment which led to some key updates including:
	 Revised calculation factor affecting Scope 2 emissions 
	 Expanded data inclusion for stationary combustion in Scope 1
	 Extending coverage beyond business travel and employee commute to all relevant IT industry parameters, expecting a substantial rise in 
Scope 3 emissions. 
Due to these updates, the SBTi baseline year was shifted from FY19 to FY23.

Encouraging water 
stewardship
We operate in diverse regions, each 
with its own set of water-related 
challenges, which makes effective 
water management not only a 
priority but a necessity for us. To 
address these challenges, we have 
implemented several targeted water 
conservation measures. 
Our efforts are underpinned by the 
installation of sensor-based taps, 
which help control water waste 
significantly. These advanced 
fixtures reduce water usage by 
approximately 50% compared to 
traditional taps, owing to integrated 
aerators that also help manage flow 
rates efficiently.
Our proactive approach extends 
to our ground operations as well, 
where we have introduced drip 
and sprinkler irrigation systems for 
landscaping. These systems are 
designed to achieve up to 30% water 
savings over traditional watering 
methods. Furthermore, we have 
constructed groundwater recharge 
pits as part of our commitment to 
replenish the water we draw.
Monitoring water consumption
We have initiated a comprehensive water management strategy that 
includes the installation of 28 advanced meters across our facilities. We have 
introduced flow rate controls and a level-based sensor system in water taps 
and overhead tanks, preventing overflow and water conservation. These 
meters are crucial for monitoring consumption patterns during different times 
of the day—distinguishing between working and non-working hours—and 
identifying areas where water wastage can be minimized. The next phase of 
this initiative will involve connecting these meters to an IoT-based system for 
enhanced real-time monitoring and performance assessment.
Water conservation awareness
To ensure the effectiveness of these initiatives, we have established a 
dedicated team responsible for overseeing our water management practices. 
This team follows industry best practices, and through continuous training, 
we strive to enhance their capability to drive our water conservation efforts. 
Across our facilities, digital displays and posters have been aligned to 
promote water conservation among our people.
Our integrated water 
management efforts 
at Pune campus 
have yielded positive 
results. Our water 
credit-to-debit ratio 
stands at 1.5, making 
us water positive. 
We have constructed a rainwater harvesting structure to capture 
and reuse rainwater. In FY23-24, our campus achieved a water 
harvesting potential of 30,221 KL per annum, surpassing our 
freshwater consumption of 20,002 KL with a water credit to debit 
ratio calculated as 1.5.
This accomplishment has enabled the Pune campus to be 
recognized as “water positive” for FY23-24, demonstrating our 
dedication to improving regional water security.

Wastewater treatment
Addressing water-related 
impact
Spreading sustainability 
awareness
Within our Pune campus, a 
forward-thinking approach toward 
sustainability has led to the 
implementation of a zero-wastewater 
discharge facility. This initiative is 
part of our broader commitment to 
enhance water efficiency and reduce 
dependence on freshwater sources. 
In the fiscal year, our sewage 
treatment plant (STP) underwent 
significant upgrades, to ensure 
maximum water recycling. This 
plant, with a capacity of 150 KLD, 
effectively manages sewage from 
various buildings.
During the hybrid working model, 
the average treated water output 
from the STP is calculated at 
approximately 55 KLD. Regular 
water quality assessments are 
conducted to monitor and ensure 
the safety and effectiveness of 
the treatment process. The high-
quality treated water is then utilized 
for gardening within the campus, 
which has led to a substantial 
reduction in the consumption of 
freshwater resources. 
Sustainable water supply and 
resource management are 
fundamentally linked to engaging 
stakeholders effectively in 
decision-making processes. In 
alignment with our commitment 
to responsible water stewardship, 
we conduct regular consultations 
with local water supply entities. 
These discussions are pivotal 
for advancing water distribution 
enhancements through the renewal 
of aging infrastructure. Additionally, 
water intake restrictions are 
implemented during non-operational 
days and holidays, optimizing 
water conservation and financial 
savings while fostering stronger 
relations between governance 
structures and stakeholders.
The Civil and Infrastructure 
Management team holds the 
overarching responsibility for water 
management operations, while 
the Environmental Management 
team evaluates their strategy and 
performance at regular intervals, 
offering strategic recommendations. 
Our ESG Council, alongside the 
Senior Management team, conducts 
quarterly reviews of our water 
management status, providing 
necessary budget approvals and 
strategic directions in support of 
our overarching environmental and 
sustainability goals.
We also empower our employees to act as sustainability champions, fostering 
engagement and raising awareness about the importance of environmental 
conservation, energy management, and upholding sustainable practices 
within the workplace. Furthermore, our dedication extends beyond 
operational boundaries to include biodiversity conservation and enhancing 
our impact on the community through landscaping initiatives.

	 Provided support for domestic 
violence cases through the 
Ek Thamba Kendra. 
	 Liaison efforts to access 
government schemes and 
complete documentation 
have positively 
impacted 830 people. 
	 Successfully linked 16 women 
to various government 
schemes, offering them 
benefits worth INR 2,24,000. 
As part of the PM Street 
Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi 
(PM SVANidhi) scheme, 
female street vendors were 
provided affordable loans.
Initiatives
Providing government support
We act as a bridge between 
communities and government 
authorities, facilitating easier 
communication between 
government agencies and people. 
Among other advocacy efforts 
with the government, we assist 
community members in accessing 
important resources through 
government platforms, such as 
enabling community members to 
receive benefits from government 
schemes and participating in the 
task forces of local community 
meetings organized by the 
Pune Municipal Corporation for 
resolving various issues.
Liaising with the government 
We are dedicated to empowering 
communities by connecting them 
with opportunities for growth, 
contributing to their economic 
stability. One of our significant 
impacts has been through the PM 
Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi 
(PM SVANidhi) scheme, which 
provides affordable, collateral-free 
loans to street vendors. A prime 
example is Asha Waghchore, 
who transitioned from earning 
100-200 INR daily as a scrap 
collector to making 500-600 INR 
per day by starting a vegetable 
selling business with the scheme’s 
assistance. This financial support 
has enabled her to better meet 
her family’s needs and improve 
their quality of life.
Our community development 
initiatives aim to bridge the gap 
between the community and 
government schemes, helping 
individuals like Asha access 
these beneficial programs. In FY 
23-24, we reached out to 830 
people, facilitating their access 
to the PM SVANidhi scheme 
and other resources.
Client relationships
We focus on building strong 
relationships with our clients 
through regular engagement. We 
solicit regular feedback from our 
clients and maintain open channels 
of communication to effectively 
meet their needs. 
Online modes of engagement
We use our website and social 
media channels to engage 
with our clients. 
Many of our solutions are 
hosted on marketplaces in 
collaboration with our technology 
partners, helping broaden our 
reach to more clients.
In addition to online efforts, we run 
targeted campaigns and strategic 
marketing activities to support our 
high-value pursuits and Request for 
Proposal (RFP) efforts.
Offline modes of 
communication
We actively participate in partner 
events where we establish 
valuable industry connections and 
engage with clients.

Client feedback
We gather client feedback to 
continuously improve our services 
and ensure client satisfaction. To 
facilitate this, we have established 
a Client Feedback Cell dedicated to 
implementing a systematic process 
for capturing client feedback.
To continuously meet and exceed 
client expectations, we conduct 
client satisfaction surveys through 
various channels. We conduct an 
annual Client Engagement Survey 
for selected client accounts with a 
revenue of USD 0.5 million or more. 
This survey allows us to gather 
feedback from our key clients on 
their overall experience.

In addition to the annual survey, we 
practice Continuous Listening, which 
involves ongoing feedback collection 
every six months for all eligible 
projects (projects with more than 
three resources and a duration of 
more than three months). This allows 
us to capture real-time insights 
and make necessary adjustments 
for enhancing client experience

Collaborating to ensure 
excellence
Procurement budget spent 
on local suppliers
Business review meetings
In addition to interaction with 
suppliers for obtaining goods 
and services, periodic meetings 
are conducted to ensure open 
communication and address issues.
Engagement governance
We closely monitor the revenue 
generated from these engagement 
efforts as well as track the number 
of meetings and marketing 
qualified leads (MQLs) generated 
by campaigns. As part of our 
commitment to enhancing client 
experience, we have developed 
the Zenvisit app for handling client 
visits, currently in the pilot phase and 
expected to be fully adopted in FY25. 
Additionally, we engage our clients 
through events hosted by our brands, 
Foolproof and Indigo Slate, to build 
strong relationships with clients.
Our business-enabling functions 
and client feedback cell conduct 
quality assurance gates and review 
client projects to uncover any risks 
or issues related to quality. They also 
seek feedback from client’s middle 
management, senior management, 
and CXOs annually on qualitative 
and quantitative aspects of delivery 
performance, and expectations. 
Client engagement surveys and 
continuous listening helps to gather 
detailed feedback from clients.
Project feedback is also sought at 
half-yearly intervals for all projects to 
ensure adherence with quantitative 
as well as qualitative aspects. It 
helps to gain insight into team 
competency, project performance, 
quality of deliverables, resourcing, 
and management responsiveness. 
Based on the feedback received, the 
team facilitates corrective actions 
and tracks their implementation. 
Additionally, they conduct quality 
assurance reviews for business-
enabling functions to ensure 
timely and adequate support 
for delivery teams.
To ensure effective governance and 
oversight of client engagements, 
we have a robust governance 
mechanism in place. It defines 
the cadence and agenda at each 
level of engagement, involving key 
stakeholders such as client partners, 
delivery heads, and executive 
sponsors from Zensar. Additionally, 
each engagement has a well-defined 
escalation matrix to address any 
issues promptly and effectively. 
Many of our client relationships span 
over a decade, indicating the strong 
rapport established by senior Zensar 
leadership through personalized 
care and attention.

Supplier code of conduct and 
reporting mechanism
Implementation of a supplier code 
of conduct ensures compliance 
with all rules, regulations, and 
guidelines. This helps us conduct 
our business in a fair and transparent 
manner, free from corruption and 
bribery. A dedicated helpline for 
reporting concerns has also been 
established for suppliers.
Identification of critical 
suppliers 
Critical suppliers are identified based 
on spend, importance to business 
operations, business continuity 
planning needs, and handling of 
company/PI data. This helps in 
proper allocation of resources, 
ensuring that the most crucial 
relationships receive appropriate 
attention and oversight.
Extended scope and review 
mechanisms

agreements extend the scope of 
compliance, and regular reviews 
are conducted through assessment 
questionnaires, performance 
evaluations, and statutory 
compliance audits. Regular reviews 
and evaluations ensure that suppliers 
meet performance standards and 
deliver quality goods and services. 
This enhances overall service 
delivery and customer satisfaction.

include assessment of statutory 
requirements, technical competency,

Management Discussion and Analysis
Economic overview
Global Economy1 
The global economy demonstrated resilience, despite facing 
numerous headwinds in the recent years. According to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth is expected 
to hold steady at 3.2% in CY2024 and maintain this rate 
during CY2025. There is a favourable outlook for global trade 
momentum, which is anticipated to accelerate in CY2024. The 
management of supply-side issues and the implementation 
of restrictive monetary policies have significantly contributed 
to reducing inflation in most economies of the world. 
Global headline inflation is anticipated to decrease to 5.9% 
in CY2024 and further to 4.5% in CY2025, owing to weak 
labour markets and low core inflation, supported by stringent 
monetary policies.
The future outlook appears optimistic, owing to the resilience 
of advanced economies as well as emerging economies such 
as India. Anticipated easing of inflationary pressures and the 
implementation of more accommodative monetary policies 
by Central banks have contributed to this outlook. Robust 
domestic demand is propelling the economic expansion in 
Europe and Asia. Moreover, the global economy stands to 
benefit from the adoption of advanced technologies such as 
Generative AI (GenAI), which could provide both structural 
support and cyclical momentum to the global economy.
Review of key market economies3
Europe
South Africa
The United States is expected to see 
an increase in GDP growth rate from 
2.5% in CY2023 to 2.7% in CY2024 
and then drop to 1.9% in CY2025. 
This slowdown is influenced by the 
effects of monetary policy tightening, 
gradual fiscal tightening and 
softening labour markets, impacting 
aggregate demand. 
The Europe region is projected to 
recover from a low GDP growth 
rate of 0.4% in CY2023 to 0.8% in 
CY2024 and 1.5% in CY2025, owing to 
increased household consumption, 
facilitated by recovery from energy 
prices, decline in inflation and 
increase in real income. Inflation is 
anticipated to subside faster than 
expected, reflecting favourable global 
supply developments. 
The South African economy is 
expected to face pressure in CY2024, 
owing to supply-side constraints in 
the electricity and logistics sectors. 
However, South Africa's GDP growth 
is expected to increase from 0.6% 
in CY2023 to 0.9% in CY2024 and 
1.2% in CY2025, attributed to the 
management of supply issues and 
recovery from earlier weather shocks.
United States
Indian Economy4 
The Indian economy has showcased improvement amidst global volatility. Strong 
domestic demand is expected to sustain growth, facilitating real GDP surge of 8.2% 
in FY2023-2024. An increase in investments in public sector and a robust banking 
sector has facilitated gradual economic expansion over the years. Industries and 
services sectors have been key contributors for supply-side growth in the first 
half of FY2023–2024. Rising credit demand and decreasing inflation have further 
contributed to the positive outlook.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program through which 
risks are assessed and managed at various levels in the 
organization with a top-down and bottom-up approach 
covering the enterprise, business units, geographies and

applicable government and regulatory requirements, and 
potential risk areas in various economic, social, and industrial 
environments that Zensar operates in. The ERM framework 
encompasses the risks that the organization is facing 
under different categories, such as strategic, operational/
cybersecurity, financial, compliance/regulatory, and ESG/
climate risks, with each of these categories having internal/
external dimensions. Systematic and proactive identification 
of risks and mitigations thereof enable effective and timely 
decision-making.

Risk Assessment
The risk score is calculated based on the probability and 
impact. Using a combination of risk impact from insignificant 
to catastrophic, and risk probability ranging from rare to 
almost certain, a risk score is deduced which helps to identify 
if the risk rating is low, medium, or high. The risk scores are 
then used to arrive at a risk prioritization matrix, which guides 
the allocation of time and resources towards risk mitigation. 
Risk governance
A multi-level governance structure has been established 
by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team, which 
ensures monitoring, reporting and mitigation of risks. The 
ERM program is headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who 
ensures that the function executes its primary responsibilities 
of formulation and deployment of risk management policies 
and procedures. In terms of reporting, the function provides 
quarterly updates to the Risk Management Council and 
periodic updates to the Board Risk Management Committee 
on risks which impact key business objectives, with an insight 
into their mitigations. Also, ad-hoc updates may be provided 
in case of any emerging risks and change in internal/external 
factors influencing risk assessment.  
Enterprise Level Risk Register
The ERM function has defined and implemented a detailed 
Risk Register with risks defined at Organizational, Business 
Unit, Functional and Regional levels, which enables risk-
based decision making and reviews by various stakeholders 
in the risk management process. 
Risk Categories
Strategic: Risks arising out of strategy formulation and 
successful execution of these strategies are covered in this 
category. For example, risks associated with the choice of the 
target markets, the Company’s market offerings and business 
models. Details of the Company’s strategy are described in 
other sections of the annual report.
Operational / Cybersecurity: Risks arising out of internal 
and external factors affecting policies, procedures, people, 
and systems, thereby impacting service delivery. These also 
include potential risks arising out of breach of Company’s 
network and possible impact on its operations, including risks 
of cyberattacks and data privacy breaches.  
Compliance / Regulatory: Risks arising from potential 
litigations, violations of laws, regulations, and major 
regulatory/geopolitical changes.  Also includes Reputational 
Risks, which are likely to affect brand or reputation. 
Financial: Risks related to financial liquidity, currency 
fluctuation and capital management.
ESG / Climate: Risks related to business impact due 
to mismatch in approach versus implementation of 
sustainability 
initiatives 
linked 
to 
climate 
changes, 
alignment with stakeholders, and regulatory reporting 
compliances. The risks due to natural calamities– extreme 
climate events / human made disasters are also being 
reviewed and monitored.
Risk identification and mitigation
During the year, the focus was on strengthening ERM framework across the organization and institutionalising ERM as one of 
the key business review mechanisms for key risks. Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact, and mitigations:

2
Climate 
Change
Risk
As global climate change leads 
to harsh environmental impacts 
like temperature increase and 
unpredictable flooding, including 
in urban areas worldwide, Zensar 
acknowledges the potential 
vulnerability of its operations to 
extreme weather phenomena 
such as cyclones, heatwaves, 
and floods. While the current 
impact on Zensar’s operational 
areas remains relatively low, the 
probability of such occurrences 
has shifted from low to medium, 
prompting heightened awareness 
and preparedness measures within 
the organization.
Risk mitigation approach:
All facilities operated by 
the organization in India are 
categorized as having a low 
environmental impact.
The company has 
established a well-defined 
Crisis Management 
framework and Business 
Continuity policies and 
processes, ensuring 
that stakeholders are 
fully informed about the 
ownership, activities,  and 
responsibilities to be 
undertaken during climate-
related emergencies. 
Designated crisis managers, 
initiators, and monitors are 
appointed at both regional 
and functional levels to 
address anticipated as well 
as unforeseen crises. 
Negative:
On the downside, climate 
change presents the 
challenge of adhering 
to environmental 
standards and compliance 
requirements, elevating 
operating costs. 
Conversely, neglecting 
these standards can result 
in adverse incidents, 
potentially leading 
to financial losses, 
compromising employee 
well-being, and tarnishing 
the organization’s 
reputation.
3
Customer 
Satisfaction
Risk and 
Opportunity
The customer plays a pivotal 
role as a major stakeholder and 
contributor to the economic 
growth of an organization. 
Failing to meet expected 
deliverables or address customer-
centric issues within stipulated 
timeframes can adversely 
impact customer satisfaction, 
leading to detrimental effects 
on both business outcomes and 
relationship continuity. 
The rationale for identifying 
opportunities emphasizes 
the importance of customer 
satisfaction in driving repeat 
business, enhancing customer 
retention, and expanding the 
customer base. 
Risk mitigation approach:
The organization has 
deployed proactive 
measurement mechanisms 
to gauge customer 
satisfaction levels and 
collect feedback from 
various perspectives. This 
includes the establishment 
of a dedicated customer 
feedback cell tasked with 
capturing and assessing 
satisfaction levels.  
Positive:
The company’s profitability 
is significantly influenced 
by high levels of customer 
satisfaction and loyalty, 
which lead to enhanced 
business prospects and 
growth opportunities.
Negative:
Dissatisfaction with 
Zensar’s capability to 
deliver promised quality 
services can lead to lost 
business opportunities. 
Moreover, any breaches in 
privacy and data security 
can result in severe 
consequences
4
Employee 
Wellbeing
Opportunity
Within the IT industry, employees 
play a significant role in 
guaranteeing the delivery of quality 
services to customers. They serve 
as the wellspring of skills, agility, 
and innovation, thereby facilitating 
enhanced revenue generation and 
customer satisfaction. Prioritizing 
employee well-being fosters 
heightened employee engagement 
and productivity, leading to 
improved business outcomes.
Positive:
Directing resources 
towards employee well-
being results in notable 
financial benefits, such 
as elevated productivity, 
decreased healthcare 
expenditures, enhanced 
employee retention rates, 
heightened job satisfaction 
levels, and a positive 
employer brand.

Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
Safeguarding data security and 
privacy is integral to protect 
the organization from financial 
losses, reputational damage, legal 
liabilities, and the erosion of trust 
from customers and consumers.
Risk mitigation strategy:
Adopting proven and 
industry-standard monitoring 
and continuous testing 
mechanisms and processes 
ensures the identification 
and neutralization of 
ongoing threats.
Negative:
A decline in customer 
trust regarding Zensar’s 
capability to safeguard 
customer’s data, may 
lead to penalties directly 
impacting the bottom line, 
along with reputational 
repercussions.
6
Community 
Development
Opportunity
Community development 
empowers individuals and 
stimulates economic growth 
by bolstering local businesses 
and generating employment 
opportunities. Moreover, it 
addresses societal challenges, 
advocates for social justice, 
and enhances the well-being of 
marginalized communities by 
increasing access to essential 
services.
The Global Risk List of 2023 
identifies “Deep social polarization 
due to political, economic, and 
cultural issues” as a top risk, 
emphasizing the significant role 
of corporations in mitigating this 
polarization. 
Positive:
The organization’s CSR 
division is dedicated to 
implementing initiatives 
that promote community 
well-being, economic 
development, and 
educational advancement, 
with the aim of improving 
the financial and 
societal conditions 
of the communities it 
serves, hence actively 
contributing to elevating 
societal standards and 
fostering cohesive 
interdependence within 
the ecosystem.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Implementing targeted strategies to position ourselves as the preferred partner for our clients, we continue to diversify our 
customer base, expand our market reach, and cultivate enduring relationships. Looking ahead, we identify the following drivers 
of future growth: strengthening client focus through a robust go-to-market strategy aligned with our Experience, Engagement, 
and Engineering pillars; enhancing sales performance by implementing a new sales platform and fostering strategic alliances; 
strategically investing in expanding service lines, including Enterprise as a Service (ESAS) and Advanced Engineering Services 
(AES), among others. Additionally, prioritizing talent transformation through advanced skill development programs, we aim 
to enrich our associates’ proficiency in critical domains such as solution architecture, product management, and program 
management. In our sustainability journey, anchored by our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) charter, we have 
made significant strides integrating innovation and technology to drive sustainability forward. Emphasizing measurable change, 
we have adopted sustainability measures such as virtualization, cloud migration, green-labeled hardware procurement, and 
improved energy management practices. Furthermore, we have substantially enhanced our energy consumption profile by 
adopting renewable energy options, increasing our global use of green energy to over 31.5%, compared to 18% in the previous 
year. Complementing these efforts, we have launched various programs focused on holistic wellbeing and skill development in 
emerging technologies for our associates, which are integral to our community development initiatives promoting technology-
based education and employment planning.

1.	 Environment & Human Safety: The organization 
collaborated with a prominent UK-based utilities 
company specializing in water and wastewater asset 
management. Through joint efforts, they embarked 
on a business process transformation leveraging 
cutting-edge technologies such as automation, AI, 
and computer vision. The innovation is twofold: i. It 
provides comprehensive coverage of environmental 
factors by encompassing all utility services. ii. It plays 
a crucial role in preserving lives by mitigating the 
risks associated with accidentally striking underlying 
assets, thereby preventing accidents.
2.	 Social Impact: Inclusivity: The implementation of AI 
for Diversity and Inclusion involves the identification 
and rectification of gender bias within organizational 
data. This innovative approach detects various 
stereotypical biases, thereby facilitating informed 
decision-making to promote equality and inclusivity 
within the organization.
3.	 Carbon footprint reduction: The organization is 
actively involved in the development of AI models that 
consolidate multiple use cases into one. Training and 
executing AI models, particularly large deep learning 
models, 
necessitate 
significant 
computational 
resources and energy consumption. This, in turn, 
contributes to the carbon footprint through the energy 
sources utilized to power the data centers and servers 
hosting these models. By developing assets that 
integrate multiple use cases into a unified framework, 
the organization reduces the computational power 
and data requirements, consequently mitigating the 
carbon footprint associated with AI operations.

certification for all its facilities in India, demonstrating our concern about the environment. We are continuing to manage 
waste better by sorting waste, collecting it safely, and handling both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. We follow the 
3-R rule: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, to deal with waste responsibly and protect the environment. Thereby, we hand over 
all the non-hazardous and hazardous waste to authorized recyclers only. In FY24, 100% hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste was diverted from disposal.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Zensar engages with its stakeholders to deliberate on significant subjects and consistently evaluates their relevance. 
Through these engagements, a diverse array of issues pertinent to each stakeholder group is identified. Subsequently, the 
ESG Council prioritizes these topics based on their potential economic, environmental, or social implications for Zensar's 
business, reputation, and operational aspects. Annually, during the Annual General Meeting, this feedback is shared with 
the board, facilitating shareholder discussions on various matters. Various communication channels, such as customer 
surveys and interactions with vendors and partners, are utilized to engage stakeholders effectively. Any notable concerns 
raised are deliberated upon in SCSR committee (Sustainability and CSR committee at Board level) at regular interval 
and various board meetings, encompassing financial, audit, and other committee sessions, ensuring the board remains 
apprised of critical issues.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. Zensar's ESG strategy regarding material topics draws upon insights collected through stakeholder consultations 
involving various parties such as employees, management, external stakeholders including vendors and customers. These 
inputs are carefully considered and processed through our designated tool to determine our material topics. Following this 
process, material topics are then assessed, shortlisted, and prioritized based on their significance in relation to both our 
stakeholders and the overall business operations.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.

grievances brought forward. Employees are encouraged to report their grievances through the designated email address,

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Concerns regarding discrimination and harassment can be promptly and informally addressed by engaging in discussions 
with the employee's immediate supervisor or the HR Manager for the respective region.  We have Internal Complaints 
Committee (ICC) at every location in India to handle sexual harassments related complaints.  Grievances of non-sexual 
nature are handled by HR and any type of complaints requiring escalation are handled by the Corporate Governance & 
Ethics Committee (CGEC), as stipulated in the RPG Code of Corporate Governance & Ethics.
	
Zensar also has POSH policy which specifically has rules defined on complaint management and ensuring protection for 
complainant in sexual harassments cases.  All complaints, sexual and non-sexual in nature, undergo impartial investigation 
and are addressed based on the findings. We are committed to ensuring that there is no retaliation against any individual 
who raises a complaint. Engaging in retaliatory behavior will result in disciplinary actions, including termination. As a 
standard practice, all complaints and investigation details are treated with utmost confidentiality.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. In all contractual agreements, whether with vendors or customers, Zensar places a strong emphasis on compliance 
with legal mandates. The Constitution of India and pertinent labor laws underscore fundamental aspects of human rights, 
such as the right to work, fair working conditions, equitable remuneration, and privacy protection. These rights are pivotal 
not only for the organization but also for its vendors, customers, and partners. It is crucial that all parties actively uphold 
these rights and ensure their effective implementation within collaborative endeavors.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Zensar Technologies Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Zensar Technologies Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31 2024, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss including the statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes 
to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the 
state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024, its profit 
including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and 
the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements 
in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as 
specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities 
under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Financial 
Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, 
our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below to be the 
key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We 
have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements. The results of our audit procedures, including 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, 
provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying 
standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Notes 2.1(a) and 3 (a) to the standalone financial statements)
The Company engages into various contracts for software 
development, and maintenance of software/hardware and 
related services. The contracts with customer’s have defined 
delivery milestones with agreed scope of work and pricing for 
each milestone based on the nature of service. On the basis 
of scope of work and terms, the pricing arrangement of these 
contracts is time and material and/or fixed price.
Revenue from fixed price, where the performance obligation is 
satisfied over a period of time has been recognised using the 
percentage of completion computed as per the input method 
based on Company’s estimate of total contract costs. Use of 
percentage -of-completion method requires the determination 
the actual efforts or costs expended to date as proportion of 
estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	 Obtained the understanding of the processes, systems 
and the controls implemented by the Company for 
recording and computing revenue and the associated 
contract assets and unearned revenue; and assessed the 
appropriateness of accounting policy with Ind AS 115.
2.	 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition;
3.	 Tested sample revenue contracts and performed the 
following procedures to assess whether revenue is 
appropriately recognised as per principles of Ind AS 115 :
	
a)	 Evaluated management’s assessment with respect to 
identification of performance obligation;
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised basis 
the time spent by employee/vendors on a contract as approved 
by the project manager. Such services are recognised as 
and when the services are rendered and/or approved by the 
customers. 
We identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter since :
 
 
There is an inherent and presumed fraud risk around the 
revenue recognition considering application of revenue 
recognition standard is complex and involves number 
of key judgements and estimates mainly in identifying 
performance 
obligations, 
related 
transaction 
price 
(including estimates of variable consideration) and 
estimating the future cost to completion of the fixed price 
contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of 
completion of the relevant performance obligation;
 
 
Time and material contracts are billed basis approval 
of effort estimate by project manager and also through 
customer acceptances in certain cases; and
 
 
At year end, significant amount of unbilled revenue related 
to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
	
b)	 Agreed the transaction price to the underlying 
contracts; 
	
c)	 In case of time and material type contract, tested 
samples to verify whether revenue has been correctly 
recorded based on approved effort estimate by 
project manager and where applicable, is backed by 
customer acceptances wherever revenue is invoiced 
to the customer;
	
d)	 In respect of fixed price type contracts, tested samples 
to verify whether management has appropriately 
accrued revenue as per milestones defined in the 
contract with necessary approvals and the estimated 
cost to complete the contract is appropriate;
	
e)	 Assessed aging of unbilled revenue as on the balance 
sheet date and in case of aged items obtained reasons 
for delays if any and expected timelines for invoicing 
of the same.
	
f)	 Performed analytical procedures on unbilled revenue 
and customer margin’s and obtained reasons 
for significant variations in customer margins as 
compared to contracted margin if any. 
4.	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the standalone 
financial statements.
Impairment assessment of Goodwill (as described in Notes 2.1(f), 3(f) and 33 to the standalone financial statements)
As at March 31, 2024, the Company has a goodwill of INR 956 
million pertaining to various business combinations undertaken 
at a group level in the previous years. The carrying value of 
goodwill is tested as a whole annually for impairment using 
discounted cash flow models of recoverable value compared to 
the carrying value of assets. A deficit between recoverable value 
and carrying value would result in impairment. Determination 
of recoverable amount is complex and typically requires a high 
level of judgment.
The key assumptions to the impairment testing model includes:
 
 
Projected revenue growth, operating margins and 
operating cash flows during the forecasted period,
 
 
Long-term growth rate beyond explicit forecast period and 
in perpetuity; and
 
 
Discount rate used
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these 
assumptions and because of the materiality of the balance to 
the standalone financial statements of the Company, the matter 
is considered a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	 Assessed management’s evaluation of identification of 
cash-generating unit’s (CGU) and allocation of goodwill to 
the respective CGU.
2.	 Tested 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
management’s key internal controls over the impairment 
assessment process.
3.	 Involved our specialists who evaluated the appropriateness 
of the model used and assessed the key assumptions 
of the cash flow forecasts including discount rates and 
terminal growth rates used; in consideration of current 
and estimated future economic conditions.
4.	 Compared previous forecasts to actual results for the past 
two financial years to assess the historical accuracy of the 
forecasting process.
5.	 Analyzed the consistency of cash flow forecasts with 
estimates presented to the Board as part of the Budgeting 
process.
6.	 Assessed recoverable value headroom by performing 
sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.
7.	 Traced the goodwill amounts to the impairment working 
performed on a CGU basis at the group level.
8.	 Tested the arithmetic accuracy of the models 
9.	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the standalone 
financial statements.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Migration to a new information technology (IT) system during the year
The Company used Oracle EBS as its primary ERP which was 
upgraded to Oracle Fusion in October 2023. The Company’s 
financial accounting and reporting systems are highly dependent 
on the effective working of their IT systems. The changes in IT 
systems represent a financial reporting risk as controls and 
processes that have been established and embedded over a 
number of years are likely to be revisited. The audit approach 
relies on the effectiveness of automated controls of these 
applications and controls around interface of systems. While 
transitioning to the new IT system, robustness of IT general 
and application controls is critical to assess that changes to 
applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate 
manner. Accordingly, we have identified the migration as a key 
audit matter.
Our audit procedures performed with the assistance of our 
IT specialists included: 
1.	 Obtained an understanding of the changes in the IT 
environment, IT Infrastructure and the ERP system. 
2.	 Obtained an understanding of the process followed by 
the Company for implementing the new IT system- Oracle 
Fusion; and migration of data from erstwhile Oracle EBS 
to Oracle Fusion.
3.	 Tested IT general controls related to user and application 
controls, change management controls, data backup 
and audit trail. Tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the IT General Controls (ITGCs) and 
business processes post migration (both automated and

Other Information 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual report, but does not include the 
standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available to 
us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether such other information is materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these standalone financial statements that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, cash 
flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified 
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern. 
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure 2 to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the 
Standalone Financial Statements of Zensar Technologies Limted
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements of Zensar Technologies 
Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
“Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, as specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to these standalone financial 
statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference 
to 
these 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference 
to standalone financial statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Statement of Compliance:
	
The financial statements of the Company have been 
prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), read together with 
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time, presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Act as 
applicable to the standalone financial statements and 
other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
i.	
Historical cost convention:
	
	
These standalone financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost basis and on an accrual 
basis, except for certain financial instruments 
which are measured at fair value or amortized cost 
at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost 
is generally based on fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange of goods and services. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure 
purpose in these standalone financial statements 
is determined on such a basis, except for share 
based payment transactions that are within the 
scope of Ind AS 102 Share-based Payments, leasing 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 
116 Leases, and measurements that have some 
similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such 
as ‘value in use’, in Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
	
ii.	
Current versus Non-current classification:
	
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as 
current or non-current as per the Company’s 
operating cycle and other criteria set out in the 
Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of 
products and services and their settlement in cash 
and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained 
its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose 
of current and non-current classification of assets 
and liabilities.
	
iii.	
Presentation and Functional currency:
	
	
These 
standalone 
financial 
statements 
are 
presented in Indian rupees (“INR”) which is also the 
Company’s functional currency.
2.1	 Material accounting policy information
	
a)	
Revenue Recognition:
	
	
The Company derives revenue from information 
technology services, maintenance of software/ 
hardware and related services, sale of software 
licenses. These include revenue earned from 
services rendered on ‘time and material’ basis, time 
bound fixed price engagements and fixed price 
development contracts.
	
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control 
of promised products or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the 
Company expect to receive in exchange for those 
products or services. Revenue is measured based 
on transaction price, which is the consideration, 
net of indirect taxes, discounts, rebates, credits, 
price concessions, incentives, performance bonus, 
penalties, or other similar items.
	
	
Revenue from time and material contracts is 
recognized as the related services are performed 
and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the 
reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue from fixed price maintenance contracts 
is recognised based on the right to invoice for 
services performed for contracts in which the 
invoicing is representative of the value being 
delivered. If invoicing is not consistent with value 
delivered, revenue is recognized as the services 
are performed. When services are performed 
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts 
over a specified period, revenue is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the specified period unless 
some other method better represents the manner 
in which services are performed.
	
	
Revenue on fixed price development contracts is 
recognised using the ‘percentage of completion’ 
method of accounting, unless work completed 
cannot be reasonably estimated. Percentage of 
completion is determined based on project effort 
expended to date as a percentage of total estimated 
project effort required to complete the project. The 
effort expended (or input) method has been used to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a 
direct relationship between input and productivity. 
If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to 
measure the progress of completion or to estimate 
the total contract revenues and costs, revenue is 
recognized only to the extent of contract cost 
incurred for which recoverability is probable. 
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an 
arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss in 
the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the current contract estimates.
	
	
The billing schedules agreed with customers include 
periodic performance-based payments and / or 
milestone based progress payments. Invoices are 
payable within contractually agreed credit period.
	
	
The solutions offered by the Company may include 
supply of third party equipment or software. 
In such cases, revenue for supply of such third 
party products are recorded at gross or net basis 
depending on whether the Company is acting as 
the principal or as an agent of the customer. The 
Company recognizes gross amount of consideration 
as revenue when it is acting as a principal and net 
amount of consideration as revenue when it is 
acting as an agent.
	
	
Contracts assets are recognised when there is 
excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. 
Contract assets are classified as unbilled revenue 
for time and material and fixed price maintenance 
contracts, when there is unconditional right to 
receive cash, and only passage of time is required, 
as per contractual terms. Invoicing to the clients for 
other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones 
as defined in the contract and, therefore, the 
timing of revenue recognition is different from 
the timing of invoicing to the customers. The 
right to consideration in such cases depends on 
completion of contractual milestones.
	
	
Contract liability (“Unearned revenue”) arises when 
there are billing in excess of revenue.
	
	
In arrangements for hardware and software 
implementation and integration, related services 
and maintenance services, the Company has 
applied the guidance in Ind AS 115, by applying 
the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct 
performance obligation. 
	
	
Revenue recognition for delivered elements is 
limited to the amount that is not contingent on 
the future delivery of products or services, future 
performance obligations or subject to customer 
specified return or refund privileges.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains 
a ‘right to use’ the licenses is recognized at the 
time the license is made available to the customer. 
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains 
a ‘right to access’ is recognized over the access 
period. The Company has applied the principles 
of Ind AS 115 to account for revenues for these 
performance obligations.
	
	
The Company accounts for volume discount and 
pricing incentives to customers as a reduction 
based on ratable allocation of the discounts/ 
incentives amount to each of the underlying 
performance obligation that corresponds to the 
progress made by the customer towards earning 
the discount/incentive. Also, when the level of 
discount varies with increases in levels of revenue 
transactions, the Company recognises the liability 
based on its estimate of the customer’s future 
purchases. If it is probable that the criteria for the 
discount will not be met, or if the amount thereof 
cannot be estimated reliably, then discount is not 
recognised until the payment is probable or the 
amount can be estimated reliably. The Company 
recognises changes in the estimated amount of 
obligations for discounts in the period in which 
the change occurs.
	
	
The 
Company 
disaggregates 
revenue 
from 
contracts with customers by nature of services, 
geography and industry verticals.

b)	
Income Tax:
	
	
i.	
Current Income Tax:
	
	
	
Tax expense comprises of current tax and 
deferred tax. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the current tax amount are those 
that are applicable for the reporting period. 
Current tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to / recovered from the 
tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability 
computed after taking credit for allowances.
	
	
	
Current and deferred tax are recognised in 
the standalone statement of profit and loss, 
except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case, the income 
taxes are recognized in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
	
	
	
Income tax assets and income tax liabilities 
are presented in the standalone statement of 
financial position after off-setting advance tax 
paid and income tax provision arising in the 
same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant 
tax paying unit has a legally enforceable right 
and intends to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.
	
	
ii.	
Deferred Tax:
	
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
recognized 
for 
deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary differences respectively arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amount in financial 
statements, except when the deferred income 
tax arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profits or 
loss at the time of the transaction and does 
not give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the 
extent it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilized. 
	
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences except in 
respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with foreign branches where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
	
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realized 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates 
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
	
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity, or on different taxable 
entities where there is an intention to settle 
the current tax liabilities and assets on a net 
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be 
realized simultaneously.
	
c)	
Leases:
	
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. The Company assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Company 
assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the 
use of an identified asset (2) the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from 
use of the asset through the period of the lease 
and (3) the Company has the right to direct the 
use of the asset. 
	
	
Company as a lessee:
	
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-
term and low value leases, the Company recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain 
lease arrangements include the options to extend 
or terminate the lease before the end of the lease 
term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these 
options when it is reasonably certain that they will 
be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially 
recognized at cost, which comprises the initial 
amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement 
date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any 
lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the 
value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows 
that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment 
to the related right of use asset if the Company 
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise 
an extension or a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset are separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash flows used in 
financing activities.
	
	
Company as a lessor:
	
	
At the inception of the lease the Company classifies 
each of its leases as either an operating lease or 
a finance lease. The Company recognises lease 
payments received under operating leases as 
income on a straight- line basis over the lease 
term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is 
recognised over the lease term based on a pattern 
reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on 
the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the 
Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for 
its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease 
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a 
sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset 
arising from the head lease, not with reference to 
the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short term 
lease to which the Company applies the exemption 
described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as 
an operating lease.
	
	
Whenever 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
lease 
transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee, the contract is classified as 
a finance lease.
	
	
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
	
d)	
Foreign Currency Translation:
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. 
Foreign 
currency 
denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities are restated at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date and 
exchange gains and losses arising on settlement 
and restatement are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
foreign currencies are not restated.
	
	
Assets and liabilities of it’s branches with functional 
currency other than the functional currency of the 
Company have been translated using exchange 
rates prevailing on the reporting date. The 
statement of profit and loss of such entities has 
been translated using weighted average exchange 
rates. Such adjustments have been recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on 
initial recognition of the related asset, expense or 
income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-
monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to 
advance consideration, the date of the transaction is 
the date on which the Company initially recognises 
the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability

arising from the advance consideration. If there 
are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the 
Company determines the transaction date for each 
payment or receipt of advance consideration.
	
e)	
Business Combinations:
	
	
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred in a business combination is measured 
at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of 
acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred 
by the Company, liabilities, including contingent 
liabilities assumed by the Company to the former 
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests 
issued by the Company in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are 
generally recognized in the statement profit and 
loss as incurred.
	
	
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. After initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Intangible assets acquired in business combination 
are measured at fair value as of the date of acquisition 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
	
	
When the Company acquires a business, it assesses 
the financial assets and liabilities assumed for 
appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. 
	
	
When 
the 
consideration 
transferred 
by 
the 
Company in a business combination includes 
assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is 
measured at its acquisition date fair value and 
included as part of the consideration transferred in 
a business combination. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured 
at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with 
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments or Ind AS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets, with the corresponding gain or loss being 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination 
is incomplete by the end of the reporting period 
in which the combination occurs, the Company 
reports provisional amounts for the items for which 
the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 
amounts are adjusted through goodwill during 
the measurement period, or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed 
at the acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognized at that date. These 
adjustments are called as measurement period 
adjustments. The measurement period does not 
exceed one year from the acquisition date.
	
f)	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever there is any indication that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the 
value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount 
of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss.
	
	
Goodwill
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual 
basis and whenever there is an indication that 
goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of 
factors including operating results, business plans 
and future cash flows.
	
	
The Company estimates the value-in-use of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future 
cash flows after considering current economic 
conditions and trends, estimated future operating 
results and growth rate and anticipated future 
economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated 
cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. 
The discount rate used for the CGU’s represent 
the weighted average cost of capital based on the 
historical market returns. 
	
g)	
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
	
	
The Company considers all highly liquid financial 
instruments, which are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash and that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of change in value and having 
original maturities of three months or less from the 
date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Cash and 
cash equivalents consist of balances with banks 
which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
h)	
Investments, other financial assets and other 
financial liabilities:
	
	
i.	
Initial Recognition and measurement:
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities 
(other than financial assets and financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) 
are added to or deducted from the fair value 
measured on initial recognition of financial 
asset or financial liability.
	
	
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, 
as subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
fair value through other comprehensive income 
(OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. 
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Company’s business model for managing them. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value plus, in the case of financial assets 
not recorded at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs that are attributable to 
the acquisition of the financial asset. Trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component or for which the Company 
has applied the practical expedient are measured 
at the transaction price determined under 
Ind AS 115.
	
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as 
the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument 
level. Financial assets with cash flows that are 
not SPPI are classified and measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, irrespective of the 
business model.
	
	
	
The Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its 
financial assets in order to generate cash flows. 
The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual 
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. 
Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business model 
with the objective to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows while 
financial assets classified and measured at fair 
value through OCI are held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to 
collect contractual cash flows and selling.
	
	
	
The Company intends to hold its investment 
in open ended target maturity funds till 
maturity. It may be noted that these funds 
have a pre-determined maturity date. These 
funds follow a passive buy and hold strategy; 
in which the existing underlying investment 
bonds are expected to be held till maturity 
unless sold for meeting redemptions or 
rebalancing requirements as stated in the 
scheme document. In our view, such strategy 
mitigates intermittent price volatility in open 
ended target maturity funds’ underlying 
investments; 
and 
investors 
who 
remain 
invested until maturity are expected to 
mitigate the market/volatility risk to a large 
extent. Based on this, the Company believes 
that the investments in open ended target 
maturity funds meet the requirements of SPPI 
(solely payments of principal and interest) test 
as per the requirements of Ind AS 109.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, financial liabilities at 
amortised cost or as derivatives designated 
as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. The Company’s financial 
liabilities include trade and other payables, 
and derivative financial instruments.

ii.	
Subsequent Measurement:
	
	
	
Financial assets carried at amortized cost:
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive 
income if it is held within a business model 
whose 
objective 
is 
achieved 
by 
both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms 
of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. Further, in cases where 
the Company has made an irrevocable 
election based on its business model, for 
its investments which are classified as 
equity instruments, the subsequent changes 
in 
fair 
value 
are 
recognized 
in 
other 
comprehensive income.
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL):
	
	
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method or at FVTPL. For financial 
liabilities carried at amortised cost, the 
carrying amounts approximate fair values 
due to the short-term maturities of these 
instruments. Financial liabilities are classified 
as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either 
contingent consideration recognised in a 
business combination, or it is designated as 
FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated 
at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
	
The 
Company 
determines 
classification 
of financial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, no 
reclassification is made for financial assets 
which are equity instruments and financial 
liabilities. For financial assets which are debt 
instruments, a reclassification is made only 
if there is a change in the business model 
for managing those assets. Changes to the 
business model are expected to be infrequent. 
The 
Company’s 
senior 
management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Company’s operations. 
If the Company reclassifies financial assets, 
it applies the reclassification prospectively 
from the reclassification date following the 
change in business model. The Company 
does not restate any previously recognised 
gains, losses (including impairment gains or 
losses) or interest.
	
	
iii.	
Derecognition 
	
	
	
The Company derecognises a financial asset 
when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another 
party. If the Company retains substantially all 
the risk and rewards of transferred financial 
assets, the Company continues to recognize 
the financial asset and also recognizes the 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
	
	
The Company derecognises financial liabilities 
when, 
and 
only 
when, 
the 
Company’s 
obligations 
are 
discharged, 
cancelled 
or have expired.
iv.	
Impairment of financial assets (other than at 
fair value):
	
	
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date 
whether a financial asset or a Company of 
financial assets and contract assets (unbilled 
revenue) is impaired. The Company recognizes 
loss allowances, in accordance with IND AS 
109, using the expected credit loss (ECL) model 
for the financial assets which are not fair valued 
through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade 
receivables and unbilled revenue with no 
significant financing component is measured 
at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other 
financial assets, expected credit losses are 
measured at an amount equal to the 12-month 
ECL, unless there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk from initial recognition 
in which case those are measured at lifetime 
ECL. The amount of expected credit losses 
(or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss 
allowance at the reporting date is recognized 
as an impairment gain or loss in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
v.	
Investments in subsidiaries: The Company 
accounts for its investment in subsidiaries at 
cost, less impairment losses if any.
	
i)	
Interest and Dividend income:
	
	
Dividend income is recorded when the right to 
receive payment is established. Interest income is 
recognised using the effective interest method.
	
j)	
Derivatives and hedging activities:
	
	
The Company designates certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts as 
hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange 
risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges/fair value hedges, as applicable. 
	
	
The Company uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the policies of the Company which are 
approved by Board of Directors. The policies provide 
written principles on the use of such financial 
derivatives consistent with the risk management 
strategy of the Company. The Company enters 
into derivative financial instruments where the 
counterparty is primarily a bank.
	
	
The hedge instruments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Company determines the existence 
of an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, 
amount and timing of their respective cash flows. 
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce 
the risk associated with the exposure being hedged 
is assessed and measured at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are 
no longer expected to occur, then the amounts 
that have been accumulated in other equity are 
immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange 
gains/loss in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as:
	
	
-	
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of a recognized 
asset 
or 
liability 
or 
an 
unrecognized 
firm commitment.
	
	
-	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure 
to variability in cash flows that is either 
attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognized asset or liability or a 
highly probable forecast transaction or the 
foreign currency risk in an unrecognized 
firm commitment
	
	
-	
Hedges 
of 
a 
net 
investment 
in 
a 
foreign operation
	
	
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are measured as described below:
	
	
Cash flow hedges:
	
	
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging 
instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are 
recognized in other comprehensive income and 
held in cash flow hedging reserve, net of taxes, 
a component of equity, to the extent that the 
hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is 
ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss and reported 
within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within 
results from operating activities. If the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized 
in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the 
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging 
reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.
	
	
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in 
the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence of 
the related forecasted transaction.
	
	
The Company enters into the contracts that are 
effective as hedges from an economic perspective 
but may not qualify for hedge accounting. The 
change in the fair value of such instrument is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

k)	
Offsetting financial instruments:
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the 
net amount is reported in the balance sheet where 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realize the asset on a net 
basis or realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must 
not be contingent on future events and must be 
enforceable in the normal course of business and 
in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Company or the counterparty.
	
l)	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
i.	
Recognition and measurement:
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Cost includes 
expenditures directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. General and specific 
borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the construction of a qualifying asset are 
capitalized as part of the cost.
	
	
	
When parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items 
(major 
components) 
of 
property, 
plant 
and equipment. 
	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost.
	
	
	
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, 
plant and equipment is capitalized only 
when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with these will flow 
to the Company and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs 
and maintenance costs are charged to the 
statement of profit and loss in the reporting 
period in which they occur.
	
	
	
An item of property, plant & equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognized when replaced. 
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of property, plant & 
equipment are determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment 
not available for use before year end date are 
disclosed under capital work- in-progress, 
net of impairment losses, if any and are 
not depreciated.
	
	
	
An asset's carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if 
the carrying amount of the assets or cash 
generating unit (CGU) as applicable, is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
ii.	
Depreciation:
	
	
	
The Company depreciates property, plant 
and equipment on a straight-line basis as 
per the estimated useful lives prescribed in 
Schedule II of the Act, except in respect of the 
following assets:
Class of asset
Useful 
life as per 
Schedule II
Useful life 
followed by 
Company 
based on 
technical 
evaluation
Data Processing 
Equipments
6 years
4 years
Vehicles
8 years
5 years
Electrical 
Installations and 
Equipments
10 years
5 years
	
	
	
Assets acquired under leasehold improvements 
are amortized over the shorter of estimated 
useful life of the asset or the related lease term. 
	
	
	
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
	
m)	
Intangible Assets:
	
	
Intangible assets other than those acquired in a 
business combination are measured at cost at the 
date of acquisition.
	
	
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortization 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
	
	
Internally 
generated 
intangible 
asset 
arising 
from development activity is recognized at cost 
on demonstration of its technical feasibility, the 
intention and ability of the Company to complete, 
use or sell it, only if, it is probable that the asset 
would generate future economic benefit and the 
expenditure attributable to the said assets during 
its development can be measured reliably.
	
	
An item of Intangible assets is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of Intangible assets are 
determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Amortization 
periods 
and 
methods 
for 
all 
Intangible Assets, including those arising from 
business combination:
	
	
Intangible assets are amortized on straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives which 
are as follows:
Class of 
Intangible Assets
Useful life 
followed by the 
Company
Softwares (acquired)
1-5 years
Softwares (internally generated)
3-5 years
Non-compete agreements
3-6 years
Customer relationship
4-10 years
Customer contracts
1 -3 years
Brand
3-5 years
	
	
The amortization method and the estimated useful 
life of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed 
at least annually and where appropriate are 
adjusted, annually.
	
n)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities:
	
	
Provisions are recognized when the Company has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. 
	
	
When some or all of the economic benefits required 
to settle a provision are expected to be recovered 
from a third party, the receivable is recognized as 
an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement 
will be received, and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably. The expense relating to 
a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
	
	
When a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, it’s carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows (when 
the effect of the time value of money is material)
	
	
The Company uses significant judgement to 
disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities 
are disclosed when there is a possible obligation 
arising from past events, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Company or 
a present obligation that arises from past events 
where it is either not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be 
made. Contingent assets are neither recognised 
nor disclosed in the financial statements.
	
	
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by 
the Company from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations 
under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts 
are measured at the present value of lower of the 
expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the 
expected cost of terminating the contract.

o)	
Employee benefits:
	
	
i.	
Post-employment and pension plans:
	
	
	
The 
Company 
participates 
in 
various 
employee benefit plans. Pensions and other 
post-employment benefits are classified as 
either defined contribution plans or defined 
benefit plans. Under a defined contribution 
plan, the Company’s only obligation is to 
pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not 
hold sufficient assets to pay all employee 
benefits. The related actuarial and investment 
risks fall on the employee. The expenditure 
for defined contribution plans is recognized 
as an expense during the period when the 
employee provides service. Under a defined 
benefit plan, it is the Company’s obligation 
to provide agreed benefits to the employees. 
The related actuarial and investment risks fall 
on the Company. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligations is calculated by an 
independent actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. 
	
	
	
The Company has the following employee 
benefit plans:
	
	
	
Provident Fund:
	
	
	
Employees receive benefits from a provident 
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. The 
employer and employees each make periodic 
contributions to the plan. Provident fund 
contributions are made to a trust administered 
by the Company. The contributions to the trust 
managed by the Company are accounted for 
as a defined benefit plan as the Company is 
liable for any shortfall, if any with respect to 
the rate of return based on the government 
specified minimum rates of return.
	
	
	
The 
Company’s 
liability 
is 
actuarially 
determined (using the Projected Unit Credit 
method) at the end of the year. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognised in the other 
comprehensive income, net of tax in the year 
in which they arise. The contributions made 
to the trust are recognised as plan assets. The 
defined benefit obligation recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation as reduced by 
the fair value of plan assets.	
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
	
	
The Company provides benefits such as 
superannuation, provident fund (other than 
Company managed fund) and foreign defined 
contribution plans to its employees which are 
treated as defined contribution plans.
	
	
	
Contributions 
to 
defined 
contribution 
plans are recognised as an expense when 
employees have rendered services entitling 
them to such benefits.
	
	
	
Gratuity:
	
	
	
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering 
eligible employees in accordance with the 
Gratuity Scheme of the Company. The Gratuity 
plan provides for a lump sum payment to 
eligible employees, at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment 
based on the last drawn salary and years of 
employment with the Company. The gratuity 
fund is managed by the Life Insurance 
Corporation of India (LIC). The Company’s 
obligation in respect of the gratuity plan, is 
provided for based on actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method. The 
Company recognizes actuarial gains and 
losses immediately in other comprehensive 
income, net of taxes.
	
	
	
The retirement benefit obligation recognized 
in the Balance Sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted 
for 
unrecognized 
past 
service 
cost, and as reduced by the fair value of 
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the scheme.
	
	
ii.	
Short-term benefits:
	
	
	
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
recorded as expense in the statement of profit 
and loss as the related services are provided. 
Liabilities for wages and salaries including the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term 
cash bonus or profit sharing plans, expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months after 
the end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are recognized if the 
Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past service provided by the employee and 
the obligation can be estimated reliably.
	
	
iii.	
Compensated absences:
	
	
	
The employees of the Company are entitled 
to compensated absences. The employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilized 
accumulating compensated absences and 
utilize it in future periods or receive cash at 
retirement or termination of employment. 
The Company records an obligation for 
compensated absences in the period in 
which the employee renders the services that 
increases this entitlement.
	
	
	
The 
Company’s 
liability 
is 
actuarially 
determined (using the Projected Unit Credit 
method) at the end of each year, as applicable. 
Actuarial losses/ gains are recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss in the year in 
which they arise.
	
	
	
Accumulated compensated absences, which 
are expected to be availed or encashed 
within 12 months from the end of the year are 
classified under current liabilities and balance 
under non-current liabilities.
	
	
iv.	
Share-based payments:
	
	
	
Selected employees of the Company receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled 
instruments, for rendering services over a 
defined vesting period. The cost of equity-
settled transactions is determined by the fair 
value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model.
	
	
	
The cost under employee benefits expense 
is recognised, together with a corresponding 
change in Share Based Payment Reserves 
under Other Equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are 
fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised 
for 
equity-settled 
transactions 
at 
each 
reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Service and non-market 
performance conditions are not taken into 
account when determining the grant date 
fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the 
conditions being met is assessed as part of 
the Company’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
	
Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other 
conditions attached to an award, but without 
an 
associated 
service 
requirement, 
are 
considered to be non-vesting conditions. 
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair 
value of an award and lead to an immediate 
expensing of an award unless there are also 
service and/or performance conditions.
	
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met. Where awards include a market 
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.
	
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised 
is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total fair 
value of the share-based payment transaction 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee 
as measured at the date of modification. 
Where an award is cancelled by the entity or 
by the counterparty, any remaining element 
of the fair value of the award is expensed 
immediately through profit or loss.
	
p)	
Dividends:
	
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the 
date of approval by the shareholders in case of 
final dividend or by the board of directors in case 
of interim dividend. A corresponding amount is 
recognized directly in equity.
	
q)	
Fair value measurement:
	
	
The Company measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance

sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
 
 
In 
the 
principal 
market 
for 
the 
asset 
or liability, or
 
 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Company. The fair 
value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial 
instruments measured using quoted prices. This 
includes listed equity instruments and mutual 
funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all 
equity instruments (including bonds) which are 
traded in the stock exchange are valued using the 
closing price as at the reporting period.
	
	
Level 2: Fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market (for example, 
traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) but 
is determined using valuation techniques which 
maximize the use of observable market data 
and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair 
value an instrument as observable, the instrument 
is included in level 2.
	
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs 
is not based on observable data, the instrument 
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted 
equity securities, contingent consideration and 
indemnification assets.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
	
	
The 
Management 
determines 
the 
policies 
and procedures for both recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments and 
unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, 
and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets 
held for sale in discontinued operations.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the 
fair value hierarchy as explained above.
	
r)	
Operating Segments: 
	
	
The Board of Directors evaluates the Company’s 
performance and allocates resources based on 
an analysis of various performance indicators by 
business segments and geographic segments 
based on the “management approach” as defined 
in Ind AS 108. Accordingly, information has been 
presented both along business segments and 
geographic segments.
	
	
Segments are defined as components of an 
enterprise for which discrete financial information 
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief 
operating decision maker, in deciding how to 
allocate resources and assessing performance. 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker 
is the Managing Director. Information reported 
to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) 
for the purposes of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance focuses 
on the types of goods or services delivered 
or provided. 
	
	
The accounting principles used in the preparation 
of the financial statements are consistently applied 
to record revenue and expenditure in individual 
segments and are as set out in the material 
accounting policies. Revenue and identifiable 
operating expenses in relation to segments are 
categorized based on items that are individually 
identifiable to that segment. Certain expenses 
such as depreciation and finance cost, which form 
a significant component of total expenses, are 
not specifically allocable to specific segments as 
the underlying assets are used interchangeably. 
Management believes that it is not practical to 
provide segment disclosures relating to those 
expenses, and accordingly these expenses are 
separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted 
against the operating income of the Company.
	
	
The Board of Directors has identified below 
mentioned 
reportable 
segments 
of 
its 
business as follows:
	
	
Digital and Application Services (DAS): Custom 
Applications Management Services that include 
Application Development, Maintenance, Support, 
Modernization and Testing Services across a wide 
technology spectrum and Industry verticals.
	
	
Digital Foundation Services (DFS): Infrastructure 
management services includes Hybrid IT, Digital 
workplace, Dynamic Security and Unified IT 
provided under managed service platform using 
automation, autonomics and machine learning.
	
	
The Board of Directors monitors the operating 
results of its business units separately for the 
purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment 
performance is evaluated based on profit or loss 
and is measured consistently with profit or loss in 
the standalone financial statements.
	
s)	
Government grants:
	
	
Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. 
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is 
recognised as income on a systematic basis over 
the periods that the related costs, for which it is 
intended to compensate, are expensed. When the 
grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income 
in equal amounts over the expected useful life of 
the related asset.
	
t)	
Earnings per share:
	
	
The basic earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the net profit for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. The number of shares used in computing 
diluted earnings per share comprises the weighted 
average shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per share and also the weighted average 
number of equity shares which would have been 
issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are 
deemed converted as of the beginning of the 
period unless they have been issued at a later date.
2.2	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
MCA issued amendments to certain Indian Accounting 
Standards (called as “Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023”) which were 
applicable from 1 April 2023. The Company applied for 
the first-time these amendments.
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments 
to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates, 
changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. 
	
	
The amendments had no impact on the Company’s 
standalone financial statements. 
(ii)	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments 
to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies

with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making 
decisions about accounting policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact on the 
Company’s disclosures of accounting policies, but 
not on the measurement, recognition or presentation 
of any items in the Company’s financial statements. 
iii)	
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities 
arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments 
to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no 
longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable and deductible temporary differences 
such as leases. 
	
	
The Company previously recognised for deferred 
tax on leases on a net basis. As a result of these 
amendments, the Company has recognised a 
separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease 
liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its 
right-of-use assets. Since these balances qualify for 
offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 of 
Ind AS 12, there is no impact in the balance sheet. 
There was also no impact on the opening retained 
earnings as at 1 April 2022.

There are no standards that are notified and not yet 
effective as on date.
3.	
Critical estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income 
and 
expenses, 
and 
the 
accompanying 
disclosures and including the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities as at the reporting date. However, any change 
in these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in 
future periods.	
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are 
revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, 
information about significant areas of estimation, 
uncertainty 
and 
critical 
judgements 
in 
applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
are included in the following notes:
	
The 
areas 
involving 
critical 
estimates 
and/or 
judgements are:
a	
Revenue recognition
	
A portion of the Company’s business relates to fixed 
price contracts which is accounted using percentage 
of completion method, recognizing revenue as the 
performance on the contract progresses. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Company 
to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date ( input 
method) as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be 
expended. Efforts or costs expended have been used to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Provisions 
for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become 
probable based on the expected contract estimates at 
the reporting date. This requires management to make 
judgement with respect to identifying contracts for 
which revenue need to be recognised over a period of 
time, depending upon when the customer consumes 
the benefit, when the control is passed to customer, 
and whether the Company has right to payment for 
performance completed till date, either contractually 
or legally.		
	
	
b	
Income and Deferred taxes
	
Significant judgements are involved in determining 
the provision for income taxes, including judgment on 
whether tax positions are probable of being sustained 
in tax assessments. The management considers the 
probability of an unfavourable outcome while deciding 
on the need of accrual of tax with respect to ongoing 
tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex 
issues, which can only be resolved over extended 
time periods. Refer note 2.1(b) for Accounting policy 
in this regard.
	
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date, as 
explained under Note 2.1(b)(ii). The ultimate realization 
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation 
of future taxable profits during the periods in which 
those temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards 
become deductible. The Company considers the 
expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected 
future taxable income in making this assessment. The 
amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, 
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates 
of future taxable income during the carry-forward 
period are reduced.
c	
Property, plant and equipment
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge 
in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful 
life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The useful lives and residual values of Company’s assets 
are determined by management at the time the asset 
is acquired and reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period. The lives are based on historical experience 
with similar assets as well as anticipation of future 
events, which may impact their life, such as changes in 
technology. The policy for the same has been explained 
under note 2.1(l).
d	
Impairment of Investments
	
The Company reviews its carrying value of investments 
in subsidiaries and other entities annually, or more 
frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the 
recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is accounted for.	
e	
Business combinations
	
In accounting for business combinations, judgement is 
required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible 
asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. 
Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value 
of the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities 
and contingent consideration involves management 
judgement. 
These 
measurements 
are 
based 
on 
information available at the acquisition date and are 
based on expectations and assumptions that have been 
deemed reasonable by management. Changes in these 
judgements, estimates, and assumptions can materially 
affect the results of operations.
f	
Goodwill	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually once or when 
events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to 
which such goodwill pertains is less than its carrying 
value. The recoverable amount of cash generating units 
is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. 
The calculation involves use of significant estimates 
and assumptions which includes turnover and earnings 
multiples, growth rates and net margins used to calculate 
projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, 
future economic and market conditions.
g	
Defined benefit obligation
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans and the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method. An 
actuarial valuation involves various assumptions that 
may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These include the determination of the discount rate, 
future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term 
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive 
to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are 
reviewed at each reporting date. Also refer note 14.
h	
Employee stock options
	
The Company initially measures the cost of equity-settled 
transactions with employees using a Black Scholes 
Options Pricing model to determine the fair value of the 
liability incurred. Estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions requires determination of the 
most appropriate valuation model and the performance 
of the Company, which is dependent on the terms and 
conditions of the grant.
	
This estimate also requires determination of the most 
appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the 
expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend 
yield and making assumptions about them.
	
The assumptions and models used for estimating 
fair value for share-based payment transactions are 
disclosed in note 31.

Through its defined benefit plans, the company is exposed to number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:
	
	
Asset Volatility: The Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan assets 
underperform, this yield will create a deficit. The plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high 
grades. These are subject to interest rate risk.
	
	
Changes in bond yield: A decrease in bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by 
an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.
	
	
The company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework 
that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee 
benefit plans. Within the framework, the company's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by 
investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in 
the appropriate currency.

Cumulative value of previous years shortfall - INR 32 Mn
	
Reason for shortfall - The Company allocates CSR funds to on-going projects which are implemented beyond 1 financial 
year. These projects have set milestones, upon achievement of which, the next tranches of funds are released. A part of 
the total CSR allocation is ear-marked for such ongoing projects and will be released/utilized in the next financial years with 
the intent to achieve optimal objective of CSR funds, so allocated by the Company.
22 (b) Details of payments to auditors 
	
Figures in brackets are for previous year i.e. March 31, 2023
(b)	 Trade Receivables and Contract Balances
	
The Company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
	
A receivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material contracts 
are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is classified as a 
financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.

Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to 
clients is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different 
from the timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non 
financial assets as the contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
(c)	 Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognized 
as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when company expects to recognize these amounts as 
revenue. Applying the practical expedients as given in INDAS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining 
performance obligations related disclosures where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to 
customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time 
and material basis. Remaining performance obligation are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including 
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialized 
and adjustments for currency.
	
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is INR 
Nil Mn [March 31, 2023: INR 17 Mn] out of which INR Nil Mn [March 31, 2023: INR 17 Mn] is expected to be recognised as 
revenue in the next year. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

ii.	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value:
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments included 
in the above tables:
	
Derivative instruments: The company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with banks with investment grade 
credit ratings. These are valued using the forward pricing valuation technique, using present value calculations. The 
models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot and forward 
rates. As at March 31, 2024, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness 
assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
26. Financial risk management:
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s primary 
focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. The primary market risk to the company is foreign exchange risk. The company uses derivative financial instruments 
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purpose and not as trading 
or speculative instruments. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each 
customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. The demographics of the customer including the default 
risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates also has an influence on credit risk assessment.
a)	
Market Risk:
	
i.	
Foreign currency risk:
	
	
The Company operates globally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and 
consequently the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States, 
South Africa, United Kingdom and other regions, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. 
The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may 
fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations are adversely affected as 
the Indian rupee appreciates/ depreciates against these currencies. The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure 
arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of changes 
in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Company follows established risk management policies, to 
hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. The Company has designated certain derivative 
instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.
	
	
Company’s exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at March 31, 2024 in INR Million is as follows:

Figures in brackets are for previous year i.e. as at March 31, 2023
	
	
Sensitivity:
	
	
For the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, every percentage point appreciation/depreciation in the 
exchange rate would have affected the Company's profit and loss respectively:
	
	
-	
INR/USD by approximately 0.90% and 0.54%,
	
	
-	
INR/GBP by approximately 0.06% and 0.26%
	
	
-	
INR/ZAR by approximately 0.18% and 0.19%,
	
	
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on changes in income and expenses, due to every percentage point 
appreciation/depreciation in the exchange rates.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
	
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to 
mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts 
is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and 
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. The foreign exchange 
forward contracts mature within twelve months from Balance Sheet.

Credit risk
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from financial assets amounting to INR 25,388 Million and INR 
21,037 Million as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically 
unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the United States, South Africa, United Kingdom 
and elsewhere. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the 
credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company 
uses expected credit loss model to assess impairment loss or gain. The Company uses a matrix to compute the expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenue. The provision matrix takes into account available external 
and internal credit risk factors and Company's historical experience for customers. Refer note 36(i) for expected credit loss 
allowance basis ageing of trade receivable.
	
The movement in allowance for life time expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is given below:
	
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains 
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by 
adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns 
with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit 
or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

33. Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment atleast on an annual basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a 
Cash Generated Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combinations. 
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or group of assets.
Goodwill has been allocated to Digital and Application Services segment.
Goodwill with respect to Digital and Application Services operating segment acquired through acquisitions is further allocated 
to identified CGUs, mainly pertaining to Retail Consumer Services. 
The carrying amount was computed by allocating the net assets to CGU’s for the purpose of impairment testing. The recoverable 
amount is computed based on value-in-use method using a forecast period of 5 years. The value-in-use of respective CGU is 
based on the future cash flows using a discount rate range of 11.9% - 14.2% (March 31, 2023: 13.0%-16.3%) and 1.50% (March 31, 
2023: 1.50%) annual revenue growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years.
Goodwill movement is given below:
In respect of above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 as the recoverable value of the CGUs 
exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (combination of revenue without 
growth and moderate growth) did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below 
its carrying amounts.
34. Segment information

these ERP systems. However, since the new system has been implemented from October 1, 2023, which is under hyper care 
period (stabilization) period audit trails were not enabled from October 1, 2023, to March 19, 2024. Post stabilization of the 
system necessary audit logs have been enabled. However, since this is an evolving scenario, the Company is also evaluating 
and incorporating necessary changes as per requirements including updations of master data and changes at the underlying 
database level.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of Zensar Technologies Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Zensar Technologies Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Holding Company”), its subsidiaries (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”) comprising of the consolidated Balance 
sheet as at March 31 2024, the consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the 
consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and 
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including 
a summary of material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (“the Act”) 
in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as 
at March 31, 2024, their consolidated profit including other 
comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We 
are independent of the Group in accordance with the ‘Code 
of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant 
to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter 
below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter 
is provided in that context. 
We have determined the matters described below to be the 
key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We 
have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements section of our report, including in relation to these 
matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements. The results of audit procedures performed by 
us, including those procedures performed to address the 
matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition (as described in Notes 2.1(a) and 3 (a) to the consolidated financial statements)
The Group engages into various contracts for software 
development, and maintenance of software/hardware and 
related services . The contracts with customer’s have defined 
delivery milestones with agreed scope of work and pricing for 
each milestone based on the nature of service. On the basis 
of scope of work and terms, the pricing arrangement of these 
contracts is time and material and/or fixed price. 
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	 Obtained the understanding of the processes, systems and 
the controls implemented by the Group for recording and 
computing revenue and the associated contract assets 
and unearned revenue; and assessed the appropriateness 
of accounting policy with Ind AS 115.
2.	 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
management’s key internal financial controls around 
revenue recognition;
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue from fixed price, where the performance obligation is 
satisfied over a period of time has been recognised using the 
percentage of completion computed as per the input method 
based on Group’s estimate of total contract costs. Use of 
percentage -of-completion method requires the determination 
the actual efforts or costs expended to date as proportion of 
estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred.
Revenue from time and material contracts is recognised basis 
the time spent by employee/vendors on a contract as approved 
by the project manager. Such services are recognised as 
and when the services are rendered and/or approved by the 
customers. 
We identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter since:
 
 
There is an inherent and presumed fraud risk around the 
revenue recognition considering application of revenue 
recognition standard is complex and involves number of key 
judgements and estimates mainly in identifying performance 
obligations, related transaction price (including estimates 
of variable consideration) and estimating the future cost 
to completion of the fixed price contracts, which is used 
to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant 
performance obligation; 
 
 
Time and material contracts are billed basis approval 
of effort estimate by project manager and also through 
customer acceptances in certain cases; and
 
 
At year end, significant amount of unbilled revenue related 
to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
3.	 Tested sample revenue contracts and performed the 
following procedures to assess whether revenue is 
appropriately recognised as per principles of Ind AS 115 :
 
 
Evaluated management’s assessment with respect to 
identification of performance obligation;
 
 
Agreed 
the 
transaction 
price 
to 
the 
underlying contracts;
 
 
In case of time and material type contract, tested 
samples to verify whether revenue has been correctly 
recorded based on approved effort estimate by 
project manager and where applicable, is backed by 
customer acceptances wherever revenue is invoiced 
to the customer;
 
 
In respect of fixed price type contracts, tested samples 
to verify whether management has appropriately 
accrued revenue as per milestones defined in the 
contract with necessary approvals and the estimated 
cost to complete the contract is appropriate;
 
 
Assessed aging of unbilled revenue as on the balance 
sheet date and in case of aged items obtained 
reasons for delays if any and expected timelines for 
invoicing of the same.
 
 
Performed analytical procedures on unbilled revenue 
and customer margin’s and obtained reasons 
for significant variations in customer margins as 
compared to contracted margin if any.
4.	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements.
Impairment assessment of Goodwill (as described in Notes 2.1(f), 3(e) and 30 to the consolidated financial statements)
As at March 31, 2024, the group has the goodwill of INR 7,563 
million pertaining to various business combinations which 
took place in the past. The carrying value of goodwill is tested 
annually for impairment using discounted cash flow models of 
recoverable value compared to the carrying value of assets. A 
deficit between recoverable value and carrying value would 
result in impairment. Determination of recoverable amount is 
complex and typically requires a high level of judgment, taking 
into account different geographies in which the Group operates.
The key assumptions to the impairment testing model includes:
 
 
Projected revenue growth, operating margins and operating 
cash flows during the forecasted period,
 
 
Long-term growth rate beyond explicit forecast period and 
in perpetuity; and
 
 
Discount rate used
Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these 
assumptions and because of the materiality of the balance to 
the Consolidated financial statements of the Group, the matter 
is considered a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures include the following:
1.	 Assessed Group’s evaluation of identification of cash-
generating unit’s (CGU) and allocation of goodwill to the 
respective CGUs.
2.	 Tested 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
management’s key internal controls over the impairment 
assessment process.
3.	 Involved our specialists who evaluated the appropriateness 
of the model used and assessed the key assumptions 
of the cash flow forecasts including discount rates and 
terminal growth rates used; in consideration of current 
and estimated future economic conditions.
4.	 Compared previous forecasts to actual results for the 
past two financial years to assess the historical accuracy 
of the forecasting process.
5.	 Analyzed the consistency of cash flow forecasts 
with estimates presented to the Board as part of the 
Budgeting process.
6.	 Assessed recoverable value headroom by performing 
sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.
7.	 Tested the arithmetic accuracy of the models.
8.	 Obtained and read the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Migration to a new information technology (IT) system during the year
The Group used Oracle EBS as its primary ERP which was 
upgraded to Oracle Fusion in October 2023. The Group’s financial 
accounting and reporting systems are highly dependent on the 
effective working of their IT systems. The changes in IT systems 
represent a financial reporting risk as controls and processes 
that have been established and embedded over a number of 
years are likely to be revisited. The audit approach relies on the 
effectiveness of automated controls of these applications and 
controls around interface of systems. While transitioning to the 
new IT system, robustness of IT general and application controls 
is critical to assess that changes to applications and underlying 
data are made in an appropriate manner. Accordingly, we have 
identified the migration as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures performed with the assistance of our 
IT specialists included: 
1.	 Obtained an understanding of the changes in the IT 
environment, IT Infrastructure and the ERP system. 
2.	 Obtained an understanding of the process followed by 
the Company for implementing the new IT system- Oracle 
Fusion; and migration of data from erstwhile Oracle EBS 
to Oracle Fusion.
3.	 Tested IT general controls related to User and Application 
controls, Change Management Controls, Data backup 
and Audit Trail. Tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of the IT General Controls (ITGCs) and 
business processes post migration (both automated and 
manual) of Oracle Fusion, evaluated the impact of results 
in planning our audit procedures, and communicated 
any identified deficiencies to the management including 
those charged with governance.
4.	 Performed testing on a combination of compensating 
controls or remediated controls and /or performed 
alternative audit procedures, wherever necessary.
5.	 In relation to the system migration, evaluated the design 
and tested the controls specifically established over the 
implementation of Oracle Fusion.
6.	 Performed independent verification of the data migration 
and reconciliation between Oracle EBS and Oracle 
Fusion for a sample of general ledger and sub-ledgers to 
confirm completeness and accuracy.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when its become available and, in doing

inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to

Responsibilities 
of 
Management 
for 
the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in terms of the requirements of the 
Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial 
position, 
consolidated 
financial 
performance 
including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash 
flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of 
the Group in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors 
of the companies included in the Group are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of 
their respective companies and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of their 
respective companies to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of their respective companies.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
 
 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
 
 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
 
 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 
 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group of which we are the 
independent auditors and whose financial information 
we have audited, to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
audit of the financial statements of such entities included 
in the consolidated financial statements of which we are 
the independent auditors. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Zensar Technologies Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Holding Company”) as of and for the 
year ended March 31, 2024, we have audited the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiary which 
are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Controls 
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and 
its subsidiary, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding 
Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that 
the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained 
in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements were operating effectively as at March 
31,2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

Nagar Road, Pune, Maharashtra, India. The Company is 
listed on BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of 
India Limited. The Company along with its subsidiaries 
(together hereinafter referred to as “the Group”) are 
engaged in providing a complete range of IT Services 
and Solutions. The Group's industry expertise spans 
across Manufacturing, Retail, Media, Banking, Insurance, 
Healthcare and Utilities.
	
The Board of Directors approved the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended March 31 2024 
and authorized for issue on April 25, 2024.
	
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
INR and all amounts disclosed in the financial statements 
have been rounded off to nearest Million, unless 
otherwise stated. Amounts less than INR 0.5 Million are 
reported as “0”.
2.	
Basis of preparation
	
Statement of Compliance:
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), read together with 
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 as amended from time to time, presentation 
requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Act as 
applicable to the consolidated financial statements and 
other relevant provisions of the Act.
	
i.	
Historical cost convention:
	
	
These consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on historical cost basis and on 
an accrual basis, except for certain financial 
instruments which are measured at fair value or 
amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value 
of the consideration given in exchange for goods 
and services. Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. Fair value for 
measurement and/or disclosure purpose in these 
consolidated financial statements is determined 
on such a basis, except for share based payment 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 
102 Share-based Payments, leasing transactions 
that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 Leases, and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair 
value but are not fair value, such as ‘value in use’, in 
Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets.
	
ii.	
Current versus Non-current classification:
	
	
All assets and liabilities have been classified as 
current or non-current as per the Group’s operating 
cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III 
to the Act. Based on the nature of products and 
services and their settlement in cash and cash 
equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating 
cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current and 
non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
	
iii.	
Principles of consolidation:
	
	
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of Zensar Technologies Limited 
and its subsidiaries. The Company consolidates all 
entities which are controlled by it.
	
	
The Group establishes control when; it has power 
over the entity, is exposed or has rights to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has 
ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power 
over the entity. The Group re-assesses whether or 
not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances 
indicate that there are changes to these control 
elements. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins 
when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary 
and ceases when the Group loses control of the 
subsidiary. The results of subsidiaries acquired, 
or sold, during the year are consolidated from the 
effective date of acquisition and up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate.
	
	
The financial statements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intragroup 
balances, transactions including unrealized gain 
/ loss from such transactions and cash flows are 
eliminated upon consolidation. These financial 
statements are prepared by applying uniform 
accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-
controlling interests which represent part of the net 
profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are 
not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by 
the Group, are excluded.
	
	
The 
difference 
between 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
consideration received from disposal of investment 
in subsidiary and the carrying amount of its assets 
(including goodwill) less liabilities as on the date 
of disposal along with cost of sell is recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss being 
the profit or loss on such disposal of investment 
in subsidiary. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognised in the other comprehensive income are 
re-classified to the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that 
do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 
as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the 
Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted to reflect changes in their relative 
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between 
the amount by which the non-controlling interests 
are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognized directly in equity and 
attributed to owners of the Group. 
	
iv.	
Functional currency:
	
	
The functional currency of the Company and its 
Indian subsidiary is the Indian Rupee (“INR”). The 
functional currency of each foreign subsidiary is 
the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates.
2.1 	 Material accounting policy information
	
a)	
Revenue Recognition:
	
	
The Group derives revenue from information 
technology services, maintenance of software/ 
hardware and related services, sale of software 
licenses. These include revenue earned from 
services rendered on ‘time and material’ basis, time 
bound fixed price engagements and fixed price 
development contracts.
	
	
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of 
promised products or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration the Group 
expect to receive in exchange for those products 
or services. Revenue is measured based on 
transaction price, which is the consideration, net 
of indirect taxes, discounts, rebates, credits, price 
concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, 
penalties, or other similar items.
	
	
Revenue from time and material contracts is 
recognized as the related services are performed 
and revenue from the end of the last invoicing to the 
reporting date is recognized as unbilled revenue.
	
	
Revenue from fixed price maintenance contracts 
is recognised based on the right to invoice for 
services performed for contracts in which the 
invoicing is representative of the value being 
delivered. If invoicing is not consistent with value 
delivered, revenue is recognized as the services 
are performed. When services are performed 
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts 
over a specified period, revenue is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the specified period unless 
some other method better represents the manner 
in which services are performed.
	
	
Revenue on fixed price development contracts is 
recognised using the ‘percentage of completion’ 
method of accounting, unless work completed 
cannot be reasonably estimated. Percentage of 
completion is determined based on project effort 
expended to date as a percentage of total estimated 
project effort required to complete the project. 
The effort expended (or input) method has been 
used to measure progress towards completion as 
there is a direct relationship between input and 
productivity. If the Group does not have a sufficient 
basis to measure the progress of completion or 
to estimate the total contract revenues and costs, 
revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract 
cost incurred for which recoverability is probable. 
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an 
arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in 
the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the current contract estimates.
	
	
The billing schedules agreed with customers include 
periodic performance based payments and / or 
milestone based progress payments. Invoices are 
payable within contractually agreed credit period.
	
	
The solutions offered by the Group may include 
supply of third party equipment or software. 
In such cases, revenue for supply of such third 
party products are recorded at gross or net basis 
depending on whether the Group is acting as 
the principal or as an agent of the customer. The 
Group recognizes gross amount of consideration 
as revenue when it is acting as a principal and 
net amount of consideration as revenue when it is 
acting as an agent.
	
	
Contracts assets are recognised when there is 
excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. 
Contract assets are classified as unbilled revenue 
for time and material and fixed price maintenance 
contracts, when there is unconditional right to 
receive cash, and only passage of time is required, 
as per contractual terms. Invoicing to the clients for 
other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones 
as defined in the contract and, therefore, the

timing of revenue recognition is different from 
the timing of invoicing to the customers. The 
right to consideration in such cases depends on 
completion of contractual milestones.
	
	
Contract liability (“Unearned revenue”) arises when 
there are billing in excess of revenue.
	
	
In arrangements for hardware and software 
implementation and integration, related services 
and maintenance services, the Group has applied 
the guidance in Ind AS 115, by applying the 
revenue recognition criteria for each distinct 
performance obligation. 
	
	
Revenue recognition for delivered elements is 
limited to the amount that is not contingent on 
the future delivery of products or services, future 
performance obligations or subject to customer 
specified return or refund privileges.
	
	
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains 
a ‘right to use’ the licenses is recognized at the 
time the license is made available to the customer. 
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains 
a ‘right to access’ is recognized over the access 
period. The Group has applied the principles 
of Ind AS 115 to account for revenues for these 
performance obligations.
	
	
The Group accounts for volume discount and pricing 
incentives to customers as a reduction based on 
ratable allocation of the discounts/ incentives 
amount to each of the underlying performance 
obligation that corresponds to the progress made 
by the customer towards earning the discount/
incentive. Also, when the level of discount varies 
with increases in levels of revenue transactions, the 
Group recognises the liability based on its estimate 
of the customer’s future purchases. If it is probable 
that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or 
if the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably, 
then discount is not recognised until the payment is 
probable or the amount can be estimated reliably. 
The Group recognises changes in the estimated 
amount of obligations for discounts in the period in 
which the change occurs.
	
	
The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts 
with customers by nature of services, geography 
and industry verticals.
	
b)	
Income Tax:
	
	
i.	
Current Income Tax:
	
	
	
Tax expense comprises of current tax and 
deferred tax. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the current tax amount are those 
that are applicable for the reporting period. 
Current tax is measured at the amount 
expected to be paid to / recovered from the 
tax authorities, based on estimated tax liability 
computed after taking credit for allowances 
and exemptions in accordance with the local 
tax laws existing in the respective countries.
	
	
	
Current and deferred tax are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case, the income 
taxes are recognized in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
	
	
	
Income tax assets and income tax liabilities are 
presented in the consolidated statement of 
financial position after off-setting advance tax 
paid and income tax provision arising in the 
same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant 
tax paying unit has a legally enforceable right 
and intends to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.
	
	
ii.	
Deferred Tax:
	
	
	
Deferred 
tax 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
recognized 
for 
deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary differences respectively arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amount in financial 
statements, except when the deferred income 
tax arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profits or 
loss at the time of the transaction and does 
not give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the 
extent it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilized. 
	
	
	
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for 
all taxable temporary differences except in 
respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries and foreign branches where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
	
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realized 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates 
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
	
	
	
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable 
right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either 
the same taxable entity, or on different taxable 
entities where there is an intention to settle 
the current tax liabilities and assets on a net 
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be 
realized simultaneously.
	
c)	
Leases:
	
	
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. The Group assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the group 
assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use 
of an identified asset (2) the group has substantially 
all of the economic benefits from use of the asset 
through the period of the lease and (3) the group 
has the right to direct the use of the asset. 
	
	
Group as a lessee:
	
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-
term and low value leases, the Group recognizes 
the lease payments as an operating expense on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Certain lease arrangements include the options 
to extend or terminate the lease before the end 
of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities 
includes these options when it is reasonably certain 
that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets 
are initially recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior to the 
commencement date of the lease plus any initial 
direct costs less any lease incentives. They are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the 
value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows 
that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the future lease payments. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment 
to the related right of use asset if the Group 
changes its assessment of whether it will exercise 
an extension or a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset are separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease 
payments are classified as cash flows used in 
financing activities.
	
	
Group as a lessor:
	
	
At the inception of the lease the Group classifies 
each of its leases as either an operating lease or a 
finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments 
received under operating leases as income on a

straight- line basis over the lease term. In case of a 
finance lease, finance income is recognised over the 
lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant 
periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment 
in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate 
lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease 
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease 
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the 
right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not 
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head 
lease is a short term lease to which the Group applies 
the exemption described above, then it classifies the 
sub-lease as an operating lease.
	
	
Whenever 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
lease 
transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee, the contract is classified as 
a finance lease.
	
	
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 “Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers” to allocate the 
consideration in the contract.
	
d)	
Foreign Currency Translation:
	
	
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. 
Foreign 
currency 
denominated 
monetary assets and liabilities are restated at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date and 
exchange gains and losses arising on settlement 
and restatement are recognised in the statement of 
profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
foreign currencies are not restated.
	
	
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional 
currency other than the functional currency of the 
Group have been translated using exchange rates 
prevailing on the reporting date. Statement of 
profit and loss of such entities has been translated 
using weighted average exchange rates. Such 
translation adjustments have been recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). On disposal of 
a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating 
to that particular foreign operation is recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on 
initial recognition of the related asset, expense or 
income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-
monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to 
advance consideration, the date of the transaction 
is the date on which the Group initially recognises 
the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability 
arising from the advance consideration. If there 
are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the 
Group determines the transaction date for each 
payment or receipt of advance consideration.
	
	
Goodwill and fair value adjustments to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date.
	
e)	
Business Combinations:
	
	
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred in a business combination is measured 
at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of 
acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred 
by the Group, liabilities, including contingent 
liabilities assumed by the Group to the former 
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests 
issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are 
generally recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss as incurred.
	
	
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. After initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Intangible assets acquired in business combination 
are measured at fair value as of the date of 
acquisition less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is 
initially measured either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling 
interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share 
of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
	
	
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
	
	
When the consideration transferred by the group 
in a business combination includes assets or 
liabilities resulting from a contingent arrangement, 
the contingent consideration is measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and included as part 
of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Contingent consideration that is 
classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at 
subsequent reporting dates in accordance with 
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments or Ind AS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets, with the corresponding gain or loss being 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
	
	
If the initial accounting for a business combination 
is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in 
which the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting 
is 
incomplete. 
Those 
provisional 
amounts are adjusted through goodwill during 
the measurement period, or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would 
have affected the amounts recognized at that date. 
These adjustments are called as measurement 
period adjustments. The measurement period does 
not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
	
f)	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever there is any indication that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher 
of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) 
is determined on an individual asset basis unless 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In 
such cases, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset 
(or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) 
is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Goodwill
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual 
basis and whenever there is an indication that 
goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of 
factors including operating results, business plans 
and future cash flows.
	
	
The Group estimates the value-in-use of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future 
cash flows after considering current economic 
conditions and trends, estimated future operating 
results and growth rate and anticipated future 
economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated 
cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. 
The discount rate used for the CGU’s represent 
the weighted average cost of capital based on the 
historical market returns. 
	
g)	
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
	
	
The Group considers all highly liquid financial 
instruments, which are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash and that are subject to 
an insignificant risk of change in value and having 
original maturities of three months or less from the 
date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Cash and 
cash equivalents consist of balances with banks 
which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
	
h)	
Investments, other financial assets and financial 
liabilities:
	
	
i.	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities 
(other than financial assets and financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) 
are added to or deducted from the fair value 
measured on initial recognition of financial 
asset or financial liability.
	
	
	
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, 
as subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
fair value through other comprehensive income 
(OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. 
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Group’s business model for managing them. All 
financial assets are recognised initially at fair value

plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of 
the financial asset. Trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component 
or for which the Group has applied the practical 
expedient are measured at the transaction price 
determined under Ind AS 115.
	
	
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 
‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ 
on the principal amount outstanding. This 
assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and 
is performed at an instrument level. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are 
classified and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.
	
	
	
The Group’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages 
its financial assets in order to generate 
cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial 
assets, or both. Financial assets classified and 
measured at amortised cost are held within 
a business model with the objective to hold 
financial assets in order to collect contractual 
cash flows while financial assets classified and 
measured at fair value through OCI are held 
within a business model with the objective 
of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling.
	
	
	
The Group intends to hold its investment in open 
ended target maturity funds till maturity. It may 
be noted that these funds have a pre-determined 
maturity date. These funds follow a passive buy 
and hold strategy; in which the existing underlying 
investment bonds are expected to be held till 
maturity unless sold for meeting redemptions or 
rebalancing requirements as stated in the scheme 
document. In our view, such strategy mitigates 
intermittent price volatility in open ended target 
maturity funds’ underlying investments; and 
investors who remain invested until maturity are 
expected to mitigate the market/volatility risk to 
a large extent. Based on this, the Group believes 
that the investments in open ended target 
maturity funds meet the requirements of SPPI 
(solely payments of principal and interest) test as 
per the requirements of Ind AS 109.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, financial liabilities at 
amortised cost or as derivatives designated 
as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate. The Group’s financial liabilities 
include trade and other payables, and 
derivative financial instruments.
	
	
ii.	
Subsequent Measurement:
	
	
	
Financial assets carried at amortized cost:
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured at 
amortized cost if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
	
	
	
A financial asset is subsequently measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive 
income if it is held within a business model 
whose 
objective 
is 
achieved 
by 
both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets and the contractual terms of 
the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. Further, in cases where the 
Group has made an irrevocable election based 
on its business model, for its investments 
which are classified as equity instruments, 
the subsequent changes in fair value are 
recognized in other comprehensive income.
	
	
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL):
	
	
	
A financial asset which is not classified in any 
of the above categories are subsequently fair 
valued through profit or loss.
	
	
	
Financial liabilities
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method or at FVTPL. For financial 
liabilities carried at amortised cost, the 
carrying amounts approximate fair values 
due to the short term maturities of these 
instruments. Financial liabilities are classified 
as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either 
contingent consideration recognised in a 
business combination, or it is designated as 
FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated 
at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
	
	
The Group determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After 
initial recognition, no reclassification is made 
for financial assets which are equity instruments 
and financial liabilities. For financial assets 
which are debt instruments, a reclassification is 
made only if there is a change in the business 
model for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected to be 
infrequent. The Group’s senior management 
determines change in the business model as 
a result of external or internal changes which 
are significant to the Group’s operations. If the 
Group reclassifies financial assets, it applies 
the reclassification prospectively from the 
reclassification date following the change in 
business model. The Group does not restate any 
previously recognised gains, losses (including 
impairment gains or losses) or interest.
	
	
iii.	
Derecognition 
	
	
	
The Group derecognises a financial asset 
when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset to 
another party. If the Group retains substantially 
all the risk and rewards of transferred financial 
assets, the Group continues to recognize 
the financial asset and also recognizes the 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
	
	
The Group derecognises financial liabilities 
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations 
are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
	
	
iv.	
Impairment of financial assets (other than at 
fair value):
	
	
	
The Group assesses at each reporting date 
whether a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets and contract assets (unbilled 
revenue) is impaired. The Group recognizes 
loss allowances, in accordance with IND AS 
109, using the expected credit loss (ECL) 
model for the financial assets which are not fair 
valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance 
for trade receivables and unbilled revenue 
with no significant financing component is 
measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. 
For all other financial assets, expected credit 
losses are measured at an amount equal to 
the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk from initial 
recognition in which case those are measured 
at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit 
losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust 
the loss allowance at the reporting date is 
recognized as an impairment gain or loss in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
i)	
Interest and Dividend income:
	
	
Dividend income is recorded when the right to 
receive payment is established. Interest income is 
recognised using the effective interest method.
	
j)	
Derivatives and hedging activities:
	
	
The Group designates certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts as 
hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange 
risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges/fair value hedges, as applicable. 
	
	
The Group uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the policies of the Group which are 
approved by their respective Board of Directors. 
The policies provide written principles on the 
use of such financial derivatives consistent with 
the risk management strategy of the Group and 
its subsidiaries. The Group enters into derivative 
financial instruments where the counterparty is 
primarily a bank.
	
	
The hedge instruments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Group determines the existence of 
an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, 
amount and timing of their respective cash flows. 
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce 
the risk associated with the exposure being hedged 
is assessed and measured at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are 
no longer expected to occur, then the amounts 
that have been accumulated in other equity are 
immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange 
gains/loss in the statement of profit and loss.

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges 
are classified as:
 
 
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure 
to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset 
or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment.
 
 
Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure 
to variability in cash flows that is either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognized asset or liability or a highly probable 
forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk 
in an unrecognized firm commitment.
 
 
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign 
 operation
	
	
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are measured as described below:
	
	
Cash flow hedges:
	
	
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging 
instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are 
recognized in other comprehensive income and 
held in cash flow hedging reserve, net of taxes, 
a component of equity, to the extent that the 
hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is 
ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss and reported 
within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within 
results from operating activities. If the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized 
in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the 
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging 
reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.
	
	
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in 
the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence of 
the related forecasted transaction.
	
	
The Group enters into the contracts that are 
effective as hedges from an economic perspective 
but may not qualify for hedge accounting. The 
change in the fair value of such instrument is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
k)	
Offsetting financial instruments:
	
	
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the 
net amount is reported in the balance sheet where 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognized amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis or realize the asset on a net 
basis or realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must 
not be contingent on future events and must be 
enforceable in the normal course of business and 
in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of 
the Group or the counterparty.
	
l)	
Property, plant and equipment:
	
	
i.	
Recognition and measurement:
	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Cost includes 
expenditures directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. General and specific 
borrowing costs directly attributable to 
the construction of a qualifying asset are 
capitalized as part of the cost. 
	
	
	
When parts of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, they 
are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment. 
	
	
	
Freehold land is carried at historical cost.
	
	
	
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, 
plant and equipment is capitalized only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with these will flow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
charged to the statement of profit and loss in 
the reporting period in which they occur.
	
	
	
An item of property, plant & equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. The carrying 
amount of any component accounted for as a 
separate asset is derecognized when replaced. 
Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
retirement of an item of property, plant & 
equipment are determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds end the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
The cost of property, plant and equipment 
not available for use before year end date are 
disclosed under capital work- in-progress, net of 
impairment losses, if any and are not depreciated.
	
	
	
An asset's carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if 
the carrying amount of the assets or cash 
generating unit (CGU) as applicable, is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss. 
	
	
ii.	
Depreciation:
	
	
	
The Group depreciates property, plant and 
equipment on a straight-line basis as per 
the estimated useful lives. The estimated 
useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
are as follows:
Class of asset
Useful life
Buildings
30 years
Electrical Installations and 
equipments
5 years
Furniture & fixtures
3-10 years
Office Equipments
3-10 years
Data processing 
Equipments
3-5 years
Vehicles
5 years
	
	
	
Assets 
acquired 
under 
leasehold 
improvements are amortized over the shorter 
of estimated useful life of the asset or the 
related lease term. 
	
	
	
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and 
methods of depreciation are reviewed at each 
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
	
m)	
Intangible Assets:
	
	
Intangible assets other than those acquired in a 
business combination are measured at cost at the 
date of acquisition.
	
	
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortization 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
	
	
Internally 
generated 
intangible 
asset 
arising 
from development activity is recognized at cost 
on demonstration of its technical feasibility, the 
intention and ability of the Group to complete, 
use or sell it, only if, it is probable that the asset 
would generate future economic benefit and the 
expenditure attributable to the said assets during 
its development can be measured reliably.
	
	
An item of Intangible assets is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected to arise from the continued use of 
the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of Intangible assets are 
determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Amortization 
periods 
and 
methods 
for 
all 
Intangible Assets, including those arising from 
business combination:
	
	
Intangible assets are amortized on straight line 
basis over their estimated useful lives which 
are as follows:
Class of Intangible Assets
Useful life followed 
by the Group
Softwares (acquired)
1-5 years
Softwares (internally 
generated)
3-5 years
Non-compete agreements
3-6 years
Customer relationship
4-10 years
Customer contracts
1 -3 years
Brand
3-5 years
	
	
The amortisation method and the estimated useful 
life of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed 
atleast annually and where appropriate are 
adjusted, annually.
	
n)	
Provisions and contingent liabilities:
	
	
Provisions are recognized when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation.
	
	
When some or all of the economic benefits required 
to settle a provision are expected to be recovered 
from a third party, the receivable is recognized as 
an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement 
will be received and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably. The expense relating to 
a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any reimbursement.
	
	
When a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation,

its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows (when the effect of the time value of 
money is material)
	
	
The Group uses significant judgement to disclose 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation 
arising from past events, the existence of which 
will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Group or a 
present obligation that arises from past events 
where it is either not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be 
made. Contingent assets are neither recognised 
nor disclosed in the financial statements.
	
	
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by 
the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations 
under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts 
are measured at the present value of lower of the 
expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the 
expected cost of terminating the contract.
	
o)	
Employee benefits:
	
	
i.	
Post-employment and pension plans:
	
	
	
The Group participates in various employee 
benefit plans. Pensions and other post-
employment benefits are classified as either 
defined contribution plans or defined benefit 
plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the 
Group’s only obligation is to pay a fixed amount 
with no obligation to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to 
pay all employee benefits. The related actuarial 
and investment risks fall on the employee. The 
expenditure for defined contribution plans is 
recognized as an expense during the period 
when the employee provides service. Under a 
defined benefit plan, it is the Group’s obligation 
to provide agreed benefits to the employees. 
The related actuarial and investment risks 
fall on the Group. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligations is calculated by an 
independent actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. 
	
	
	
The Group has the following employee 
 benefit plans:
	
	
	
Provident Fund:
	
	
	
Employees receive benefits from a provident 
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. The 
employer and employees each make periodic 
contributions to the plan. Provident fund 
contributions are made to a trust administered 
by the Group. The contributions to the trust 
managed by the Group are accounted for as 
a defined benefit plan as the Group is liable 
for any shortfall, if any with respect to the rate 
of return based on the government specified 
minimum rates of return.
	
	
	
The Group’s liability is actuarially determined 
(using the Projected Unit Credit method) at 
the end of the year. Actuarial losses/ gains 
are recognised in the other comprehensive 
income, net of taxes in the year in which they 
arise. The contributions made to the trust are 
recognised as plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation as reduced by the fair value 
of plan assets.
	
	
	
Defined contribution plans
	
	
	
The 
Group 
provides 
benefits 
such 
as 
superannuation, provident fund (other than 
Company managed fund) and foreign defined 
contribution plans (401K, National Insurance 
in UK, etc.) to its employees which are treated 
as defined contribution plans.
	
	
	
Contributions to defined contribution plans 
are 
recognised 
as 
an 
expense 
when 
employees have rendered services entitling 
them to such benefits.
	
	
	
Gratuity:
	
	
	
The Group provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering 
eligible employees in accordance with the 
Gratuity Scheme of the Group. The Gratuity 
plan provides for a lump sum payment to 
eligible employees, at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment 
based on the last drawn salary and years of 
employment with the Group. The gratuity fund 
is managed by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India (LIC). The Group’s obligation in respect 
of the gratuity plan, is provided for based on 
actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method. The Group recognizes actuarial 
gains and losses in other comprehensive 
income, net of taxes. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to the statement of profit and loss 
in subsequent periods.
	
	
	
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in 
the Balance Sheet represents the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognized past service cost, and as reduced 
by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to the 
present value of available refunds and reductions 
in future contributions to the scheme.
	
	
ii.	
Short-term benefits:
	
	
	
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
recorded as expense in the statement of profit 
and loss as the related services are provided. 
Liabilities for wages and salaries including the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term 
cash bonus or profit sharing plans, expected 
to be settled wholly within 12 months after 
the end of the period in which the employees 
render the related service are recognized if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past service provided by the employee and 
the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
	
	
iii.	
Compensated absences:
	
	
	
The employees of the Group are entitled to 
compensated 
absences. 
The 
employees 
can carry forward a portion of the unutilized 
accumulating compensated absences and utilize 
it in future periods or receive cash at retirement 
or termination of employment. The Group 
records an obligation for compensated absences 
in the period in which the employee renders the 
services that increases this entitlement.
	
	
	
The Group’s liability is actuarially determined 
(using the Projected Unit Credit method) at 
the end of each year, as applicable. Actuarial 
losses/ gains are recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss in the year in which they arise.
	
	
	
Accumulated compensated absences, which 
are expected to be availed or encashed 
within 12 months from the end of the year are 
classified under current liabilities and balance 
under non-current liabilities.
	
	
iv.	
Share-based payments:
	
	
	
Selected employees of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled 
instruments, for rendering services over a 
defined vesting period. The cost of equity-
settled transactions is determined by the fair 
value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model.
	
	
	
The cost under employee benefits expense 
is recognised, together with a corresponding 
change in Share Based Payment Reserves 
under Other Equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are 
fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised 
for equity-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. Service 
and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant 
date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the 
conditions being met is assessed as part of the 
Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
	
	
	
Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other 
conditions attached to an award, but without an 
associated service requirement, are considered 
to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting 
conditions are reflected in the fair value of an 
award and lead to an immediate expensing of 
an award unless there are also service and/or 
performance conditions.
	
	
	
No expense is recognised for awards that 
do not ultimately vest because non-market 
performance and/or service conditions have 
not been met. Where awards include a market 
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, 
provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.
	
	
	
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised

is the expense had the terms had not been 
modified, if the original terms of the award are 
met. An additional expense is recognised for 
any modification that increases the total fair 
value of the share-based payment transaction 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as 
measured at the date of modification. Where 
an award is cancelled by the entity or by the 
counterparty, any remaining element of the fair 
value of the award is expensed immediately 
through profit or loss.
	
p)	
Dividends:
	
	
Dividend on share is recorded as liability on the 
date of approval by the shareholders in case of 
final dividend; or by the board of directors in case 
of interim dividend. A corresponding amount is 
recognized directly in equity.
	
q)	
Fair value measurement 
	
	
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell 
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. The fair value measurement is 
based on the presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
 
In 
the 
principal 
market 
for 
the 
asset 
or liability, or
 
 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market must 
be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset 
or a liability is measured using the assumptions that 
market participants would use when pricing the 
asset or liability, assuming that market participants 
act in their economic best interest.
	
	
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
	
	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements 
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial 
instruments measured using quoted prices. This 
includes listed equity instruments and mutual 
funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all 
equity instruments (including bonds) which are 
traded in the stock exchange are valued using the 
closing price as at the reporting period.
	
	
Level 2: Fair value of financial instruments that 
are not traded in an active market (for example, 
traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) but 
is determined using valuation techniques which 
maximize the use of observable market data 
and rely as little as possible on entity-specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair 
value an instrument as observable, the instrument 
is included in level 2.
	
	
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs 
is not based on observable data, the instrument 
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted 
equity securities, contingent consideration and 
indemnification assets.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
The 
Management 
determines 
the 
policies 
and procedures for both recurring fair value 
measurement, such as derivative instruments and 
unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, 
and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets 
held for sale in discontinued operations.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
	
r)	
Operating Segments 
	
	
The Board of Directors evaluates the Group’s 
performance and allocates resources based on 
an analysis of various performance indicators by 
business segments and geographic segments 
based on the “management approach” as defined 
in Ind AS 108. Accordingly, information has been 
presented both along business segments and 
geographic segments.
	
	
Segments are defined as components of an 
enterprise for which discrete financial information 
is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief 
operating decision maker, in deciding how to 
allocate resources and assessing performance. 
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the 
Managing Director. Information reported to the 
chief operating decision maker (CODM for the 
purposes of resource allocation and assessment 
of segment performance focuses on the types of 
goods or services delivered or provided. 
	
	
The accounting principles used in the preparation 
of the financial statements are consistently applied 
to record revenue and expenditure in individual 
segments, and are as set out in the material 
accounting policies. Revenue and identifiable 
operating expenses in relation to segments are 
categorized based on items that are individually 
identifiable to that segment. Certain expenses 
such as depreciation and finance cost, which form 
a significant component of total expenses, are 
not specifically allocable to specific segments as 
the underlying assets are used interchangeably. 
Management believes that it is not practical to 
provide segment disclosures relating to those 
expenses, and accordingly these expenses are 
separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted 
against the operating income of the Group.
	
	
The Board of Directors has identified below 
mentioned 
reportable 
segments 
of 
its 
business as follows:
	
	
Digital and Application Services (DAS): Custom 
Applications Management Services that include 
Application Development, Maintenance, Support, 
Modernization and Testing Services across a wide 
technology spectrum and Industry verticals.
	
	
Digital Foundation Services (DFS): Infrastructure 
management services includes Hybrid IT, Digital 
workplace, Dynamic Security and Unified IT 
provided under managed service platform using 
automation, autonomics and machine learning.
	
	
The Board of Directors monitors the operating 
results of its business units separately for the 
purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment 
performance is evaluated based on profit or loss 
and is measured consistently with profit or loss in 
the consolidated financial statements.

Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. 
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is 
recognised as income on a systematic basis over 
the periods that the related costs, for which it is 
intended to compensate, are expensed. When the 
grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income 
in equal amounts over the expected useful life of 
the related asset.

Earnings per share:
	
	
The basic earnings per share is computed by 
dividing the net profit for the period attributable 
to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. The number of shares used in computing 
diluted earnings per share comprises the weighted 
average shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per share and also the weighted average 
number of equity shares which would have been 
issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential

2.2 	 Recent accounting pronouncements
	
MCA issued amendments to certain Indian Accounting 
Standards (called as “Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023”) which were 
applicable from 1 April 2023. The Group applied for the 
first-time these amendments.
	
(i) 	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments 
to Ind AS 8
	
	
The amendments clarify the distinction between 
changes 
in 
accounting 
estimates, 
changes 
in accounting policies and the correction of 
errors. It has also been clarified how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. 
	
	
The amendments had no impact on the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements. 
	
(ii)	
Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Amendments 
to Ind AS 1
	
	
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ 
accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making 
decisions about accounting policy disclosures. 
	
	
The amendments have had an impact on the 
Group’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not 
on the measurement, recognition or presentation 
of any items in the Group’s financial statements. 
	
iii) 	 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities 
arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments 
to Ind AS 12
	
	
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial 
recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no 
longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal 
taxable and deductible temporary differences 
such as leases. 
	
	
The Group previously recognised for deferred 
tax on leases on a net basis. As a result of these 
amendments, the Group has recognised a separate 
deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities 
and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-
of-use assets. Since, these balances qualify for 
offset as per the requirements of paragraph 74 of 
Ind AS 12,there is no impact in the balance sheet. 
There was also no impact on the opening retained 
earnings as at 1 April 2022.
	
	
Standards notified but not yet effective
	
	
There are no standards that are notified and not yet 
effective as on date.
3.	
Critical estimates and judgements
	
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and 
the accompanying disclosures and including the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting date. However, any 
change in these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
	
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information 
about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are included in the following notes:
	
The areas involving critical estimates and/or judgements are:
	
a	
Revenue recognition
	
	
A portion of the Group’s business relates to fixed price contracts which is accounted using percentage of completion method, 
recognizing revenue as the performance on the contract progresses. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires 
the Group to estimate the efforts or costs expended to date ( input method) as a proportion of the total efforts or costs 
to be expended. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded 
in the period in which such losses become probable based on the expected contract estimates at the reporting date. This 
requires management to make judgement with respect to identifying contracts for which revenue need to be recognised 
over a period of time, depending upon when the customer consumes the benefit, when the control is passed to customer, 
and whether the Group has right to payment for performance completed till date, either contractually or legally.
	
b	
Income and Deferred taxes
	
	
Significant judgements are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including judgment on whether tax 
positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. The management considers the probability of an unfavourable 
outcome while deciding on the need of accrual of tax with respect to ongoing tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve 
complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods. Refer note 2.1 (b) for Accounting policy in this regard.
	
	
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, as explained under 
Note 2.1 (b) (ii). The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry forwards become deductible. The 
Group considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this 
assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term 
if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.
	
c	
Property, plant and equipment	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in 
respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the 
expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group’s assets are determined by 
management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The lives are based 
on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such 
as changes in technology. The policy for the same has been explained under note 2.1 (l).
	
d	
Business combination
	
	
In accounting for business combinations, judgement is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset 
is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent consideration involves management judgement. These measurements 
are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have 
been deemed reasonable by management. Changes in these judgements, estimates, and assumptions can materially 
affect the results of operations.

e	
Goodwill
	
	
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually once or when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which such goodwill pertains is less than its carrying value. The 
recoverable amount of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. The calculation 
involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which includes turnover and earnings multiples, growth rates 
and net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and 
market conditions.
	
f	
Defined benefit obligation
	
	
The cost of the defined benefit plans and the present value of the defined benefit obligation are based on actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves various assumptions that may differ 
from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases 
and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit 
obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Also refer note 14.
	
g	
Employee stock options
	
	
The Group initially measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees using a Black Scholes Options 
Pricing model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. Estimating fair value for share-based payment 
transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model and the performance of the Group, 
which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.
	
	
This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the 
expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
	
	
The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 37.

appropriation purposes. As the general reserve is created by a transfer from one component of equity to another and is 
not an item of other comprehensive income, items included in the general reserve will not be reclassified subsequently to 
statement of profit and loss.

(ix)	 Equity Instruments through Other Comprehensive Income	
	
The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in other 
comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated within the equity instruments through other comprehensive 
income within equity. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the underlying transaction 
is consummated.
(x)	 Exchange differences on translating the financial statements of a foreign operation
	
Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income as 
described in accounting policy and accumulated in a separate reserve within equity. The cumulative amount is reclassified 
to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed off.

As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, plan assets were primarily invested in insurer managed funds.
	
d	
Through its defined benefit plans, the Group is exposed to number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:
	
	
Asset Volatility: The Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields. If plan assets 
underperform, this yield will create a deficit. The plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high 
grades. These are subject to interest rate risk.
	
	
Changes in bond yield: A decrease in bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by 
an increase in the value of the plans' bond holdings.
	
	
The Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework 
that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee 
benefit plans. Within the framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by 
investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in 
the appropriate currency.
	
	
The Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected 
cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Group has not changed the process used to manage 
its risks from previous periods.
	
e	
The Group expects to contribute INR 167 Million (March 31, 2023 INR 16 Million) to the defined benefit plan during the 
next annual reporting period.
	
	
Weighted average duration of the Projected benefit Obligation is 7 Years (March 31, 2023 - 5 Years)

Reason for shortfall - The Group allocates CSR funds to on-going projects which are implemented beyond 1 financial year. 
These projects have set milestones, upon achievement of which, the next tranches of funds are released. A part of the 
total CSR allocation is ear-marked for such ongoing projects and will be released/utilized in the next financial years with 
the intent to achieve optimal objective of CSR funds, so allocated by the Group.
23	 Revenue from operations
(a)	 Disaggregate revenue information
	
The table below presents disaggregated revenues from contracts with customers by geography, offerings and contract-
type for each of our business segments. The Group believes that this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors.
	
Figures in brackets are for previous year i.e. March 31, 2023
(b)	 Trade Receivables and Contract Balances
	
The Group classifies the right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either receivable or as unbilled revenue.
	
A receivable is right to consideration that is unconditional upon passage of time. Revenue for time and material contracts 
are recognised as related service are performed. Revenue for fixed price maintenance contracts is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period of contract. Revenue in excess of billing is recorded as unbilled revenue and is classified as a 
financial asset for these cases as right to consideration is unconditional upon passage of time.
	
Revenue recognition for fixed price development contracts is based on percentage of completion method. Invoicing to 
clients is based on milestones as defined in the contract. This would result in timing of revenue recognition being different 
from the timing of billing the customers. Unbilled revenue for fixed price development contracts is classified as non 
financial assets as the contractual right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
	
Invoicing in excess of earnings is classified as unearned revenue.
	
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in Balance Sheet.
(c)	 Performance obligations and remaining performance obligations
	
The remaining performance obligation disclosures provide the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognized 
as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when Group expects to recognize these amounts as 
revenue. Applying the practical expedients as given in INDAS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance 
obligations related disclosures where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to customer of the 
entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on the basis of time and material 
basis. Remaining performance obligation are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, 
changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment of revenue that has not materialized and 
adjustments for currency.

Fair value hierarchy:
	
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are
	
(a) 	 recognised and measured at fair value, and
	
(b) 	 measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
	
To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its 
financial instruments into three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level follows 
underneath the table.

[March 2023 - INR 13 Million]
iii.	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value:
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments included 
in the above tables:
	
Derivative instruments: The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts with banks with investment grade credit 
ratings. These are valued using the forward pricing valuation technique, using present value calculations. The models 
incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot and forward rates. As 
at March 31, 2024, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment 
for derivatives designated in hedge relationships.
	
The main level 3 inputs for above mentioned cases used by the Group are derived and evaluated as follows:
	
1.	
unquoted equity instruments are valued based on expected cash flows discounted using weighted average 
cost of capital.
	
2.	
Financial liability is valued based on expected cash flows discounted using weighted average cost of capital and 
option-pricing models.
	
3.	
Contingent consideration: Fair value of contingent consideration is based on management's assessment of probable 
consideration payable discounted using weighted average cost of capital.
26	 Financial risk management:
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary 
focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purpose and not as trading 
or speculative instruments. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each 
customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. The demographics of the customer including the default 
risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates also has an influence on credit risk assessment.
a)	
Market Risk:
	
i.	
Foreign currency risk:
	
	
The Group operates globally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently 
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States, South Africa, United 
Kingdom and other regions, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange 
rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate 
substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are adversely affected as the Indian 
rupee appreciates/ depreciates against these currencies. The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from 
these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange 
rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group follows established risk management policies, to hedge forecasted 
cash flows denominated in foreign currency. The Group has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow 
hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.

Group's exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at March 31, 2024 in INR Million is as follows:
	
	
Figures in brackets are for previous year i.e. as at March 31, 2023
	
	
Sensitivity:
	
	
For the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, every percentage point appreciation/depreciation in the 
exchange rate would have affected the Group's profit and loss respectively:
	
	
-	
INR/USD by approximately 0.08% and 0.12%,
	
	
-	
INR/GBP by approximately 0.00% and 0.00%,
	
	
-	
INR/ZAR by approximately 0.00% and -0.01%,
	
	
-	
INR/EUR by approximately 0.04% and 0.10%
	
	
Sensitivity analysis is computed based on changes in income and expenses, due to every percentage point 
appreciation/depreciation in the exchange rates.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments:
	
	
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate 
the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally 
a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in 
active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. The foreign exchange forward 
contracts mature within twelve months from Balance Sheet.

The Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate 
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast sale transactions. The related hedge transactions 
for balance in cash flow hedging reserve are expected to occur and reclassified to the statement of profit or loss 
within 12 months.
	
	
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains 
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by 
adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns 
with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit 
or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.
	
	
The following table provides the reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve:
b)	
Credit risk
	
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from financial assets amounting to INR 33,246 Million and INR 
26,918 Million as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and 
are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the United States, Europe, South Africa and elsewhere. Credit 
risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness 
of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses expected credit 
loss model to assess impairment loss or gain. The Group uses a matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for 
trade receivables and unbilled revenue. The provision matrix takes into account available external and internal credit risk 
factors and Group's historical experience for customers. Refer note 40(i) for expected credit loss allowance basis ageing 
of trade receivable.
	
The movement in allowance for life time expected credit loss on customer balances for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is given below:

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group generally invest in deposits with banks and financial 
institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. Investments primarily 
include investment in liquid mutual fund units, quoted bonds issued by government organizations and non-convertible 
debentures issued by institutions with high credit ratings.
c)	
Liquidity risk:
	
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable 
price. The Group’s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. 
In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the 
Group’s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, 
cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.

Income and expenditure in relation to segments is categorised based on items that are individually identifiable to the segment, 
marketing costs are allocated based on revenue and the remainder of the costs are allocated based on resources. Certain 
expenses like depreciation are not specifically allocable to a segment as the underlying assets are used interchangeably
Finance income and costs, and fair value gains and losses on financial assets are not allocated to individual segments as the 
underlying instruments are managed at group basis. Also, Current tax, deferred taxes are not allocated to those segments as 
they are also managed on a group basis.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group’s business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used 
interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable or meaningful to provide 
further segregation of assets and liabilities, geographical or otherwise.
Geographical information on revenue and business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers 
invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognised.

30	 Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment atleast on an annual basis. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a 
Cash Generated Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies arising from the business combinations. 
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or group of assets.
Goodwill has been allocated to the following operating segment:

The carrying amount was computed by allocating the net assets to CGU’s for the purpose of impairment testing. The recoverable 
amount is computed based on value-in-use method using a forecast period of 5 years. The value-in-use of respective CGU is 
based on the future cash flows using a discount rate range of 11.9% - 14.2% (March 31, 2023: 13.0%-16.3%) and 1.5% (March 31, 
2023: 1.50%) annual revenue growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years.

In respect of above, no impairment was identified as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 as the recoverable value of the CGUs 
exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (combination of revenue without 
growth and moderate growth) did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below 
its carrying amounts.

(v)	 Data Back up in ERP system:
	
The Company and its Indian subsidiary were using legacy ERP (on premise) system till September 30,2023 and from 
October 1, 2023, the Company and its Indian subsidiary has migrated to new ERP (cloud-based system), an advanced ERP 
system. For legacy ERP system the back-ups were happening on daily basis and stored on servers within the Company and 
its Indian subsidiary. Weekly full back ups are happening in the new ERP system as per the audit report provided by the 
service organisation.
(vi)	 Audit Trail:
	
The Company and its Indian subsidiary was using legacy ERP (on premise) system till September 30,2023 and from October 
1, 2023, the Company and its Indian subsidiary has migrated to new ERP (cloud-based system), an advanced ERP system. 
The Company and its Indian subsidiary had enabled most of the logs in these ERP systems. However, since the new system 
has been implemented from October 1, 2023, which is under hyper care period (stabilisation) period audit trails were not 
enabled from October 1, 2023, to March 19, 2024. Post stabilisation of the system necessary audit logs have been enabled. 
However, since this is an evolving scenario, the Company is also evaluating and incorporating necessary changes as per 
requirements including updation of master data and changes at the underlying database level.
