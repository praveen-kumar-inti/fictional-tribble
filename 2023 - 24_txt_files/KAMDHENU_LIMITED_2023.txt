Waste

Steel production, a resource-
intensive sector, necessitates 
HIͤFLHQWUHVRXUFHXWLOL]DWLRQ
to achieve cost savings and 
environmental protection. 
Implementing effective 
strategies for waste and energy

Kamdhenu Limited places a high 
priority on waste management in

like recycling steel waste, using 
approved recyclers for disposal, 
and collecting/supplying waste

the risks associated with direct 
GLVSRVDOFRQWULEXWLQJVLJQLͤFDQWO\

Company has established clear 
protocols for the collection, 
storage, and disposal of waste.

Emissions 
and 
pollutants
7KHVWHHOLQGXVWU\VLJQLͤFDQWO\
contributes to air pollution and 
greenhouse gas emissions 
by using fossil fuels in its 
manufacturing processes. 
These emissions pose various 
environmental challenges, such 
as climate change, acid rain, and 
smog formation. Additionally, 
emissions from steel plants can 
pose substantial risks to human 
health and safety, particularly 
affecting workers within and 
around these facilities.
To mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, the Company adheres 
to CPCB emission and pollution 
regulations and has replaced coal 
with LSHS fuel. The Company has 
also implemented an induction 
furnace, which lowers electricity 
consumption and promotes 
cleaner processes. Additionally, 
alternative energy sources like a 
3.8 MW wind energy installation 
further contribute to reducing GHG 
emissions overall.
3
Water and 
wastewater 
management
Water usage can exert 
considerable environmental 
impact, especially when 
wastewater is discharged 
into water bodies. The steel 
industry, known for its high water 
consumption, contributes to 
concerns about water scarcity 
in various regions globally. 
Implementing effective water 
management strategies is crucial 
to reducing water consumption

footprint on local water resources.
Wastewater treatment serves 
various purposes, including plant 
irrigation. Kamdhenu Limited, as a 
conscientious steel manufacturer, 
has installed an Effluent Treatment 
Plant at its manufacturing facility. 
This initiative not only enables the 
Company to purify wastewater 
but also reduces its overall water 
consumption.

Energy 
management
The steel sector’s high energy 
consumption is a major 
contributor to greenhouse gas 
emissions and climate change. 
By decreasing energy usage, 
the industry can decrease its 
environmental footprint and 
play a role in mitigating climate 
change.
The Company has implemented 
several initiatives for energy 
management. Through the 
installation of wind energy capacity, 
Kamdhenu Limited offsets the use 
of non-renewable energy sources. 
Additionally, the Company has 
eliminated the use of coal in its 
manufacturing plant, reducing its 
reliance on non-renewable energy. 
Kamdhenu Limited continuously 
seeks alternative energy sources to 
mitigate its environmental impact.

policy’s provisions and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act,
