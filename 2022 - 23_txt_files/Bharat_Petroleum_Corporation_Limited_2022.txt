GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
1.	 Statement by Director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets, and achievements (listed 
entity has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure) 
	
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited has stood 
true to these insightful words in the past financial 
year with superb performance and lifting market 
share to the highest level. I am delighted to present 
to you the first edition of Bharat Petroleum’s 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(previously known as the Business Responsibility 
Report). The report has been prepared as per the 
formats provided by the Securities and Exchanges 
Board of India (SEBI). 
	
Today, corporations across the globe are being 
assessed on their ESG performance. As a public 
sector undertaking tasked with providing energy 
security to the citizens of the country, BPCL has 
always adhered to the principles of responsible 
business in conducting its operations. BPCL is one 
of the early adopters of ESG reporting in India. The 
Company first published its Sustainability Report way 
back in the year 2006. Over the years, the Company 
has been improving its disclosures, in line with the 
GRI standards.
	
It has been our topmost priority to uphold the 
principles of Corporate Governance to ensure 
transparency, integrity, and accountability in our 
functioning. We have in place strong frameworks 
that maintain high standards of ethical and 
responsible conduct of business. BPCL rigorously 
follows best HR practices. The Company encourages 
inclusive growth by providing employment and 
training opportunities to weaker sections of the 
society. Safety and well-being of our employees and 
contractual workers have always been a priority area 
of work. Safety continues to be the baseline of all our 
actions. We need to strengthen our culture of safety 
by being both proactive and prepared in the work 
environment as well as off work. 
	
BPCL is a responsible global citizen. As the flagship 
oil company of the country, BPCL has ensured that 
critical energy needs are met across the length and 
breadth of the country even during natural disasters 
or periods of national emergency. The Company 
is the leading implementing agency for many 
community development schemes of the Government 
of India such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana 
(PMUY), providing free LPG connections to BPL 
women, etc. BPCL R&D has pioneered several 
indigenous 
technologies 
in 
process/product 
improvements, in the spirit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. 
Our procurement policies are aligned to support

Contract Labour: All our contract labours across 
various locations and refineries, are mandatorily 
trained to a comprehensive training program 
including session on ‘Safety within the workplace’ 
prior to providing them access to the plant/location 
premises. 
10.	Health & Safety Management System 
a.	 Whether an occupational health and safety 
management system has been implemented by 
the entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such 
system?
	
Yes. BPCL has implemented a comprehensive 
Health, Safety, and Environment Policy that 
emphasizes the use of appropriate technology 
to reduce the environmental impact of our 
operations. BPCL refineries have been certified for 
ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 i.e., Quality, 
Environment, Occupational Health & Safety and 
50001 for Energy Management system. As part 
of these ISO certifications, Risks & Opportunities 
are identified with mitigation strategy and a 
detailed Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA), and aspect impact (AI) has been prepared 
and documented for all functions. BPCL HSSE 
policies provide the direction required to maintain 
and sustain a productive and safe workplace. To 
maintain high safety standards, every location has 
a HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and Environment) 
role holder. The primary responsibility of HSSE 
officer is to ensure adherence to the HSSE Policy. 
Safety protocols and SOPs are available to limit the 
incidents, mishaps, injury, exposure to hazards to 
BPCL personnel, contractual workers, customers, 
tank lorry drivers, and communities within 
which the BPCL operates. The Corporate Safety 
Management System (CSMS) and 12 Life Saving 
Rules (LSR) across organisation (Refinery and 
Marketing business units) are adhered by BPCL to 
achieve standardisation and enhance safety culture 
across the organization.
b.	 What are the processes used by BPCL to identify 
work-related hazards and assess risks on routine/ 
non-routine basis?
	
BPCL has developed Corporate Safety Management 
System (CSMS) which outlines a structured 
approach necessary for all operations to manage 
health and safety risks at “As Low as Reasonably 
Practicable Level (ALARP)” level and drive 
improvement in a consistent and systematic manner 
across the Company. It prescribes minimum safety 
management system compliance requirements 
and is applicable to all our operations, assets, 
facilities, employees, contractors, and important 
stakeholders. A portal has been developed for 
capturing incident reporting, leading, and lagging 
indicators, etc., which are very critical to learn 
and disseminate the learnings to take necessary 
corrective/preventive actions. The internal and 
external incidents reported in the system are 
investigated, analysed and thoroughly reviewed.
	
Hazard Identification & Risk Analysis (HIRA) study 
was conducted at all operating locations across 
the organisation in addition to Threat Vulnerability 
& Risk Assessment and Security Audits. At BPCL, 
Risks and Opportunities are identified with mitigation 
strategy and a detailed HIRA and Aspect Impact (AI) 
has been prepared and documented for all refinery 
and marketing locations. In addition, Quantitative 
Risk Analysis (QRA) and Hazard & Operability 
study (HAZOP) are also conducted in line with the 
Annual Report 2022-23
175
requirements of Oil Industry Safety Directorate 
(OISD) and Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory 
Board (PNGRB) guidelines. Such assessments are 
carried out for all new facilities and repeated after 
every five years.
	
BPCL has established Process Safety Events 
identification 
and 
Measurement 
System 
in 
accordance with American Petroleum Institute (API) 
Recommended Practice (RP) 754 Standard. BPCL 
ensures that process safety events are monitored, 
recorded, analysed and the learning is shared across 
the locations. BPCL Refineries have implemented 
Process Safety Management (PSM) principles with 
the goal of creating safe workplaces and preventing 
loss of containment that can cause disasters.  
	
BPCL has established Leading and Lagging Indicators 
which help in monitoring safety performance. 
Leading Indicators are a form of proactive monitoring 
focused on risk control processes and its elements 
to determine their continued effectiveness. It can be 
considered as measures of process monitoring to 
deliver the desired safety outcome. Whereas Lagging 
Indicators are a form of reactive monitoring. These 
incidents may or may not result in major damage or 
injury or loss of containment. They can be considered 
as measures of outcome monitoring.
	
BPCL undertakes regular safety audits to identify 
hazardous and unsafe acts, ensure compliance 
with standard operating procedures, and assess 
the performance of the company’s safety measures. 
External Safety Audits (ESA) are undertaken by the 
OISD, PNGRB, and the Petroleum & Explosives 
Safety Organisation (PESO) in addition to internal 
safety audits by multidisciplinary teams. Internal 
and external audit suggestions are strictly followed 
up and Surprise Dip Stick Audit (SDSA) mechanism 
was further strengthened to ensure the compliance 
towards 12 Life Saving Rules (LSR) at locations.
	
The Company focuses on formulation, review and 
enforcement of SOPs, safety in operations, statutory 
compliance, emergency preparedness, awareness 
creation and progress review on policy compliance. 
BPCL top management periodically reviews progress 
on compliance of various statutory audits and 
time bound action plans for redressal of safety 
observations.
c.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes. BPCL encourages its workforce to report 
hazards, unsafe situations and near misses. 
The incidents reported in the portal system are 
thoroughly investigated, Root Cause Analysis is 
undertaken and circulated online to all stakeholders 
to upsurge collaborative learning for safer 
operations and greater adoption of best practices. 
Awareness campaigns are organised to emphasise 
the value of reporting near misses to employees 
and contract labour.
	
Safety Committee meetings and Monthly Safety 
Theme events provides crucial forums for raising 
awareness of safety issues, sending out messages, 
and improving safety practises. These committees are 
structured with equal representation from workmen 
and management as per statutory requirements in 
which workers are given a platform to participate in 
resolving any safety issues/audit recommendation.
	
All functional heads, supervisors, workers, and 
contractual employees are encouraged to use safe 
practices in their daily routine as well as in operational 
planning and development activities. Workforce is 
urged to report issues and make suggestions for the 
Management of Change system. Safety protocols and 
SOPs are available to limit the incidents, mishaps, 
injury, exposure to hazards to BPCL personnel, 
contractual workers, customers, tank lorry drivers, 
and communities within which the BPCL operates.
d.	 Do the employees/worker of the entity have access 
to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/No)
	
The primary focus of BPCL on Occupation Health and 
Safety (OHS) refers to all aspects of health and safety 
in the workplace with particular focus on preventing 
accidents and hazards. The Company’s commitment 
to health and safety is also extended to its customers 
and the communities close to its operations. As per

9.	 Brief description of waste management practices 
adopted by BPCL, along with strategy adopted to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in 
products and processes, and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
1.	 Plastics (including packaging): As BPCL is in 
the business of Lubes manufacturing, packaging 
and selling of lubricants under the brand name 
of “MAK” in Indian market, as a brand owner 
BPCL is required to establish a system for 
management of plastic waste generated for 
sales of our products under Extended Producers 
Responsibility (EPR) for plastic waste recycling, 
vide policy notified on February 16, 2022 for 
plastic packaging undertaken for lubricants 
as brand owner. In the year 2022-23, BPCL 
Lubes business unit has collected 3,172 MT 
waste plastic from market and reprocessed it 
through CPCB-approved party, which has used 
this processed plastic in making various plastic 
items used in day-to-day applications.
	
2.	 E-waste: Electronic waste is disposed of 
by Refinery Warehouse through authorized 
recyclers as per the E-waste guidelines (Form-
3). In FY 2022-23 a quantity of 3.22 tons of E 
waste disposed.
	
3.	 Hazardous waste
	
	
a.	Spent Catalyst: As per CPCB guidelines, 
BPCL refineries have adopted a system 
for disposal of Solid Hazardous waste by 
recycling recoverable type of the spent catalyst 
through CPCB/SPCB-approved re-processors 
for recovery of metals. The rest spent solid 
hazardous waste is disposed of to a common 
treatment facility approved by SPCB.
	
	
	
Hazardous Waste Disposal sites or sites 
developed within refineries which are 
constructed with safety features like proper 
impermeable liners, leachate collection 
system, protection from rain etc. These sites 
are regularly monitored for ground water 
contamination.
	
	
b.	Slop Oil: Oily sludge waste generated 
during handing over of equipment/tankages, 
turnarounds or routine operations etc. is 
collected from various locations in refinery 
and it is sent to weathering pit for recovery of 
oil. After recovery by chemical and mechanical 
methods, residual sludge from weathering pit 
is sent for Bioremediation. Slop oil generated 
from process units is reprocessed along 
with crude in crude distillation column. At 
marketing and pipeline locations slop oil is 
recycled after decanting in sump tank and 
pumping back to product system.
	
	
c.	Oily Sludge: Oily sludge waste generated 
during handing over of equipment/tankages, 
turnarounds or routine operations etc. is 
collected from various locations, in refinery 
and it is sent to weathering pit for recovery 
of oil. After recovery of oil by chemical and 
mechanical methods, residual sludge from 
weathering pit is sent for Bioremediation 
which is a process that uses naturally 
occurring microorganisms to transform 
harmful substances to non-toxic compounds. 
As per Hazardous Waste Rules, 2016, oil 
content in sludge waste should be less than 
0.5% before it can be disposed of. 
	
4.	 Kitchen Waste: In BPCL refineries, a biogas 
plant has been installed, where refinery

thermal efficiency of cook-stove.
•	 Design of experiments (DOE) based Computational 
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analysis of LPG Domestic 
Cooking Stove Gas with carried out. Multiple 
prototypes of various components were fabricated 
based on extensive CFD simulation studies. Based 
on experimental validation and analysis, final design 
was firmed up.
•	 Test results indicated 74% plus thermal efficiency of 
the optimized domestic cook-stove, which is 5-6% 
higher than the presently available cook-stoves in the 
market.
•	 A domestic LPG cooking 
stove 
with 
improved 
thermal 
efficiency 
developed by BPCL is
