(R/O)

In case of risk, approach to

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1
Risk of 
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
There is a risk of 
occupational health 
and safety hazards to 
employees, contractors, 
or visitors, including 
injuries, hazardous 
exposure, stress, and 
ergonomic issues.
The Company mitigates 
occupational health and 
safety risks through regular 
on-the-job and classroom 
training, Root Cause Analysis 
(RCA) and use of drones for 
hazardous tasks. Employees 
are trained in safety gear 
usage and technical training 
records are maintained to 
ensure compliance and 
continuous improvement.
Negative: The Company 
faces occupational health 
and safety risks from 
inadequate training in 
machinery handling, electrical 
safety, and hazardous 
substances. Outdated or 
misaligned training can lead 
to accidents, downtime and 
non-compliance. Regular 
updated training is essential to 
ensure safety and operational 
efficiency.
2
Risk of 
Reliance on 
Few Suppliers
Risk
The Company relies 
heavily on a few vendors, 
especially Inox Wind, for 
critical components. This 
vendor concentration 
poses risks to operations, 
cost efficiency, and 
innovation, while limiting 
flexibility in adapting to 
market shifts and supply 
chain disruptions.
The Company has recognized 
its vendor dependency risk 
and is addressing it, especially 
for non-AMSC components 
where it isn’t heavily reliant on 
Inox Wind. To mitigate the risk, 
the Engineering and Quality 
teams are working to identify 
and qualify alternate suppliers. 
This will ensure technical 
compliance, enhance 
procurement flexibility, reduce 
dependency, improve cost 
efficiency and strengthen 
negotiation leverage.
Negative: The Company’s 
reliance on a limited supplier 
base exposes it to risks 
like delays, price volatility, 
and quality issues. This 
reduces bargaining power, 
limits access to innovative 
technologies and may hinder 
scalability, competitiveness, 
and resilience against future 
growth or regulatory changes.
3
Technological 
Advancements
Opportunity
Implementing new 
technologies can improve 
efficiency and lower 
costs.
Invest in Research 
& Development and 
collaboration with tech 
partners.
Positives: Reduced costs, 
enhanced operational 
efficiency and strengthened 
competitive advantage.
4
Market 
Demand for 
Green Energy
Opportunity
Growing demand for 
renewable energy 
solutions can drive 
market expansion and 
boost market share.
Expand renewable energy 
portfolio and market outreach
Positive: Increased revenue 
and market expansion

5
Risk of 
uncertain 
Weather 
Events
Risk
Extreme weather, 
supply chain delays 
and poor forecasting 
can disrupt operations 
and maintenance, 
affecting service delivery. 
Without insurance, this 
raises operational risks, 
penalties and customer 
dissatisfaction.
To mitigate weather-related 
risks, the Company issues 
emergency notices to 
wind farm operators and 
proactively shuts down 
turbines during severe 
conditions to prevent costly 
damage. Operations are 
swiftly restored once weather 
normalizes. Such events are 
covered under the Force 
Majeure clause in contracts, 
protecting the Company from 
penalties.
Negative: Unpredictable 
weather, such as storms 
and high winds, can delay 
maintenance and disrupt 
supply chains, affecting 
efficiency, uptime and 
contractual obligations. 
Without buffer times, this 
may lead to penalties and 
customer dissatisfaction. 
Using data analytics for 
forecasting and reviewing 
insurance coverage can 
improve preparedness and 
reduce weather-related risks.
6
Environmental 
Risk
Risk
Environmental risks, 
including reduced 
wind speeds, extreme 
weather, seismic activity, 
and stricter regulations, 
could impact energy 
generation, operational 
costs and profitability.
To mitigate environmental 
risks, our wind turbines use 
advanced coolant technology, 
enabling efficient operation at 
ambient temperatures up to 
50°C. Unlike others that curtail 
at 35–45°C, our turbines run 
without interruption, ensuring 
stable energy generation. 
This makes us the only O&M 
provider in India offering 
optimal turbine performance 
in extreme heat.
Negative: Environmental 
changes like rising 
temperatures and reduced 
wind speeds in key regions 
(Maharashtra, Andhra 
Pradesh, Karnataka) may 
lower energy output and 
impact revenue. Extreme 
weather can strain the 
grid and cause outages, 
while seismic risks threaten 
infrastructure. These factors 
increase O&M efforts and 
costs. Stricter land and wildlife 
regulations may also raise 
compliance expenses and 
affect profitability.
7
Remote 
Monitoring 
& Control 
through 
SCADA
Opportunity
Enables optimal wind 
farm performance and 
facilitates proactive 
maintenance.
N.A.
Positive: Reduces downtime, 
increases efficiency and 
lowers operational costs
