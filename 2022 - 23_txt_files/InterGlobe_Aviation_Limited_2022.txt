Sub:Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for the Financial Year 2022-2023 
 
Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
In compliance with Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, please find attached herewith the 
BRSR forming part of the Annual Report of the Company for the financial year 2022-23. 
 
The Net Worth of the Company for the financial year 2022-23 is (-) Rs.63,031 million. However, 
BRSRXBRL Utility File does not allow filling in negative value for net worth under General 
Disclosures Tab-> CSR Details –> Net worth and punching in 0 value, would be a wrong 
representation. We have therefore, filled in the net worth in the said field as Rs.63,031 in BRSR 
XBRL Utility File. However, it is a negative number and is accordingly represented in the BRSR 
PDF file being uploaded. 
 
This is for your information and record. 
 
Thanking you, 
 
Yours faithfully, 
For InterGlobe Aviation Limited

Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability  
Report (BRSR) FY 2023
The top 1000 listed entities in India, 
based on market capitalization, are 
required 
to 
include 
the 
Business 
Responsibility & Sustainability Report 
(BRSR) in their annual reports. The BRSR 
draws on the nine principles covered 
under the National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) 
and Business Responsibility Report 
(BRR) by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
(MCA). "A single comprehensive source of 
non-financial sustainability information 
relevant to all business stakeholders—
investors, shareholders, regulators, and 
the general public," is how the MCA 
characterizes the BRSR.
As part of the top 1000 listed companies 
in India, this requirement is applicable 
to InterGlobe Aviation Limited, hereafter 
referred to as “We”, “IndiGo” or “the 
Company” from FY 2023. In full compliance 
with the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (SEBI 
LODR Regulations), IndiGo has developed 
its second BRSR for FY 2023. The Company 
voluntarily published its first BRSR last year 
(for FY 2022). With the BRSR, we take the 
opportunity to apprise our stakeholders, 
of the Company's responsible business 
initiatives, along with the Company's 
approach to building long-term value. 
We are aware that IndiGo’s responsible 
business conduct extends beyond reporting 
and must be supported by the Company 
taking the necessary steps to ensure 
sustainability in the right spirit and continue 
to take measures actively in this direction.

Executive Summary
InterGlobe Aviation Limited is a leading air transportation company in India. As of March 2023, we had 304 
aircraft in our fleet. With a presence in 78 domestic and 261 international cities, we served around 86 million 
passengers in FY 2023.
Our network not only serves needs of people living in metros, but also serves the needs of people living in remote 
parts of the country. We take pride in being a part of the Government of India’s “UDAN” scheme which is focused 
on providing flying opportunities to common people of the country. These efforts also help in generation of direct 
and indirect employment in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in India. Our ambition is well formulated in our purpose of 
‘Giving wings to the nation, by connecting people and aspirations’.
Aviation industry contributes slightly over 2% of overall global CO2 emissions. As an airline, we are aware of our 
environment related responsibilities and are taking steps to mitigate climate related risks. Since 2011, we have 
made our aircraft investments in latest generation Airbus A320 NEO aircraft which are 15% more fuel efficient, 
compared to the earlier generation aircraft. With our investments in the new generation aircraft, we have been 
able to reduce CO2 footprint by around 20% since FY 2016. These aircraft also have a lower noise footprint. In 
addition, we are making investments in electrification of our ground equipment and usage of renewable energy 
wherever an opportunity exits.
We have made efforts in elimination of waste in a responsible manner and have made significant replacements 
of single use plastic items in our flights with biodegradable and eco-friendly options.  
Since IndiGo’s inception, we have taken initiatives towards creation of a social and inclusive work culture, where 
people are valued for their talent, skill and performance. We follow workplace policies which stimulate gender 
diversity and provide inclusivity to people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community. This report 
also details out our approach to creating social impact and achieving a transparent organization on a foundation 
of strong governance. We hope that the report will be helpful in furthering the understanding of our ESG approach 
and initiatives that we undertake with the support of all our stakeholders.

1
Climate change
Risk
Climate is an 
important part of 
our environmental 
responsibility. We are 
committed to reduce our 
carbon footprint. Some 
of the key climate risks 
that we foresee are:
•	 Policy and legal 
risk from emerging 
regulatory changes 
e.g., CORSIA 
•	 Increased fuel cost 
e.g., SAF
•	 Reduced 
demand due to 
stigmatization of 
sector
•	 We are closely 
monitoring 
the regulatory 
developments, so that 
we can better respond 
to the requirements. 
Our investments in 
fuel efficient aircraft 
will help us to reduce 
our carbon offset 
requirements under 
CORSIA
•	 Sustainable aviation 
fuel is one of the 
proposed solutions 
towards mitigating 
CO2 emissions, we are 
working with regulators 
and oil marketing 
companies to identify 
cost effective solutions
•	 Communication with 
customers on IndiGo’s 
low carbon footprint 
shall help IndiGo to 
position itself as a 
greener airline option 
compared to other 
airlines
•	 Policy action in 
recent years point 
towards a stricter 
regime, e.g., CORSIA 
requirements require 
airline companies to 
offset carbon emissions 
from international 
operations, resulting 
in higher cost of 
operations
•	 The cost of Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel is 
disproportionately 
higher than the cost 
of normal jet fuel. This 
may result in a higher 
cost of operations, in 
the coming years
•	 Increased focus on 
climate related risks 
globally may create a 
sector perception risk 
in the long term. Few 
business customers 
may potentially 
adopt to substitution 
methodologies, which 
may have a bearing on 
demand for air traffic
2
Fuel and energy 
conservation
Opportunity
Fuel and energy 
conservation is critical 
to reduce our carbon 
footprint and to reduce 
our cost of operations. 
Our strategies to 
achieve these objectives 
are:
•	 Fleet strategy
•	 Flight Operations 
•	 Ground operations 
•	 Sustainable office 
spaces
•	 IndiGo’s fleet strategy 
has three key features-
i.	 Investments in fuel 
efficient aircraft, A320 
NEO aircraft are 15% 
fuel efficient compared 
to old generation 
aircraft
ii.	 Young fleet- IndiGo 
maintains a young 
aircraft fleet, currently 
the average fleet age 
is 3.5 years
•	 Light weight aircraft 
•	 Our flight operations 
Standard operating 
procedures “SOP’s” are 
designed to optimize 
fuel cost
•	 Usage of Ground 
Power Units and Air 
Conditioning Units 
instead of Auxiliary 
power units 
•	 Deploy alternative 
energy sources 
wherever possible
•	 Utilize energy efficient 
practices in all 
corporate offices and 
airport
•	 Fuel cost comprises 
40-50% of the total 
airline cost and 15% 
improvement in fuel 
consumption results in 
significant cost savings
•	 Younger aircraft are 
relatively fuel efficient, 
and result in lower cost
•	 Low aircraft weight 
results in lower fuel 
burn, thereby resulting 
in lower cost
•	 Usage of Ground power 
unit and ACUs help in 
reducing the cost of 
operations and have a 
better carbon footprint

3
Waste 
management
Opportunity and risk
Waste from different 
parts of operations 
may result in pollution 
and contamination of 
earth, water and air. We 
are focused on proper 
waste management and 
elimination of single use 
plastic.
•	 Well defined waste 
management processes 
•	 Appropriate disposal 
of waste (discarded 
cabin seats, waste oil 
and oil filters etc.) as 
per regulatory norms to 
authorized vendors
•	 E-waste managed by 
ISO certified vendors
•	 Damaged or worn-out 
plastic, rubber, or metal 
parts are replaced 
regularly
•	 Substitution of Single 
use plastics products 
with biodegradable 
and recyclable options
•	 Recycling opportunities 
help in cost savings
•	 Reduction of Single 
use plastics results in 
improved environmental 
footprint, creates right 
customer perception 
and prevents any cost 
in form of fines and 
penalties
4
Aircraft noise
Risk
Aircraft noise is a source 
of community annoyance 
and health concern. 
We have mitigated risk 
related to aircraft noise 
by making investments 
in the latest generation 
aircraft.    
•	 Fleet upgradation to 
meet International 
Civil Aviation noise 
certification standards. 
Airbus and ATR fleets 
are compliant with 
Chapter 14 of ICAO 
Annex 16
•	 Freighter aircraft 
compliant with Chapter 
4 of ICAO
•	 Reduced flap and thrust 
take-offs.
•	 Reduced flap Landing
•	 Use of specific 
departure and arrival 
procedure which avoids 
populated area
•	 Aircraft noise if not 
maintained under the 
permissible limits, 
carries risk of fines in 
the medium to long 
term
5
Diversity and 
inclusion
Opportunity
Creation of a diverse 
and inclusive work 
environment is pivotal to 
creating a sustainable 
business. The work 
environment should be 
free from discrimination 
and sensitive to the 
needs of different 
sections of workforce. 
Some of our diversity 
priorities are appearing 
below:
•	 Prioritization of 
gender diversity 
•	 Discrimination free 
environment.
•	 Inclusive work 
practices
•	 Inclusion of LGBTQ 
community
•	 Inclusion of 
differently abled 
employees
•	 IndiGo has a healthy 
gender ratio
•	 IndiGo has initiated 
recruitment drives to 
employ women who 
had taken a career 
break
•	 Encourage women’s 
advancement in the 
workplace by providing 
flexible work options
•	 Promote an equal 
opportunity 
environment, where 
everyone can display 
their talents regardless 
of gender, age, 
nationality, race, 
ethnicity, religion, 
social status, disability, 
sexual orientation or 
gender identity
•	 Provide employment 
opportunities to 
candidates with 
physical disabilities 
•	 LGBTQ inclusive culture
Diverse workplace leads to 
•	 Talent retention 
•	 Improved customer

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets, and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) Response:
At IndiGo, we take pride in our commitment to prioritize responsible business practices, ethical conduct and sustainability with 
integration of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects in our business operations. As we continue to mature on our 
ESG journey, we continue to prioritize critical initiatives aimed at transforming our Company into an ESG thought leader within 
the aviation sector both in India and globally. These efforts span the length and breadth of our organization from deploying one 
of the most energy efficient fleets in the world, to implementing DEI programmes, and focusing on building the skills and capacity 
of our employees among others.
As an aviation company, we recognize the vital importance of managing our carbon footprint effectively. Our fleet is comprised 
primarily of Airbus A320 NEO family aircraft which are 15% more energy efficient than the older generation Airbus A320 CEO 
family aircraft. Apart from this we have also implemented a slew of operational measures to conserve as much fuel as possible 
during take-off, cruise and landing. Our ground operations team is also working towards gradually phasing out diesel operated 
equipment and replace them with electric equipment where possible.
We continue to work with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Indian Institute of Petroleum (CSIR-IIP) in our aim to use 
SAF in the future. We are working with relevant stakeholders to accelerate the viability of SAF in the aviation sector, since SAF 
is critical in transition towards a low-carbon pathway. As a renewable and low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel that can 
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, SAF represents the best option for airline companies to decarbonize in the short 
to medium term while we await the eventual transition to hydrogen in the long-term. By using SAF, we can reduce upstream and 
downstream greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This significant reduction in emissions can 
contribute towards achieving our sustainability goals and mitigating our impact on the environment. However, global limited SAF 
availability reduces our reach on this front.
Moreover, we are steadily making progress to manage plastic waste on our flights and are phasing out single-use plastic. We 
also have innovative programs in place to recycle the seats and carpets in our aircraft into products like bags. 
We are committed towards Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in workplace. With one of the highest number of women pilots among 
global airlines, we have created an environment of inclusivity. We have policy and initiatives in place to increase the numbver of 
women in management positions and joined IATA’s 25 by 2025 initiatives that focuses on increasing women leadership to 25%. 
Additionally, we have taken steps to ensure that people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals feel supported and valued at 
IndiGo. We believe in enabling a supportive culture which treats people equitably and celebrates differences.
We have also aligned our efforts with ensuring every Indian citizen has the accessibility to fly under the UDAN initiative launched 
by the Government of India and the Civil Aviation Ministry of India. Under this scheme, IndiGo has flown over 8,00,000 passengers 
in FY 2023. Furthermore, we are continuously expanding our network coverage to ensure that we cover more customers and are 
on track to connect the states in the northeast, with the rest of India. In this past year, we have flown over 650 flights under the 
UDAN scheme to ensure the common man has the same 6E experience which has been cherished by our customers over the span 
of 16 years.  
As a socially responsible organization, we understand that our efforts through our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives continue to positively impact the lives of many people. With our CSR arm, IndiGo Reach, we have supported over 
40,000 students this year through our education programs, enabling them to achieve their dreams. More than 50,000 women 
have been empowered through our livelihood enhancement programs, providing them with the necessary skills and resources 
to take control of their futures. We have also rallied and joined hands with nearly 19,000 individuals who are committed to 
conservation of the ecosystem, waste reduction, eco-restoration, and upcycling projects. Our local outreach efforts to societies 
we serve include afforestation and tree plantation in certain rural areas to aid efforts to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, 
we continue to focus our efforts on heritage restoration in collaboration with the Aga Khan Foundation.
We are proud of our progress towards becoming a more sustainable and inclusive company, but we know that there is still more 
work to be done. We invite all our stakeholders to read our ESG report and provide feedback at IndiGoGreen@goindigo.in. Your 
feedback is critical in helping us reach new heights on our ESG journey.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste:
	
Response: IndiGo believes in going beyond compliance and has taken numerous steps to improve waste management practices 
across its operations. The maintenance of equipment such as equipment filters, batteries, plastic materials, rubber/metal components, 
and tires generates waste that needs to be properly managed. At IndiGo, the crew is responsible for collecting, cataloguing, sorting, 
and storing this debris in the scrapyard. To facilitate the disposal of garbage, our ground support staff classify it into seven different 
categories, which include rubber, plastic, metal, batteries, tires, lubricants, and old flyers.
	
To ensure that waste is properly managed, we have implemented a set of steps for reusing, recycling, and disposing of waste. These 
include:
	
a)	 Segregating plastic waste and disposing it off with authorized vendors who are ISO certified. 
	
b)	 Disposing of batteries to authorized vendors once they reach the end of their life cycle. 
	
c)	
Regularly emptying ground equipment waste oils, such as engine oil/hydraulic oil, at specified intervals, such as hourly, calendar, 
or by kilometre. 
	
d)	 Re-threading worn-out tires through three rounds before being discarded. 
	
e)	 Delivering scrap/waste oil to vendors under the supervision of IndiGo and the airport operators.
	
These measures reflect our commitment to environmental sustainability, and we take pride in managing waste in a responsible and 
eco-friendly manner. As a result, we aim to minimize our environmental impact and contribute to a better and more sustainable future 
for all stakeholders, including our valued investors.

10. Health and safety management system:
a.
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the
coverage such system?
Response: IndiGo believes that a safe and healthy work environment is a pre-requisite for employee well-being, and the
adoption of best practices in occupational health and safety have a direct impact on its overall performance. As mandated by
the Directorate General before Civil Aviation (DGCA) under the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), We have implemented an
occupational health and safety management system. Our SOPs are modified using Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) principles
based on current scientific data in the following areas:
•
Crew fatigue reporting
•
Systematic testing for alcohol
•
Psychoactive drug testing
•
Advisory for passengers
b.
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
Response: : IndiGo places great emphasis on safety management and has established various processes and technologies to
ensure the safety of its operations. The Company’s Safety Management System (SMS) is the foundation that enables IndiGo to
operate safely.
Integrum, a safety reporting application that allows employees to report possible hazards in the form of required and optional
reports. This technology is an essential part of IndiGo's Safety Management System (SMS) and Structured Safety Process (SSP)
frameworks, which include both proactive and reactive components.
The reactive component of IndiGo's SMS and SSP frameworks involves investigating accidents and incidents that occur within
the system. This investigation process is crucial because it identifies the underlying causes of accidents and incidents, provides
lessons learned, and contributes to the continual improvement of the aviation system. IndiGo has a sophisticated system in
place to collect all network incidents, which are then reported to regulatory authorities by the Flight Safety department as
needed.
InterGlobe Aviation Limited
Annual Report 2022-23

Each occurrence is investigated in collaboration with stakeholders concerned, including flight operations, engineering, inflight 
services, airport operations and customer services, OEMs, and airport operators to determine the root cause(s) and contributory 
factor(s). Based on the findings, mitigation actions are formulated to prevent future occurrences. IndiGo's Permanent Investigation 
Board, in collaboration with the regulatory authority, investigates all major events.
	
	
In summary, a continuous encouragement on safety culture has resulted in increase in safety awareness across the operational 
staff, which is evident by the type and number of reports being received by Flight Safety. IndiGo's commitment to safety is 
demonstrated by its Safety Management System and Structured Safety Process frameworks, and the use of technologies like 
Integrum. Additionally, the thorough investigation of accidents and incidents and the formulation of mitigation actions to prevent 
future occurrences are key elements of IndiGo's safety management approach.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N) 
	
	
Response: IndiGo is committed to prioritizing the health and safety of its employees, recognizing that it has a direct impact on 
the Company's business and strategic plans. The Company takes a proactive and determined approach to identify and prevent 
potential hazards, and to safeguard its personnel. A holistic approach is taken to address all health-related issues in the 
workplace, with the aim of minimizing incidents.
