The Brigade Group recognizes the real estate sector's role in climate change, the responsibility of land use and the people employed to develop it and the 
customers that use these spaces for their daily activities. The Group has always held the conviction that sustainability and profitability go hand in hand 
and that a company's long-term performance is influenced by the proactiveness with which it addresses its environmental, social, and governance 
components. Therefore, this year, a deliberate decision was taken by the Board at Brigade Group to recalibrate our approach to sustainability and be part 
of the solution instead. 
 
Our new strategic sustainability vision is "Scaling new heights for a sustainable future". We have set clear ambitions -near and long term - across 
fourteen ESG focus areas under three sustainability pillars:  
 
1. Scaling sustainable operations for the planet: By adopting Eco-friendly practices across our operations  
2. Scaling livable spaces for communities: By developing spaces that improve the quality of life of communities   
3. Scaling good governance for shareholders: By conducting our business with the utmost integrity and good governance    
 
The Group is confident that we will achieve these ambitions in a methodical, well-governed manner such that the lives we touch through our operations 
and the spaces we build and manage continue to have a positive impact in the long run.

10. Health and Safety Management System: 
 
a) Has an occupational health and safety management system been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of 
such a system? 
 
Yes, as a real estate development and management organization, a well-established Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System is crucial 
to eliminate health and safety hazards and manage potential risks. The management system helps an organization in developing well-defined procedures 
and holistic health and safety practices across offices and construction sites. The organization has an ISO 45001:2018 certified OHS Management System. 
The standard ensures systematic identification, assessment, and monitoring of health and safety related risks and opportunities. The health and safety 
assessment conducted in the organization evaluates risks using the standard severity versus likelihood approach basis which necessary mitigation 
strategies are developed. The Group identifies areas of improvement through periodic analysis of the health and safety performance of all offices and 
construction sites.   
 
All the employees, including the contractual workforce, are covered under the Group’s OHS Management System. The coverage for the reporting period 
included a total of 1978 male employees 378 female employees and 14359 contractual workers.

ergonomics. The organization's ISO 450001:2018 certified OHS management system defines procedures and practices to be followed across all managed 
spaces and construction sites. The Group ensures that all applicable laws and regulations are followed.  
 
The OHS management system of the Group has identified potential hazards and risks and the required control measures to eliminate the same. The risks 
are categorized based on severity and likelihood, and the lagging and leading indicators are captured and analyzed, and monitored based on reduced 
incidents, near misses, first aid, unsafe acts, and unsafe conditions.  
 
Across all real estate development sites, the organization conducts regular hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) for all routine and non-
routine activities before commencing construction. This is reviewed every six months, and necessary revisions are made per the requirements.  
The control mechanisms followed at the sites are elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective 
equipment. A few of the measures being practiced at the sites include safety nets, lifelines, fall arrestor systems, closing all cutouts, lift shafts, and 
plumbing shafts that are used for safety. Daily site visits are conducted to ensure compliance with these measures, and workers who follow all best 
practices are given a "Helmet of Honour" as a form of motivation. The organization ensures process quality by conducting regular safety training, 
equipment handling training, and adherence to daily applicable checklists, permits, and formats.  
 
For the properties the Group manages, all employees and workers are provided with training on safety measures and the protocols in place for emergency 
response. The organization conducts periodic mock drills for emergencies such as fire outbreaks, earthquakes, etc. All guests and tenants accommodating 
the properties are informed about the safety measures implemented in the buildings. To ensure the safety and well-being of all employees, workers, and 
customers, the Group conducts periodic maintenance checks for all elevators, escalators, and other machinery.

safe and secure working environment. One such initiative is “Toolbox Talks” - it is a direct communication medium for the workers to raise their concerns 
and queries with supervisors onsite, during site visits and safety committee meetings. 
 
Brigade Group has established a Joint Management-Worker Committee which has 50% participation from worker representatives and is chaired by  
Respective project heads of each project. The committee meets once a month and conducts site tours - ensuring direct interaction with workers, 
understanding their concerns and gathering their feedback. Workers across all levels participate in this two-way consultation process with the employers 
to drive best practices across health and safety. 
 
d) Do the employees of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes / No) 
 
Yes, workers are provided access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services through weekly doctor visits and monthly medical camps. All 
project sites are equipped with a medical room and a nurse. All workers can access the medical room during emergencies. The company collaborates with 
nearby hospitals for all medical emergencies. It conducts programs to promote workers' health and address significant non-work-related health risks. The
