Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG   related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
One of our primary imperatives is to do business in a responsible and sustainable manner. We began tracking and reporting 
our Green House Gas (GHG) emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 with the base year set at 2021-2022. We also strive to 
optimise our water use, electricity consumption, and waste generation. By doing so, we ensure compliance with statutory 
requirements and gain a comprehensive understanding of our resource utilisation and waste management practices.
 We are also actively exploring renewable energy sources like solar power to further lower our Scope 2 GHG emissions. 
During fiscal year 2022-23, the solar power plant at the Aurangabad Plant generated about 1.8MWh units, which not only 
reduced our dependency on the grid, but also helped in reduction of carbon emissions by 701 MT during the year 2022-23.
Employee well-being is critical to maintain a positive and productive work environment. Investing in employee well-being 
boosts morale, increases engagement, and eventually contributes to the organisation’s growth and success. The safety of 
employees and workers is of the highest priority. We ensure that all workplaces are safe, and that all employees and workers 
are appropriately trained in health and safety. We achieved zero injuries by regularly monitoring the workplace. Social 
responsibility is maintained through promoting and supporting local communities.
We acknowledge the need of robust governance in our journey towards sustainability. We are embracing digitisation in order 
to simplify our operations and improve our cyber-security measures.
Our Whistleblower Policy, Code of Conduct, and Integrity standards govern the actions of our employees and Board members. 
Moreover, our recently introduced enterprise risk management programme intends to actively address significant business-
wide risks that remain relevant in the medium term. We safeguard the integrity and resilience of our systems through different 
governance approaches.

9.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
In the endeavour to develop a sustainable ecosystem, we have been striving to create value by adopting 3R (Reduce, Reuse 
& Recycle) principles. At our manufacturing facilities, waste is categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous categories. 
Non-hazardous waste is further categorised as recyclable or non-recyclable. We manage waste in compliance with the OCP 
for Material Handling, with recyclable waste handled by state-authorised vendors who have been certified by the pollution 
control board. Battery recycling is facilitated by returning the batteries to the suppliers, whilst e-waste is processed by state-
authorised recyclers. This necessitates a constant emphasis on three essential areas:
	
•	
Consuming less energy
	
•	
Recycling solid and liquid waste
	
•	
Recovering carbide, oils, and lubricants
