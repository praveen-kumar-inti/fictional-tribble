1
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Energy consumption, primarily 
from electricity, accounts for 
over 80% of the Company’s total 
energy 
usage. 
This 
presents 
a 
significant 
opportunity 
to 
implement 
energy-efficient 
technologies and practices that 
can 
reduce 
operating 
costs 
and 
environmental 
footprint. 
Additionally, 
incorporating 
renewable 
energy 
into 
the 
energy mix supports long-term 
sustainability 
goals, 
reduces 
dependence on fossil-fuel-based 
grid electricity, and aligns with 
the global shift toward low-
carbon operations.
NA
Positive:
Cost savings through improved 
energy 
efficiency, 
reduced 
electricity 
expenses, 
and 
enhanced 
brand 
reputation 
attracting 
sustainability-
conscious stakeholders.
2
Waste 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
The Company’s manufacturing 
activities 
primarily 
generate 
non-hazardous waste along with 
smaller quantities of hazardous 
waste. Inefficient or improper 
disposal methods can lead to 
serious consequences, including 
health 
and 
safety 
hazards 
for 
workers, 
contamination 
risks 
for 
surrounding 
communities, 
and 
ecological 
degradation. Moreover, evolving 
environmental regulations are 
becoming increasingly stringent, 
and non-compliance can result 
in 
financial 
penalties, 
legal 
liabilities, and reputational harm.
Opportunity:
Adopting 
a 
robust 
waste 
management strategy aligned 
with circular economy principles, 
such as waste minimization 
at 
source, 
reuse, 
recycling, 
and responsible disposal, can 
yield long-term value. TCPL 
Packaging’s waste management 
practices, including optimizing 
ink usage and implementing 
effective solvent management 
will 
significantly 
improve 
company’s 
environmental 
performance and compliance 
standing.
To mitigate waste-related risks, 
the Company actively works to 
reduce waste at the source by 
deploying newer technologies 
and maintaining full compliance 
with 
applicable 
local 
and 
national regulations. Structured 
systems are in place for the 
safe 
handling, 
storage, 
and 
transportation of both hazardous 
and 
non-hazardous 
waste. 
The Company ensures proper 
waste segregation and partners 
with 
CPCB/SPCB-authorized 
vendors for responsible disposal, 
minimizing environmental risks 
and ensuring legal compliance
Positive:
Operational 
efficiency 
gains 
through resource optimization, 
improved regulatory compliance 
that helps avoid fines and legal 
risks, and enhanced stakeholder 
trust driven by responsible waste 
management and environmental 
stewardship.
Negative:
Environmental 
degradation 
and 
harm 
to 
ecosystems 
due to improper disposal or 
landfill accumulation, as well 
as potential financial liabilities 
arising from non-compliance 
with 
waste 
management 
regulations.

3
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Water is a critical resource for 
the Company’s operations, and 
efficient 
water 
management 
presents a strategic opportunity 
to reduce environmental impact 
while 
enhancing 
long-term 
sustainability. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
water 
stewardship, 
the 
Company 
has 
implemented 
several 
initiatives to reduce freshwater 
consumption and increase water 
reuse. 
These include conducting water 
audits and impact assessments 
to identify usage patterns and 
areas for conservation.
The installation of rainwater 
harvesting 
systems 
reduces 
reliance on groundwater and 
supports the replenishment of 
underground water levels.
Additionally, effluent treatment 
plants 
(ETPs) 
have 
been 
established wherever necessary 
to achieve zero liquid discharge, 
ensuring 
that 
no 
untreated 
water 
leaves 
the 
premises. 
The 
Company 
also 
reuses 
treated water for non-potable 
applications such as gardening 
and 
toilet 
flushing 
through 
sewage 
treatment 
plants 
(STPs). These integrated water 
conservation and reuse practices 
not only reduce operational 
dependency 
on 
freshwater 
sources but also strengthen the 
Company’s ESG performance.
NA
Positive:
Reduced 
water 
procurement 
costs, 
avoidance 
of 
future 
regulatory 
costs 
or 
water 
scarcity-related disruptions, and 
enhanced sustainability profile 
appealing to environmentally 
conscious stakeholders.

Emissions 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Ineffective control of greenhouse 
gas 
(GHG) 
emissions 
can 
contribute to climate change, 
pose threats to public health, 
and lead to environmental 
degradation. 
As 
regulatory 
frameworks 
around 
carbon 
emissions 
tighten 
globally, 
the Company faces potential 
exposure to compliance risks, 
and reputational damage if 
emissions are not properly 
measured, 
reported, 
and 
reduced. 
These 
risks 
are 
particularly 
significant 
given growing scrutiny from 
investors, 
customers, 
and 
regulators on climate-related 
performance.
Opportunity:
The Company’s GHG emissions 
are largely attributed to its 
use of grid-based electricity, 
highlighting a opportunity to 
transition toward cleaner and 
more efficient energy use. By 
managing energy consumption 
and investing in low-carbon 
technologies, the Company can 
unlock 
significant 
economic, 
environmental, and social value. 
This 
includes 
cost 
savings, 
operational 
efficiencies, 
and 
enhanced brand value. Moreover, 
effective emissions management 
aligns 
the 
Company 
with 
emerging customer expectations 
for lower-carbon supply chains, 
creating competitive advantages 
and 
expanding 
access 
to 
sustainability-focused markets.
To address emissions-related 
risks, 
the 
Company 
has 
developed 
a 
comprehensive 
emissions 
inventory 
and 
monitors GHG emissions across 
all its units. Energy audits have 
been conducted across facilities 
to 
identify 
inefficiencies, 
enabling the implementation 
of cost-effective and energy-
efficient practices. Additionally, 
the 
Company 
is 
adopting 
emission-reducing technologies 
and systems wherever feasible.
A key initiative includes the 
installation 
of 
solar 
panels 
with a cumulative capacity of 
approximately 4516 KWp across 
all operational sites, significantly 
reducing dependence on grid-
supplied electricity and lowering 
overall carbon emissions.
Positive:
Reduced 
energy 
costs, 
enhanced operational efficiency, 
contribution to environmental 
sustainability, improved brand 
reputation, 
and 
stronger 
stakeholder and investor trust. 
Effective emissions management 
also 
supports 
long-term 
resilience and competitiveness 
in a low-carbon economy.
Negative:
Potential regulatory penalties, 
reputational damage, and supply 
chain disruptions if timely and 
adequate action is not taken to 
manage emissions and meet 
stakeholder expectations.

Occupational
Health and
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Inadequate safety protocols or 
poor implementation can lead to 
workplace injuries, occupational 
illnesses, fire incidents, and 
other safety-related risks that 
directly impact employee well-
being, productivity, and morale. 
Such incidents can also expose 
the Company to legal liabilities, 
compliance 
violations, 
and 
reputational damage.
Opportunity:
Maintaining high standards in 
occupational health and safety 
offers a significant opportunity 
to 
create 
a 
resilient 
and 
motivated workforce. A strong 
safety culture not only reduces 
accidents 
but 
also 
boosts 
employee 
trust, 
engagement, 
and retention. It reflects the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to 
responsible business practices 
and enhances its reputation 
among stakeholders. Proactive 
safety management can also 
lead to fewer work disruptions, 
improved operational efficiency, 
and stronger alignment with 
global safety standards and 
customer expectations.
The Company has implemented 
the ISO 45001 Occupational 
Health & Safety Management 
System across all its facilities, 
ensuring strict adherence to 
safety protocols and continuous 
improvement 
in 
workplace 
safety practices. Regular safety 
training programs are conducted 
to equip employees with the 
necessary 
knowledge 
and 
awareness, while periodic mock 
drills and fire drills are organized 
to enhance preparedness for 
emergency situations.
To 
ensure 
proactive 
hazard 
management, the Company has 
established structured processes 
to identify, assess, and mitigate 
safety risks across its operations. 
All 
employees 
and 
workers 
are provided with appropriate 
personal protective equipment 
(PPE), and health and safety 
information 
is 
prominently 
displayed 
across 
facilities. 
Internal and external safety 
assessments 
are 
conducted 
regularly, and the workforce is 
actively engaged through health 
and safety committees to foster a 
culture of shared responsibility.
Critical machinery is equipped 
with automatic CO₂ flooding 
systems, while water sprinklers, 
smoke 
detectors 
with 
GSM 
dialer systems, and integrated 
public address (PA) systems 
are installed on each floor to 
ensure quick response in case 
of emergencies. Additionally, 
static monitoring devices are 
deployed in solvent dispersion 
areas to prevent the buildup of 
static electricity and minimize 
associated risks.
Positive:
Improved 
workforce 
productivity, 
reduced 
absenteeism, 
and 
stronger 
employee 
morale. 
A 
well-
managed safety system also 
reduces the likelihood of costly 
incidents and supports long-
term operational continuity.
Negative:
Lapses in safety standards can 
lead to workplace accidents, legal 
penalties, increased insurance 
premiums, 
and 
reputational 
harm. Inaction on safety risks 
can result in significant financial 
and human costs, including 
potential operational shutdowns 
in case of serious incidents.

Community
and Society
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Community 
and 
societal 
engagement represents a key 
opportunity for the Company 
to 
create 
long-term, 
shared 
value beyond its core business 
operations. 
Through 
targeted 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
initiatives, 
the 
Company 
contributes to the well-being 
of vulnerable and underserved 
communities, 
particularly 
in 
areas of healthcare, education, 
women’s 
empowerment, 
environmental 
conservation, 
and sports development. These 
efforts not only fulfill social 
obligations but also enhance 
the Company’s social license to 
operate.
NA
Positive:
Enhanced corporate reputation, 
improved 
stakeholder 
relationships, greater employee 
engagement, 
and 
long-term 
community support that can 
facilitate smoother operations. 
Strategic CSR investments can 
also open up new partnerships, 
contribute to social stability 
in 
operating 
regions, 
and 
strengthen brand equity through 
visible commitment to social 
responsibility.
7
Responsible
Sourcing
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Responsible 
sourcing 
presents 
a 
strategic 
opportunity 
for 
the Company to enhance the 
sustainability and resilience of its 
supply chain while aligning with 
global best practices. By prioritizing 
ethical procurement and sourcing 
raw materials from responsible 
and often local suppliers, the 
Company supports environmental 
stewardship, 
reduces 
supply 
chain risks, and contributes to 
local 
economic 
development. 
Notably, 
approximately 
one 
fourth portion of its raw materials 
are Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC) certified, reflecting a strong 
commitment 
to 
responsible 
forestry.
The 
Company’s 
sustainable 
procurement policy and Supplier 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
promote 
accountability, transparency, and 
environmental 
consciousness 
among 
vendors. 
Encouraging 
suppliers 
to 
adopt 
responsible 
business practices helps elevate 
standards 
across 
the 
supply 
chain and reinforces long-term 
partnerships 
based 
on 
shared 
values. This approach not only 
improves operational efficiency and 
traceability but also strengthens 
stakeholder 
confidence 
and 
positions the Company as a trusted 
and forward-looking brand in the 
marketplace.
NA
Positive:
Improved 
supply 
chain 
resilience, 
enhanced 
brand 
credibility, 
and 
stronger 
supplier 
relationships 
rooted 
in transparency and ethical 
practices. 
Responsible sourcing can also 
reduce long-term procurement 
risks, 
attract 
sustainability-
conscious 
customers, 
and 
support access to global markets.

Customer
Satisfaction
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
As a manufacturer of packaging 
materials for prominent clients 
across 
various 
sectors, 
the 
Company faces significant risks if 
product quality is compromised. 
Defective 
packaging 
can 
result in physical damage to 
products, 
contamination, 
or 
health hazards for end users, 
potentially 
triggering 
product 
recalls. 
Such 
incidents 
can 
damage client relationships, lead 
to loss of business, and cause 
reputational harm. Moreover, 
failure to meet customer-specific 
quality 
requirements 
may 
result in contract penalties and 
diminished market credibility.
Opportunity:
By embedding stringent quality 
control systems and adhering 
to 
responsible 
manufacturing 
practices, 
the 
Company 
can 
consistently deliver high-quality 
products that meet or exceed 
customer 
expectations. 
This 
builds 
long-term

Business 
ethics 
represent 
a 
critical 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Company to build and sustain 
long-term 
success. 
Ethical 
business practices form the 
foundation of its reputation, 
ensuring that trust is fostered 
with customers, employees, and 
stakeholders. By maintaining a 
strong ethical framework, the 
Company not only mitigates 
legal and reputational risks but 
also enhances employee morale 
and retention. This approach 
attracts top talent, increases 
productivity, and contributes to 
a positive work culture.
In 
addition, 
a 
commitment 
to 
ethical 
behaviour 
helps 
the 
Company 
build 
strong 
relationships with its customers 
and 
suppliers, 
reinforcing 
loyalty and fostering a culture

long-term 
financial performance, supports 
sustainability 
initiatives, 
and 
strengthens

confidence, ensuring resilience 
and 
competitiveness 
in 
the

Ethics
Opportunity
Opportunity:
Upholding 
human 
rights 
is 
a critical opportunity for the 
Company 
to 
strengthen 
its 
position as an ethical leader 
in the industry. Prioritizing 
human 
rights 
not 
only 
enhances 
relationships 
with 
employees, 
customers, 
and 
local 
communities 
but 
also 
fosters trust and transparency. 
Proactively addressing human 
rights issues, such as labour 
standards, health, and safety, 
mitigates potential risks like 
legal liabilities, public backlash, 
and 
reputational 
harm. 
By 
adhering to human rights best 
practices, the Company can 
safeguard its long-term viability 
and ensure sustainable business

as 
an 
additional 
layer 
of 
accountability, 
showcasing 
the 
Company’s 
commitment 
to

and continuous improvement. 
This proactive approach not 
only reduces the risk of legal 
complications but also enhances 
the Company’s reputation as a 
socially responsible business, 
driving stakeholder confidence

partner in the marketplace.
NA
Positive:
Enhanced

the factory premises to facilitate anonymous reporting. 
Regular safety briefings reinforce the importance of self-protection, including the right to withdraw from potentially 
dangerous situations and to seek prompt support from supervisors or management.
The Company remains committed to enhancing workplace safety through improved working conditions, technological 
support, and regular safety training tailored to specific operations to enhance employees’ skills and support safe 
practices across specific areas and operations.

Independent Assurance Statement
The Board of Directors
TCPL Packaging Limited,
Empire Mills Complex,
414, Senapati Bapat Marg, 
Lower Parel, Mumbai,
Maharashtra-400013
Subject: Independent Limited Assurance Report on 
the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of TCPL Packing 
Limited (hereafter referred as “TCPL” / “Company”) 
for the year ended March 31, 2025
Moore Singhi Advisors LLP (“Moore Singhi” / “we” / “us”) have 
been engaged by TCPL Packaging Limited to perform a limited 
assurance engagement on the Company’s Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Emissions (the “Subject Matter”) for the period April 1, 
2024 to March 31, 2025 with engagement letter dated May 23, 
2025. This engagement is on a consolidated basis that covers 
the following facilities: Haridwar, Dapada, Goa, Guwahati, 
Silvassa, corporate office and COPPL – Noida. 
1.	 Management Responsibility
 
TCPL’s management is responsible for selecting the 
methodology and presenting the GHG emissions 
disclosures in accordance with that methodology, in 
all material respects. This responsibility includes the 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
including policies and processes, maintenance of adequate 
records, calculations, and making estimates that are 
reasonable in the circumstances, and ensuring that they 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
 
The methodology used by TCPL for compiling and reporting 
GHG emissions for FY 2024-25 is based on “The GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(Revised Edition)” by World Resources Institute (WRI) 
/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD). As a result, the subject matter information may 
not be suitable for other purposes.
2.	 Moore Singhi’s Responsibility
 
Our responsibility is to provide limited assurance that 
the subject matter is in accordance with the methodology 
devised by the Company, based on our examination of the 
records and computations prepared by the management.
 
A limited assurance engagement includes performing 
procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence 
on the reporting criteria. In this connection, we have 
performed the following procedures:
 
1. 
Reviewed the procedures for GHG emission reporting 
and its compliance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG 
Protocol.
 
2. 
Conducted discussions with individuals responsible 
for managing the GHG emission inventory. 
 
3. 
Verified procedures used for data collection, 
quantification, and computations.
 
4. 
Evaluated the appropriateness of the quantification 
methods and models used in the preparation of the 
GHG report. 
 
5. 
Checked the sources of emission factors and their 
applicability according to the chosen methodologies.
 
6. 
Obtained evidence of supporting documents on a 
sample basis.
 
7. 
Assessed the reasonableness of assumptions, 
estimations, and thresholds considered in 
calculations.
 
8. 
We also performed such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. 
 
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when planning the nature and scope 
of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
intended to provide assurance on these controls. Our 
procedures did not involve testing internal controls or 
verifying the aggregation and calculation of data within 
the IT systems.
 
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance 
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance engagements other than 
audits or reviews of historical financial information, and 
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3410: Assurance engagements on greenhouse 
gas statements, as well as the terms of reference for this 
engagement as agreed with TCPL on May 23, 2025. 
Integrated Report 2024-2025
256
37th Annual Report 2024-2025
 
Those standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in 
all material respects, the Subject Matter presented to us is 
in accordance with the methodology, and to issue a report.
 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in 
extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited 
assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable 
assurance engagement been performed.
 
We have complied with independence and all other ethical 
requirements, which are founded on the fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence 
and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. 
3.	 Our Opinion
 
Based on our procedures as mentioned in the section 
“Moore Singhi responsibilities”, information and 
explanations given and management representations 
provided to us, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the GHG emissions for the period 
from April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 is prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the methodology 
adopted by the company.
 
The reported GHG emissions for the period from April 1, 
2024 to March 31, 2025 are:
• Scope 1: 3909.92 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent
• Scope 2: 33,678.50 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent
4.	 Uncertainties
 
The reliability of assurance is subject to uncertainties 
inherent in the assurance process. These uncertainties 
may arise due to the limitations in quantification models, 
assumptions, or conversion factors used or may be present 
in estimation of data to arrive at results. As a result, our 
conclusions regarding this assurance are subject to any 
inherent uncertainties involved in the process.
5.	 Restriction on Use 
 
Our work was performed solely to assist management in 
meeting their responsibilities in relation to meet TCPL’s 
supply chain assessment reporting requirements. The 
report is addressed and provided to the Board of Directors 
of the Company, solely for the purpose of enabling it to 
comply with the aforementioned requirements, and should 
not to be used, referred to or distributed for any other 
purpose or to any other party without our prior written 
consent. Accordingly, we do not accept or assume any 
liability or duty of care for any other purpose for which 
or to any other person to whom this assurance report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior 
consent in writing. 
 
Other than as described in the paragraph 1, which sets 
out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform any 
assurance procedures on the remaining information. 
Accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this 
information.
