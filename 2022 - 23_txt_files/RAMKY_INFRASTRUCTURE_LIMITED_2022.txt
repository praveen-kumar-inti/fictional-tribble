3. | Community 
Risk 
development 
e Infrastructure projects 
often require significant land 
acquisition, which can lead 
to displacement and resettle- 
ment of communities. If not 
managed properly, this can 
result in social unrest, pro- 
tests, and legal challenges 
¢ Community resistance can 
lead to disruptions 
in the 
supply chain. 
Protests 
or 
road blocks by community 
members can prevent the 
smooth flow 
of materials 
and equipment, causing con- 
struction delays and added 
expenses. 
e Ramky proactively engages 
with local communities, attend- 
ing to their concerns, and invests 
in sustainable and responsible 
practices, thus enhancing the 
likelihood 
of mitigating these 
risks 
e 
Ramky is firmly committed to 
actively respecting human rights 
and cultivating robust commu- 
nity relations, with the primary 
goal of building trust and ulti- 
mately fostering comprehensive 
community satisfaction. 
Negative: 
It results 
in project delays, protests, 
or potential legal challenges, impeding 
the company’s progress and creating 
obstacles 
in securing future project 
approvals 
or obtaining funding from 
investors and lenders. 
  
4. | Workforce 
Risk 
Health and 
Safety 
e The nature 
of infrastruc- 
ture projects often involves 
high-risk activities, such 
as 
construction, 
excava- 
tion, and heavy machinery 
operations. Without proper 
safety measures, there is an 
increased likelihood 
of ac- 
cidents, injuries, and, in the 
worst cases, fatalities among 
the workforces. 
¢ A poor safety record can 
lead 
to higher insurance 
premiums for the company, 
increasing operating costs. 
e Ramky 
is known for its pro- 
fessional management, 
led by 
highly qualified and experienced 
personnel in various areas, such 
as engineering, procurement, 
legal, secretarial, finance, and 
administration and a fully inte- 
grated Management Information 
System (MIS) operates 
in the 
SAP environment to support its 
operations 
e 
By conducting 
risk assess- 
ments, ensuring compliance with 
occupational health and safety 
regulations, and continuously 
monitoring and improving safety 
practices, the Company aims to 
protect the well-being 
of its 
employees. 
Negative: 
It leads to project delays. Investigations, 
remedial actions, and increased safety 
protocols can interrupt construction 
schedules, causing additional costs and 
potentially affecting project timelines. 
  
5. | Business 
Risk 
Integrity and 
Ethics 
 
 
 
 
¢ Any unethical behaviour or 
lack of integrity within the 
company can lead to nega- 
tive publicity and damage 
the company’s reputation. 
¢ Engaging in unethical prac- 
tices can 
lead to breaches 
of contracts with clients, 
subcontractors, or suppliers. 
This may result in legal dis- 
putes and financial liabilities 
for the company 
 
e Ramky Infrastructure Limited 
has always maintained a strong 
commitment to upholding sound 
corporate governance standards 
and ethical business practices. 
e 
By implementing these prac- 
tices, the Company believes 
it 
can achieve sustainable growth 
and meet the expectations of all 
stakeholders. 
¢ Ramky is firmly committed to 
combating fraud, corruption, 
and dishonesty. The anti-bribery 
policy extends to 
all the group 
companies and stakeholders. 
 
Negative: 
It leads to legal battles, project delays, 
cost overruns, and strained business 
relationships which results in huge loss 
on financial impacts.

sanitation facilities, and regular health check-ups by first aiders are prioritized for a clean and hygienic work 
environment. 
Proper documentation is maintained, including records of safety inductions, Toolbox Talks, HIRA assessments, 
medical check-ups, and maintenance activities, ensuring compliance and serving as a reference for future audits 
or evaluations. Through these comprehensive measures and proper documentation, Ramky ensures the safety, 
well-being, and compliance of its workforce in the workplace.
