Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
Our buildings are thoughtfully designed, keeping the health and well-being of our employees and occupiers in mind. Different design 
elements ensure that the buildings offer a conducive work environment. These elements minimise stress or discomfort due to loud 
sounds, insufficient light or excessive glare, or thermal stress in order to create ergonomically friendly spaces.
	
At Anant Raj, we have taken a number of steps to control the dust released from our projects.

Each of our sites is surrounded by high barricades
 
• 
When not in use, construction materials kept on the ground or in vehicles are mandatorily covered
	
The Company is committed to continuously employing Safety, Health and Environment practices through benchmarking with the 
companies that are best in the business. We check for Air quality at our offices spaces and take regular measures to improve the 
same. Frequent equipment checks are carried out to mitigate any wear and tear due to continued use, E.g.: Air Conditioners, UPS, 
Stabilisers etc, Fire alarm systems and smoke detectors are installed at all premises. Fire extinguishers are kept filled to ensure 
effective use during any untoward incidents. The Company strives to use inflammable substitutes for its construction project sites. 
Project specific safety committee is established and improvement areas are discussed.

Essential Indicators

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
The Company has a strong ‘Customer Relationship Department’ located in the Head Office in Delhi and is a nodal point for 
dealing with customer Grievances. Customer feedback plays a vital role as it gives us insight into customer satisfaction levels. 
Customer queries could either be in the form of a service request or a complaint where the desired work is unfulfilled within the 
stipulated time frame. We are adequately and suitably staffed to facilitate customers to lodge their grievances through our IVR 
system, Emails, phones, website, social media etc. While complaints are resolved through a structured complaints matrix, queries 
involving inputs required from cross-functional teams are dealt with accordingly by the team and the same is communicated 
to the customer for closure of their service request within the defined time frame. The team reports to the Department head 
and escalates the customer complaints as and when required for the complete resolution of customer queries. All complaints/
queries received are being recorded, tracked and reported by the customer care representative where the focus is on customer 
satisfaction and retaining him with the company. We have a designated team for receiving grievances and for advising; the 
department has been devised along with an escalation matrix for unresolved grievances. There is a turnaround time (TAT) to 
resolve/respond to the received complaints. The complaints are being resolved within a stipulated timeframe through various 
mediums like phones, emails, websites, social media, IVR systems, etc. Thus, the company has a planned and organised process for 
resolving customer grievances.
