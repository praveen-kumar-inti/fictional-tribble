Competition Commission of 
India (CCI)
Case related to after-market sale of spare parts: An investigation was 
initiated by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2011 against 
a few car manufacturing companies wherein it was contended that these 
companies were not making genuine spare parts of automobiles freely 
available in the open market. CCI later expanded the scope of investigation 
to the Company and other car manufacturing companies. In the final order 
passed by the CCI on 25th August, 2014, certain directions were laid 
down against the automobile companies and penalties were imposed. A 
penalty of ` 4,711.4 million was imposed on the Company. The Company 
contested this matter before the Delhi High Court primarily on the ground 
that it was not a named party in the investigation and that the investigation 
ought not to have been conducted against the Company. On the contrary, 
the Company was named in the information given by the informant as a 
Company that made spare parts easily accessible in the open market. The 
Delhi High Court, on 16th May, 2019, disposed the petition stating that the 
Company had alternative remedies available. Thereafter, it filed a Special 
Leave Petition before the Supreme Court of India, wherein a stay on the 
CCI’s order was granted and the stay is continuing.
No. MSIL does 
not agree with the 
observation by CCI. 
The order is stayed by

Competition Commission of

Matter relating to discount control practices: An investigation was initiated

by a purported dealer of the Company. The dealer alleged that the 
Company resorts to anti-competitive discount control practices. The CCI 
passed its final order on 23rd August, 2021 and held that MSIL indulged 
in anti-competitive discount control practices (re-sale price maintenance) 
and imposed a penalty of ` 2,000 million on the Company. The Company 
filed an appeal against the CCI’s order before the National Company Law 
Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), wherein on 22nd November, 2021, a stay on the 
CCI’s order was granted subject to the deposit of ` 200 million. The stay is 
continuing, and appeal is pending
No. MSIL does
