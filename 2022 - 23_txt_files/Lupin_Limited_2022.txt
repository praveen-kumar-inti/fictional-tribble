Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive 
or negative implications)
1.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety (OHS)
Risk
As a responsible 
corporate citizen, it 
is Lupin’s prerogative 
to maintain a safe 
working environment 
that is free of injuries, 
accidents, and 
fatalities. 
Poor occupational 
health and safety 
(OHS) performance 
can negatively impact 
labor costs through 
lower productivity. 
Moreover, it can 
also the company's 
reputation and the 
morale of the staff 
through incidents of 
injuries and fatalities 
at the site. Non-
adherence to OHS 
requirements may 
result in penalties and 
fines for the company.
Measures undertaken 
to mitigate risks 
include:
- All the facilities are
implementing ISO
45001 Management
systems (health &
safety management
systems), which help
ensure employees’
physical and mental
well-being are
prioritized over
operations
- OHS risks are
regularly and
proactively identified
through Hazard
Identification and Risk
Assessment systems
at all our locations.
Additional risk
assessments include
HAZOP for API
products, processes,
and risk assessment
for Formulation Units.
- Regular safety
training, drills for
response management 
systems, and capacity-
building sessions are
conducted.
- Internal and external
audits are conducted
every year for all the
facilities.
Negative: Improper 
safety mechanism of life, 
high-consequence injury, and 
reputational damage.
2.
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity and 
Inclusion improve 
company 
performance by 
bringing together 
people with varied 
knowledge, views, 
and perspectives. 
This results in 
identifying innovative 
ideas and improves 
talent attraction
and retention at the 
workplace.
Various initiatives 
have been undertaken 
to drive Inclusivity 
in the workplace. 
This includes Lupin’s 
women’s network, 
Returning Mother’s 
program, gender 
sensitization program, 
and Impact - a 
women’s mentoring 
program.
We are also 
committed to 
including 15% of 
women employees 
across all business 
units by 2027. This 
goal is in line with our 
Diversity Strategy.
Positive: A diverse workforce 
from different genders, ages, 
ethnicities, and special abilities 
enables a productive environment 
and drives innovative thinking, 
helping in employee engagement 
and resulting in higher efficiency.

3.
Product 
Quality
Risk
With increasing 
regulatory 
compliances, it is 
essential to maintain 
the high quality 
of products. Non-
adherence to such 
quality requirements 
may result in heavy 
fines,  fees, penalties, 
etc. 
Consumers’ 
expectations are 
constantly changing, 
and to stay ahead 
of their peers, it is 
important to stay 
aligned with such 
requirements.
Initiatives to improve 
product quality are:
- Use of advanced
automated systems to
detect product defects
- Compliance with
CGMP requirements,
FDA guidelines, etc.
- Dedicated
Pharmacovigilance
team to track the
incidence of any
adverse event caused
by any medication
and ensure its timely
redressal or recall.
We follow a quality-
first approach where 
we implement systems 
and processes that 
help enhance quality 
management through 
training, corrective 
action plans, etc.
Negative: A company can 
incur severe reputational and 
operational damage in product 
quality-related issues. This 
may also lead to a decrease in 
customer satisfaction and trust
4.
Resource 
Efficiency
Risk
By using fewer 
resources and 
optimizing their 
use, businesses 
can become more 
environmentally 
friendly, competitive, 
and profitable. It also 
helps in achieving 
sustainable green 
growth. Additionally, 
it maintains investors’ 
and shareholders’ 
confidence in the 
company.
Non-adherence 
to regulatory 
requirements can 
result in penalties, 
fines, plant 
shutdown, etc., and 
impact a company’s 
reputation.
Initiatives to improve 
resource efficiency 
are:
- All our facilities are
implementing ISO
14001 certification
(Environmental
management system)
- Our 6 out of 13
Indian sites are zero
liquid discharge.
- Utilising cleaner
energy sources in
our manufacturing
operations and
focusing on using
renewable energy
sources such as solar,
wind, etc.
- We have set
targets related to
water recycling,
hazardous waste
better utilization, and
reduction of GHG
emissions.
- Internal and external
energy audits are
environmental audits
conducted annually.
Positive: Judicious use of 
resources can yield cost 
benefits, reduce the negative 
environmental impact and build 
reputational synergy in the sector.

5.
Supply chain 
sustainability
Risk
An efficient supply 
chain ensures 
business continuity. 
With increasing 
cross-border 
dependency on raw 
materials, managing 
the risks (e.g., geo-
political crisis, etc.) 
associated with it 
is essential. Non-
availability of raw 
materials could 
impact production 
and timely availability 
of products in the 
market resulting in 
financial losses.
Through Adopting 
an Integrated 
Business Planning 
(IBP) process, we 
have improved the 
transparency of data, 
clear insights, and 
identification of any 
existing/emerging 
gaps have enabled 
us to make the right 
decisions to ensure 
that we maximize 
our ability to service 
the market and 
mitigate the costs of 
Failure to Supply. 
We conduct ESG 
risk assessments for 
our critical suppliers, 
which enables us 
to assess suppliers’ 
performance on 
environmental, 
social & governance 
parameters.
Negative: Value chain disruption 
can significantly impact 
operations, and production, 
impacting the timely availability 
of products and profits 
generated.
6.
Digitization
Opportunity
Transitioning to 
digital tools enables 
enhanced efficiency 
and effectiveness 
of operational 
processes, resulting 
in increased 
productivity across 
operations. 
Advancements in 
digitization can also 
be utilized to build 
digital therapeutic 
solutions.
At Lupin, we 
have invested 
in automation 
and digitization 
to enhance the 
efficiency and 
effectiveness of our 
processes. 
We have 
implemented 
Project ADAPT, 
which leverages the 
power of big data, 
predictive analytics, 
and digital tools 
across the value 
chain to build in-
house capabilities 
and develop the 
required IT/OT 
infrastructure. 
We launched LYFE, 
a digital therapeutic 
solution to help 
patients improve 
their heart health 
modules. FDA 
and CE-approved 
wearable devices 
record vital 
parameters and 
notify caregivers 
and doctors about 
off-range vitals and 
emergencies. 
Positive: Digitization helps 
reduce human errors, improves 
systems efficiency, saves time & 
effort, increases data capturing 
and analysis, and provides a 
competitive advantage.

Business 
ethics and 
governance
Opportunity
Good governance 
ensures that the 
company meets its 
corporation’s stated 
objectives, complies 
with applicable laws 
and regulations, and 
protects shareholder 
rights and interests.
- We have a well-
defined Code of
Business Conduct
highlighting
a company’s
commitment to
conduct business
with integrity and
professionalism.
- Formulated the ESG
core committee to
provide accountability
for ESG-related risks
and opportunities.
Positive: Ethical conduct 
improves profitability, increases 
talent attraction and retention, 
and increases the trust of 
customers and shareholders in 
the organization.
8.
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The Pharmaceutical 
Industry is one of 
the most heavily 
regulated industries 
in the world. 
Therefore, it is 
essential to abide 
by the regulatory 
requirements 
applicable across 
different aspects 
of the business. 
Non-adherence 
could impact on 
business profits 
and the company’s 
reputation. This 
could also impact 
stakeholders’ trust in 
the organization.
Adherence to the 
applicable regulatory 
requirements is a 
key priority, and at 
Lupin, we ensure 
that the regulatory 
compliances for 
health and safety, 
quality, human 
rights are followed 
at all times. Our 
facilities across 
the globe observe 
Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) 
standards and 
have accreditations 
from leading global 
regulatory authorities 
such as US FDA, UK 
MHRA, WHO, and 
Japanese PMDA.
Compliance related to 
Environment, Health 
and safety (EHS) 
as provided in the 
consent to operate, 
environmental 
monitoring, etc. are 
diligently followed at 
the sites.
Negative: Non-compliance 
could result in plant shutdown, 
penalties, fines, etc., and may 
impact profits and financial gain.
9.
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
It is crucial that Lupin 
engages with the 
communities we 
operate in to increase 
trust and foster 
harmony.
The Lupin Human 
Welfare and Research 
Foundation engages 
with communities 
to identify their 
most critical social 
development needs 
and strategizes 
to create impact 
oriented programs. 
The Foundation has 
been working in the 
two niche domains 
of livelihoods and 
healthcare with a 
strong bottom-up 
approach
Positive: Maintaining goodwill 
with the nearby communities 
helps mitigate future grievances 
or concerns. This safeguards the 
business from possibilities of 
conflicts and any adverse events.

Environmental Performance and Climate Change, Employment Practices, Supply Chain Management,
Governance, Community Engagement, Product, and Consumer. The Board of Directors and the ESG
Core Committee discussed and approved the results.

At Lupin, we have taken various initiatives to reduce the emission of GHG gases from our operations, including 
procurement of renewable energy, switching to cleaner use of fuels, replacing conventional lights with LED, 
installation of variable frequency drives (VFDs), etc.
We have also adopted an ambitious target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 15% by 2030. 
Our GHG emission reduction initiatives include:
1. We have increased renewable energy contribution by 3.71 MW at Ankleshwar and 1.58 MW at Dabhasa,
reducing 34,688 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
2. We are implementing rooftop solar panels with a capacity of 0.52 MW in FY23, and an additional 1.83 MW in
progress.
3. We have introducted electronically commutated (EC) motors at Pithampur and Aurangabad, which has
significantly reducing power consumption by 5 lakh units per annum. We plan to implement EC motors at
Lupin Biotech, Lupin Research Park, Sikkim, and Nagpur for further energy reduction.
4. We are executing proposal for briquette boilers and installation of bag filters & electrostatic precipitators
(ESP) at multiple locations for energy optimization and reduction of particulate matters in flue gas.
5. We have initiated scope 3 inventorization and calculated emissions for 8 categories including Purchased
Goods and Services, Capital Goods, Fuel and Energy, Waste Generated and Disposed, Upstream Transport,
Downstream Transport, Business Travel, and Employee Commute.
6. We have successfully implemented Microsoft Cloud Based Technologies across our various sites and offices.
By leveraging these technologies, we have achieved operational efficiency and significantly reduced
approximately 27 tCO2e across our operations.
26
7. We have installed advanced chillers and condensers in our manufacturing plants to improve the
effectiveness of recovery and further reduce utility costs.
8. We are transitioning to Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS) as boiler fuel at our 4 facilities has resulted in a
significant reduction in steam costs and GHG emissions.
9. We are implementing efficient equipment, such as finned tube condensers, dry vacuum pumps,
nano-filtration, and heat integration systems.
10. We have replaced AC motors with DC electronically commutated motors in AHUs, which has resulted in
energy efficiency and power cost savings.
11. Our manufacturing facility in Mandideep, India has been awarded the "GOLD LEED".
12. Our commitment to climate stewardship also contributes to product innovation in the development phase.
Lupin Healthcare UK' product, Luforbec, has recently achieved Carbon neutrality certification. Lupin

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
(For information on Lupin’s waste management practices, please refer to the section “Waste Management” 
on page 136 under Natural Capital Chapter.)
We have implemented efficient waste management and circularity practices across our entire value chain. 
We prioritize waste recycling and are actively reducing landfill and incineration. Seven of our thirteen sites, 
including R&D, send incinerable hazardous waste to Co-processors/ Pre-processors. In FY23, we sent 
4,175.21 MT (60.9%) of incinerable hazardous waste for co-processing. By 2050, we aim to re-direct 60% of 
incinerable hazardous waste from Indian operations to co-processing such as cement plants.
Spent solvents generated during the manufacture of APIs are either recovered and used locally or 
transferred to registered disposal sites or approved recyclers. Also, as part of our resource conservation 
measures, we send the used calcium sulphate to cement factories so they may be used as raw material and 
alternative fuel. Non-hazardous waste from our operations, including canteen and mycelia waste, is either 
composted to create usable organic fertiliser or sent to piggeries.
27
We are dedicated to reducing waste through the following methods:
• Promoting non-hazardous and less toxic materials during R&D stage or as a part of process
improvement
• Process improvement to improve the yield of the product and in turn reducing the waste generated.
• Training staff on the proper handling, labelling, and storage of hazardous products
