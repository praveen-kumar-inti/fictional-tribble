a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?

System in accordance with ISO 45001-2018. The organization has determined the necessary processes

and their application throughout the organization. This includes identifying the inputs and outputs of 
each process, as well as creating an Inter-relation Matrix to illustrate their relationships. The sequence 
and interaction of processes have been determined, and criteria and methods, including monitoring, 
measurements, and performance indicators, have been applied to ensure effective operation and control. 
Resources have been allocated and made available for the processes, and responsibilities and authorities 
have been assigned accordingly. Risks and opportunities have been addressed, and processes are regularly 
evaluated and improved to achieve their intended results. IRCON maintains documented information to 
support process operations and retains documentation to ensure adherence to planned processes.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
IRCON through their Occupational Health and Safety Manual has established a process for identifying and 
assessing aspects/hazards, with an assessment mechanism based on their significance. During the initial 
stage of project execution, major hazards are identified, tabulated, and communicated to the construction 
team. A comprehensive inventory of all aspects and OH&S hazards are periodically reviewed & updated 
based on the initial review and group risk assessment. Several factors are addressed, including storage, 
handling, and disposal of construction & hazardous materials, plant & machinery activities, construction 
activities & related standard operating procedures, and infrastructure facilities. For OH&S risk assessment, 
aspects with significant impacts on employee health and safety, such as physical, chemical, and biological 
factors, are identified. Probability and severity factors are used to rate the assessment, with a scale ranging 
from “Always” to “Never” for probability and from “Permanent/partial disability with hospitalization or 
death” to “No harm” for severity. The risk rating is determined by multiplying the probability and severity 
factors together. If the risk rating is 3 or higher, it is considered intolerable, and control measures should be 
developed and implemented. The OH&S risk levels are defined as Extreme, High, Moderate, Low, and Trivial 
based on specific criteria.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes, following an incident or accident, the Person in Charge of Health and Safety (PH/SO) will initiate an 
investigation in collaboration with the Sub-contractor’s safety officer and other site staff to determine the 
cause(s) of the incident/accident and suggest appropriate remedial actions. The incident/accident report 
form will be completed, and the PH/SO will identify the necessary steps to be taken. Furthermore, the 
Safety Officer will present the report to the Safety Committee and also share it during the Project Quality 
Council Meeting.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No) 
	
Yes, IRCON ensures that its employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services. 
The company provides a range of benefits to both permanent and non-permanent employees, including 
outdoor and indoor treatment reimbursement, sanctions for medical advances, ambulance charges and 
other complete health checkup benefits. Apart from this IRCON has a medical trust set up that provides 
assistance to employees under different circumstances.

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
	
IRCON takes several measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. The company conduct regular hazard 
identification and risk assessments, including safety drills for various scenarios. Stringent safety measures are in 
place at project sites to prioritize the well-being of employees and workers. This includes the implementation

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
of Safety Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and comprehensive training programs. Regular pre-medical 
checkups are conducted at scheduled intervals to monitor the health of personnel. Following the principles of 
the Industrial Safety hierarchy, the project emphasizes a systematic approach to risk mitigation. The hierarchy 
involves the steps of elimination, substitution, engineering control and administrative control. Hazards are first 
eliminated whenever possible, followed by substituting hazardous elements with safer alternatives. Engineering 
controls are implemented to design a safer work environment, while administrative controls establish procedures 
and guidelines to manage risks effectively. Finally, when necessary, appropriate PPE is provided to ensure worker 
safety. Through the consistent application of this safety hierarchy, the project endeavors to identify and address 
potential hazards, fostering a culture of safety and responsibility throughout the project site.

a)	
Adoption and implementation of staging surrounding every liner driving of pile at the project site – Resulting 
in no cave-in of any workmen during piling work.
b)	
Pile load Test Using the “Crown Anchor Reaction Method” that reduces the probability of near miss during 
execution of pile testing. 
c)	
Slope stabilization and protection make the execution area safer and more stable during the movement of 
workmen and machinery. This helps in reducing the chances of fatality and safe working manhours.

Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its 
stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The process of identifying key stakeholder groups for IRCON encompasses several steps. Initially, it involves clearly 
defining IRCON’s purpose and role within the industry. Subsequently, both internal and external stakeholders are 
identified, taking into account their respective interests and concerns. 
	
As a listed EPC contractor in the infrastructure sector, there are several key stakeholder groups that are 
considered, these include investors and shareholders, employees and workers, clients or employers, vendors, 
sub-contractors, consultants, the community, and the end users of the infrastructure. The selection of client/
employers is typically based on the company’s business interests. Vendors, sub-contractors, and consultants are 
identified and chosen according to project requirements and contract conditions. The responsibility for the end 
users of the infrastructure facility typically lies with the client/employer, unless the contract provisions allow for 
involvement by the EPC contractor. Investors, shareholders, employees, and workers are integral parts of the 
entity itself.
	
IRCON can successfully understand and engage with stakeholders, effectively addressing their needs and 
concerns, and cultivating positive relationships through the stakeholder engagement process. Such a strategic 
approach enables IRCON to optimize project execution, enhance client satisfaction, collaborate effectively 
with government agencies, and generate value for its shareholders and other stakeholders, thereby achieving 
improved overall outcomes.
