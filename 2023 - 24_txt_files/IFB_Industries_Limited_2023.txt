Overview of the entityȂs material responsible business conduct issues Ȯ
 
 
Our Sustainability initiative focuses on our signicant sustainability issues and opportunities. These are dened 
by our ongoing materiality assessment, which identies and prioritizes issues based on two criteria: the impact 
or likely impact on the achievement of CompanyȂs Strategic Objectives; and the impact or potential impact on 
CompanyȂs stakeholders and their interests.  
 
 
Our materiality assessment is based on our risk management processes, which not only consider immediate risks, 
but also longer-term emerging macro trends such as the accelerating growth in demand for renewable energies and 
policy changes impacting the cost of CO2 emissions, all of which could profoundly a ect our markets.
 
 
Indicated below are the material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental 
and social ma ers that present a risk or an opportunity to business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to 
adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its nancial implications.

1
Climate change, 
global warming 
and climate 
action
Risk if no 
action taken / 
Opportunity for 
the company to 
take a lead on 
action
Climate action represents a 
core focus area among industry 
players, not only as a means to 
address the climate crisis but 
also establish the organization 
as a leader.
Climate concerns have 
continued to increase as the 
e ects of climate change 
become increasingly evident. 
Both physical and transition 
risks pose a threat to the 
CompanyȂs business operations 
and continuity. For example, 
extreme weather could 
potentially impact physical 
assets, stakeholders are 
demanding increased e orts 
towards reducing emissions 
and disclosing performance, 
and the overall transition to a 
low carbon economy requires 
substantial investment.
However, there also exists a 
clear opportunity through 
climate action. This includes 
direct opportunities to mitigate 
climate risk, reduce GHG 
emissions, enable savings in 
electricity costs etc.
Company has taken 
a number of steps to 
conserve energy, alternate 
sources of energy 
incorporating 26% of the 
energy requirement from 
renewable energy sources 
like solar energy, and 
wind energy. To further 
enhance our actions in this 
direction, the Company is 
exploring more renewable 
energy technologies. 
The company is also 
leading in developing / 
commercializing products 
which will reduce the 
environmental footprint 
(E.g., machines with 
Xeros technology / use 
of steam to reduce water 
consumption and plastic 
micro-bre release etc.

Changes in 
consumer 
preferences and 
behaviour
Opportunity to 
di erentiate
Across the globe, the concept of 
sustainable consumerism has 
gained momentum with more 
consumers choosing to support 
brands that generate positive 
impact. Factors such as climate 
change and Covid-19 etc have 
been inuencing customer 
sentiment and leading to 
demand shi s.
Company has invested 
in developing products 
that work to reduce 
environmental impact, 
for examples washers that 
save water, and energy 
e
cient appliances. The 
manufacturing process 
followed also has certain 
controls on environment 
friendly processes and 
e
uent discharge control.
The Company is at initial 
phase on conducting 
Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) to e ectively 
quantify impact and 
identify potential risks 
from existing or future 
products.

Health and 
safety
Risk
In the normal course of 
business, human resources 
including associates, 
subcontractors and channel 
partners are all exposed to 
inherent health and safety 
risks. The Company has a 
safety-oriented culture and it 
makes every e ort to ensure 
safe and motivating work 
environment.
At the Company, 
permanent employees and 
contractual employees 
are provided with safety 
and skill upgradation 
training, thereby 
building the skill set to 
mitigate and e ectively 
respond to various 
safety-related risks. 
Plants are ISO 45001:2018 
standard certied 
and have established 
safety commi ee which 
includes unit heads and 
departmental heads.

Water scarcity
Risk
Like climate change, water 
scarcity is becoming a common 
concern in areas around the 
world. Companies are facing 
a range of water-related risks 
such as lack of resources, 
degradation of water quality, 
and continued increase in 
demand of water consumption.
To minimize exposure to 
this risk, the Company 
has focused on practicing 
greater responsibility 
with respect to water 
consumption. This 
includes measures to 
reduce water consumption 
in production operations 
by installing water 
recycling plants. Further 
the company is working 
on new technologies to 
develop products that will 
require less water during 
the consumer-use phase.

Digitization,

Opportunity
The growth of digital 
technology has presented 
numerous opportunities for 
organizations in the consumer 
electronics segment. Industry 
players are strategically 
integrating tech solutions into 
diverse areas of the business, 
leading to higher demand and 
revenue, increased customer 
satisfaction, and greater 
operational e
ciency. At the 
company, tech absorption 
has already generated 
results in terms of product 
improvements, cost reductions 
and import substitutions.
Company has integrated 
various measures aimed 
at technology absorption. 
The Company has been 
working actively with 
partners from other 
countries such as Italy, 
China and Korea to 
enhance knowledge and 
capabilities, and importing 
technologies. On an 
ongoing basis, internal 
design team also work on 
technology upgrades such 
as testing and validation 
of products IOT, wireless 
controls and app-based 
appliance controls.

Sustainable 
product 
development
Opportunity
Sustainable product 
development has been 
considered a core component 
of meeting broader 
environmental goals. For 
product organisations, the 
greatest opportunities extend 
beyond manufacturing 
and operations processes, 
but also into the ability to 
mitigate impact through 
consumer-use, thereby creating 
transformational change in the 
industry.
The Company has 
developed a range of 
products that reduces the 
environmental impact 
in terms of use of water 
and energy. For example, 
all washing machines 
manufactured now 
have a 5-star rating in 
energy as per BEE. The 
Company is in the initial 
phase on conducting 
Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA), and incorporating 
principles of the circular 
economy into product 
design and end-of-life 
management, all of which 
will further build on the 
capability to develop more 
environment friendly 
products in the coming 
years.
 Positive

Circular 
economy 
and waste 
management
Opportunity
In response to the growing 
waste crisis, robust waste 
management coupled with 
principles of the circular 
economy are of core 
importance, particularly for 
organizations involved in 
the manufacture of tangible 
products. Industry peers are 
also investing in incorporating 
various elements of the circular 
economy across the product 
lifecycle. These include more 
responsible packaging, o ering 
repair options and take-back 
programs, among other 
circular models. 
The Company is 
currently practicing some 
elements of the circular 
economy, including 
the development of an 
ȃEnd of LifeȄ return 
policy, through which 
old products may be 
exchanged and returned 
products are recycled 
in accordance with 
Government regulations. 
The Company provides 
spares and services 
beyond estimated life 
of the product so that 
the life of the product 
increases thereby reducing 
overall requirement 
of such products. The 
organization is also 
exploring more circular 
initiatives in both 
product design and o
ce 
operations.

Diversity and

In response to rising 
inequalities on a global scale, 
signicant investment and 
focus is being dedicated 
to enhance diversity and 
inclusion at the workplace 
Ȯ a trend that can be 
observed across industries. 
However, the consumer 
electronics industry is still 
at a comparatively nascent 
stage, signalling tremendous 
scope for improvement and 
opportunities for organizations 
to establish themselves as 
industry leaders se ing best 
practices.
Company has an 
ongoing focus on 
greater representation 
of women at all levels 
of the workforce. The 
establishment of a 
monitoring mechanism 
with specic KPIs to 
assess performance over 
time periods will further 
enhance the organizationȂs

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
  7. 
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.  
 
Our company has published its mandatory Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which covers a range of 
indicators that reect our commitment to responsible business practices. As a beginner in reporting ESG performance, 
we faced several challenges in identifying and tracking the most relevant areas and detailing them to the indicators. 
However, we recognized the importance of sustainability and took steps to improve our ESG performance. In the 
environmental forefront, to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve resources and minimize waste, we have implemented 
various initiatives, including using renewable energy sources like solar energy and wind energy which caters to 26% 
of the energy requirements, adopting circular economy practices like buy-back program for end-of-life products, 
water recycling units in the manufacturing processes, etc. On the social front, we are commi ed to ensuring that our 
business practices are ethical and socially responsible, and we have implemented a range of initiatives and measures 
for employee health and safety, diversity and inclusion etc. Governance challenges are another critical area of focus for 
us, and we are commi ed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance. We have implemented various 
measures to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical behaviour across our organization. Moving forward, we 
will continue to report on our ESG performance and provide our stakeholders with the information they need to make 
informed decisions. We are commi ed to transparency and accountability and will work towards being a responsible 
corporate citizen. We recognize that sustainability is a journey, and there is still much work to be done. 
 
We are commi ed to continuous improvement and will be using the information gathered in our report to develop 
a sustainability roadmap that will guide our e orts towards achieving our sustainability goals and targets while 
considering the impact of our operations on the environment, society, and our business.
