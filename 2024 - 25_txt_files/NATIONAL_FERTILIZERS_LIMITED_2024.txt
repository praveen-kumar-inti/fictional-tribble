1.
• Urea is sold to 
farmers in the 
country in 
multilayered 
plastic bags. 
• As per latest draft 
Notiﬁcation dtd 
06.10.2021 on 
the matter, 100% 
recycling of 
Plastic Waste 
generated is 
required to 
recycle in year 
2024-25.
• The annual 
plastic waste 
generated by 
NFL is approx. 
16300 MT.
Negative
• Total ﬁnancial 
implication for 
the year 2024-
25 is Rs 1.75 Cr.
• Urea is 
controlled 
commodity and 
additional 
expenditure will 
impact the 
ﬁnancials of the 
company.
• NFL has 
achieved the 
target of 
recycling of 
100% of plastic 
waste for the 
year 2024-25.
Risk 
Plastic waste 
Management rules-
2016 (along with 
subsequent 
amendments) : 
MOEF&CC notiﬁed 
“Plastic Waste 
Management Rules 
2016 (amended)” 
wherein fertilizer 
manufacturing 
companies have to 
get registered with 
State Pollution 
Control Board / 
Central Pollution 
Control Board as 
Brand Owner and 
prepare an action 
plan for collecting 
back the plastic 
waste and its 
disposal.  
2.
Tightening of 
energy norms has 
reduced company’s 
operational proﬁt 
from urea 
manufacturing 
business. Further, 
reduction in energy 
norms shall make 
operation unviable.
Negative
• NFL has 
completed the 
energy saving 
projects by 
March 2022 
leading to 
reduction of 
energy 
consumption 
and reduction of 
carbon 
footprints by 
more than 25%. 
• However, Urea 
operations were 
at risk till the 
projects were 
completed as 
energy 
consumption
• To meet the 
revised norms 
of NUP-2015, 
NFL has 
already spent 
more than Rs 
1000 Crore.
• However, by 
implementation 
of these 
schemes NFL 
was able to 
only reduce 
losses but 
further 
tightening of 
energy norms 
will make  
operation of 
these plants 
unviable. 
Risk 
Tightening of Energy 
norms by GoI by 
implementation of 
NUP-2015 norms 
and further revision 
is due from April 
2025
 was higher than 
the norm.
• Further, energy 
reduction norms 
by GoI will 
severely impact 
NFL proﬁtability.
• Energy Norms 
of NUP-2015 
(REN) for 
Vijaipur-I Unit 
under 
consideration 
for extension till 
31.03.2025 
with penalty of 
35% of 
diﬀerence 
between REN 
and Target 
Energy Norms 
(TEN) or till the 
unit achieves 
the TEN, 
whichever is 
earlier.
• Further, 
revision of 
energy norms 
beyond 
01.04.2025 are 
under review 
and notiﬁcation 
for the same is 
awaited.
3.
• All fertilizer 
manufacturing 
plant operate by 
sourcing the power 
from running the 
GTG-HRSG to 
avoid frequent 
plant tripping and 
thermal shocks to 
plant.  
Negative
The estimated 
ﬁnancial 
implication on 
account of 
purchase of REC 
will be Rs. 4-5 Cr.  
NFL has to 
purchase 
equivalent 
RCO/REC for 
compliance
Risk 
Notiﬁcation of BEE 
for compliance of

4.
• Agriculture Waste 
can be utilized as 
Organic manure 
which oﬀers 
numerous 
environmental 
beneﬁts, primarily 
by reducing 
pollution, 
enhancing soil
