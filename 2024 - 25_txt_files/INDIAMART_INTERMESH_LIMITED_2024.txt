Corporate 
Governance
Risk 
Inadequate corporate governance 
can lead to a series of detrimental 
outcomes for an organisation. These 
may include unethical behaviour, the 
mismanagement of resources, legal 
complications and damage to both 
reputation and financial stability.
The Company has established a policy 
framework to encourage ethical conduct 
among all employees throughout the 
organization and to ensure compliance 
with all regulations. To promote 
transparency and accountability, 
the Company has implemented a 
confidential whistleblower mechanism. 
The Board-approved policies of 
the Company are available on the 
Company’s website at https://investor.
indiamart.com/CorporateGovernance.
aspx in multiple languages. Additionally, 
these policies are communicated to 
and accessible by employees via the 
Company Intranet, Web ERP.
Negative 
Opportunity
Strong corporate governance 
principles, ethical leadership, and 
effective oversight can enhance 
accountability, stakeholders trust 
& confidence leading to promotion 
of long-term sustainability for the 
company.

2
Privacy and 
Data Security
Risk 
Failure to prevent, detect and 
mitigate data security threats 
encompassing data prevention, 
storage and leakage can significantly 
impact reputation and trust of the 
stakeholders, which could lead to 
adverse consequences on customer 
acquisition and retention.
IndiaMART has established a 
comprehensive information security 
framework to safeguard its data against 
unauthorized access and external 
threats. The Company’s adherence to 
global best practices for data protection 
is demonstrated by its attainment of 
the ISO 27001 certification for effective 
information security management 
and the ISO 27701:2019 certification 
for Privacy Information Management 
Standard. Additionally, IndiaMART 
holds several other ISO certifications, 
including:
 
 
ISO 12207:2017 for Software and 
System Engineering
 
 
ISO 31000:2018 for Enterprise 
Risk Management
 
 
ISO 22301:2019 for Business 
Continuity Management
 
 
ISO 27701:2019 for Privacy 
Information Management Standard
 
 
ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 for IT Service 
Management System
Negative 
Opportunity
Strong data protection measures, 
transparent privacy policies, and 
responsible data management 
would lead to trust and confidence 
of stakeholders with ultimate benefit 
over customer acquisition, retention, 
maintain brand reputation with 
competitive advantage.
3
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Risk 
Discrimination, lack of diversity, 
and a non-inclusive culture can 
lead to legal issues, talent retention 
challenges, and a negative public 
perception apart from restricted 
view or perspective. Also, hinders 
innovation, employee morale, and 
organizational adaptability.
The Company is dedicated to 
implementing policies and procedures 
that promote equal opportunity, prevent 
discrimination, and ensure fair treatment 
for all employees, regardless of their 
background, identity, or personal 
characteristics. These policies are 
regularly reviewed and updated to align 
with best practices and applicable laws 
and regulations. Furthermore, they 
are available in multiple languages to 
ensure accessibility for all employees. 
Further, we have institutionalized 
dedicated programs focusing on 
increasing the participation of women in 
the workforce as well as enhancing their 
well-being.
Positive 
Opportunity
Diversity and inclusion are distinct 
yet interconnected. The Company 
firmly believes in diversity and 
inclusion as it supports or ensures 
different perspectives on different 
issues. The different perspective 
results into the best possible and 
evaluated decision benefiting the 
organization. Diversity represents an 
entity’s composition, while inclusion 
focuses on valuing and encouraging 
contributions from diverse groups. 
The Company fosters economic 
growth, and a culture of inclusion 
and equality in the society.

Talent 
Management
Risk 
Ineffective talent management may 
also result in a lack of diversity, 
hindering innovation and exposing 
the organization to reputational 
risks. Failing to effectively manage 
talent could result in a lack of a high 
performance culture and a loss of 
competitive advantage. Additionally, 
overlooking the significance of our 
employees in our cost structure 
could lead to financial inefficiencies 
and hinder long-term success.
The Company employs a well-organized 
approach to identifying skilled talent, 
utilizing strategies such as campus 
hiring, participation in job fairs, 
internal employee referrals, periodic 
hiring drives, and collaborations with 
external organizations. Additionally, 
the Company prioritizes career growth 
and retention initiatives, including the 
grant of ESOP/SAR, and regularly 
upgrades employees’ skills in line 
with technological advancements and 
developments. This commitment is 
evidenced by the fact that over 950 
employees have been associated with 
IndiaMART for more than five years.
Negative 
Opportunity
In today’s dynamic environment, 
recognizing the invaluable 
contributions of our employees, we 
prioritize both retaining our existing
talent and attracting new 
professionals to scale up our 
operations effectively. This
approach not only boosts 
productivity and cultivates a high-
performance culture but also plays 
a pivotal role in ensuring long-term 
success and sustaining a competitive
advantage as we scale up our 
operations. It’s crucial to recognize 
that employees are a significant part 
of our cost structure.
5
Community 
Development
Risk 
Failing to address community needs, 
causing environmental or social 
harm, and neglecting stakeholder 
engagement pose significant 
risks. These actions can lead to 
reputational loss and connect with 
community at large.
The Company focuses on creating 
value through initiatives that support 
economic development, education, and 
environmental conservation. By offering 
free listings, affordable technology 
solutions, and platform training to small 
suppliers, the Company supports their 
growth and development. Additionally, 
by empowering buyers in smaller 
cities through price transparency, the 
Company fosters fairer market practices 
and enhances the value of their 
investments.
Positive
Opportunity
Community development creates 
a positive social impact while also 
benefiting the bottom line. By 
engaging in community development 
initiatives, such as sponsoring 
local events, supporting education 
programs, and participating in 
charitable endeavors, strengthens 
relationships with key stakeholders. 
It also enhances brand reputation., 
attracts top talent, and differentiate 
the Company from competitors.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe    the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Given the nature of IndiaMART’s business, e-waste is the primary waste generated. The Company produces a minimal amount 
of e-waste, which is managed in accordance with relevant laws. This e-waste mainly originates from discarded electrical and 
electronic devices. To manage this, the Company ensures the safe disposal and recycling of e-waste by transferring it to certified 
recyclers. Additionally, the Company refurbishes its IT assets when feasible.
	
The Company’s dry waste primarily consists of paper waste. There has been a consistent focus on reducing paper consumption 
through extensive digitization across various value chains and functions. Waste paper generated in the offices is shredded and 
subsequently recycled into new paper products as part of a wastepaper recycling service. The Company’s initiatives aim to reduce 
waste and optimize resource efficiency wherever possible.

•

Performance Indicators (KPIs) under 9 ESG attributes.

Our focus included disclosures, management processes, and key ESG metrics specified under the BRSR Core. The 
Industry Standard on Reporting of BRSR Core used a basis of limited level of assurance. 
• 
Understanding the key systems, processes and controls for collecting, managing and reporting the Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) of BRSR Core. Understand and test, on a sample basis to evaluate adherence to the reporting principles. 
• 
Collect and evaluate documentary evidence and management representations supporting adherence to the reporting 
principles. We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our assurance efforts on the issues of high 
material relevance to the Company’s business and its key stakeholders. 
• 
DNV audit team conducted on-site audit for head office. Sample based assessment of site-specific data disclosures was 
carried out. We were free to choose sites for conducting our assessment.
