strictly prohibits unethical practices like bribery, forgery, deception, extortion, and corruption. The CoC governs employee 
conduct in dealings with external parties and is enforced through oversight by the Statutory Audit Committee and the Risk 
Management Committee. Significantly, under the Policy’s provisions on misconduct and embezzlement, the acceptance 
of illegal gratification constitutes a serious offence, leading to termination of employment. KNPL's CoC thus provides a 
strong framework for anti-bribery and anti-corruption governance. Furthermore, a separate Code of Conduct is in place 
for the BoD and senior management, mandating the highest level of integrity and ethical conduct in all professional 
dealings.

KNPL has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge system at key manufacturing facilities nationwide. This system has 
significantly reduced its freshwater withdrawal in FY 2024-25 and completely eliminated industrial wastewater discharge 
into external water bodies. Domestic wastewater is treated through the STP (Sewage Treatment Plant), while processed 
wastewater undergoes treatment via the ETP (Effluent Treatment Plant). The ZLD system employs a multi-stage effluent 
treatment process (primary, secondary, and tertiary) followed by treatment in Multiple Effect Evaporators (MEE). The 
condensates from the MEE are recycled for process use, and the MEE salts and residue are sent for co-processing.

The Company’s strategies include increasing the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and adopting 
alternative fuels with lower emissions for energy generation. Furthermore, KNPL aims to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 
by 55% by FY 2029-30, based on the FY 2018-19 baseline. As part of its dedication to sustainability across its operations 
and supply chain, the Company has partnered with a third party to launch a programme focused on enhancing its 
suppliers’ understanding of GHG monitoring and measurement. Over 200 suppliers were invited to in training sessions 
covering climate change, GHG accounting, and management practises. Additionally, the Company has implemented 
energy-efficient initiatives throughout its facilities. For further details, please refer to the Natural Capital Section of this
