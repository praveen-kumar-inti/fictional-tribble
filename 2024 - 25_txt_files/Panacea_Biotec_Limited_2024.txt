Ethical 
Conduct of
Clinical Trials
and Animal
Testing
Risk
Clinical 
Trials

integral part of product 
development 
in 
the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
There is a need to address 
risks 
associated 
with 
clinical trials and animal 
testing especially around 
the ethical and safety 
related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and 
animal testing. Adverse 
events reported during 
the animal testing or 
clinical trial can delay 
product 
development 
leading to increase in 
cost and loss of gaining 
business 
opportunity
•	
The Company complies with all the 
relevant 
regulatory 
requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. The Company has dedicated in-
house teams responsible for ensuring

permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation.

order 
to assess and measure safety 
parameters over a longer time 
horizon. 
Negative: 
Not 
following 
good clinical practices while 
conducting animal testing or 
clinical trials can have impact 
on the efficacy and safety 
of the products. It can also 
attract adverse regulatory / 
legal action, lead to financial 
damages and reputation loss 
and have a negative impact on 
participant’s health and safety.
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.

suppliers 
can 
disrupt 
supplies and dictate their 
terms. The Company also 
imports some of the critical 
materials 
from 
outside 
India. During spread of any 
global pandemic supplies 
from 
outside 
may 
be 
affected. 
These factors can disrupt 
operations 
resulting 
in 
lower sales and negative 
impact on the Company’s 
profitability and reputation.
The Company has entered into long-
term 
supply 
agreements 
for 
key 
materials having single source suppliers. 
The Company also maintains adequate 
inventories to take care of any temporary 
non-availability of imported materials.
The 
Company 
is 
also 
proactively 
working towards expanding its supplier 
base, and adding alternative suppliers, 
in order to minimize any risk associated 
with supply chain interruptions.
Negative: Supply chain related 
risks can disrupt production 
activities, delay in supply of 
products to customers, loss of 
business contract and attract 
penalty on account of failure / 
delay in supply of the products 
on time. All these can adversely 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
profitability and reputation as a 
reliable supplier.

Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements 
The Company aims to become one of the leading biotechnology Company. We recognize 
the importance of conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner. We 
are implementing sustainability practices, accountability and transparency across our 
operations and value chain. As part of our efforts to integrate sustainability in our business 
we are developing a robust ESG framework, which is being built on the principles of 
operating responsibly and growing sustainably.
Environmental Responsibility: At Panacea Biotec, we are committed to embedding 
sustainability across our operations as a driver of resilience and long-term value creation. 
To achieve our target of sustainable operations, we have implemented multiple initiatives 
like conducting detailed assessment of all our operations to identify emissions hotspots 
and develop decarbonisation pathways to guide individual sites to bring down their carbon 
emissions over medium and long term. We also conducted water use assessments across 
all manufacturing facilities and potential to minimize fresh water usage was identified. 
We plan on conducting assessment audits in the future to further reduce our fresh water 
consumption. We are also reviewing waste management practices to further minimize 
waste and turn Zero Landfill in India by end of calendar year 2025. To sustain these efforts, 
ESG-focused employee training and awareness programs are actively being conducted 
across the organization to eliminate waste, rethink processes and products in our endeavour 
to become Net Zero.
In financial year 2025, our sustainability initiatives delivered measurable impact:
•	
165 tCO₂ emissions avoided
•	
58.6 tonnes of plastic recycled and 97.3 tonnes of plastic eliminated
•	
690 litres of oil recycled
•	
58.84 million litres of water treated and reused
•	
74.78 tonnes of waste effectively managed
These achievements reflect our systematic approach: conducting detailed assessments of 
emission hotspots, developing decarbonisation pathways for individual sites, and auditing 
water usage across facilities to identify opportunities for reducing fresh water consumption. 
Social Responsibility: We believe our growth is inseparable from the well-being of our 
employees, communities, and stakeholders. Panacea Biotec employs ~1,500 employees, 
representing diversity in culture, gender, demographics, and expertise. We foster a safe, healthy, 
and competitive workplace that enables innovation and supports professional growth.
