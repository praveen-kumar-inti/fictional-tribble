1.
Price 
volatility 
of Raw 
Materials
Risk
Fluctuations in raw material 
prices can have several 
impacts on a company, 
including the availability 
of materials and increased 
operational expenditure.
De-risking 
of 
our 
raw 
material 
sources 
by 
having 
multiple 
raw 
material suppliers across 
multiple geographies and 
in certain cases achieving 
de-risking by co-working 
with the suppliers for 
sustainable pricing. 
Positive
2.
Availability 
of natural 
resources 
based inputs
Risk 
Our focus on natural capital 
as an important aspect of 
our value creation approach 
motivates us to develop 
sustainable products and 
solutions that have minimal 
negative impact on the 
natural 
environment, 
in 
order to meet our business 
requirements.
Inputs based on natural 
resources are a challenge 
and steps are taken to 
ensure that these inputs 
are procured sustainably. 
Positive
3.
Energy 
Intensive 
Operations
Opportunity
Our 
production 
process 
involves the use of high-
temperature reactions and 
distillation, which require 
significant 
amounts 
of 
energy.
Adopting 
renewable 
energy, energy-efficiency 
and continuous process 
optimization programme.
Positive
4.
Disposal of 
Waste
Risk
During 
the 
production 
process, 
various 
waste 
materials are generated, 
which can pose a threat 
to the environment and 
human 
health, 
if 
not 
properly 
handled 
and 
disposed off.

5.
Climate 
change 
Risk
The risks associated with 
climate change and global 
warming encompass risks 
related to environmental 
regulations, 
natural 
disasters caused by climate 
change and sustainability 
pressures at both the local 
and global levels.
Despite the current risk, 
it presents the Company 
with 
a 
distinctive 
opportunity to transition 
towards 
sustainable 
practices 
such 
as 
exploring as well as using 
renewable 
energy 
and 
alternative resource and 
fuel sources.
Positive
6.
Water 
Management
Risk
Any disruption to water 
supply or quality can affect 
operations and potentially 
lead to increased costs, 
delays.
Going 
beyond 
the 
minimum 
regulatory 
compliance requirements 
by focusing on water 
conservation 
and 
efficiency, 
effective 
waste 
water 
quality 
management, 
and 
achieving 
zero 
liquid 
discharge.
Negative
7.
Air Pollution 
/ emission
Risk 
Not 
complying 
with 
emission regulations could 
result in a negative and 
long-lasting impact on the 
environment and society, 
leading to the imposition of 
fines and levies, increased 
costs for monitoring and 
reporting and other related 
expenses.
Adherence to regulations 
by 
installing 
state-of-
the-art 
air 
pollution 
control devices (APCD), 
implementing 
effective 
management of fugitive 
emissions and conducting

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
	
The manufacturing process unavoidably generates waste, taking cognizance of this, the Company has 
implemented measures to ensure responsible waste management practices. Our aim is to avoid disposal 
of large amounts of waste and adopt procedures that repurpose used material and reintroduce excess 
material back into the production process. The Company employs the ‘3R’ concept, which is to reduce, reuse, 
and recycle waste. The Company follows legally prescribed methods and environmentally safe disposal 
techniques for disposing of hazardous waste and sells non-hazardous waste to approved recyclers.
	
The company manages all waste in accordance with the Consent to Operate/Hazardous Waste authorization 
of each site. By regularly refining the process and technology, the company employs a “Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle, Recovery, and Disposal” strategy to minimize the creation of hazardous waste.
	
The company either provides hazardous waste to authorized recyclers, disposes of it through Treatment 
Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDF), or offers it to other industries as raw material.
	
Recognizing the importance of water as a resource, we undertake several initiatives to optimize the 
consumption and reduce resultant wastewater generation through our reuse or recycle approach at our 
Bareilly and Baroda Plant. The wastewater generated in the plants is recovered and reused in process. 
	
Effluent generated at Bareilly and Baroda is treated in Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) followed by treatment 
in RO plant. The company has installed Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to 
recover 70%-80% of the water from ETP effluent which is recycled to process.
	
Currently we are recycling 30% pure condensate against total steam consumption of 175 TPD (tonnes per 
day). Bareilly plant recycles wash water within the same process, thus saving on almost 5 -10% of fresh water. 
The Company has installed a new Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at its plant in Bareilly.
10.	 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife
