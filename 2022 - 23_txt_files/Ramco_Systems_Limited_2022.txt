matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or

1.
Energy 
Management
Risk
Energy is often necessary 
to operate processing units, 
machinery, and other facilities 
that are not directly involved 
in manufacturing in the 
software and IT business. As 
a result, a firm’s decisions 
about the energy intensity 
of its operations and the 
sources of its energy may 
change over time, impacting 
the organization’s operating 
efficiency and risk profile.
Energy efficiency and 
switching to renewable 
energy sources, is a 
priority that reduces 
carbon emissions, can 
reduce our operating 
costs and is aligned with 
the agenda of moving 
towards carbon neutrality. 
Ramco takes focused 
initiatives to reduce 
Company’s specific 
and absolute energy 
consumption.

2.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Climate change events bring 
physical dangers such as 
sea level rise and increased 
cyclonic effect, as well as 
transitional concerns such as 
renewable energy mandates. 
Such occurrences have the 
potential to have an impact 
on the business. As a result, 
assessment and mitigation of 
such hazards is very vital. 
Ramco is focusing on 
Net Zero and developing 
technology-enabled 
climate-centric solutions 
for our customers.
Negative
3.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
A Company’s high diversity 
and inclusion rate reflects its 
employees’ sense of belonging 
and justice. Furthermore, 
increasing diversity and 
inclusion helps businesses 
support vulnerable populations, 
resulting in the construction of 
community brand image.
-
Positive
4.
Human 
Rights
Risk
Companies that prioritise 
human rights highlight their 
dedication to developing 
long-term, mutually beneficial 
partnerships with individuals 
influenced or touched by their 
operations, such as consumers, 
communities, workers, and 
investors. This includes 
demonstrating concern for the 
people whose lives they interact 
with.
Ramco has a robust 
Human Capital 
Management (HCM) 
tool which helps Ramco 
optimize the various HR 
functions. It helps the 
Company in Competency 
planning and better 
staffing. 
Negative
5.
Digital Talent 
Empowerment
Opportunity
Empowering digital talent in the 
workplace is critical because it 
provides employees with new 
skills and chances to engage 
more effectively and show their 
potential, as a result, increasing 
employee engagement and 
efficiency in performance.

6.
Talent 
Acquisition, 
Development 
& Retention
Risk
Higher staff retention rates 
indicate that the Company’s 
policies and practises are 
sound. A high attrition rate, 
on the other hand, signals 
low employee satisfaction 
to investors. Ensuring good 
worker wellbeing can increase 
employee morale while 
decreasing onboarding costs.
The primary focus is 
to create a motivated 
workforce that will 
contribute to higher levels 
of business performance. 
We rely on the right 
talent for servicing 
customer needs, business 
sustainability, and future 
growth.
Negative
7.
Education 
and Skill 
Development
Opportunity
Employee re-skilling enables 
businesses to stay up with 
the dynamic shift in demand 
for new technology while also 
sustaining the growing firm. It 
develops a workforce that is 
adaptable, nimble, and eager to 
learn, and that can take on new 
duties when the organisation 
requires assistance.
-
Positive
8.
Customer 
Relations
Risk
Customer satisfaction is a 
critical success indicator as it 
assesses how well firms deliver 
products and services that 
meet or exceed consumers’ 
expectations, providing insight 
into an organization’s overall 
success. A poor customer 
experience relationship can 
lead to customer loss or a drop 
in customer loyalty. Similarly, 
client loss and reputational 
damage can result in decreased 
sales and revenue.
Our trust-based 
relationships with 
customers enable us 
for success. Ramco 
engages with customers 
across the year in ways 
to reinforce trust and 
strengthen relationship. 
With dedicated customer 
support team and quality 
team we ensure utmost 
customer satisfaction
Negative
9.
Risk 
Management
Risk
Maintaining competitive 
superiority in this dynamic 
demand and supply side 
environment needs that the 
Company be resilient to 
shocks. This is controlled 
through a strong enterprise 
risk management approach 
that assesses and manages 
financial and non-financial 
threats.
Maintaining our position of 
competitive dominance in 
this dynamic demand and 
supply-side environment 
necessitates that our 
business is resilient 
to handle shocks. 
Management of this 
is enabled through a 
robust enterprise risk 
management process that 
evaluates and addresses 
both financial and non-
financial risks.

Business 
Ethics and 
Compliance
Risk
The significant issue relevant 
to business ethics and the 
management of business 
ethics issues such as fraud, 
executive misbehaviour, 
unethical practises, money 
laundering, or anti-trust crimes. 
Ethics infractions can result in 
police investigations, expensive 
fines, settlement fees, and 
reputational damage. 
We comply with the Laws 
of the countries and 
geographies in which we 
operate is a business 
imperative that protects 
the Company. 
Negative
11.
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Companies are graded based 
on the amount of personal data 
they gather, their exposure to 
changing or expanding privacy 
rules, their vulnerability to 
prospective data breaches, 
and their data protection 
mechanisms.
Ramco uses data 
protection practices to 
ensure that the customer’s 
data is secure. We have 
a ISO 27001 certified 
process in place.
Negative
12.
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are evaluated 
based on their performance 
in all important governance 
concerns, such as ownership 
and control, Board’s 
compensation, accounting, 
corporate ethics, and tax 
transparency. Additionally, 
this topic investigates how 
corporate governance and 
business ethics practises affect 
a Company’s Shareholders and 
other investors.
As being exposed to 
Reputation Risk and 
Legal Risk, Ramco 
Systems hold strong 
corporate governance 
for achieving long-term 
mission of aligning the 
Company’s interests with 
stakeholders.
Negative
13.
Innovation
Opportunity
Businesses that innovate stay 
relevant and ahead of the 
competition. It enables them to 
contribute value to the industry 
while also meeting the needs 
of their customers along with 
tapping into a wider market 
presence.
