Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
At Affle, we recognize the importance of integrating 
sustainability across our organisation. We continue to 
benchmark our governance, ESG practices and financial 
reporting with industry leading standards. Our proactive 
adoption of ESG in FY2020-21 and perpetual initiatives 
towards enabling a sustainable well-governed ecosystem 
reinforces our commitment towards inclusive value 
creation for the stakeholders and the society at large.
Affle being in the mobile advertising technology 
business, is significantly less resource intensive in 
terms of environmental impact or related material 
inputs. However, as a responsible Company, we resolve 
to accelerate the evolution of ESG to make a positive 
impact on people and the planet. We are committed 
to make conscious efforts towards managing energy, 
water and waste more efficiently. Recently, we revised 
our e-waste strategy as part of our waste management 
approach, with the aim of minimizing waste and its 
environmental impact. Our revised policy aims to 
minimize e-waste by donating used laptops/hardware 
to charitable organisations in the working condition, 
aligned to the 3R (Reduce, Recycle and Reuse) principle 
of waste management. This shall also contribute to the 
digital inclusiveness and academic well-being of the 
communities around us.
During the year FY2023, we continued our efforts of 
implementing sustainable business practices across 
organisation, focused on: 1. enhancing cyber security 
and data protection capabilities to ensure the security 
and privacy for our customers and 2. creating an 
inclusive workplace free from all forms of discrimination 
and harassment.  On the governance front, our ESG 
Committee 
conducts 
regular 
evaluations 
of 
the 
Company’s ESG practices. We assess all critical policies 
to ensure that they align with our values & objectives 
and integrate sustainability considerations into all our 
business processes, corporate decisions and strategic 
goals. In order to reinforce our policy framework, during 
FY2023 we have introduced two new policies, namely 
the ESG Policy and the Vendor Code of Conduct. 
Additionally, we have revised and updated the BRSR 
and IT Hardware Standards Policy to promote business 
sustainability and foster long-term resilience.
With the aim of positive impact towards a better 
tomorrow, Affle is broadening its sustainability 
initiatives and working more closely to address 
previously identified major material topics which have 
high relevance to its business.
