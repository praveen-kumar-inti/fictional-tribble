Management 
Perspective
We are happy to report that AICL has continued to 
demonstrate phenomenal results in the FY23. We have 
reported a 26.35% year-on-year (YoY) jump in consolidated 
revenue from operations at Rs 2024.08 crores. Our EBIDTA 
has increased by 32.03 % at Rs. 144.57 crore and we reported 
PAT of Rs. 92.25 crore with an increase of 44.87%. We are 
committed to serve our nation by being an integral part of 
Indian Infrastructure development. We function as an Infra-
ancillary for the transport & logistics segments because of 
our powerful logistical assets & infrastructure. We continue 
our stand of being the largest bitumen player in the private 
sector in India.
Our performance has seen a steady growth journey year on 
year and this has led us to have continual strategic expansion 
plans to grow our capacities. We now own a fleet of 8 large 
vessels having total capacity of around 48550 MT which are 
used in importing raw bitumen from oil producing countries. 
In Budget 2023 Road ministry got a 36% hike in allocation 
at Rs 2.7 lakh cr for 2023-24, to help the ministry meet the 
25,000-km road development target announced in the 2022-
23 Budget. This development pace is creating a huge demand 
for road materials, thereby our responsibilities of catering 
Bitumen has further increased. The market opportunity is 
tremendous and we have captured almost 20%-30% of the 
bulk market share in Bitumen in the private sector.
Expecting strong growth in infrastructure activity and based 
on the current market trend and order pipeline, we have a 
strong guidance of sustainable long-term growth.
Mr. Lalit Agarwal
Whole Time Director

STATE 
OF 
AFFAIRS 
& 
BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW
The Company primarily belongs to Ancillary Infra Industry 
and is engaged in the business of (i) manufacturing and 
trading of Bitumen and Allied products used heavily in 
infrastructure projects (ii) providing Logistics for Bulk 
Bitumen and LPG through its own Specialized Tankers 
and (iii) also generates power through Wind Mills. These 
businesses are of seasonal nature due to which revenue 
gets varied.
MANUFACTURING & BULK BITUMEN 
STORAGE FACILITIES
The Company has its manufacturing and storage units 
at Taloja, Belgaum, Baroda, Hyderabad, Cochin (through 
its wholly owned subsidiary – Bituminex Cochin Private 
Limited) and at recently added unit at Pachpadra City, 
Dist. Barmer, (Rajasthan). Further, the Company has 
started full fledged operations  at its recently established 
manufacturing and storage facilities of Bitumen and 
other value added Bituminous products at Guwahati, 
Assam and which would endeavor to expand and develop 
Bitumen trade in Eastern states as Bitumen is extensively 
used in infrastructure projects more specifically in road 
construction projects initiated by the State Government.

effectively handle and market bitumen imports at Mumbai,

Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
BULK BITUMEN TRANSPOTATION
We are the pioneers of logistics in Bitumen, which is 
predominantly used in road construction business. It can 
be procured either in bulk or in packed form. In either case 
the product has to be dispatched to the construction site 
or  to the storage facilities of our industrial consumers. The 
bulk bitumen is transported via specially designed tankers 
that are insulated and have pumping facility for loading 
and unloading the bitumen. Most of our Bitumen tankers 
are under contract with major oil companies in India like 
HPCL, BPCL and IOCL and by other major consumers of 
the product.
BULK LPG TRANSPOTATION
We are amongst the leading transporters of LPG in India, 
which is the most widely used fuel for domestic as well as 
industrial purposes. While we already own a large fleet 
of tankers, we also hire tankers on long term contracts to 
cater to the demand from customers LPG is mainly sourced 
from domestic refineries and via bulk imports. Bulk LPG is 
mainly transported from the source to the industrial user or 
to their bottling plants through specially designed tankers 
LPG, being highly inflammable, require tankers that take 
care of all safety aspects while loading, transporting and 
unloading. Most of the LPG tankers are under contract 
with major oil companies like HPCL, BPCL and IOCL.
POWER GENERATION THROUGH WIND 
MILLS
The Company has diversified into Non-Conventional 
energy generation by installing wind mills at Rajasthan 
and Maharashtra, keeping in view of the likely shortage of 
energy resources in future. Your Company has one Windmill 
at Dhulia, Maharashtra and one in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.
AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRE OF ASHOK 
LEYLAND
We own a large fleet of tankers which necessarily calls 
for regular periodic checks and maintenance. As also, 
our entire fleet of tankers comes from the Ashok Leyland 
stable. Both these factors influenced our decision to set up 
an authorized service center, for Ashok Leyland vehicles, 
within the company. Not only does this ensure a timely 
turnaround of the fleet serviced but is an economically 
beneficial proposition for the company. We have our own 
workshop and maintenance facilities at strategic locations 
like Mumbai, Baroda and Jodhpur.
SHARE CAPITAL
Issued and Paid up Capital of the Company is comprised 
of 1,49,57,789 Equity Shares of Face Value of `10/ each

conversion are listed on BSE & NSE. Further, entire funds 
raised under the said Preferential Issue have been utilized 
strictly in accordance with the objects of the issue which 
inter alia, included: repayment of debt, capital expenditure, 
investments and meeting working capital requirements.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Please note that disclosures given in this Annexure - 
Management Discussion and Analysis’ (MD&A) are 
meant to ensure that there is transparency in Company’s 
financial performance. They enable our investors to 
evaluate the Company and make informed investment 
decisions. Financial statements alone are not sufficient 
to judge a Company’s current performance and predict 
the future performance. The ordinary investor needs 
narrative explanations to have a better understanding of 
the performance and the environment in which the firm 
operates. MD & A fulfills this objective. It gives the investor 
an opportunity to look at the Company through the eyes 
of management by providing both a short and long-term 
analysis of the business of the Company.
Some statements in this discussion describing the 
projections, estimates, expectations or outlook may 
be forward looking. Actual results may, however, differ 
materially from those stated, on account of various factors 
such as changes in government regulations, tax regimes, 
economic developments within India and the countries 
within which your Company conducts its business, exchange 
rates and interest rates fluctuations, impact of competition, 
demand and supply constraints, etc.
BITUMEN INDUSTRY SCENARIO
Indian Bitumen Market Outlook - 2026
The India bitumen market was valued at $2.8 billion in 2018, 
and is projected to reach $3.6 billion by 2026, growing at a 
CAGR of 2.8% from 2019 to 2026.
Bitumen is a black to dark brown sticky material, composed 
principally of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. It is a 
semi-solid hydrocarbon product of crude oil distillation, 
which is produced by removing the lighter fractions (such as 
liquid petroleum gas, petrol, and diesel) from heavy crude 
oil during the refining process. The physical properties of 
bitumen include adhesion, resistance to water, hardness 
and higher softening point.
The growth of Indian bitumen market is majorly driven 
by increase in road and building construction activities. 
Construction of various national highways, expressways, 
and airport runways boosts the demand for bitumen 
across the country. Bitumen is processed into asphalt for 
road construction. In addition, rise in investments by the 
government for the development of national highways and 
expressways, which include projects relating two-laning of 
highways, the National Highways Development Project, six-
laning of crowded stretches of the Golden Quadrilateral, a 
special program for the development of road connectivity in 
naxal affected areas, development of Vijayawada-Ranchi 
road, and for providing last mile connectivity, is anticipated 
to drive the growth of the market. Furthermore, bitumen is 
widely used in the construction industry for roofs, owing to 
its physical properties such as adhesion, resistance to water, 
hardness, ductility, and higher softening point. Therefore, 
growth in the construction industry due to growth in 
population across the cities and demand for new houses 
led to increase in demand for bitumen across the country. 
In addition, government initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri 
Awas Yojana (PMAY) that includes construction of houses 
for poor people living in both rural and urban areas is likely 
to increase the demand for bitumen; thereby, driving the 
growth of the India bitumen market.
However, human health & environmental issues associated 
with bitumen, fluctuating international crude oil prices, and 
increase in use of alternative of bitumen such as concrete in 
roadway construction applications are expected to restrain 
the growth of the market. Moreover, development of bio-
based bitumen and EME (Enrobés á Module Elevé) binder 
is anticipated to provide lucrative opportunities for further 
development of the market.
 The Indian bitumen market size is segmented on the 
basis of type, end-use industry, and region. Depending on 
type, the market is classified into paving grade bitumen, 
oxidized bitumen, polymer modified bitumen, and bitumen 
emulsions. By end-use industry, it is classified into road 
construction, waterproofing, and others. Region wise, it is 
analyzed across North India, East India, Northeast India, 
South India, and West India.
The major key players operating in the Indian bitumen market 
besides Agarwal Industries Corporation Ltd, include Indian 
Oil Corporation Ltd., Hindustan Petroleum Corporation 
Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd., Oil & Natural 
Gas Corporation Ltd., Total India, Tiki Tar Industries India 
Ltd, Juno Bitumix Pvt Ltd., Universal Bituminous Industries 
Pvt. Ltd., and Swastik Tar Industries. Other players operating 
in this market include Hincol, Jalnidhi Bitumen Specialities 
Pvt. Ltd., OOMS Polymer Modified Bitumen Pvt Ltd., Sapco, 
and UFTI. These major key players are adopting different 
strategies such as joint venture, agreement, and business 
expansion to stay competitive in the Indian market.
Indian Bitumen Market, By Region – 2026
North India, East India, Northern India, 
West India & South India
North India would exhibit an CAGR of 3.4% during 
2019-2026.
North India accounted for the major India bitumen market 
share in 2018, owing to major road network development 
initiatives undertaken by the Government of India (GoI) in 
the North India Region, which include national highways 
projects in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. In addition, 
maintenance and repair of rural roads constructed 
under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) in 
Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh 
is anticipated to increase the demand for bitumen across 
these states; thereby, driving the growth of the bitumen 
market across North India.
Indian Bitumen Market, By Type
70
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Paving Grade Bitumen is projected as the 
most lucrative segment.
Paving grade bitumen segment accounted for the major 
share in 2018, owing to growth in road construction 
development activities across the country. Government 
projects such as Bharatmala, various national highway 
projects, and construction of various economic corridors 
in different states fuel the demand for bitumen emulsion 
across the country. In addition, initiatives launched by 
Government of India for construction of roads in rural areas 
such as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and 
upgradation, maintenance, and repair work of existing 
rural roads, national highways, and expressways are likely 
to boost the demand for bitumen across India; thereby, 
driving the India bitumen market growth.
India Bitumen Market, By End-Use Industry
Road Construction is projected as the 
most lucrative segment.
Depending on end-use industry, the road construction 
segment accounted for the major market share .The road 
construction segment includes national highway, state 
highway, rural roads, and airport runways. Government has 
initiated various road projects that include construction of 
various national and state highways, expressways, and 
airports to boost the infrastructural activities. In addition, 
to connect the rural areas of the country to the cities the 
government has launched initiatives like Pradhan Mantri 
Gram Sadak Yojana that provide good all-weather roads. 
This factor is anticipated to drive the growth of the market.
Key Benefits for Indian Bitumen Market:

The India bitumen market analysis covers in-depth 
information of major industry participants.
•	
Porter’s five forces analysis helps analyze the potential 
of buyers & suppliers and the competitive scenario of 
the industry for strategy building.
•	
Major countries have been mapped according to their 
individual revenue contribution to the regional market.
•	
The report provides an in-depth analysis of the India 
bitumen market forecast for the period 2019-2026.
•	
The report outlines the current India bitumen market 
trend and future estimations of the market from 2018 
to 2026 to understand the prevailing opportunities 
and potential investment pockets.
•	
The key drivers, restraints, and India bitumen market 
opportunity and their detailed impact analysis is 
elucidated in the study. Construction of various 
national 
highways, 
expressways, 
and 
airport 
runways boosts the demand for bitumen across the 
country. Bitumen is processed into asphalt for road 
construction. In addition, rise in investments by the 
government for the development of national highways 
and expressways, which include projects relating 
two-laning of highways, the National Highways 
Development Project, six-laning of crowded stretches 
of the Golden Quadrilateral, a special program for the 
development of road connectivity in naxal affected 
areas, development of Vijayawada-Ranchi road, and 
for providing last mile connectivity, is anticipated to 
drive the growth of the market. Furthermore, bitumen 
is widely used in the construction industry for roofs, 
owing to its physical properties such as adhesion, 
resistance to water, hardness, ductility, and higher 
softening point. Therefore, growth in the construction 
industry due to growth in population across the 
cities and demand for new houses led to increase in 
demand for bitumen across the country. In addition, 
government initiatives such as Pradhan Mantri Awas 
Yojana (PMAY) that includes construction of houses 
for poor people living in both rural andurban   areas 
is likely to increase the demand for bitumen; thereby, 
driving the growth of the Indian bitumen market. 
However, human health & environmental issues 
associated with bitumen, fluctuating international 
crude oil prices, and increase in use of alternative of 
bitumen such as concrete in roadway construction 
applications are expected to restrain the growth of 
the market. Moreover, development of bio-based 
bitumen and EME (Enrobés á Module Elevé) binder 
is anticipated to provide lucrative opportunities for 
further development of the market.

MANUFACTURING 
OF 
BITUMEN 
& 
BITUMINOUS PRODUCTS
The Company has its manufacturing and storage units 
at Taloja, Belgaum, Baroda, Hyderabad, Cochin (through 
its wholly owned subsidiary – Bituminex Cochin Private 
Limited) and at recently added unit at Pachpadra City, 
Dist. Barmer, (Rajasthan). Further, the Company has 
started full fledged operations  at its recently established 
manufacturing and storage facilities of Bitumen and 
other value added Bituminous products at Guwahati, 
Assam and which would endeavor to expand and develop 
Bitumen trade in Eastern states as Bitumen is extensively 
used in infrastructure projects more specifically in road 
construction projects initiated by the State Government.
BULK BITUMEN STORAGE FACILITIES
The Company has Bulk Bitumen Storage facilities to 
effectively handle and market bitumen imports at Mumbai, 
Maharashtra , Vadodara, Gujarat,  Karwar,  Haldia, West 
Bengal, Dighi ( Company Owned), Maharashtra , Hazira ( 
Loading ) and Mangalore.
BULK BITUMEN TRANSPOTATION
We are the pioneers of logistics in Bitumen, which is 
predominantly used in road construction business. It can 
be procured either in bulk or in packed form. In either case 
the product has to be dispatched to the construction site 
or  to the storage facilities of our industrial consumers. The 
bulk bitumen is transported via specially designed tankers 
that are insulated and have pumping facility for loading 
and unloading the bitumen. Most of our Bitumen tankers 
are under contract with major oil companies in India like 
HPCL, BPCL and IOCL and by other major consumers of 
the product.
BULK  LPG  TRANSPOTATION
We are amongst the leading transporters of LPG in India, 
which is the most widely used fuel for domestic as well as 
industrial purposes. While we already own a large fleet 
of tankers, we also hire tankers on long term contracts 
to cater to the demand from customers LPG is mainly 
sourced from domestic refineries and via bulk imports. 
Bulk LPG is mainly transported from the source to the 
industrial user or to their bottling plants through specially 
designed tankers LPG, being highly inflammable, require 
tankers that take care of all safety aspects while loading, 
transporting and unloading. Most of the LPG tankers are 
under contract with major oil companies like HPCL, BPCL 
and IOCL.
POWER GENERATION THROUGH WIND 
MILLS
The Company has diversified into Non-Conventional 
energy generation by installing wind mills at Rajasthan 
and Maharashtra, keeping in view of the likely shortage of 
energy resources in future. Your Company has one Windmill 
at Dhulia, Maharashtra and one in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.
AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRE OF ASHOK LEYLAND
We own a large fleet of tankers which necessarily calls 
for regular periodic checks and maintenance. As also, 
our entire fleet of tankers comes from the Ashok Leyland 
stable. Both these factors influenced our decision to set up 
an authorized service center, for Ashok Leyland vehicles, 
within the company. Not only does this ensure a timely 
turnaround of the fleet serviced but is an economically 
beneficial proposition for the company. We have our own 
workshop and maintenance facilities at strategic locations 
like Mumbai, Baroda and Jodhpur.

Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To The Members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation 
Limited
Report on the Standalone Financial Statements
1. 
We have audited the Standalone financial statements 
of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited (“the 
Company”), which comprise the Standalone Balance 
Sheet as at 31st March, 2023, and the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including other 
comprehensive income), the Standalone Statement 
of Changes in Equity and the Standalone Cash 
Flow Statement for the year then ended and, notes 
to the standalone financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
2. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at 31st March, 2023, and its profit and 
other comprehensive income, the changes in equity 
and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis of Opinion
3. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
4. 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
5
.
The Key Audit Matter
How was the matter addressed in our audit
Revenue is one of the key profit drivers and is therefore susceptible 
to misstatement. Cut-off is the key assertion insofar as revenue 
recognition is concerned, since an inappropriate cut-off can result 
in material misstatement of result for the year.
Our audit procedures with regard to revenue recognition included 
testing controls, automated and manual, around dispatches / deliveries, 
inventory reconciliations and circularization of receivable balances, 
substantive testing of cut-off and analytical review procedure. 
Information other than the financial statements 
and auditors’ report thereon
6. 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the 
Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report 
including Annexures to Board’s Report, Corporate 
Governance, but does not include the standalone 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
7. 
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
8. 
In connection with our audit of the standalone 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone 
Financial Statements
9.

10. In preparing the standalone financial statements, 
management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board 
of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the standalone financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also :
 
• 
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
standalone 
financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls.
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
controls relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements made by management.
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
13. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually 
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the 
effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
14. We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
15. We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
16. From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Report on other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
17. As required by section 197(16) of the Act, we report 
that the Company has paid remuneration to its directors 
during the year in accordance with the provisions of and 
limits laid down under section 197 read with Schedule 
V to the Act.
18. As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 
2020 (“the Order”) issued by the Central Government 
of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of 
the Act, we give in the “Annexure A” a statement on 
the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
Order, to the extent applicable.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to as ‘Annexure B’ in paragraph 19(f) of the Independent 
Auditors’ Report of even date to the members of Agarwal Industrial 
Corporation Limited on the standalone financial statements for the 
year ended on 31st March 2023.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
1. 
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited (“the 
Company”) as on 31st March 2023 in conjunction with our audit 
of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
2. 
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (“the Guidance Note”). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
3. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and 
prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with the ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls over 
financial reporting was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
5. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
6. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is 
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the standalone 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting
7. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
8. 
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting and such internal financial controls over 
financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March 
2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

(B) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	
1.	 Basis 
of 
Preparation 
of 
Financial 
Statements:
 
 
These financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind 
AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting standards) Rules as amended from 
time to time  and other related provisions of 
the Act.
 
 
The financial statements of the Company are 
prepared on accrual basis of accounting and 
Historical cost convention except for the following 
material items that have been measured at fair 
value as required by the relevant Ind AS:
 
 
(i) 
Certain financial assets and liabilities are 
measured at Fair value (refer note 7 below)
 
 
(ii) 
Defined benefit employee plan (refer note 14 
below)
 
 
The accounting policies are applied consistently 
to all the periods presented in the financial 
statements. All assets and liabilities have been 
classified as current or non current as per 
the Company’s normal operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
 
 
The financial statements are presented in INR, 
the functional currency of the Company.
	
2.	
Use of Estimates and judgments:
 
 
The preparation of the financial statements requires 
the Management to make, judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent 
liabilities as at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
during the reporting period. The recognition, 
measurement, classification or disclosure of an 
item or information in the financial statements is 
made relying on these estimates. The estimates 
and judgments used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are continuously evaluated 
by the management and are based on historical 
experience and various other assumptions and 
factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the management believes to be reasonable 
under the existing circumstances. Actual results 
may differ from those estimates. Any revision to 
accounting estimates is recognised prospectively 
in current and future periods.
	
	
Critical accounting judgments and key source 
of estimation uncertainty
 
 
The Company is required to make judgments, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
 
 
(a) Recognition 
and 
measurement 
of 
defined benefit obligations, key actuarial 
assumptions  - refer note 14 below.
 
 
(b) Estimation of current tax expenses and 
payable - refer note 15 below.
 
 
(c) 
Estimation 
of 
Right-of-Use 
and 
Lease 
Liabilities - refer note 20 below.
	
3.	 Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
 
 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at 
acquisition cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
 
 
The cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment 
comprises 
its 
purchase 
price, 
including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates, any directly attributable costs of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use and estimated costs of dismantling 
and removing the item and restoring the item 
and restoring the site on which it is located.
 
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, then 
they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment. 
Subsequent expenditure and subsequent costs 
are included in the assets carrying amount or 
recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate 
only if it is probable that the future economic 
120
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Company and that the cost of the item can be 
reliably measured.
 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined 
by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. 
These are included in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
 
 
Assets that are subject to depreciation and 
amortization are reviewed for impairment, 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate 
that 
carrying 
amount 
may 
not 
be recoverable.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment which are not 
ready for intended use as on the date of Balance 
Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
	
4.	 Intangible assets
 
 
Intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
	
5.	 Depreciation and Amortization:
	
	
(a)	 Property plant and equipment (PPE)
 
 
 
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata 
basis on the straight line method based 
on estimated useful life prescribed under 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.
 
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and method 
of depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment is reviewed at each financial 
year 
end 
and 
adjusted 
prospectively, 
if appropriate.
	
	
(b)	 Intangible assets
 
 
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed as either finite or indefinite. Finite-
life intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of their 
expected useful lives.
 
 
 
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for finite life intangible assets is 
reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. For 
indefinite life intangible assets, the assessment 
of indefinite life is reviewed annually to 
determine whether it continues, if not, it is 
impaired or changed prospectively on the 
basis of revised estimates.
	
6.	 Investment Properties:
 
 
Property that is held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both, and that is 
not occupied by the Company, is classified as 
investment property. Investment property is 
measured at its cost, including related transaction 
costs and where applicable borrowing costs less 
depreciation and impairment if any.
 
 
Depreciation on Investment Property is provided 
using the written down value method based on 
the useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
7.	
Financial Instruments:
	
	
Financial assets - Initial recognition:
 
 
Financial assets are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions 
of 
the 
instruments. 
On 
initial 
recognition, a financial asset is recognised at 
fair value, in case of Financial assets which are 
recognised at fair value through profit and loss 
(FVTPL), its transaction cost are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. In other cases, the 
transaction cost are attributed to the acquisition 
value of the financial asset.
	
	
Subsequent measurement:
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently classified and 
measured at:
 
  
- 
amortised cost
 
  
- 
fair value through profit & loss (FVTPL)
 
  
- 
fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI)
 
 
The above classification is being determined 
considering the:
 
 
(a) 
the entity’s business model for managing the 
financial assets and
 
 
(b) 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
financial asset.
 
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period the 
company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
	
(i)	
Measured at amortised cost:
 
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost if these financial assets 
are held within a business whose objective 
is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual 
terms of the financial asset that give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	 Measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
 
 
 
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI, 
if these financial assets are held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows 
that give rise on specified dates to solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding and by selling

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Interest income measured 
using the Effective Interest Rate method and 
impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On 
derecognition, cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to ‘other income’ in the 
Statement of Profit and  Loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Measured at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL):
 
 
 
Financial 
assets 
other 
than 
equity 
instrument are measured at FVTPL unless it 
is measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI 
on initial recognition. Such financial assets 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
in fair value, including interest income and 
dividend income if any, recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Equity instruments:
 
On initial recognition, the Company can make an 
irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument 
basis) to present the subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income pertaining to 
investments in equity instruments. This election is not 
permitted if the equity investment is held for trading. 
These elected investments are initially measured at 
fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain or loss 
is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss on 
disposal of the investments.
 
Dividends on these investments in equity instruments 
are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the Company’s right to receive the dividends is 
established, it is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the dividend will flow to the entity, the 
dividend does not represent a recovery of part of cost 
of the investment and the amount of dividend can be 
measured reliably. Dividends recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss are included in the ‘Other income’ 
line item.
	
Impairment
 
The Company recognises a loss allowance for 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that 
are measured at amortised cost and at FVTOCI. The 
credit loss is difference between all contractual cash 
flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects 
to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the 
original effective interest rate. This is assessed on 
an individual or collective basis after considering all 
reasonable and supportable including that which is 
forward looking.
 
The Company’s trade receivables or contract revenue 
receivables do not contain significant financing 
component and loss allowance on trade receivables 
is measured at an amount equal to life time expected 
losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, being simplified 
approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance.
 
Under simplified approach, the Company does not 
track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on the lifetime ECL 
at each reporting date right from its initial recognition. 
The Company uses a provision matrix to determine 
impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade 
receivables. The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over the expected 
life of the trade receivable and is adjusted for forward 
looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical 
observed default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, the 
Company recognises 12–months expected credit losses 
for all originated or acquired financial assets if at the 
reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has 
not increased significantly since its initial recognition. 
The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime 
expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset 
increases significantly since its initial recognition. If, in 
a  subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer significant increase 
in credit risks since initial recognition, then the Company 
reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based 
on 12 months ECL. The impairment losses and reversals 
are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. For 
equity instruments and financial assets measured at 
FVTPL, there is no requirement of impairment testing.
	
Derecognition
 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial 
asset expire, or it transfers rights to receive cash flows 
from an asset, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred 
control of the asset, the Company continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the 
Company’s continuing involvement.
 
In that case, the Company also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the Company has retained.
	
Financial Liabilities
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
 
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value net of transaction costs for 
122
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
all financial liabilities not carried at fair value through 
profit or loss.
 
The Company’s financial liabilities includes trade 
and other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts.
	
Subsequent measurement : Financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured 
at using Effective Interest Rate (EIR)  method. Financial 
liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured at fair value with all changes in fair value 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Loans & Borrowings: After initial recognition, interest 
bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using EIR method. Gains 
and losses are recognized in profit & loss when the 
liabilities are derecognized as well as through EIR 
amortization process.
	
Financial Guarantee Contracts : Financial guarantee 
contracts issued by the Company are those contracts 
that requires payment to be made or to be reimbursed 
to the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified 
debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance 
with the term of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair 
value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
	
De-recognition
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
Derivative financial instruments
 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge 
its  foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with 
changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
	
8.	 Fair Value Measurement
 
 
The Company measures financial instruments, 
such as, derivatives, investments at fair value at 
each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
 
 
(a) In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
 
 
(b) In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or 
liability.”
 
 
The 
principal 
or 
the 
most 
advantageous 
market must be accessible by the Company. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured 
using 
the 
assumptions 
that 
market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best interest. 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling 
it to another market participant that would 
use the asset in its highest and best use. The 
Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable 
inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
 
 
(i) 
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market 
prices in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities
 
 
(ii) 
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable.
 
 
(iii) Level 3- Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement is unobservable.
 
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
123
 
 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the 
Company has determined classes of assets and 
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics 
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.”
	
9.	
Inventory
 
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost is computed on First-in-
First-Out (FIFO) basis. Cost of finished goods and 
work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. The net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
	
10.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 
 
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and 
Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand 
deposits with banks and other short-term highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value where 
original maturity is three months or less.
	
11.	 Foreign Currency Transactions:
	
	
a)	
Initial Recognition
 
 
 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions 
settled during the year are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss of the year.
	
	
b)	
Measurement of Foreign Currency Items at 
the Balance Sheet Date
 
 
 
Foreign currency monetary items of the 
Company are restated at the closing 
exchange rates.  Non monetary items are 
recorded at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date of the transaction.  Exchange 
differences arising out of these transactions 
are charged to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
12.	 Revenue Recognition:
 
 
Revenue is measured at the value of the 
consideration 
received 
or 
receivable. 
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of 
returns, trade allowances, rebates, discounts, 
loyalty 
discount, 
value 
added 
taxes 
and 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
The Company recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured, 
it is probable that future economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and specific criteria have 
been met for each of the Company’s activities as 
described below :
	
	
Sale of Goods
 
 
Revenues are recognized at a point in time when 
control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually 
upon either at the time of dispatch or delivery. 
In case of export sale, it is usually recognised 
based on the shipped-on board date as per bill 
of lading.
	
	
Rendering of Services
 
 
Income from services rendered is recognised 
based on agreements /arrangements with the 
customers as the service is performed / rendered.
	
	
Interest
 
 
Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the amount outstanding 
and the interest rate applicable and based on 
Effective interest rate method.
	
	
Dividend
 
 
Dividend Income is recognized when right to 
receive the same is established.
	
13.	 Investment in subsidiaries
 
 
Investments in equity shares of subsidiaries are 
recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment 
at each reporting date. Where an indication 
of impairment exists, the carrying amount of 
the investment is assessed and written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount. On 
disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the 
difference between net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amounts are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
14.	 Employee Benefits:
 
 
The Company has provided following post-
employment plans:
 
 
(a) Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
 
 
(b) Defined 
contribution 
plans 
such 
as 
Provident fund
	
	
a)	
Defined-benefit plan:
 
 
 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period 
less fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligations is calculated annually 
by actuaries through actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method. 
The Company recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation 
as an expense in the statement of profit 
and loss:
124
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
 
 
(a) Service costs comprising current service 
costs, 
past-service 
costs, 
gains 
and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
 
 
(b) Net interest expense or income”
 
 
 
The net interest cost is calculated by 
applying the discount rate to the net balance 
of the defined benefit obligation and fair 
value of plan assets. This cost is included in 
employee benefit expenses in the statement 
of the profit & loss.
 
 
 
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial 
gains and losses arising from
 
 
(a) Re-measurement of Actuarial (gains)/losses
 
 
(b) Return on plan assets, excluding amount 
recognized in effect of asset ceiling
 
 
(c) 
Re-measurement 
arising 
because 
of change in effect of asset ceiling 
are recognised in the period in which they 
occur directly in Other comprehensive 
income. Re-measurement are not reclassified 
to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment 
in relation to various assumptions including 
future pay rises, inflation and discount rates 
and employee and pensioner demographics. 
The Company determines the assumptions 
in conjunction with its actuaries, and 
believes these assumptions to be in line with 
best practice, but the application of different 
assumptions 
could 
have 
a 
significant 
effect on the amounts reflected in the 
income statement, other comprehensive 
income and balance sheet. There may be 
also interdependency between some of 
the assumptions.
	
	
b)	
Defined-contribution plan:
 
 
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident 
fund, 
the 
Company 
pays 
pre-defined 
amounts to separate funds and does not 
have any legal or informal obligation to pay 
additional sums. Defined Contribution plan 
comprise of contributions to the employees’ 
provident 
fund 
with 
the 
government, 
superannuation fund and certain state 
plans like Employees’ State Insurance and 
Employees’ Pension Scheme. The Company’s 
payments to the defined contribution plans 
are recognised as expenses during the 
period in which the employees perform the 
services that the payment covers.
	
15.	 Taxes on Income:
 
 
Income tax comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent 
it relates to items directly recognized in equity or 
in other comprehensive income.
 
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit 
due to temporary differences between accounting 
and tax treatments, and due to items that are 
never taxable or tax deductible. Tax provisions 
are included in current liabilities. Interest and 
penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the 
tax charge. The Company offsets, the current tax 
assets and liabilities (on a year on year basis) 
where it has a legally enforceable right and where 
it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a 
net basis or to realise the assets and liabilities on 
net basis.
 
 
Deferred income tax is recognized using the 
balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary 
differences 
arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount in financial statements. 
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be 
utilized. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
where it is more likely than not that the assets 
will not be realised in the future.
 
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
to be utilized.  Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the asset 
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 
 
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
	
16.	 Borrowing Cost:
 
 
General and specific borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets 
are capitalized as a part of Cost of that assets, 
during the period till all the activities necessary to 
prepare the Qualifying assets for its intended use 
or sale are complete during the period of time that 
is required to complete and prepare the assets 
for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
 
 
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.

17.	 Segment Reporting:
 
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the chief operating decision maker.
	
18.	 Earnings Per Share:
 
 
Basic earnings per shares are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the period. For the purpose 
of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net 
profit or loss for the period attributable to the 
equity shareholders and the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the period 
is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.
	
19.	 Measurement of EBITDA
 
 
The Company has opted to present earnings 
before interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) as a separate line item 
on the face of the Statement of Profit and Loss 
for the period. The Company measures EBITDA 
based on profit/(loss) from continuing operations.
	
20.	 Leases:
	
	
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116-Leases 
using the modified retrospective method. The 
Company has applied the standard to its leases 
with the cumulative impact recognised on the 
date of initial application.
 
 
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for Land, Buildings and Plant 
& Machinery. The Company assesses whether 
a contract is or contains a lease, at inception 
of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease 
if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. To assess whether a 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset, the Company assesses whether:
 
 
(a) the contract involves the use of an 
identified asset
 
 
(b) the Company has substantially all of the 
economic benefits from use of the asset 
through the period of the lease and
 
 
(c) 
the Company has the right to direct the use 
of the asset.
 
 
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short 
term leases) and leases of low value assets. For 
these short term and leases of low value assets, 
the Company recognises the lease payments as 
an operating expense on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease.”
 
 
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the 
lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement  date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs less 
any lease incentives. They are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated from the commencement date 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
 
 
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing 
rates. 
The 
lease 
liability 
is 
subsequently 
remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to 
reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments 
made. A lease liability is remeasured upon the 
occurrence of certain events such as a change 
in the lease term or a change in an index or 
rate used to determine lease payments. The 
remeasurement 
normally 
also 
adjusts 
the 
leased assets.
 
 
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet and 
lease payments have been classified as financing 
cash flows.
	
21.	 Provisions, 
Contingent 
Liabilities 
and 
Contingent Assets:
 
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a 
past event, the company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation.
 
 
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized 
when the expected benefits to be derived by 
the Company from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract.
 
 
A disclosure for contingent liabilities is made 
where there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may probably not require an 
outflow of resources or an obligation for which 
the future outcome cannot be ascertained with 
reasonable certainty. When there is a possible 
or a present obligation where the likelihood of 
outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
 
 
Contingent assets are neither recognized nor 
disclosed in financial statements.

35	 Leases
 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, has notified Ind AS 116 Leases which 
replaces the existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles 
for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces 
a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
 
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases”using modified retrospective approach.  The Company’s lease asset 
classes primarily consist of leases for Land, buildings and Plant & Machinery. These leases were classified as “Operating 
Leases” under Ind AS 17. On transition to Ind AS 116 “Leases””, for these leases, lease liabilities were measured at the 
present value of remaining lease payments, discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1st April, 
2019. Right to Use if measured either at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid 
or accrued lease payments.
 
Due to transition, the nature of expenses in respect of operating leases has changed from ”lease rent” to ”depreciation 
cost” and ‘’finance cost’’ for the right-of-use assets and for interest accrued on lease liability respectively.”
	
The Company has used following practical expedient, when applying Ind AS 116 to leases previously classified 
as operating leases under Ind AS 17.
 
(1) The Company didn’t recognized Right to Use and Lease liabilities for lease for which the lease terms ends within 
12 months on the date of initial transition and low value assets.
 
(2) The Company excluded initial direct cost from measurement of the Right to Use assets at the date of 
initial application.
 
(3) The Company uses hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or 
terminate the lease.
The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities is 9%.
The difference between the lease obligation under Ind AS 17 and the value of the lease liability is primarily on account 
of inclusion of extension and termination options reasonably certain to be exercised in measuring the lease liability in 
accordance with Ind AS 116 and discounting the lease liabilities to the present value under Ind AS 116.
Following are the changes in the carrying value of right of use assets for the year ended 31st March, 2023:

With the objective of presenting the plan assets and plan liabilities of the defined benefits plans  at their fair value 
on the balance sheet, assumptions under Ind AS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:  
 
 
 
As at 
31st March 2023

The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is 
based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity 
to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the 
previous period.

41	 Financial instruments
 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1. 
Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current 
liabilities, short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely due 
to short term maturities of these instruments.
2. 
Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on parameters 
such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this  evaluation, allowances 
are taken to account for expected losses of these receivables. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments is not 
materially different from their carrying amounts. 
 
 
 
 
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

Fair value estimation
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable 
inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
• 
Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments
• 
Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
• 
Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is 
summarised below:

42	 Financial risk factors
 
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, advances and  trade and other 
payables. The  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations and to provide to 
support its operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include loans, trade and other receivables and 
cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
 
The Company’s activities exposes it to Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and Credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised as below.
(a)	 Liquidity risk
 
The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or  another financial asset. Liquidity risk management implies maintenance sufficient 
cash including availability of  funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet the 
obligations as and when due.
 
The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
short term and long term liabilities as and when due. Anticipated future cash flows are expected to be sufficient to 
meet the liquidity requirements of the Company.

(b)	 Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price 
risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk includes investment, 
deposits, foreign currency receivables and payables. The Company’s treasury team manages the Market risk, which 
evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management.

(i)	
Foreign currency risk
 
 
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company has foreign currency loan and trade payables and is 
therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk. The exchange rates have been volatile in the recent years and 
may continue to be volatile in the future. Hence the operating results and financials of the Company may be 
impacted due to volatility of the rupee against foreign currencies.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  According to the Company, interest rate risk exposure is only for floating 
rate borrowings. The Company is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk, since the borrowings of the 
Company are on Fixed interest rate basis.
	
(iii)	 Commodity risk
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil. Volatility in Crude Oil prices, Currency 
fluctuation of Rupee vis-à-vis other prominent currencies coupled with demand–supply scenario in the world 
market affect the effective price and availability. The Company manages this risk by widening its source base, 
appropriate contracts and commitments and well planned procurement.
(c)	 Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Company is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily trade receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, deposits with banks and other financial instruments.
 
Credit risk is managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring 
the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of assets and whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risks on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.

Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To The Members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation 
Limited
Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
We 
have 
audited 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements of Agarwal  Industrial Corporation 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding 
Group”) and its subsidiaries, Bituminex Cochin 
Private Limited, AICL Overseas FZ LLC and Agarwal 
Translink Private Limited (the holding Group and its 
subsidiaries constitute “the Group”), which comprise 
the consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March 
2023, and the consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss (including other comprehensive income), the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year 
then ended and, notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial 
statements”).
2.	
In our opinion and to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state 
of affairs of the Group as at 31st March 2023, and of its 
consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated 
cash flows statement for the year ended on that date.
Basis of Opinion
3.	
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
4.	
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
5.
The Key Audit Matter
How was the matter addressed in 
our audit
Revenue is one of the key 
profit drivers and is therefore 
susceptible to misstatement. 
Cut-off is the key assertion 
insofar as revenue recognition 
is 
concerned, 
since 
an 
inappropriate cut-off can result 
in material misstatement of 
result for the year.
Our 
audit 
procedures 
with 
regard to revenue recognition 
included 
testing 
controls, 
automated 
and 
manual, 
around dispatches / deliveries, 
inventory 
reconciliations 
and 
circularization 
of 
receivable 
balances, substantive testing 
of cut-off and analytical review 
procedure. 
Information other than the financial statements 
and auditors’ report thereon
6.	
The Holding Company’s management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Holding Company’s 
Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated 
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual report is expected to be made available to 
us after the date of this auditor’s report.
7. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
8.	
In connection with our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
9.	
The Holding Company’s management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the matters stated in 
section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a 
true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, 
consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The 
respective management and board of directors of the 
companies included in the group for maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the 
provision of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each 
company and for preventing and detecting the frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were

operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
10. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, 
respective management and Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the group are responsible 
for assessing the ability of each company to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the respective board of 
directors intends to liquidate the company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the group is also responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
11.	 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
12.	 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also :
	
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls.
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal financial 
controls relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, 
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on internal financial controls with reference to 
the consolidated financial statements and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls based 
on our audit.
	
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements made 
by management.
	
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
	
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
 
• 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of such entities 
or business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, 
of which we are the independent auditors. We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of financial information 
of such entities. For the other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
Our responsibilities in this regard are further 
described in the section titled ‘Other Matters’ in 
this audit report.
	
	
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us along with the consideration of audit reports of 
the other auditors referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
13.	 Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually 
or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to 
evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
164
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
14.	 We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
15.	 We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.
16.	 From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that 
a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matter

Cochin Private Limited and AICL Overseas FZ-LLC, 
subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial

included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report 
in terms of sub-sections (3) and (11) of Section 143 of 
the Act, in-so-far as it relates to aforesaid subsidiaries, 
is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
18. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,

Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s 
Report
Referred to as ‘Annexure A’ in paragraph 20(f) of the 
Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the 
members of Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited on 
the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
on 31st March, 2023.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
1. 
We have audited the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting of Agarwal Industrial Corporation 
Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary 
company which are incorporated in India, as on 31st 
March, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the Company for 
the year ended and as on that date.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
2.	
The Respective Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company and its subsidiary company incorporated in 
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the Guidance Note”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility
3.	
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Holding Company’s internal financial controls over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note 
and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
the ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls over 
financial reporting was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
4.	
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting included obtaining 
an understanding of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor 
of the subsidiary company incorporated in India, in 
terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph 9 
of the Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Group’s internal financial controls system over 
financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over 
Financial Reporting
6. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting
7. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud 
may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
8.	
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its 
subsidiary company incorporated in India, have, in 
all material respects, an adequate internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and such 
internal financial controls over financial reporting 
were operating effectively as at 31st March 2023, 
based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company and its subsidiary 
company incorporated in India considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note.
Other Matter
9.	
Our aforesaid report under section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
insofar as it relates to its subsidiary company 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding 
reports of the auditors of such company incorporated 
in India.
10. Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matters.

1	 (B).	
SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES
	
1.	 Basis of Preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements:
 
 
These consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred to as 
the ‘Ind AS’) as notified by Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs pursuant to Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting standards) Rules as amended 
from time to time and other related provisions of 
the Act.
 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the 
Group are prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting and historical cost convention  except 
for the following material items that have been 
measured at fair value as required by the relevant 
Ind AS:
 
 
(i) 
Certain financial assets and liabilities are 
measured at Fair value (refer note 7 below)
 
 
(ii) 
Defined benefit employee plan (refer note 13 
below)
	
	
The accounting policies are applied consistently 
to all the periods presented in the consolidated 
financial statements. All assets and liabilities 
have been classified as current or non current 
as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and 
other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
	
Basis of Consolidatation
 
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise 
the financial statements of the Parent Company 
and its subsidiaries as at 31st March, 2023.
	
	
Subsidiaries
	
	
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group 
has control. Control is achieved when the Group 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee.
174
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
 
 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and 
only if the Group has
	
	
(a)	 Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights 
that give it the current ability to direct the 
relevant activities of the investee)
	
	
(b)	 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee
	
	
(c)	
The ability to use its power over the investee 
to affect its returns
	
	
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when 
the group obtains control over the subsidiary 
and ceases when the Group losses control of 
the subsidiary.
	
	
Consolidatation Procedure
	
	
Subsidiaries
	
	
(a)	 Combine, on line by line basis like items of 
assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows of the Parent with those of 
its subsidiaries.
 
 
(b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of 
the Parent’s investment in each subsidiary 
and the Parent’s portion of equity of 
each subsidiary. Business combinations 
policy explains how to account for any 
related goodwill.
	
	
(c)	
Eliminate in full intra-group assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
Cash flows relating to transactions between 
entities of the group (profits or losses 
resulting from intra-group transactions that 
are recognised in assets, such as inventory 
and property, plant and equipment (PPE), 
are eliminated in full). Intra-group losses 
may indicate an impairment that requires 
recognition in the consolidated financial 
statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies 
to temporary differences that arise from the 
elimination of profits and losses resulting 
from intra-group transactions.
 
 
(d) Profit or loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income are attributed to the 
owners of the Parent Company and to the 
noncontrolling interests. Total comprehensive 
income of subsidiaries is attributed to the 
owners of the Parent Company and to the 
non-controlling interests even if this results 
in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit balance.
	
	
(e)	 Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of the 
Group uses accounting policies other than 
those adopted in the consolidated financial 
statements for like transactions and events 
in 
similar 
circumstances, 
appropriate 
adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s financial statements in preparing 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
to ensure conformity with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
	
	
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in 
existing subsidiaries:
	
	
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in 
subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing 
control over the subsidiaries are accounted for 
as equity transactions. The carrying amounts 
of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any 
difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the 
fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognised  directly in equity and attributed to 
owners of the group.
	
	
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, 
a gain or loss is recognised in consolidated 
statement of profit and loss and is calculated 
as the difference between (i) the aggregate of 
the fair value of the consideration received and 
the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the 
previous carrying amount of the assets (including 
goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any 
noncontrolling interests.
 
 
The 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
presented in INR, the functional currency of 
the Group.
	
2.  	 Use of Estimates and judgments:
 
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements requires the Management to make, 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during the 
reporting period. The recognition, measurement, 
classification or disclosure of an item or information 
in the financial statements is made relying on 
these estimates. The estimates and judgements 
used in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements are continuously evaluated 
by the management and are based on historical 
experience and various other assumptions and 
factors (including expectations of future events) 
that the management believes to be reasonable 
under the existing circumstances. Actual results 
may differ from those estimates. Any revision to 
accounting estimates is recognised prospectively 
in current and future periods.
	
	
Critical accounting judgements and key source 
of estimation uncertainty
	
	
The Group is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying

amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered 
to be relevant. The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
 
 
(a) Recognition and measurement of defined 
benefit obligations, key actuarial assumptions 
- refer note 13 below.
	
	
(b)	 Estimation of current tax expenses and 
payable - refer note 14 below
	
	
(c)	
Estimation 
of 
Right-of-Use 
and 
Lease 
Liabilities - refer note 19 below
	
3.	 Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
	
	
Property, plant and equipment is stated at 
acquisition cost net of accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
	
	
The cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises its purchase price, including 
import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, 
after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any 
directly attributable costs of bringing the asset 
to its working condition for its intended use and 
estimated costs of dismantling and removing the 
item and restoring the item and restoring the site 
on which it is located.
 
 
If significant parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, then 
they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment. 
Subsequent expenditure and subsequent costs 
are included in the assets carrying amount or 
recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate only 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and 
that the cost of the item can be reliably measured.
	
	
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These 
are included in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Assets that are subject to depreciation and 
amortization are reviewed for impairment, 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate 
that 
carrying 
amount 
may 
not 
be recoverable.
	
	
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready 
for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet 
are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
	
4.	 Intangible assets
	
	
Intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
	
5	
Depreciation and Amortization:
	
	
(a)	 Property plant and equipment (PPE)
	
	
	
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on 
the straight line method based on estimated 
useful life prescribed under Schedule II to 
the Companies Act, 2013. The Group, based 
on technical assessment made by technical 
experts, have estimated the useful live of 35 
years of ocean going bulk carriers ship from 
their making year which, managment belives 
is realistic and reflect fair approximation of the 
period over which ships are likely to be used.
	
	
	
The residual values, useful lives and method of 
depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
is reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
	
	
(b)	 Intangible assets
	
	
	
The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed as either finite or indefinite. Finite-
life intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of their 
expected useful lives.
	
	
	
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for finite life intangible assets is 
reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted 
prospectively, 
if 
appropriate. 
For indefinite life intangible assets, the 
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether it continues, if 
not, it is impaired or changed prospectively on 
the basis of revised estimates.”
	
6.  	 Investment Properties:
	
	
Property that is held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not 
occupied by the Group, is classified as investment 
property. Investment property is measured at its 
cost, including related transaction costs and where 
applicable borrowing costs less depreciation and 
impairment if any.
	
	
Depreciation on Investment Property is provided 
using the written down value method based 
on the useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013.
	
7.  	 Financial Instruments:
	
	
Financial assets - Initial recognition:
	
	
Financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments.  On initial recognition, a financial 
asset is recognised at fair value, in case of Financial 
assets which are recognised at fair value through 
profit and loss (FVTPL), its transaction cost are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss. In 
other cases, the transaction cost are attributed to 
the acquisition value of the financial asset.
176
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
	
	
Subsequent measurement:
 
 
Financial assets are subsequently classified and 
measured at:
	
	
- amortised cost
 
 
- fair value through profit & loss (FVTPL)
	
	
- fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI)
 
 
The above classification is being determined 
considering the:
	
	
(a)	 the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and
 
 
(b) the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset.
 
 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, except if and in the period the 
group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
	
(i)	
Measured at amortised cost:
	
	
	
Financial assets are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, if these financial assets 
are held within a business module whose 
objective is to hold these assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset that 
give rise on specified date to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
	
	
(ii)	 Measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI):
	
	
	
Financial assets are measured at FVTOCI, 
if these financial assets are held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved 
by both collecting contractual cash flows 
that give rise on specified dates to solely 
payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding and by selling 
financial assets. Fair value movements 
are recognized in the other comprehensive 
income (OCI). Interest income measured 
using the Effective Interest Rate method and 
impairment losses, if any are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On 
derecognition, cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from the equity to ‘other income’ in the 
Statement of Profit and  Loss.
	
	
(iii)	 Measured at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL):
	
	
	
Financial 
assets 
other 
than 
equity 
instrument are measured at FVTPL unless it 
is measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI 
on initial recognition. Such financial assets 
are measured at fair value with all changes 
in fair value, including interest income and 
dividend income if any, recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Equity instruments:
	
	
On initial recognition, the Group can make an 
irrevocable 
election 
(on 
an 
instrument-by-
instrument basis) to present the subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income pertaining to investments in equity 
instruments. This election is not permitted if 
the equity investment is held for trading. These 
elected investments are initially measured at fair 
value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are measured at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the ‘Reserve for equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative gain or 
loss is not reclassified to Statement of Profit and 
Loss on disposal of the investments.
	
	
Dividends on these investments in equity 
instruments are recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss when the Group’s right to receive the 
dividends is established, it is probable that the 
economic benefits associated with the dividend will 
flow to the entity, the dividend does not represent 
a recovery of part of cost of the investment and 
the amount of dividend can be measured reliably. 
Dividends recognised in Statement of Profit and 
Loss are included in the ‘Other income’ line item.
	
	
Impairment
	
	
The Group recognises a loss allowance for Expected 
Credit Losses (ECL) on financial assets that are 
measured at amortised cost and at FVTOCI. The 
credit loss is difference between all contractual 
cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance 
with the contract and all the cash flows that the 
entity expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
This is assessed on an individual or collective basis 
after considering all reasonable and supportable 
including that which is forward looking.
	
	
The Group’s trade receivables or contract 
revenue receivables do not contain significant 
financing component and loss allowance on trade 
receivables is measured at an amount equal to life 
time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall, 
being simplified approach for recognition of 
impairment loss allowance.
 
 
Under simplified approach, the Group does not 
track changes in credit risk. Rather it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on the lifetime 
ECL at each reporting date right from its initial 
recognition. The Group uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance on the 
portfolio of trade receivables. The provision matrix 
is based on its historically observed default rates 
over the expected life of the trade receivable and 
is adjusted for forward looking estimates. At every 
STATUTORY REPORTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CORPORATE OVERVIEW
177
reporting date, the historical observed default 
rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed.
 
 
For financial assets other than trade receivables, 
the Group recognises 12–months expected credit 
losses for all originated or acquired financial assets 
if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial 
asset has not increased significantly since its 
initial recognition. The expected credit losses are 
measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the 
credit risk on financial asset increases significantly 
since its initial recognition. If, in a  subsequent 
period, credit quality of the instrument improves 
such that there is no longer significant increase in 
credit risks since initial recognition, then the Group 
reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance 
based on 12 months ECL. The impairment losses 
and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss. For equity instruments and financial 
assets measured at FVTPL, there is no requirement 
of impairment testing.
	
	
Derecognition
 
 
The Group derecognises a financial asset when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or it transfers rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset, it evaluates if and 
to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the transferred asset 
to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.
	
	
In that case, the Group also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the 
associated liability are measured on a basis that 
reflects the rights and obligations that the Group 
has retained.
	
	
Financial Liabilities
	
	
Initial Recognition and measurement
	
	
Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments. Financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value net of transaction costs 
for all financial liabilities not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.
 
 
The Group’s financial liabilities includes trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including 
bank overdrafts.
	
	
Subsequent measurement : Financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) 
method. Financial liabilities carried at fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value 
with all changes in fair value recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Loans & Borrowings : After initial recognition, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in 
profit & loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through EIR amortization process.
	
	
Financial Guarantee Contracts : Financial 
guarantee contracts issued by the Group are 
those contracts that require payment to be made 
or to be reimbursed to the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the specified debtor fails to make 
payment when due in accordance with the term of 
a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts 
are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, 
adjusted for transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
	
	
De-recognition
 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss.
	
	
Derivative financial instruments
 
 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to 
hedge its  foreign currency risks. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair 
value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured at 
fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount is reported in the Balance 
Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
	
8.	 Fair Value Measurement
 
 
The Group measures financial instruments, such 
as, derivatives, investments at fair value at each 
balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair 
value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
178
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
	
	
(a)	 In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
	
	
(b)	 In the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset 
or liability.
	
	
The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Group. The fair value 
of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would 
use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
 
 
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using the 
asset in its highest and best use or by selling it 
to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses 
valuation techniques that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximising the use 
of relevant observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities 
for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the 
financial statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
	
	
(i)	
Level 1	
Quoted (unadjusted) market prices 
in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities.
	
	
(ii)	
Level 2 	 Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable.
	
	
(iii)	 Level 3 	 Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement 
is unobservable.
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
	
9.   	Inventory :
	
	
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost is computed on First-in-
First-Out (FIFO) basis. Cost of finished goods and 
work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, 
conversion costs and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. The net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business less the estimated costs of completion 
and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
	
10.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents:
	
	
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash and 
Cheque in hand, bank balances, demand deposits 
with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value where original 
maturity is three months or less.
	
11.	 Foreign Currency Transactions:
	
	
a)	 Initial Recognition
	
	
	
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction. Exchange differences 
arising on foreign exchange transactions 
settled during the year are recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss of the year.
	
	
b)	 Measurement of Foreign Currency 
Items at the Balance Sheet Date
	
	
	
Foreign currency monetary items of the 
Group are restated at the closing exchange 
rates.  Non monetary items are recorded at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction.  Exchange differences arising 
out of these transactions are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.  
	
	
c)	
Translation of Financial Statements of 
foreign entities
	
	
	
On Consolidation, the assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations are translated into Indian 
Rupees at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date and their statements of profit 
and loss are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For 
practical reasons, group uses an average rate 
to translate income and expenses items. The 
exchange difference arising on translation for 
consolidation are recognised in Consolidated 
Statement of OCI.
	
12. 	Revenue Recognition:
	
	
Revenue is measured at the value of the 
consideration received or receivable. Amounts 
disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade 
allowances, rebates, discounts, loyalty discount, 
value added taxes and amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties.
	
	
The Group recognizes revenue, whenever control 
over distinct goods or services is transferred to 
the customer; i.e. when the customer is able to 
direct the use of the transferred goods or services

and obtains substantially all of the remaining 
benefits, provided a contract with enforceable 
rights and obligations exists and amongst others 
collectability of consideration is probable taking 
into account customer ’s creditworthiness. It is 
probable that future economic benefits will flow to 
the Group and specific criteria have been met for 
each of the Group’s activities as described below.
	
	
Sale of Goods
	
	
Revenues are recognized at a point in time when 
control of the goods passes to the buyer, usually 
upon either at the time of dispatch or delivery. In 
case of export sale, it is usually recognised based 
on the shipped-on board date as per bill of lading.
	
	
Rendering of Services
	
	
Income from services rendered is recognised based 
on agreements /arrangements with the customers 
as the service is performed / rendered.
	
	
Interest
	
	
Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis 
taking into account the amount outstanding and 
the interest rate applicable and based on Effective 
interest rate method.
	
	
Dividend
	
	
Dividend Income is recognized when right to 
receive the same is established.
	
13. 	Employee Benefits:
	
	
The 
Group 
has 
provides 
following 
post-
employment plans:
 
 
(a) Defined benefit plans such a gratuity and
 
 
(b) Defined 
contribution 
plans 
such 
as 
Provident fund
	
	
a)	
Defined-benefit plan:
	
	
	
The liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity 
plan is the present value of defined benefit 
obligations at the end of the reporting period 
less fair value of plan assets. The defined 
benefit obligations is calculated annually 
by actuaries through actuarial valuation 
using the projected unit credit method. 
The Group recognises the following changes 
in the net defined benefit obligation as an 
expense in the statement of profit and loss:
	
	
(a)	 Service costs comprising current service 
costs, 
past-service 
costs, 
gains 
and 
losses on curtailment and non-routine 
settlements; and
	
	
(b)	 Net interest expense or income
	
	
	
The net interest cost is calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net balance of the 
defined benefit obligation and fair value of 
plan assets. This cost is included in employee 
benefit expenses in the statement of the profit 
& loss.
	
	
Re-measurement comprising of actuarial gains 
and losses arising from
	
	
(a)	 Re-measurement of Actuarial (gains)/losses
	
	
(b)	 Return on plan assets, excluding amount 
recognized in effect of asset ceiling
	
	
(c)	
Re-measurement arising because of change 
in effect of asset ceiling
	
	
	
are recognised in the period in which they 
occur directly in Other comprehensive income. 
Re-measurement are not reclassified to profit 
or loss in subsequent periods.
	
	
	
Ind AS 19 requires the exercise of judgment 
in relation to various assumptions including 
future pay rises, inflation and discount rates 
and employee and pensioner demographics. 
The Group determines the assumptions in 
conjunction with its actuaries, and believes 
these assumptions to be in line with best 
practice, but the application of different 
assumptions could have a significant effect on 
the amounts reflected in the income statement, 
other comprehensive income and balance 
sheet. There may be also interdependency 
between some of the assumptions.
	
	
b)	
Defined-contribution plan:
 
 
 
Under defined contribution plans, provident 
fund, the Group pays pre-defined amounts 
to separate funds and does not have any 
legal or informal obligation to pay additional 
sums. Defined Contribution plan comprise 
of contributions to the employees’ provident 
fund with the government, superannuation 
fund and certain state plans like Employees’ 
State Insurance and Employees’ Pension 
Scheme. The Group’s payments to the defined 
contribution plans are recognised as expenses 
during the period in which the employees 
perform the services that the payment covers.
	
14 .	Taxes on Income:
	
	
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss except to the extent it relates 
to items directly recognized in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
 
 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit is different from accounting profit 
due to temporary differences between accounting 
and tax treatments, and due to items that are 
never taxable or tax deductible. Tax provisions are 
included in current liabilities. Interest and penalties 
on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge. 
The Group offsets, the current tax assets and 
180
Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
liabilities (on a year on year basis) where it has a 
legally enforceable right and where it intends to 
settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis or to 
realise the assets and liabilities on net basis.
	
	
Deferred income tax is recognized using the 
balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible 
and 
taxable 
temporary 
differences 
arising 
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amount in financial statements. 
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. 
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it 
is more likely than not that the assets will not be 
realised in the future.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets 
is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be 
utilized.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the asset is realized or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date.
	
	
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly 
in equity.
	
15. 	Borrowing Cost:
 
 
General and specific borrowing costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets are capitalized 
as a part of Cost of that assets, during the period 
till all the activities necessary to prepare the 
Qualifying assets for its intended use or sale are 
complete during the period of time that is required 
to complete and prepare the assets for its intended 
use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use or sale.
	
	
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
	
16. 	Segment Reporting:
	
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision maker of the 
Parent Company.
	
17.	 Earnings Per Share:
	
	
Basic earnings per shares are calculated by 
dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the period 
attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the period. For the purpose of calculating 
diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for 
the period attributable to the equity shareholders 
and the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the period is adjusted for the 
effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
	
18.	 Measurement of EBITDA
	
	
The Group has opted to present earnings before 
interest (finance cost), tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) as a separate line item on 
the face of the Statement of Profit and Loss for the 
period. The Group measures EBITDA based on 
profit/(loss) from continuing operations.
	
19.	 Leases:
	
	
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116-Leases using 
the modified retrospective method. The Group 
has applied the standard to its leases with the 
cumulative impact recognised on the date of 
initial application.
	
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily 
consist of leases for Land, Buildings and Plant 
& Machinery. The Group assesses whether a 
contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a 
contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. To assess whether a contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset, the Group assesses whether:
	
	
(a)	 the contract involves the use of an 
identified asset.
	
	
(b)	 the Group has substantially all of the economic 
benefits from use of the asset through the 
period of the lease and
	
	
(c)	
the Group has the right to direct the use of 
the asset.
	
	
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, 
the Group recognises a right-of-use asset 
(“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for 
all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, 
except for leases with a term of twelve months 
or less (short term leases) and leases of low 
value assets. For these short term and leases 
of low value assets, the Group recognises the 
lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
	
	
	
The 
right-of-use 
assets 
are 
initially 
recognised at cost, which comprises the 
initial amount of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or prior 
to the commencement  date of the lease 
plus any initial direct costs less any lease 
incentives. They are subsequently measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated from the commencement

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
181
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
	
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using 
the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates. The lease liability is 
subsequently remeasured by increasing the 
carrying amount to reflect interest on the 
lease liability, reducing the carrying amount 
to reflect the lease payments made. A lease 
liability is remeasured upon the occurrence 
of certain events such as a change in the 
lease term or a change in an index or rate 
used to determine lease payments. The 
remeasurement normally also adjusts the 
leased assets.
	
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been 
separately presented in the Balance Sheet 
and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
	
20.	 Provisions, 
Contingent 
Liabilities 
and 
Contingent Assets:
	
	
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past 
event, the group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
for onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group 
from a contract are lower than the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the future obligations under the 
contract. A disclosure for contingent liabilities is 
made where there is a possible obligation or a 
present obligation that may probably not require 
an outflow of resources or an obligation for which 
the future outcome cannot be ascertained with 
reasonable certainty. When there is a possible or a 
present obligation where the likelihood of outflow 
of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure 
is made.
	
	
Contingent assets are neither recognized nor 
disclosed in financial statements.

35	 Leases
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019 and 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Second Amendment Rules, has notified Ind AS 116 Leases which replaces the 
existing lease standard, Ind AS 17 Leases and other interpretations. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces a single, on-balance 
sheet lease accounting model for lessees.
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 “”Leases”” using modified retrospective approach.  The group’s lease asset classes 
primarily consist of leases for Land, buildings and Plant & Machinery. These leases were classified as “Operating 
Leases” under Ind AS 17. On transition to Ind AS 116 “Leases””, for these leases, lease liabilities were measured at the 
present value of remaining lease payments, discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as at April 01, 
2019. Right to Use if measured either at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid 
or accrued lease payments.
Due to transition, the nature of expenses in respect of operating leases has changed from “lease rent” to “depreciation 
cost”and ‘’finance cost’’ for the right-of-use assets and for interest accrued on lease liability respectively.”

Annual Report 2022-23
Agarwal Industrial Corporation Limited
The Group has used following practical expedient, when applying Ind AS 116 to leases previously classified as 
operating leases under Ind AS 17.
(1)	 The Group didn’t recognize Right to Use and Lease liabilities for lease for which the lease terms ends within 12 
months on the date of initial transition and low value assets.
(2)	 The Group excluded initial direct cost from measurement of the Right to Use assets at the date of initial application.
(3)	 The Group uses hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate 
the lease.
	
The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities is 9%.
 
The difference between the lease obligation under Ind AS 17 and the value of the lease liability is primarily on 
account of inclusion of extension and termination options reasonably certain to be exercised in measuring the lease 
liability in accordance with Ind AS 116 and discounting the lease liabilities to the present value under Ind AS 116.

D.	 Assumptions
With the objective of presenting the plan assets and plan liabilities of the defined benefits plans  at their fair value on the 
balance sheet, assumptions under Ind AS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date.
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
  ` in Lakhs 
As at 
31st March 2023
As at 
31st March 2022
Financial Assumptions
Discount rate
7.34 to 7.38 %
7.11 to 7.19 %
Salary Escalation Rate
5.00%
5.00%
E.	 Sensitivity
The sensitivity of the overall plan liabilities to changes in the weighted key assumptions are:
  ` in Lakhs 
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in 
assumption
Increase in 
assumption
Decrease in 
assumption
Discount rate
1.00%
 69.81 
 87.77 
Salary Escalation Rate
1.00%
 87.55 
 69.82 
The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of the actual change. It is 
based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating the sensitivity 
to the assumption, the same method used to calculate the liability recognised in the balance sheet has been applied. 
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the 
previous period.

41	 Financial instruments
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged 
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
1.	
Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current 
liabilities, short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely 
due to short term maturities of these instruments.
2. 
Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Group based on parameters 
such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this  evaluation, allowances 
are taken to account for expected losses of these receivables. Accordingly, fair value of such instruments is not 
materially different from their carrying amounts.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by 
valuation technique:
Level 1: 	 quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.
The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments by category are as follows:

Fair value estimation
For financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, a three level fair value hierarchy is used that reflects 
the significance of inputs used in the measurements. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 
measurements).
The categories used are as follows:
•	
Level 1:	 quoted prices for identical instruments
•	
Level 2:	 directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and
•	
Level 3:	 inputs which are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value, the classification of fair value calculations by category is 
summarised below:

classifications of financial assets and financial liabilities during the year.
42	 Financial risk factors
 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, advances and  trade and other payables. 
The  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide to support its operations. 
The Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that 
derive directly from its operations.
	
The Group’s activities exposes it to Liquidity Risk, Market Risk and Credit risk. The Board of Directors reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised as below.
(a)	 Liquidity risk
 
The risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled 
by delivering cash or  another financial asset. Liquidity risk management implies maintenance sufficient cash including 
availability of  funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet the obligations as and 
when due.
 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring as far as possible that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
short term and long term liabilities as and when due. Anticipated future cash flows are expected to be sufficient to 
meet the liquidity requirements of the Group.

(b)	 Market risk
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk,  currency risk and other price risk, such 
as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk includes investment, deposits, 
foreign currency receivables and payables. The Group’s treasury team manages the Market risk, which evaluates and 
exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management.
	
(i)	
Foreign currency risk
 
 
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group has foreign currency borrowing and trade payables and is therefore 
exposed to foreign exchange risk. The exchange rates have been volatile in the recent years and may continue to 
be volatile in the future. Hence the operating results and financials of the Group may be impacted due to volatility 
of the rupee against foreign currencies.

(ii)	 Interest rate risk
 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.  According to the Group, interest rate risk exposure is only for 
floating rate borrowings. The Group is not significantly exposed to the interest rate risk, since the borrowings 
of the Group are on Fixed interest rate basis.
	
(iii)	 Commodity risk
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil. Volatility in Crude Oil prices, Currency 
fluctuation of Rupee vis-à-vis other prominent currencies coupled with demand–supply scenario in the world

market affect the effective price and availability. The Group manages this risk by widening its source base, 
appropriate contracts and commitments and well planned procurement.
(c)	 Credit risk
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. 
The Group is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities, primarily trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
deposits with banks and other financial instruments.
	
Credit risk is managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the 
credit worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

increase in credit risks on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.
To assess whether there is a significant change increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risks of default occurring on 
the assets as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of  initial recognition. It considers the reasonable 
and supportive forward looking information such as:
(i) 
Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business.
(ii) 
Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty.
(iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet 
its obligations.
