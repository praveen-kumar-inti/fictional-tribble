2. a.	Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) – 
	
At NCC Limited, all input materials are procured strictly in accordance with the terms and specifications outlined in client 
contracts. In most cases, the client specifies the brand or company from which the input materials must be sourced, thereby 
guiding the procurement process.
	
Nevertheless, as part of its standard procurement practices, NCC Limited consistently sources key construction materials such 
as steel and cement from reputed manufacturers who are known for their strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
performance. These suppliers typically adhere to high sustainability standards in their operations. As a result, a significant portion 
of the input materials used across NCC’s projects are sustainably sourced, reflecting the company’s commitment to responsible 
sourcing within the contractual framework.
    b.	If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably. Major key inputs were sourced sustainably. This includes materials 
such as steel, cement and other building material.

NCC Ltd., being a leading infrastructure and construction company, does not manufacture discrete products in the 
conventional sense. However, the company recognises the importance of assessing environmental impacts across the lifecycle 
of its infrastructure projects. While formal LCA studies as per ISO 14040/44 standards may not have been conducted across 
all project categories, NCC integrates lifecycle considerations in its project design, material selection, and execution phases, 
especially for large-scale public infrastructure works.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products / 
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same 
along-with action taken to mitigate the same.

Description of the risk / concern
Action Taken
NCC Ltd., being an EPC and infrastructure execution company, is primarily engaged in the construction of public assets such 
as buildings, roads, water supply networks, and urban infrastructure. While the company does not independently conduct 
full-scale Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) for its services, several of its clients—especially public sector agencies and smart city 
missions—incorporate LCA principles or sustainability criteria in their project planning and tendering processes.
Accordingly, NCC aligns its construction practices to meet the environmental and social requirements embedded in client 
specifications and project mandates. Additionally, the company conducts Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) 
wherever statutorily or contractually required and integrates mitigation measures throughout the project lifecycle.

NCC Ltd. does not directly use recycled or reused input materials in its core construction and infrastructure activities in a 
measurable manner that can be quantified as a percentage of total material consumption. However, it is important to note 
that many of the primary inputs procured—such as steel—often contain a significant proportion of recycled content at the 
manufacturer’s end. These embedded recycling practices, though not under NCC’s direct control or calculation, contribute 
indirectly to material circularity and sustainability within the supply chain. NCC continues to engage with responsible suppliers 
and encourages sustainable sourcing practices wherever feasible.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
At the outset of the construction project sites, a comprehensive and site-specific Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) plans are 
developed in line with the corporate HSE manual, setting the foundation for safety and compliance across all activities. Medical 
screenings have been conducted for all workers to ensure fitness for duty, particularly for those involved in high-risk tasks. Each 
employee has undergone HSE orientation, where they are briefed on project-specific hazards, emergency procedures, and their 
roles in maintaining a safe working environment. Regular risk assessments are carried out to proactively identify hazards such 
as falling objects, slips and trips, fall from height, mechanical and electrical risks, and chemical exposure. Preventive control 
measures have been put in place accordingly. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided and enforced across the site, 
including helmets, gloves, safety shoes, reflective vests, eye protection, and harnesses for height work, with job-specific PPE 
issued as necessary. Excavation activities are carried out with proper shoring, benching, and access ladders, while trenches 
are barricaded and illuminated to prevent accidents. Work at height is controlled through the use of fully certified scaffolding, 
guardrails, safety nets, and personal fall arrest systems, and only trained workers are allowed to carry out such tasks.
	
All mechanical equipment and tools undergo scheduled maintenance and pre-use inspections, while machine guarding, safe limit 
switches, warning devices and lockout-tagout procedures are strictly followed to prevent accidental startups. Electrical safety 
is maintained through well-organized cable management, the use of IP-rated panels, earth leakage protection devices, proper 
grounding, and routine checks by certified electricians. Vehicles operating on-site follow a designated traffic management plan 
that includes marked pedestrian pathways, traffic signage, and the use of trained flagmen to coordinate vehicle movement. 
Chemical handling is managed through proper labelling, secure storage, availability of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and 
worker training in spill response and PPE usage. Fire safety measures are in place, including strategically located extinguishers, 
hot work permits, fire watch personnel, and emergency evacuation plans. Occupational health is prioritized with ergonomic 
practices, safe manual handling techniques, availability of rest areas, and regular health check-ups, while psychological wellbeing 
is addressed through adequate rest periods and stress management awareness.
	
Environmental protection is actively pursued through dust suppression, noise control measures, waste segregation and disposal, 
and spill containment systems. All workers receive ongoing training, including toolbox talks, job-specific briefings, and emergency 
drills, to reinforce safety knowledge. Weekly inspections and HSE audits are conducted to identify gaps and ensure continuous 
improvement, while non-compliance is addressed promptly with corrective action plans. Full compliance with national regulations 
and international standards such as ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 is ensured, and all records are documented. The safety culture on-
site encourages open communication, with workers empowered to report unsafe acts or conditions without fear of retaliation. 
These are not limited but common practice measures. Through these integrated HSE measures, the project maintains a safe, 
healthy, and environmentally responsible construction environment.
