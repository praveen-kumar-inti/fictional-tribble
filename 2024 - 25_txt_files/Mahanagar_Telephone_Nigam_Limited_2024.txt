In connection with fine levied by NSE and BSE for non-appointment of Independent 
Directors, as stated in the previous question, since the power to appoint Directors on 
the Board of the Company vests with the Government of India, acting through the 
Administrative Ministry i.e., Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of 
Communication,  Government of India, therefore the Company has been requesting the 
appointing authority, i.e., DoT, for appointment of requisite number of Independent 
Directors. The Company has no control in the appointment of Directors. In view of the 
same, the Company has requested the stock exchanges to waive off the said fines.
