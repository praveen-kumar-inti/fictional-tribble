Health risks 
associated 
with the 
workplace 
affecting 
employees
R
Workplace health risks 
can contribute to higher 
employee absenteeism, 
reduced productivity, 
and decreased morale. 
Collecting samples 
from patients with 
infectious diseases poses 
a considerable health 
risk. If these risks are not 
effectively managed, it may 
result in regulatory non-
compliance, attracting fines 
and penalties. Collectively, 
these factors can have a 
substantial impact on the 
company’s profitability and 
long-term sustainability.
The Company has put 
in place measures to 
ensure the well-being of 
its employees. Regular 
vaccinations are carried 
out in accordance with 
prescribed guidelines. 
Employees are provided 
with medical insurance 
to mitigate health and 
financial risks. In cases 
where staff members lose 
their lives while treating 
patients, financial support is 
extended to their families. 
Additionally, the company 
rotates personnel engaged 
in sample collection to 
minimize exposure risks.
Negative Implications

Workplace 
Protection
R&O
Risk: Inadequate 
implementation of safety 
protocols can cause 
workplace accidents, 
leading to adverse 
outcomes such as increased 
absenteeism and a higher 
Lost Time Rate (LTR).
Opportunity: Strong 
workplace safety measures 
can enhance employee 
health, safety, and well-
being, driving higher 
productivity, improved job 
satisfaction, and reduced 
employee turnover.
A detailed safety manual is 
in place, outlining guidelines 
applicable to all company 
laboratories. Regular health 
check-ups are conducted, 
particularly for technical 
staff, to proactively monitor 
their well-being. Employees 
are equipped with essential 
safety gear such as eye 
wash stations, gloves, 
lab coats, goggles, fire 
sprinklers, TLD badges, and 
fire extinguishers. Periodic 
fire drills are organized 
to familiarize staff with 
evacuation procedures and 
their responsibilities during 
emergencies. The company 
adheres to Biomedical Waste 
Management (BMW) rules 
as per the Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB) 
guidelines. Additionally, 
strict disinfection protocols 
are followed across all 
centers to maintain a 
clean and hygienic work 
environment.

Risk 
Management
R&O
Risk: Ineffective risk 
management can expose 
the company to multiple 
threats, causing substantial 
financial losses, operational 
setbacks, and reputational 
harm. It may also result 
in missed opportunities 
due to excessive caution 
or unforeseen crises 
stemming from ignored 
risks. Furthermore, poor 
risk oversight can lead to 
regulatory non-compliance, 
attracting penalties and 
legal complications.
Opportunity: Strong risk 
management enables 
informed decision-making, 
greater operational 
efficiency, and a stronger 
capacity to seize growth 
opportunities. It helps 
the company identify and 
mitigate potential threats 
proactively, minimizing the 
likelihood and severity of 
negative outcomes.
The company works closely 
with key stakeholders in the 
risk management process 
to keep all relevant parties 
informed of potential risks 
and engaged in developing 
strategies to address 
them. This collaborative 
approach fosters a culture 
of risk awareness and 
accountability, leading 
to more effective and 
successful risk management 
outcomes.
Positive Implications

Waste 
Management
R
Ineffective waste 
management can lead to 
environmental pollution, 
potentially resulting in 
regulatory fines, legal 
liabilities, and reputational 
damage for examples 
production of biomedical 
waste as a result of the 
business activities.
Disposal is carried out by 
a government-authorized 
partner, with waste sorted 
into different color-coded 
bags that have barcodes. 
The waste is weighed before 
being transferred to an 
authorized vendor. All safety 
regulations are adhered to 
from the point of generation 
until it is handed over to the 
authority.
