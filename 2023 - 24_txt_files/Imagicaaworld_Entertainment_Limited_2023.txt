1.
Customer 
experience 
and 
satisfaction 
Risk
Customer 
satisfaction 
is 
crucial for a theme park and 
hotel, as it fundamentally 
shapes 
the 
Company’s 
reputation 
and 
presents 
a 
significant 
opportunity. 
A 
negative 
customer 
experience 
can 
threaten 
business continuity, whereas 
a positive one can boost 
profits and enhance brand 
reputation. Additionally, a 
positive guest experience 
encourages repeat visits and 
generates strong word-of-
mouth 
recommendations, 
which 
are 
powerful 
for 
attracting 
more 
guests 
and 
lowering 
marketing 
expenses.
Imagicaa prioritizes customer satisfaction from the ticket 
booking stage onwards. To ensure a high standard of guest 
experience, the Company implements the following practices:
¡	
Trained call center staff to assist and encourage park visits.
¡	
One-on-one Guest Relations Executive (GRE) team at the 
park entrance.
¡	
Security team for guest and baggage screening.
¡	
Easy Ticket (Virtual Ticket) system for smooth entry and 
reduced crowding.
¡	
Welcome performance at the entrance for a grand entry 
experience.
¡	
Help desk counters at key locations for guest queries.
¡	
Lucky draws with gifts or prizes to enhance guest 
excitement.
¡	
Collecting feedback through surveys, forms, social 
media, and reviews to understand guest experiences 
comprehensively.
¡	
Focusing on creating a journey that makes guests feel 
happy, satisfied, and valued, ensuring repeat visits.
¡	
Implementing an emergency preparedness plan for 
handling emergencies.
¡	
Safety evacuation layout boards/signage and designated 
emergency assembly points.
¡	
Conducting Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA) for all risk activities and implementing safety 
controls.
¡	
A central safety committee, established in 2014, to 
address and mitigate identified hazards.
¡	
Annual audits and certification of HSE practices by BIS as 
per ISO 45001:2018 standards.

Product 
Quality and 
Safety 
Risk 
Ensuring 
the 
safety 
of 
theme park rides demands 
significant effort, including 
maintenance, safety checks, 
repairs, and other on-site 
tasks. Proper precautions 
are essential to maintain 
health and safety, preventing 
mishaps, 
falls, 
fatalities, 
and 
injuries. 
Temporary 
employees, in particular, may 
be at risk due to insufficient 
training 
or 
experience. 
Failure to protect health 
and safety can lead to fines 
and penalties, with major 
incidents potentially causing 
severe injuries and legal or 
regulatory liabilities.
Imagicaa is deeply committed to safety, implementing 
a comprehensive regimen and achieving notable 
milestones:
¡	
Conducting daily safety checks on rides and 
attractions.
¡

¡	
Deploying attendants and fire marshals equipped 
with two-way radios throughout the park.
¡	
Successfully implementing and closing the Permit to 
Work (PTW) system.
¡	
Procuring high-quality materials and equipment for 
rides and attractions without negligence.
¡	
Strictly adhering to the inward vendor policy and 
event policy with disclaimers.
¡	
Conducting annual and quarterly health checkups for 
staff to ensure optimal performance.
¡	
Maintaining cleanliness and hygiene across the park 
through effective housekeeping.
¡	
Engaging in horticulture to maintain adequate plant 
numbers, cool temperatures, and natural beauty in 
the park.
¡	
Integrating 
100% 
IMS 
standards, 
including 
Environment Management and Safety Management 
Systems, throughout the theme and water park 
facilities.
¡	
Conducting periodic training to foster a strong safety 
culture.
¡	
Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to all 
employees exposed to residual risks.
¡

systems.

lightning hazards.

attractions.
¡	
Ensuring CCTV surveillance throughout the park.
¡	
Utilizing a public address system for emergency 
warnings.
¡	
Operating a fully equipped first aid medical facility 
with professional doctors and nurses.

Energy 
Management
Risk
The 
hospitality 
and 
entertainment 
parks 
industry, particularly theme 
parks, is generally energy-
intensive due to the need 
for operating rides, lighting, 
fireworks, and other facilities. 
A firm’s decisions about 
the energy intensity of its 
operations and the sources 
of its energy can change over 
time, affecting its operational 
efficiency and risk profile.
¡	
Imagicaa has implemented in-house green initiatives 
to optimize the operations of rides and attractions, 
thereby reducing energy consumption. 
¡	
Currently, the company has an open access power 
arrangement for 8 MW of renewable energy (solar 
and wind), fulfilling over 60% of its power needs.
¡	
Additionally, Imagicaa is setting up an 8 MW captive 
solar project, expected to be completed by Q2FY25.
¡	
The company has also installed EV charging stations 
for electric vehicles and motion control lights as part 
of its energy management efforts.
Negative
4
Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste is commonly produced 
through 
a 
company’s 
operations, 
machinery 
maintenance, office work, 
and food disposal. Improper 
waste handling can lead 
to air pollution, climate 
change, and various direct 
and indirect environmental 
impacts. It also poses health 
and safety risks to personnel 
exposed to the waste. Non-
compliance 
with 
waste 
management regulations can 
result in substantial fines.
¡	
With the climate changing rapidly, proactive 
environmental measures are essential. This includes 
effective solid waste management, limiting water 
usage, and recycling whenever possible.
¡	
Waste is segregated at the source using color-coded 
biodegradable garbage bags/bins into dry, wet, and 
horticulture waste.
¡	
Highly visible waste bins are placed throughout the 
park in easily accessible locations to encourage use.
¡	
Waste is collected and transported to the designated 
waste segregation yard.
¡	
Wet waste is processed in the Organic Waste 
Converter (OWC) to produce organic manure.
¡	
Disposal methods such as open dumping, animal 
feeding, and landfilling are avoided.

Innovation
Opportunity
The entertainment industry 
can foster innovation among 
diverse 
talents. 
Product 
design 
and 
innovation 
help theme parks remain 
competitive and relevant in 
a constantly evolving market. 
By adopting new designs 
and 
technologies, 
theme 
parks can seize new market 
opportunities and enhance 
the customer experience.
The management and promoters regularly attend trade fairs 
and industry gatherings to connect with manufacturers, 
innovators, and technology providers. 
Additionally, they hold periodic ‘think tank’ sessions with 
senior team members and heads of departments (HODs) to 
brainstorm ideas and concepts for implementation across all 
sites.
Positive
6
Employee 
well-being, 
training and 
retention
Risk
High 
employee 
retention 
rates reflect strong company 
policies and practices, while 
high attrition rates signal 
low employee satisfaction 
to investors. Focusing on 
employee 
well-being 
can 
improve morale and reduce 
the costs associated with 
hiring and onboarding.
Imagicaa highly values its employees and puts significant 
effort into developing policies that benefit them.
¡	
The Company offers group mediclaim policies to all 
employees.
¡	
It conducts skill development training programs for 
employees.
¡	
Long-term service of employees is acknowledged and 
rewarded.
¡	
Flexible working hours and work-from-home options 
are provided based on employee profiles.
¡	
A transfer program is available for employees wishing 
to change their profiles.
