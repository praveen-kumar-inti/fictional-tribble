Management System to identify and control all the hazards existing in routine and non-routine activities across all 
the sites. We follow a five-step approach (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting), which 
also acts as a key driver for controlling the risk of EHS in business. Prior to commencing any work activity, Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessments, SOPs, Work Methodologies, etc. are developed and pre-approved by all the 
relevant stakeholders, including management staff and workers. We adhere to a hierarchical approach for mitigating 
risks, with a strong emphasis on engineering control measures. All identified risks and risk mitigation plans are 
documented, approved, and communicated to all relevant authorities and parties as and when required.
	
	
Our operational safety is overseen by a safety committee, which is chaired by the project head and representatives 
of different business functions. This committee ensures equal representation from management and workers. During 
the monthly safety committee meeting, updates and briefings related to safety aspects are discussed, and specific 
concerns are addressed. The safety committee reviews future action plans related to the project or work location, 
ensures a comprehensive risk assessment is conducted, and communicates adequate corrective measures until they 
are implemented.

values and principles into key processes and decisions.
The Company has established procedures to effectively engage with relevant stakeholders on human rights, ensuring a safe, 
healthy and productive workplace in consultation with employees. IRB places significant emphasis on human rights through 
its Human Rights policy, which outlines a clear strategy to uphold all employees’ rights.
The policy reinforces a commitment to comply with applicable laws and uphold the United Nations Global Compact’s principles 
on human rights and labor. Key features include safeguarding employee rights, fostering an inclusive workplace that values 
diversity, and prohibiting child labor and forced labor. The policy also addresses working conditions, compensation and benefits, 
workplace health and safety, freedom of association, and the right to collective bargaining.

INDEPENDENT 
PRACTITIONER’S 
ASSURANCE 
REPORT 
ON 
IDENTIFIED 
SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION OF IRB INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPERS LIMITED 
 
To the Board of Directors of IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited 
 
We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance engagement, for IRB 
Infrastructure Developers Limited (the “Company”) vide our engagement letter dated 
26th May 2025, in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I 
(the “Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance with the Criteria stated in 
section. This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance 
practitioners, environmental engineers, and specialists. 
 
Identified Sustainability Information  
 
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the Identified Sustainability Information 
listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting boundary of the Reports is disclosed 
in the ‘Section-A: General Disclosures Para 13’ in the Company’s Sustainability Report 
2024-25. 
 
Our assurance engagement was with respect to the financial year 1st April 2024 – 31st 
March 2025, information and we have not performed any procedures with respect to 
earlier periods included in the reports, and, therefore, do not express any conclusion 
thereon. 
 
Criteria 
 
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is 
listed below: 
 
√ Criteria 1: BRSR Core Indicators, as outlined under the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework issued by (Securities and 
Exchange Board of India) SEBI and aligned with the principles of the National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). 
√ Criteria 2: ISAE 3000 (Revised) issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). It is designed to assess the materiality, 
responsiveness and inclusivity and reliability of the specified information with 
regards to the identified sustainability indicators. 
Management’s Responsibility  
 
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria 
for preparing the Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the 
Reports, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to reporting  
 
 
 
IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd.
35
 
 
on Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability.  
 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the 
Reports and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
Inherent limitations 
 
Non-financial information, such as sustainability performance indicators, is inherently 
limited due to the nature of the subject matter and the methods used for determining, 
calculating, or estimating such data. These limitations include the subjective nature of 
certain qualitative information, the possibility of human error in data collection and 
reporting, reliance on assumptions, estimates, or projections for certain indicators, and 
the inclusion of data from third-party sources or processes not under the direct control 
of the Company, which may be unaudited. Additionally, greenhouse gas accounting 
involves uncertainties arising from the scientific methods used to determine emission 
factors and the variability in values for combining different gas emissions. Consequently, 
our assurance report should be interpreted with these limitations in mind. 
 
Our Independence and Quality Control 
   
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of 
Ethics for VVB (Validation & Verification body), which is founded on fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality 
and professional behaviour. The management and staff of Carbon Check (India) Private 
Limited are committed to excellence in the provision of impartial and competent 
assurance services covering the relevant requirements. Our overall commitment to the 
success of the business and its service rests on two main pillars, being impartiality and 
competence, whilst also supported by openness, responsiveness, and clearly defined 
responsibilities. The firm follows established quality control standards and maintains a 
comprehensive system to ensure compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This includes documented 
policies and procedures for maintaining high-quality assurance and related services. 
 
Our Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to provide a conclusion, with reasonable assurance, on the Identified 
Sustainability Information outlined in Appendix I. This conclusion is based on the 
procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained. 
 
Our engagement followed the principles of the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability 
Information.” 
 
 
IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd.
36
 
 
This standard guides us to plan and carry out our engagement to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and 
evaluating the overall presentation of the selected Identified Sustainability Information. 
 
In line with the requirements of a reasonable assurance engagement under this standard, 
we applied professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout 
the engagement. 
 
Level of Assurance 
 
The engagement was performed to provide reasonable assurance over the indicators 
presented in Appendix I of this report. This involved applying assurance procedures to 
obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to evaluate whether the subject matter is 
fairly stated and free from material misstatement, in all material respects. The 
engagement was conducted in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised), which sets out the 
framework for assurance over non-financial information. A reasonable assurance 
engagement provides a high level of confidence, though not absolute, that the information 
subject to assurance is reliable and accurately presented. 
 
Summary of Work Performed 
 
The procedures we performed, based on our professional judgment, included inquiries, 
observations of processes, onsite inspections, review of documents, assessment of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures, and reconciliation 
with underlying records. Additionally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the 
applicable criteria for the subject matter, interviewed key personnel responsible for 
preparing the sustainability performance indicators, assessed the design and 
implementation of controls related to data collation and reporting, inspected relevant 
documents and evidence to verify the reported sustainability performance indicators, 
performed analytical procedures and substantive testing on a sample basis, and 
conducted site visits at one constructed unit and Head Office. 
 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed 
above, we:  
 
√ Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and 
related disclosures; 
√ Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the 
evaluation and/or measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information; 
√ Inquiries of sustainability team, EHS team, and others those with the 
responsibility for preparation of the Reports; 
√ Obtained an understanding of the key systems and processes for recording,  
processing, and reporting the Identified Sustainability Information at various sites 
on a sample basis. 
 
IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd.
37
 
 
√ Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability 
Information may be materially misstated, determined the nature, timing and 
extent of further procedures; 
√ Reviewed the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information 
through agreeing or reconciling the Identified Sustainability Information with the 
underlying records; and 
√ Reviewed the consolidation for various sites and corporate office under the 
reporting boundary for ensuring the completeness of data being reported. 
 
During the assurance process a few of the findings were raised and the same are 
successfully addressed by the client. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance conclusion. 
 
Exclusions 
 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express a conclusion 
on:  
 
√ Aspects of the Reports and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) 
other than the Identified Sustainability Information; and 
√ The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, 
aim, or future intentions provided by the Company.  
 
Assurance Conclusion 
 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Identified Sustainability 
Information listed in Appendix I and presented in the Report for the financial year 1 April 
2024 to 31 March 2025 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Criteria stated in paragraph 3 above. 
 
Other matter 
 
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the 
Company’s management. Our procedures did not involve consideration of these matters 
and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes to either the information in 
the Report or our independent assurance report that may have occurred since the initial 
date of its presentation on the company’s website.
