1
Climate 
Change and 
Resilience
Risk & 
Opportunity
The operations and business 
of an organization can be 
directly affected by critical 
sustainability risks such as 
climate change, water security, 
plastic waste, supply chain 
disruptions, and sourcing 
challenges. Additionally, 
regulatory and market transition 
risks associated with the shift 
to a low-carbon economy 
are present. These risks 
include changing consumer 
preferences, increased product 
costs, and future government 
policies and regulations.
1.	 JPL's primary consumption consists 
of large quantities of printing inks 
and paper. The goal is to improve 
bulk shipment and storage, aiming 
to reduce transportation impact and 
excessive packaging.
2.	 The Company has started using 'Vio-
Green Plate Technology' (waterless 
chemistry) to conserve water, 
installed various water harvesting 
structures, star-rated energy-efficient 
air conditioners, solar panels at 
various locations and LED lights to 
save and conserve energy.
3.	 The Company's objective is to reduce 
reliance on power supplied by the 
Electricity Board by transitioning 
to solar energy. Several units are 
already utilising solar power.
4.	 JPL has installed energy-efficient 
fixtures at the majority of its printing 
presses and offices.
5.	 The installation of a solar power plant 
at the Kanpur, Agra and Noida units 
ensures the use of renewable energy, 
thereby decreasing overall CO2 
emissions. The Company is also in 
the process of installing solar panels 
at Lucknow, Patna and Varanasi units.
Short Term: Negative 
Medium to Long Term: 
Positive
Initiatives and 
endeavors aimed 
at mitigating climate 
change risks may 
result in additional 
costs in the short 
to medium term. 
However, these costs 
can be partially offset 
by long-term efficiency 
improvements. 
Moreover, these 
initiatives enhance 
business resilience 
and protect long-term 
value.

2
Waste 
Management
Opportunity
By embracing waste 
management as an opportunity, 
we can reduce costs, enhance 
sustainability, comply with 
regulations, drive innovation, 
and contribute to a more 
circular economy. This not only 
benefits a company's bottom 
line but also strengthens its 
reputation and position in the 
market.
1.	 JPL is focused towards adapting 3R 
policy i.e., Reduce, Reuse & Recycle 
on the waste generated, leaving 
lesser waste for disposal to third 
party vendors.
2.	 The Company has a proper tracking 
mechanism for the waste generated 
and does not encourage in 
performing any hazardous activity in 
printing presses.
3. The Company endeavors to deliver 
waste materials (which cannot 
be reused or recycled internally) 
to vendors who sell the waste to 
recyclers. JPL strives to reuse the 
wastepaper generated during 
production activities by converting it 
into writing pads and using it in paper 
packaging to reduce the quantity 
of waste delivered to vendors. 
Regarding production wastage, we 
do not recycle paper/newsprint as it 
is directly purchased from vendors, 
and the finished product is delivered 
to the end user.
Positive - 
Proper tracking 
and monitoring of 
waste generated 
along with source 
mapping reduces the 
total overall waste 
generated along with 
reducing the waste 
disposal cost.
3
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Water is foreseen as an 
opportunity at Jagran as 
majority of the water is 
consumed for domestic usage 
and minimal amount in process 
of printing.
1.	 JPL has installed Effluent Treatment 
Plants at 12 of its printing presses 
where Industrial effluents are treated 
and then discharged.
2. The Company started using ‘Vio-
Green Plate Technology’ (waterless 
chemistry) to save water.
3. We have installed various water 
harvesting structures to conserve 
water.
Positive -
Use of ETP helps in 
use of the treated 
water into domestic 
processes like 
gardening and toilet
flushing.
4
Human Capital 
Development
Opportunity
The success of the Company's 
operations relies on the 
ongoing dedication, skills, 
and expertise of its corporate 
and divisional executive 
teams, as well as other highly 
qualified employees who 
possess extensive knowledge 
in business, technology, and 
operations. The market for 
skilled professionals is highly 
competitive, and there is no 
guarantee that the Company 
will be able to retain these 
employees or recruit and train 
suitable replacements without 
incurring significant costs or 
experiencing delays.
1.	 Investing in training and development 
programs.
2.	 Offering opportunities for growth 
and development demonstrates 
our commitment to our employee’s 
professional growth.
3.	 Building a robust talent pipeline 
across responsibility levels through 
requisite quality in key roles.
4.	 Maintaining fair wages basis 
performance/appraisal or industry 
standard & applicable code.
5.	 The Company maintains an employee 
friendly work environment.
Positive -
Human Capital 
Development can 
improve the skills 
and knowledge of 
employees. This can

productivity, improved 
product quality, and 
operational efficiency 
within the Company.

Beyond content, the Company also leverages its massive reach to organize 
initiatives that can mobilize citizens from all walks of life and generate ground-
level impact. The details of the initiatives undertaken during the year are provided 
elsewhere in this report.
The Company has been addressing climate change issues by improving its 
process efficiency and taking initiatives in energy efficiency. For instance, the 
Company has started using 'Vio-Green Plate Technology' (waterless chemistry) 
to save water, installed various water harvesting structures, star-rated energy-
efficient air conditioners, solar panels and LED lights to save and conserve energy.
Through daily publications and editorial content centered around these themes, 
the Company endeavors to empower and enable its readers to become more

The Company has established processes to prevent and manage conflicts of interest involving board members. The 
Company has a Code of Conduct and Ethics that is approved by the Board of Directors and is applicable to all Directors 
and Senior Management Personnel. Annually, Directors and Senior Management affirm their compliance with the Code of 
Conduct, confirming that there have been no instances of non-compliance. Additionally, Directors disclose their interests 
using Form MBP-1, as required by Section 184 of the Companies Act, 2013. The Board acknowledges these confirmations 
at the first board meeting each year, in accordance with the aforementioned section.
Furthermore, in adherence to the Companies Act, 2013, its associated rules and schedules, and the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015—as amended periodically—directors abstain from participating in 
discussions about agenda items in which they are interested during board and committee meetings. The Audit Committee 
of the Board comprises solely independent directors, and the majority of members in nearly all other committees formed 
by the Board are independent directors, ensuring transparency and accountability.
The Company has also implemented a Related Party Transaction Policy to guarantee the proper approval and reporting of 
transactions between the Company and its related parties.
The aforementioned Code and Policy are available at: https://jplcorp.in/new/Reports.aspx?CID=14.

the entity, respectively.
FY 2023-24
(Current Financial Year)
FY 2022-23
(Previous Financial Year)
Details of improvement in social and environmental aspects
R&D
The raw materials required for newspaper production are procured externally from vendors, which means 
there is no direct investment in research and development (R&D) in this area. Nonetheless, we engage in 
regular discussions with our vendors to stay informed about the latest technological advancements and 
environmental issues related to newsprint. The costs associated with these discussions are negligible.
Capex
JPL has implemented several initiatives across its operations in areas such as energy efficiency, emissions 
management, and water conservation. The Company has allocated 2.40% of its total capital expenditures 
(CAPEX) to the installation of solar panels and effluent treatment plants (ETPs) in the reporting year. These 
investments are part of our efforts to address climate change by enhancing process efficiency and pursuing 
energy-saving measures. For example, the Company has adopted 'Vio-Green Plate Technology,' a waterless 
chemistry approach, to conserve water. We have also installed water harvesting structures, energy-efficient air 
conditioners with star ratings, solar panels at various plants and LED lighting to reduce energy consumption. 
To make the most of our limited resources, we have implemented operational controls to minimize waste 
and established waste norms for each plant. We closely monitor plant-specific waste levels to ensure they 
remain within acceptable limits. Additionally, we have established ETPs to treat and reuse wastewater for 
non-potable purposes, such as gardening, cleaning, and toilet flushing. While the Company ensures that 
other waste materials are delivered to vendors who sell the waste to recyclers, we do not engage in recycling 
ourselves.
2. 	 a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
As part of our sustainable sourcing initiative, we aim to assess vendors on various parameters, including environmental, 
social, and ethical areas. We have an established supplier code of conduct and expect vendors to comply with the 
same. Additionally, we aim to incorporate these parameters into the vendor selection and onboarding process as an 
extra control measure. In our supplier selection criteria, local sourcing is considered an essential criterion.
2. 	 b. 	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably.
Considering the purchase of low penetration inks and vio-green plates, the Company is sustainably sourcing 100% 
of these key inputs.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the 
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste
Given the nature of the business, the Company has limited scope for using recycled materials as processed inputs, with the 
exception of paper. As part of our production process, we do not recycle paper or newsprint waste because it is purchased 
directly from vendors, and the finished product is delivered to the end user. We import newsprint and also purchase it from 
Indian companies, with Indian manufacturers supplying 63.25% of the total newsprint we buy, most of which is recycled. A 
minimal quantity of e-waste was generated in the reporting year, and the Company has engaged a certified, government-
approved third-party e-waste handler to safely dispose of the generated e-waste. In addition to our waste disposal practices, 
the Company has implemented operational control measures to efficiently utilize limited resources, control wastage, and 
establish wastage norms for each plant. We closely monitor actual wastage plant by plant to ensure it remains within 
permissible limits.
4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted

As mentioned elsewhere in this report, the Company endeavors to deliver waste materials (which cannot be reused or 
recycled internally) to vendors who sell the waste to recyclers. JPL strives to reuse the wastepaper generated during 
production activities by converting it into writing pads and using it in paper packaging to reduce the quantity of waste 
delivered to vendors. Regarding production wastage, we do not recycle paper/newsprint as it is directly purchased from 
vendors, and the finished product is delivered to the end user. Newsprint is both imported and purchased from Indian 
companies, with Indian manufacturers accounting for a higher percentage of the total newsprint purchased, which consists 
of recycled newsprint.

topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Company has established a Stakeholder Relationship Committee of the Board (SRC), which the Board has constituted 
to ensure the swift resolution of grievances and complaints from stakeholders and investors. Additionally, the Company has 
formed a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee tasked with identifying CSR activities that impact communities in the 
areas or subjects specified by Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013 and its Rules. The Risk Management Committee 
is also in place to pinpoint risk elements across various operational domains. The Board of Directors approves policies 
that guide the Company's risk management practices, which aim to mitigate the unpredictability of financial markets and 
minimize potential adverse effects on the Company’s financial performance. The Board is duly informed of each committee's 
observations during their respective meetings.
	
Value Chain Partners are encouraged to communicate their complaints, grievances, or concerns directly to the head of the 
relevant department within the Company. Furthermore, a dedicated email ID is provided on the vendor purchase order, 
offering an additional channel for our value chain partners to express any grievances or concerns. The Company ensures 
that all employees have unrestricted access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee through the Vigil Mechanism. This

Insider Trading, as well as unethical business practices, illegality, fraud, corruption, or the leak of unpublished price-sensitive 
information related to the Company, in the workplace without fear of reprisal.

principles of Saat Sarokaar. This includes a daily column on health and wellbeing, a youth-centric supplement focusing on

its extensive reach to organize initiatives that embody these seven principles and have the potential to mobilize citizens and 
create a significant impact at the grassroots level. As a leading media company, JPL recognizes its responsibilities towards 
its readers and the citizens of the country. Accordingly, every word of editorial content produced across both print and digital 
media adheres to a strict Editorial Code, which is based on Saat Sarokaar.

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be provided along-with 
summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Set up of 
Effluent 
Treatment Plant 
(ETP)
The Company has installed ETP plants in our facilities located in Kanpur, 
Noida, Lucknow, Agra, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Patna, Bhagalpur, Indore, 
Haldwani, Dehradun, and Meerut. Installation of ETP plants is underway 
in Jalandhar and Ranchi. The treated water is then reused and recycled 
for gardening, flushing, cleaning, or returned to the earth for recharge, as 
appropriate. The Company plans to install ETP plants across all printing 
facilities.
The 
reuse 
of 
wastewater 
for 
non-
potable purposes, such 
as gardening, cleaning, 
and flushing, ultimately 
reduces the withdrawal 
of fresh water.
2
Vio-Green Plate 
Technology
The Company has been addressing climate change issues by improving 
process efficiency and initiating energy-saving measures. One such 
initiative is the use of 'Vio-Green Plate Technology' (waterless chemistry) 
to reduce water consumption during the printing process. This technology 
has led to a reduction in water consumption of 2.5 liters per square meter 
of plate area. The total number of half plates and full plates used in the 
reporting year is 28.9 Lakhs, resulting in a total reduction of 22 Lakh liters 
of water consumption.
This 
practice 
saves 
water at the installed 
facilities, 
ultimately 
reducing fresh water 
withdrawal by 22 Lakh 
litres.
3
Installed Star-
Rated systems 
& Renewable 
energy
The Company has been investing in various energy-saving renewable 
energy projects, such as the installation of star-rated systems and solar 
rooftop projects. JPL has installed efficient air conditioners and LED lights in 
office facilities. Lighting is used in all major facilities, including workspaces, 
canteens, and parking spaces. The capital expenditure investment in 
replacing conventional lighting with LED lights has resulted in savings in 
absolute energy consumption. The Company has successfully installed 
solar panels at its Kanpur, Agra and Noida locations, and is in the process 
of installing solar panels at its Lucknow, Patna and Varanasi locations.
The use of efficient 
air 
conditioners 
and 
LED lights contributes 
to 
energy 
savings, 
while the generation 
of renewable energy 
further enhances our 
sustainability efforts

5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.
The Company has established a business continuity and disaster management plan. In the event of a disturbance or 
breakdown, we have arranged for the printing of papers at nearby plants to ensure that our business continuity remains 
unaffected. As part of our disaster management strategy, we perform daily backups of applications to prevent such issues. 
Should any IT-related problems arise, we have plans in place to initiate recovery functions promptly, allowing business 
activities to continue without loss.
The Company has consistently maintained uninterrupted business operations and continuity, thanks in large part to the 
pioneering efforts of our employees. Their dedication has preserved the Company's tradition of prioritizing consumer 
interests. The pandemic has further demonstrated our capability to sustain operations during prolonged periods of crisis 
and disruption.
