To the Board of Directors of Prestige Estates Projects Limited,
1.	
We have undertaken to perform Reasonable Assurance 
engagement, for Prestige Estates Projects Limited. 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Company” or “Prestige”) 
vide our engagement letter dated March 31, 2025 in 
respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed 
below (the “Identified Sustainability Information” 
or “BRSR Core indicators”) in accordance with the 
Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability 
Information is included in the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of the Company for 
the financial year ended March 31, 2025.
	
This 
engagement 
was 
conducted 
by 
our 
multidisciplinary 
team 
including 
assurance 
practitioners, environmental engineers and specialists.
2.	
IDENTIFIED SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION
	
Our scope of Reasonable Assurance consists of 
the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to 
our report. The reporting boundary of the BRSR is 
as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosures of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by 
way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, 
where applicable.
	
Our Reasonable Assurance engagement was with 
respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information 
only and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, 
and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
3.	
CRITERIA
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the 
Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
	
The criteria used is the “BRSR Core”, which is a subset 
of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”)/ metrics under nine Environmental, 
Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes, as per 
the format of BRSR Core specified in Annexure 17A, 
read with the format of BRSR and the Guidance Note 
given in Annexure 16 and 17, respectively, of the SEBI 
Master Circular for ‘compliance with the provisions of 
the SEBI LODR Regulations, 2025 by Listed Entities’ 
dated November 11, 2024, and the SEBI Circular on the 
’Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core’ dated 
December 20, 2024 (collectively referred to as the “SEBI 
Circulars”).
4.	
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information including 
the reporting boundary of the BRSR, disclosing 
environmental information basis operational control 
approach, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations including the SEBI circulars, related to 
reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of 
the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
	
The Management and the Board of Directors of the 
Company are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s compliance with the requirements of LODR 
Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to the 
BRSR Core.
5.	
INHERENT LIMITATIONS
	
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non- financial information allows for different, but 
acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between companies.
	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core 
metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG 
emissions, water footprint, energy footprint and waste. 
Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support 
our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the 
amounts and metrics.
6.	
OUR INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm 
that we have met the requirements of the Code of 
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Circular No. SEBI/
HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 
dated 
July 
12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have the 
required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement.

(Indicate 
positive or

implications)
1.
GHG Emissions
Risk
Construction 
is 
inherently 
energy-intensive 
and 
contributes substantially to both 
direct and indirect greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, including 
carbon 
dioxide 
(CO2) 
and 
methane, primarily from fuel 
consumption. If not properly 
managed, 
emissions 
and 
pollutants 
released 
during 
operations can pose significant 
environmental and regulatory 
risks for the Company.
To 
reduce 
transportation-
related emissions, the Company 
promotes the local procurement 
of 
raw 
materials. 
Energy 
efficiency is further enhanced 
by prioritizing the conversion of 
direct current (DC) to alternating 
current (AC) for faucet and flush 
valves. Additionally, Portland 
Pozzolana Cement (PPC) is 
used 
in 
all 
non-structural 
construction activities to lower 
the overall carbon footprint of 
our projects.
Negative
2.
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The 
development 
and 
management of real estate 
projects demand extensive use 
of natural resources such as 
timber, water, and electricity. As 
a result, effective management 
of 
energy 
consumption 
is 
crucial 
to 
ensure 
resource 
efficiency and environmental 
sustainability.
NA
Positive
3.
Sustainable 
Construction 
and 
Procurement
Opportunity Companies 
are 
increasingly 
assessed based on the resource 
efficiency and carbon footprint 
of their real estate assets, 
their 
exposure 
to 
evolving 
environmental 
regulations 
related to construction, and 
the measures they undertake 
to enhance the environmental 
sustainability of their properties.

4.
Climate Change
Risk
Climate 
change 
affects 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
geographies 
and industries, bringing with 
it 
significant 
physical 
risks 
such as floods, heatwaves, 
and wildfires. Additionally, it 
introduces 
transitional 
risks, 
including 
the 
shift 
towards 
mandatory renewable energy 
adoption, evolving regulatory 
frameworks, 
and 
changing 
market expectations related to 
sustainability.
The 
Company 
addresses 
climate change by integrating 
sustainable practices into its 
design processes, technological 
choices, and safety systems. 
It also promotes the use of 
renewable 
energy 
solutions, 
such as the installation of 
solar panels, to reduce its 
carbon footprint and enhance 
environmental resilience.
Negative
5.
Water 
Management
Risk
Water plays a vital role across 
the 
construction, 
operation, 
and maintenance phases of 
real estate projects. Its usage 
can 
significantly 
affect 
the 
availability and quality of local 
water 
resources. 
Moreover, 
improper treatment or discharge 
of wastewater can result in 
environmental 
contamination 
and pose legal and compliance 
risks for the Company.
The Company utilizes sewage 
treatment 
plants 
(STPs) 
to 
recycle water for non-potable 
uses 
such 
as 
landscaping, 
toilet flushing, and dust control. 
For upcoming projects, the 
Company plans to incorporate 
smart water meters along with 
water-efficient fixtures like low-
flow taps and aerators, aiming 
to enhance water conservation 
efforts across operations.
Negative
6.
Waste 
Management
Risk
The circular economy approach 
emphasizes 
the 
reuse, 
refurbishment, and recycling 
of 
materials 
and 
products. 
Adopting this model influences 
building design and material 
selection, 
encouraging 
more 
sustainable 
construction 
practices. Evolving regulations, 
shifting market demand, and 
advancements in technology 
further support this transition by 
potentially lowering costs and 
enhancing resource efficiency.
The 
Company 
ensures 
responsible 
waste 
disposal 
by partnering with authorized 
vendors 
and 
runs 
buyback 
programs for batteries. Waste 
is systematically segregated 
and managed at a centralized 
facility, with a strong focus 
on processing and recycling 
to 
promote 
sustainability 
throughout its operations.

Employee 
Well-being and 
Development
Risk
High employee retention rates 
indicate 
effective 
company 
policies and positive workplace 
practices, 
contributing 
to 
greater employee satisfaction. 
Conversely, high attrition rates 
may 
signal 
dissatisfaction, 
resulting in increased costs for 
recruitment and training, and 
potentially disrupting business 
continuity, especially in key 
roles.
As a certified “Great Place 
to 
Work,” 
we 
emphasize 
continuous 
re-skilling 
and 
upskilling 
of 
employees 
in 
emerging 
technologies 
via 
digital learning platforms. Our 
focus 
extends 
to 
retaining 
critical talent through team-
building 
initiatives, 
health 
and wellness programs, and 
fostering a safe, inclusive, and 
supportive work environment.
Negative
8.
Diversity and 
Inclusion

demonstrate 
employees’ 
strong 
sense 
of 
belonging 
and commitment to a fair and 
equitable workplace.
NA

9.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Customer 
satisfaction 
measures 
the 
effectiveness 
with 
which 
the 
Company 
delivers products and services 
that meet or surpass customer 
expectations, offering valuable 
insights into overall business 
performance.
NA
Positive
10.
Human rights 
and Labour 
Management
Risk
Real 
estate 
management 
and construction are labour-
intensive 
sectors 
that 
frequently attract attention from 
human 
rights 
organizations 
regarding 
labour 
practices. 
Ensuring effective workforce 
management 
and 
upholding 
workers’ rights are therefore 
critical 
priorities 
for 
the 
Company.
The Company has implemented 
a robust grievance redressal 
mechanism, 
strictly 
follows 
POSH (Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment) guidelines, and 
promotes 
non-discrimination 
and 
equal 
opportunity. 
We 
maintain a strong commitment 
to 
upholding 
human 
rights 
across all operations.

Community 
Engagement
Risk
While 
construction 
activities 
drive 
social 
and 
economic 
development, 
they 
can 
also present risks to local 
communities 
and 
the 
environment. 
Environmental 
issues 
and 
community 
opposition have the potential 
to delay or halt projects, which 
may 
affect 
the 
Company’s 
profitability 
and 
growth 
prospects.
The 
Company 
proactively 
engages with local communities 
through 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, 
investing in projects that target 
social, 
environmental, 
and 
economic development, with the 
aim of creating lasting positive 
impacts.
Negative
12.
Ethical 
Business 
Conduct
Risk
Issues 
related 
to 
business 
ethics, such as fraud, executive 
misconduct, 
corruption, 
money 
laundering, 
and 
antitrust violations, can result 
in 
regulatory 
investigations, 
financial 
penalties, 
legal 
settlements, 
and 
significant 
reputational 
harm 
to 
the 
Company.
The 
Company 
prioritizes 
transparency 
by 
sharing 
project information openly and 
enforcing 
a 
comprehensive 
Anti-Fraud and Vigilance Policy. 
This policy actively involves all 
stakeholders to uphold integrity 
and 
ensure 
accountability 
throughout our operations.
Negative
13.
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Businesses are evaluated on 
governance aspects including 
ownership 
and 
control 
structures, board compensation, 
financial 
reporting, 
business 
ethics, and tax transparency. 
Robust corporate governance 
and ethical standards play a 
critical role in maintaining the 
confidence of shareholders and 
investors.
The Company undertakes both 
internal and statutory audits to 
ensure regulatory compliance. 
We provide regular training 
and 
resources 
to 
enhance 
compliance awareness among 
employees and maintain an 
independent 
internal 
audit 
team responsible for assessing 
risk management and control 
processes.
Negative
14.
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
Companies 
are 
evaluated 
based on their data collection 
practices, adherence to privacy 
regulations, susceptibility to data 
breaches, and the robustness of 
their data protection systems.
The Company has transitioned 
its business applications to 
SAP Cloud on AWS using S4 
HANA SAP Rise, implemented 
stringent 
access 
controls, 
migrated to Office 365, and 
upgraded endpoint security with 
advanced software solutions to 
minimize risks and strengthen 
protection against cyber threats.

I hope this message finds you in good health and enduring optimism.
	
The past year has reaffirmed a vital truth that enduring value lies not just in scale or speed, but in resilience, responsibility,

quality developments and strengthening our foundations. Across our residential, commercial, retail, and hospitality verticals, 
we sustained our pace of launches and completions with a disciplined approach to execution and stakeholder trust.
	
Projects such as Prestige Nautilus in Mumbai garnered exceptional market response, and we progressed towards our 
vision of becoming a pan-India real estate leader.
	
Deepening Our Sustainability Commitment
	
At Prestige, sustainability is not an auxiliary pillar. It is the central design principle guiding every decision we make. In 
FY 2024–25, our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) efforts continued to evolve from intention to impact.
	
Environmental Leadership
	
We expanded our certified green portfolio and pursued industry-leading benchmarks:
	
•	
1.8 Mn sq. ft. of completed commercial projects and 13 Mn sq. ft. spanning commercial and residential spaces.
	
•	
18 projects are WELL pre-certified, and 11 projects are WELL Health-Safety Ratings rated.
	
•	
Enhanced implementation of EV-ready infrastructure, solar energy integration, and advanced water stewardship 
across our developments.
	
Our approach continues to be anchored in circular economy principles, minimising waste, reusing resources, and reducing 
our environmental footprint, from design through delivery.
	
Social Equity and Quality
	
Our commitment to inclusive growth is reflected in the communities we build and the lives we touch. Through targeted 
skilling, education, and health initiatives, and under our Integrated Quality Management Framework, we worked to ensure 
both operational excellence and equitable development outcomes across geographies.
	
Governance and Transparency
	
The strength of our governance defines the integrity of our growth. Our ESG Council, under Board supervision, ensured 
strategic oversight, internal controls, and transparent reporting. The CRISIL DA1+ Developer Grading reaffirmation during 
the year stands testimony to our operational prudence and institutional reliability.
	
Looking Forward
	
As we look ahead to FY 2025–26, we do so with pragmatic optimism. We are set to launch over 44.8 Mn sq. ft. of new 
developments, with an estimated Gross Development Value (GDV) of ` 421,202 Mn. Notable among them:
	
•	
The Prestige City – Indirapuram, NCR
	
•	
Prestige Falcon City Luxe – Bengaluru
	
•	
Prestige Horizon Heights – Mumbai
	
•	
Prestige Pallavaram Gardens – Chennai
	
These developments will also help bolster our presence in new strategic geographies. The road ahead is filled with exciting 
opportunities, and with our strategic vision and operational prowess, we are poised to capture them.
	
Our Promise
	
Even as market cycles shift, our values remain constant. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to every member of the Prestige 
family, employees, customers, partners, and investors, who continue to trust us.
	
Let us continue to lead with courage, build with conscience, and shape a future that is not only successful but also 
sustainable.

internal and external fraud risks.

Fraud Alerts – The Anti-Fraud and Vigilance Officer collaborates with business units to issue timely fraud alerts and 
raise awareness.
	
5.	
Lessons Learnt – Post-incident insights are documented and shared with employees to improve future fraud 
identification and response.
	
6.	
Fraud Deterrence – Preventive measures and strong consequences are emphasized to discourage fraudulent 
behavior.

stakeholders based on their level of influence and impact. Internal stakeholders include employees, board members, 
channel partners, and vendors, while external stakeholders comprise government agencies, regulatory bodies, local 
communities, customers, investors, and the media. The Company also assesses the social and environmental impact 
of its activities to ensure communities affected by operations are actively recognized and engaged. By understanding

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Prestige Group has established a structured process for stakeholder consultation on economic, environmental, and social 
topics. A key component of this process is the stakeholder-driven materiality assessment, during which feedback on 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues is collected through digital surveys targeting diverse stakeholder 
groups including employees, vendors, contractors, clients, channel partners, and management committee members.
	
The feedback is systematically analysed by the management team and presented to the Board for review and approval. 
Additionally, during the reporting period, the Company collaborated with sustainability experts to reassess its material 
topics in line with global ESG rating agencies, leading reporting frameworks, and benchmarking with industry peers. This 
process informed the development of relevant sustainability targets, ensuring that stakeholder concerns are effectively 
integrated into strategic decision-making at the Board level.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics (Yes/No). Yes
	
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is actively used by Prestige Group to support the identification and management of 
environmental and social topics. We regularly engage with stakeholders through structured dialogues and surveys to 
surface their concerns and expectations. These insights are systematically assessed using a materiality framework that 
evaluates top risks both qualitatively and quantitatively, covering dimensions aligned with the integrated reporting capitals 
and the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.
	
The ESG Committee, which has oversight of local stakeholder engagement, plays a central role in analysing feedback and 
identifying issues critical to the Company. Inputs received from stakeholders are integrated into our policy framework 
and operational activities through several mechanisms. These include the standardisation of debriefing processes, 
development of targeted training modules, and facilitation of internal conferences where regional managers share best 
practices. The process ensures that stakeholder perspectives are embedded in decision-making and help shape Prestige 
Group’s sustainability agenda.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
	
Prestige Group actively engages with vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups to address their specific concerns 
and promote social equity. We enhance worker social protection by collaborating closely with NGOs and regulatory 
bodies to ensure access to essential rights and benefits. Additionally, we prioritise local procurement from Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), supporting the growth and sustainability of local economies. These efforts not 
only empower marginalized communities but also foster inclusive development aligned with our social responsibility 
commitments.

Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste at Prestige is handled and managed by sub-contractors. Accordingly, this waste is 
not reported in the BRSR. The waste figures disclosed do not include waste generated at under-construction sites and ongoing 
projects. The previous year’s figure has also been revised to reflect this methodology
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Prestige Group follows structured waste management practices across its establishments to ensure compliance and 
reduce environmental impact. Waste is categorised into hazardous, non-hazardous, biodegradable, and non-biodegradable 
types. Hazardous waste—such as used oil from diesel generators and leftover paint—is disposed of through authorised 
vendors as per regulatory guidelines.
	
Biodegradable waste is processed into organic manure and used in landscaping. Wet waste, primarily kitchen waste, 
is collected daily in designated green bins. Dry waste, including paper and packaging materials, is placed in blue bins 
and collected on scheduled days for recycling. Medical and sanitary waste is wrapped and disposed of in red bins with 
appropriate precautions.
	
The Group also uses Organic Waste Composters (OWCs) to treat wet waste on-site. In its hospitality operations, the Group 
is introducing a drinking water bottling unit to reduce plastic waste from bottled water.
	
To reduce the use of hazardous chemicals, the Group uses eco-friendly materials in construction and maintenance, 
ensures proper handling and disposal through trained staff, and explores safer alternatives through ongoing evaluations.
