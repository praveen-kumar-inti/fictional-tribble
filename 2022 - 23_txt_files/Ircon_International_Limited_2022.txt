Risk
Extreme weather events, sea-level

threats to railway infrastructure, 
leading to operational disruptions, 
financial losses, and reputational 
damage. Adapting infrastructure 
for resilience, meeting stricter

can 
lead 
to

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes, IRCON has established and implemented an Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management 
System in accordance with ISO 45001-2018. The organization has determined the necessary processes 
and their application throughout the organization. This includes identifying the inputs and outputs of 
each process, as well as creating an Inter-relation Matrix to illustrate their relationships. The sequence 
and interaction of processes have been determined, and criteria and methods, including monitoring, 
measurements, and performance indicators, have been applied to ensure effective operation and 
control. Resources have been allocated and made available for the processes, and responsibilities and 
authorities have been assigned accordingly. Risks and opportunities have been addressed, and processes 
are regularly evaluated and improved to achieve their intended results. IRCON maintains documented 
information to support process operations and retains documentation to ensure adherence to planned 
processes.
b.
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
IRCON through their Occupational Health and Safety Manual has established a process for identifying 
and assessing aspects/hazards, with an assessment mechanism based on their significance. During the 
initial stage of project execution, major hazards are identified, tabulated, and communicated to the 
construction team. A comprehensive inventory of all aspects and OH&S hazards are periodically reviewed 
& updated based on the initial review and group risk assessment. Several factors are addressed, including 
storage, handling, and disposal of construction & hazardous materials, plant & machinery activities, 
construction activities & related standard operating procedures, and infrastructure facilities. For OH&S risk 
assessment, aspects with significant impacts on employee health and safety, such as physical, chemical, 
and biological factors, are identified. Probability and severity factors are used to rate the assessment, 
with a scale ranging from “Always” to “Never” for probability and from “Permanent/partial disability 
with hospitalization or death” to “No harm” for severity. The risk rating is determined by multiplying the 
probability and severity factors together. If the risk rating is 3 or higher, it is considered intolerable, and 
control measures should be developed and implemented. The OH&S risk levels are defined as Extreme, 
High, Moderate, Low, and Trivial based on specific criteria.
c.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
IRCON takes several measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. The company conduct regular hazard 
identification and risk assessments, including safety drills for various scenarios. Stringent safety measures are in 
place at project sites to prioritize the well-being of employees and workers. This includes the implementation 
of Safety Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and comprehensive training programs. Regular pre-medical 
checkups are conducted at scheduled intervals to monitor the health of personnel. Following the principles of 
the Industrial Safety hierarchy, the project emphasizes a systematic approach to risk mitigation. The hierarchy 
involves the steps of elimination, substitution, engineering control and administrative control. Hazards are first 
eliminated whenever possible, followed by substituting hazardous elements with safer alternatives. Engineering 
controls are implemented to design a safer work environment, while administrative controls establish procedures 
and guidelines to manage risks effectively. Finally, when necessary, appropriate PPE is provided to ensure worker 
safety. Through the consistent application of this safety hierarchy, the project endeavors to identify and address 
potential hazards, fostering a culture of safety and responsibility throughout the project site.

BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be  
responsive to all its stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The process of identifying key stakeholder groups for IRCON encompasses several steps. Initially, it involves clearly 
defining IRCON’s purpose and role within the industry. Subsequently, both internal and external stakeholders are 
identified, taking into account their respective interests and concerns. 
	
As a listed EPC contractor in the infrastructure sector, there are several key stakeholder groups that are considered, 
these include investors and shareholders, employees and workers, clients or employers, vendors, sub-contractors, 
consultants, the community, and the end users of the infrastructure. The selection of client/employers is typically 
based on the company’s business interests. Vendors, sub-contractors, and consultants are identified and chosen 
according to project requirements and contract conditions. The responsibility for the end users of the infrastructure 
facility typically lies with the client/employer, unless the contract provisions allow for involvement by the EPC 
contractor. Investors, shareholders, employees, and workers are integral parts of the entity itself.
	
IRCON can successfully understand and engage with stakeholders, effectively addressing their needs and concerns, 
and cultivating positive relationships through the stakeholder engagement process. Such a strategic approach 
enables IRCON to optimize project execution, enhance client satisfaction, collaborate effectively with government 
agencies, and generate value for its shareholders and other stakeholders, thereby achieving improved overall 
outcomes.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complaints in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
To prevent adverse consequences for complainants in discrimination and harassment cases, several mechanisms 
can be employed. These include ensuring strict confidentiality of complainants’ identities and details, implementing 
robust non-retaliation policies to protect them from reprisals, establishing whistleblower protection measures 
for anonymous reporting, conducting independent and unbiased investigations, providing adequate remedies 
such as disciplinary actions and support for complainants, offering ongoing training and awareness programs, 
implementing external reporting mechanisms, and conducting regular reviews and evaluations. By implementing 
these mechanisms, IRCON creates a safe and supportive environment for individuals to report complaints, address 
issues effectively, and prevent adverse consequences for complainants in discrimination and harassment cases.

potentially impact critical business functions and processes. The plan underscores the necessity of adopting a 
coordinated and thorough approach to address cyber security incidents and breaches.
	
This plan draws its foundation from the ‘Cyber Crisis Management Plan for countering cyber-attacks and cyber 
terrorism’ formulated by CERT-In, MeitY, Government of India. It acknowledges the dynamic nature of cyber 
security, wherein technological progress brings forth new vulnerabilities, necessitating periodic updates to 
response strategies. Ideally, these updates should occur on an annual basis. The section concerning the nature of 
cyber crisis and contingencies identifies distinct types of threats and crisis that may target specific objectives. Its 
objective is to assess the impact of these crisis on critical business functions and services within IRCON, ultimately 
determining suitable response and mitigation measures.
	
The plan encompasses various organizational units within IRCON, including the corporate office, regional 
offices, and project offices. Additionally, it encompasses key business functions such as finance and accounts, 
human resources management, business development, plant maintenance, contract management, and project 
management.
