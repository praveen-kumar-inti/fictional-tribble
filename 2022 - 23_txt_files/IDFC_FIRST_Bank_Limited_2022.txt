would help result in improving efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel as well as the Bank. The Vigilance Policy

Since the Bank is not involved in manufacturing or in direct production of goods, 
this parameter is not directly material for the Bank.
However, the Bank has embarked upon Digital journey for its various business 
processes and products. The Bank has also encouraged the use of mobile and 
internet banking by its customers which in turn minimises the paper consumption 
and reduces environmental impact.
The Bank has undertaken several initiatives to minimise its environmental 
impact by getting its large offices green certified (IGBC or LEED).
The Bank aims to reduce contribution to global climate change, protect and 
restore water resources, protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services and 
enhance community quality of life.

same is not possible. As per our destruction policy after the cooling period all the RTO/undelivered Welcome kits, 
Debit cards and Cheque books are handed over to destruction vendor appointed by procurement for physical

Digitisation and automation helped implement paperless processes, reduced consumption of paper through 
e-statements and e-receipts to customers and reduced paper procurements.
The Bank has empanelled certified vendors for managing E-waste.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.

waste quantum through its operations.
	
All recyclable waste collected at our branches is separated (dry and wet waste). The waste is then handed over to an 
authorised waste processor.
	
Digitisation and automation has helped implement paperless processes, reduced consumption of paper through e-statements 
and e-receipts to customers and reduced paper procurements.
	
We have empanelled certified vendors for managing E-waste.

and switched to reusable or sustainably sourced alternatives wherever possible.
