share in this sector by adding products such as 
electrolysers, sheet metal assemblies, 
enclosures etc.
In addition, MTAR has started catering to 
customers in Hydro Power and Waste to Energy

Managing Director’s Overview - Sustainability
In FY 2022-23, the company has derived nearly 
85% of revenue from manufacturing climate 
positive products as against 77% in FY 2021-22. 
At MTAR, ESG has been an integral part of our 
business decision making to power a sustainable 
future
Dear Stakeholders,
I am delighted to inform our shareholders 
that we have made significant strides in 
integrating environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) considerations into 
our operations. Sustainability has been 
an integral part of our business strategy, 
and we have been manufacturing climate 
positive products since our inception. 
We have always believed that infusing 
company with purpose can help attract 
a motivated skilled workforce that drives 
financial success. 
MTAR was established to supply climate 
positive products for Civil Nuclear 
Programme to Clean Energy – Civil 
Nuclear Power and later forayed into 
Clean Energy Fuel Cells division in 2009. 
The company has started fabricating 
critical structures for Clean Energy – 
Hydel & Waste to Energy sectors. In FY 
2022-23, the company has derived nearly 
85% of revenue from manufacturing 
climate positive products as against 77% 
in FY 2021-22. To contribute further to 
sustainability by manufacturing products 
that have positive impact on 
environment, the company has also 
initiated discussions with customers that 
are into Wind Energy, Battery Storage 
Systems and Hydrogen Storage systems. 
Apart from expanding our green product 
portfolio, the company has focused on 
several key areas to drive sustainability 
and create positive impact. One of our 
major initiative is installation of solar 
rooftops across EOU and Unit2 that 
contribute to the majority of our 
revenues to reduce our carbon footprint. 
We are working towards installing solar 
rooftops at our Adibatla unit. In addition, 
the company has also implemented 
other energy-efficient practices including 
replacement of conventional lighting with 
LED lighting. As a result, the company has 
started reducing its carbon foot print.
In the past, the company has developed 
several import substitutes such as ball 
screws, roller screws, water lubricated 
bearing, fins, fork lift bases, bellows etc. 
to reduce emissions by avoiding imports. 
In FY 2022-23, the company has 
developed products such as bellows 
etc. that were previously imported to 
integrate with power units for Solid Oxide 
fuel cells, which enables us to reduce 
emissions by avoiding sea shipments/
airfreight. MTAR is committed to 
sustainable procurement and responsible 
sourcing and always procured majority 
of imported raw materials through sea 
shipments to contribute to the reduction 
of emissions. The company has 
strengthened partnerships with the 
vendor throughout the value chain in the 
year under review to create awareness 
about ESG. MTAR has taken up training 
session to its vendors about the need 
for adhering to ethical labour practices, 
minimizing environmental impacts, and 
promoting biodiversity conservation. By 
promoting awareness about sustainability 
throughout the value chain, the company 
aims to create a positive ripple effect that 
extends beyond its own operations.
The company has always focused on 
fostering a cultural of excellence marked 
by high people retention. We have a 
modest attrition of 8.5% as on year ended 
March 31, 2023. The company firmly 
believes that the growth of the 
organisation is dependent on the growth 
and welfare of our employees. 
Accordingly, the company places a lot of 
emphasis on the training our employeers 
and various welfare activities taken up 
for our employee wellbeing. We have 
taken up salary correction activity in Q4 
FY 2022-23 to ensure the compensation 
of our employees in on par with or better 
than the industry average.
Furthermore, we also believe that a 
diverse workforce drives innovation and 
leads to better decision-making. Our 
hiring practices have always been aimed 
at gender and racial diversity at all levels 
of the company, however, historically 
female work force in our overall strength 
is lower due to the nature of the industry 
in spite of inclusive human resource 
policies. In the recent past the company 
has taken up special initiatives to enhance 
gender diversity by increasing the number 
of women in the organisation at all levels 
and is working on improving it further. 
The company’s believes that a diverse 
workforce drives innovation and leads to 
better decision-making goal. We target 
to create an environment where every 
employee feels valued, respected, and 
empowered to reach their full potential; 
the company promotes training programs 
and takes up activities to promote a 
culture of belonging. The company 
believes that up-lifting of communities is 
essential for an inclusive and equitable 
growth. We have contributed to Rs. 11.7 
Mn towards various initiatives related to 
education, skill development, healthcare, 
eradication of poverty and preservation of 
cultural heritage through CSR funds in the 
year under review. Furthermore, the 
company has adopted two schools to 
enhance the quality of education by 
improving the infrastructural facilities.
The company firmly believes that robust 
corporate governance is essential for 
the long-term success of a business and 
we ensure 100% compliance with all the 
regulatory requirments. At MTAR, our 
strategic direction is guided by our board, 
which comprises majority of 
independent directors. The company has 
always maintained transparency in 
providing disclosures to all the 
stakeholders. It also organises regular
5

BRSR FY 2022- 23
trainings sessions on corporate 
governance and business code of conduct 
to all the stakeholders including the 
directors on the board, KMPs and 
employees. 
The company has always taken measures 
to integrate sustainability into our 
business model with an aim to impact 
different aspects of it, however, we 
understand that the ever-changing 
landscape of sustainability requires us to 
continually adapt and find 
innovative solutions. MTAR understands 
the imperative need to address various 
issues such as reduction of carbon 
emissions, water management, waste 
management, work place diversity, and 
biodiversity. The company believes that 
addressing these challenges requires 
collaborative efforts from all the 
stakeholders, and hence, MTAR has been 
engaging with all the stakeholders 
including vendors, industry partners, 
NGOs etc.to accelerate progress by 
driving collective action. 
The company envisions to be 100% 
complaint with ESG and charted out a 
clear road map for sustainability over the 
coming years. The company shall continue 
to integrate sustainability into its business 
strategies and operations, focusing on 
expansion of Clean Energy verticals, 
implementation of circular economy 
principles, renewable energy adoption, 
and community engagement. 
MTAR is in discussion with various 
customers in Clean Energy to increase 
its green product portfolio and shall be 
carrying out project specific investments 
to develop sustainable products. 
Furthermore, the company is exploring 
business models to prioritize resource 
efficiency, and aims to leverage 
technology to enhance our environmental 
monitoring and reporting capabilities.
I would like to express my gratitude to our 
board, our employees, customers, 
suppliers and partners who have 
extended their immense support in the 
company’s sustainability journey thus far. 
Our stakeholders have a key role to play 
in our emergence of MTAR as a Clean 
Energy player that constitutes 85% of 
revenues of the firm and their 
commitment and passion have been 
instrumental in driving positive change. 
Together, the company looks forward 
to power a sustainable future over the 
coming decades.
