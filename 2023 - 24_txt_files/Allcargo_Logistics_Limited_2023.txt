1.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Opportunity
Implementing a sustainable supply 
chain can decrease supply chain 
disruption and concurrently help stay 
ahead of emerging regulatory risks. 
Guiding suppliers to meet Allcargo’s 
ESG requirements will thereby reduce 
environmental 
impacts, 
encourage 
business with local suppliers, and 
endorse good governance.
-
Positive 
implications
2.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
Supply chain disruptions can impede 
processes 
and 
create 
obstacles 
throughout 
Allcargo’s 
value 
chain. 
Human rights violations and poor 
environmental performance of our 
vendors can lead to an impaired brand 
reputation are a few of the disruptions 
that can occur which subsequently lead 
to financial losses.
Allcargo’s 
Supplier 
Code 
of 
Conduct establishes its stance 
over issues such as human 
rights, community development, 
business ethics and transparency, 
environmental performance, and 
whistleblowing. 
Allcargo 
has 
also formulated a Sustainable 
Procurement 
Policy 
for 
its 
suppliers 
with 
guidance 
to 
acquire from sustainable and 
local sources.
Negative 
implications
3.
Community 
Development
Opportunity
Engaging in community development is 
imperative to build long lasting relations 
with our associated communities, given 
our nation-wide presence. Furthermore, 
corporate social responsibility also 
providing a social license to operate, 
increase 
in 
investor 
interest 
and 
improved brand value recognition.
-
Positive 
implications
4.
Energy
Opportunity
Being in the logistics sector, efficiently 
managing our energy usage is important 
to ensure that our dependency on non-
renewable energy sources is reduced 
and the transition to options such as 
solar energy and alternate fuels is 
optimized. Although adopting better 
technology to reduce our energy 
consumption may incur a significant 
initial 
investment, 
it 
will 
ensure 
seamless transition to cleaner fuels. 
Additionally, this will reduce emissions 
in the process.
-
Positive 
implications
5.
Energy
Risk
We are largely dependent on our 
business vendors such as shipping 
liners for being able to transition towards 
alternate fuel in our operations of ocean 
freight, air freight, and road freight. 
However, the financial implications of 
the same would be limited to the short 
term.
Allcargo 
has 
formulated 
an 
Environmental Policy to monitor 
its performance on reducing GHG 
emissions over a period of time.

implications

Emissions
Risk
A prime source of emissions for Allcargo 
is ocean freight, air freight, and road 
freight. Therefore, non-management of 
emissions can lead to environmental 
deterioration.
Allcargo 
has 
formulated 
an 
Environmental Policy to monitor 
its performance on reducing GHG 
emissions over a period of time.

7.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity, equity and inclusion serves 
as key pillar to facilitate a thriving 
working 
environment 
and 
access 
to an expanded talent pool. Healthy 
workplace relationship enables growth 
and career advancement. Additionally, 
well-connected facilities can encourage 
participation of women in the workforce.
-
Positive 
implications
8.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
Actively making use of sustainable 
logistics solutions at the company could 
aid in both attracting and retaining 
customers as numerous customers 
are aiming to make their supply chains 
more sustainable in nature. Redressal 
of customer grievances and obtaining 
timely feedback can work towards 
improving 
customer 
loyalty 
and 
increase the rate of customer retention.
-
Positive 
Implication
9.
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
It 
is 
imperative 
to 
ensure 
good 
governance and transparent practices 
as they can together help in securing 
stakeholder 
interest, 
lead 
to 
an 
improved 
reputation, 
reduce 
the 
company’s vulnerability to risks and 
improve financial performance of the 
company.
-
Positive 
Implications
10.
Cybersecurity
Risk
Maintaining the privacy of customers 
and employee data is vital at Allcargo 
holds its service online. Data breaches 
and cybersecurity threats have risen 
over the past decade, and this has a 
negative impact on the functioning of 
the organisation leading to penalties 
and reputational damage.
Allcargo has a Cybersecurity 
policy. 
Allcargo 
is 
also 
ISO 
27001:2022 certified to ensure 
utmost compliance and better 
customer data privacy. In doing 
so, we have achieved a score 
of 760 in our third-party audit 
through BitSight ratings.
Negative 
Implications
11.
Labour 
Practice and 
Human Rights
Risk
Violation of human rights principles can 
adversely impact the workforce at larger 
and bear a risk of litigation against the 
company. Further, the violations could 
also lead to severe reputational damage 
to the company.
Allcargo has in place a Human 
Rights Policy with commitments 
such as zero tolerance towards 
human trafficking, child labour, 
and 
forced 
labour, 
freedom 
of 
association, 
discrimination

redressal mechanism is set for 
all employees and contractual 
workers to report any grievances
