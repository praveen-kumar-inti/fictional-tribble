1	
Data Privacy 
and Security
Opportunity & 
Risk
Opportunity: Continuous augmentation 
of a strong and secure tech 
infrastructure helps mitigate the 
risks associated with data privacy and 
security. In addition to this the adoption 
of specific tech modules makes the 
entire infrastructure more resilient.
Risk: Data Privacy and security is 
increasingly becoming vulnerable 
with large scale use of technology 
and integration across multiple 
Techsystems.
The Company has zero 
tolerance towards breach 
of technology/ cyber 
security. To this aspect we 
have policies framed and 
well defined procedures 
in place to handle such 
incidents, if any, including 
availing services of ethical 
hackers.
Positive: Strong reputation of 
reliability and assurance leading 
to better business prospects.
Negative: Loss of credibility.
2	
Human Capital
Opportunity & 
Risk
Opportunity: The strong build up of a 
world class talent pool empowers Angel 
One to further explore ineffable tech 
capabilities in its domain. Today Angel 
One is foremost amongst the thought 
leaders in the digital financial services 
industry in India.
Risk: Skill obsolescence and flight of 
quality human capital is a perpetual risk 
faced by all organisations.
The Company has built a 
strong and professional 
culture along with globally 
competitive compensation 
practices which help 
attract great talent.
Positive: Great talent creates 
great businesses and is the 
catalyst for growth.
Negative: Retention of laggards 
and flight of quality talent 
may result in deterioration of 
business.
3	
Technology
Opportunity & 
Risk
Opportunity: The Company continues 
to invest in augmenting its tech 
capabilities across its entire domain 
mirroring global benchmarks. The DNA 
of Angel One is to endeavour to stay 
ahead of the curve as a digital first 
organisation.
Risk: Loss of focus on continuous 
evolution of technology is a major 
risk for any large scale retail focussed 
business.
Angel One is an agile 
organisation which 
keeps developing its tech 
stack, either through 
internal resources or by 
collaborating with domain 
experts.
Positive: State-of-the-art 
tech infrastructure helps 
build scalable businesses with 
greater efficiencies.
Negative: Technology 
obsolescence may lead to 
degradation of business.
4	
Social 
Responsibility
Opportunity
Angel one is committed to the 
empowerment of society as its 
important constituent, by helping 
the marginalised. The organisation 
fulfils its commitment towards its 
stakeholders by contributing to nation 
building, in the form of transparent 
disclosures. Ensuring responsible 
use of finite resources is another 
aspect of socio-economic sustainable 
development.
Not applicable
Positive: Social empowerment 
initiatives helps build strong 
relationships with all our 
stakeholders.

6. 
Performance of the entity against the specific commitments, goals and targets along-with reasons in case the same 
are not met:
P1
Ethics, Transparency and Accountability: Our policy on Corporate Governance is based on the principles of full disclosure, fairness, 
equity, transparency and accountability in various aspects of its functioning, leading to the protection of stakeholders’ interest and 
an enduring relationship with them. The Management’s commitment to these principles is reinforced through the adherence of all 
Corporate Governance practices as mandated by the regulations. We have a strong governance framework in place with various 
Board committees chaired by and constituted of Independent Directors. Our Board, through the Audit Committee, oversees our 
compliance framework. We have adopted various policies and procedures related to internal compliance, including a code of practice 
and procedure for fair disclosure of unpublished price sensitive information, anti-bribery and anti corruption policies, anti-money 
laundering, vigil mechanism and whistleblower policies.
P2
The Company believes that technology plays a very important role in delivering services on a sustainable basis via a safe and secure 
environment. The Company has been on the forefront of tech adoption in different eras to ensure continually improving customer 
experience. Data privacy and system uptime are critical factors to measure this experience. To achieve this objective the Company 
has completely digitised its end-to-end customer experience, from acquisition to on-boarding, engagement, execution and post trade 
services.
Statutory Reports
P3
Employee wellbeing: Our employee wellbeing activities span across the entire life cycle of our employees. Some of the finer aspects of 
this are enlisted below:
Strengthening Hiring: We leveraged our massive social media presence to represent Angel One as the new home for techies. We have 
seen tremendous growth in the engineering talent traffic on our social media pages. Employee referrals are one of the most effective 
and popular modes of hiring.
Promoting Diversity: Diversifying the pipeline by actively sourcing candidates. The team goes beyond the “obvious” sources and aims 
to send one email or set up one coffee per week with a different type of profile. We have ended up uncovering many star employees 
months later through this method. Adapted our recruitment forms and assessments to be more inclusive of transgender people. 
Our Campus Hiring program guarantees the diversity of our employees, as young women bring new perspectives and up-to-date 
information to the table, which helps everyone in their work.
Caring for People: The health and well-being of our people remains a priority. Targeted wellness support is provided to employees 
and local leadership teams across locations. We have also appointed happiness coaches to address any mental health issues our 
employees might be facing. We also promote good health through various programmes like Zumba and yoga. To enable our people 
to deal with the pandemic, we offer 14 days of leave to those testing positive and special leave to the caregivers of infected family 
members. We have covered our employees and their family members under our vaccination drive. We have collaborated with Zariyaa 
in association with Your DOST, India’s first and largest online mental health and emotional wellness coach, to be the employees' 
confidante.
Engaging with Employees: Feedback from all Angelites - old, current and new, all genders, minorities and age brackets - is important 
to this process. Therefore, we roll out an Engagement eNPS survey every quarter and based on the feedback received, we plan and 
execute corrective actions. We conducted our Employer Brand audit in July, 2021, to understand how much pride our people feel in 
being an Angelite and what makes them so.
Learning and Development: Our learning and development initiatives are focused on bespoke leadership journeys to support and 
enable leaders across the employee lifecycle, achieved through our Leadership Accelerator Program (New Leader Onboarding). We 
have meticulously crafted a 90-day journey, focused on Mindset-Skillset-Toolset to set new leaders up for success. The programme 
includes Team-based Assimilation designed to accelerate communication, clarify ways of working and align the purpose between the 
new leader and their team. The program has garnered a lot of positive feedback as it has helped new and young leaders from diverse 
backgrounds settle in as an impactful leader at Angel One, ready to talk and walk the strategy. Our managerial skill development journey 
is focussed on CORE manager behaviours that reinforce how great managers build great teams.
P4
The Company believes that a sustainable business should have its foremost responsibility towards all its stakeholders which includes 
its customers, employees, investors, financiers, services providers, regulators, government and public at large. The Company is 
committed to enhance the value of its stakeholders universe, having implemented a strong corporate governance framework through 
the various mandated and voluntary policies.
P5
The Company advocates strong adherence to human rights for all its employees and other stakeholders. This is governed through the 
various policies instituted to protect the integrity of all such stakeholders. The Company practices a strong performance oriented 
culture with zero tolerance towards discrimination in any form.
P6
Within the ambit of its financial services business, the Company respects and upholds the sustainability of the environment by being 
a responsible consumer of limited natural resources. The Company operates under a completely digital model, therefore eliminating 
substantial usage of depleting natural resources like paper and fossil fuels. The responsibility towards preserving the environment 
is part of the core philosophy of the business; and the Company strives towards attaining this objective with environmentally 
sustainable processes, policies and practices. The Company ensures optimum usage of energy by installing energy efficient electronic 
equipments. The Work from Anywhere Policy of the Company enables the employees to work from desired locations, thus saving their 
precious time and limiting carbon footprint.
The Company further takes care to responsibly dispose-off/ recycle the e-waste generated by it to protect the environment.
P7
Not applicable
P8
Inclusive growth: The Company strives to be a socially responsible Company and strongly believes in development, which is beneficial 
for the society at large, as a part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiatives. Through the CSR programme, your Company 
sets the goal of reaching a balance that integrates human, environmental and community resources. By means of integrating and 
embedding CSR into its business operations and participating proactively in CSR initiatives, your Company intends to contribute 
continuously to global sustainable development efforts
P9
The Company has processes to track key performance indicators such as NPS, eNPS, stakeholder complaints etc., since no mandated 
commitments, goals and targets are present for the same.
