Case Details
Name of the regulatory/ enforcement 
agencies/ judicial institutions
In connection with fine levied by NSE and BSE for non-
appointment of Independent Directors, as stated in the 
previous question, since the power to appoint Directors on 
the Board of the Company vests with the President of India, 
acting through the Administrative Ministry i.e., Department 
of Telecommunications (DoT), Government of India, therefore 
the Company has been requesting the appointing authority, 
i.e., DoT, for appointment of requisite number of Independent 
Directors. The Company has no control in the appointment of 
Directors. In view of the same, the Company had requested / 
is requesting the stock exchanges to waive off the said fines.
