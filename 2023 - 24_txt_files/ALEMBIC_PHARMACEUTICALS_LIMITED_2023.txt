Financial Impacts (Negative 
or Positive)
1. 	 Human Rights
Risk
Human rights exert a 
substantial influence on 
the entire supply chain and 
can significantly damage a 
company's reputation and 
public relations if violated. 
Consequently, this underscores 
the importance of this topic for 
the Company.
The Company has shifted its focus towards 
creating an enabling, supportive, and 
safe environment for its employees. 
Additionally, it has implemented a 
policy to prevent sexual harassment and 
established a robust grievance redressal 
mechanism to address violations of 
human rights.
Costs incurred in 
implementing systems to 
ensure adherence to human 
rights principles may pose 
negative implications, 
including financial burdens 
and operational disruptions. 
However, investing in these 
systems can yield positive 
outcomes such as enhanced 
reputation, increased 
consumer trust, and improved 
employee morale and 
productivity.
2. 	 Product Quality 
and Safety
Risk
With heightened regulatory 
constraints on product quality 
to safeguard consumer safety, 
it is imperative to comply with 
them rigorously to prioritize 
consumer-centricity.
The Company prioritizes its quality 
commitments, fostering an environment 
where everyone embraces a culture of 
quality to produce responsible work. 
Alembic has consistently invested in 
initiatives to enhance quality across 
its plants, ensuring compliance with 
international standards and regulations.
This dedication leads to 
positive implications such as 
increased customer loyalty 
and acceptance.
3. 	 R&D and 
Innovation
Opportunity
In today's market, there are 
numerous opportunities to 
create innovative solutions 
and cater to customer needs. 
By proactively engaging in 
research and development 
(R&D), companies can enhance 
operational efficiency, 
productivity, and accuracy.
Alembic's R&D teams remain updated on 
the latest product development tools and 
technologies to gain a competitive edge 
in the market. Additionally, the company 
has made substantial investments to 
strengthen R&D capabilities in various 
high-growth and high-value therapy areas.
This results in a positive 
impact, including increased 
productivity and the 
development of new products.

4. 	 Digital Business 
model and 
digitization
Opportunity
With the rapid advancement 
of technology and innovation, 
the pharmaceutical industry 
is witnessing a significant 
shift towards digitization. This 
transformation is expected to 
revolutionize various aspects 
of the industry, including the 
emergence of e-pharmacies, 
digital clinical trials, digital 
pills, artificial intelligence tools, 
and the production of precise 
medicines
Alembic is actively embracing this digital 
evolution by focusing on digitizing its 
operations. To achieve this goal, the 
company has developed a detailed digital 
blueprint, which will be implemented in a 
phased manner.
The adoption of digital 
technologies is anticipated 
to yield several positive 
outcomes, including 
enhanced precision, increased 
efficiency, improved quality, 
and enhanced productivity 
throughout the organization.
5. 	 Pharmacovigil-
ance
Risk
Pharmacovigilance is 
intrinsically linked with 
pharmaceutical products' 
hazards, necessitating diligent 
monitoring of their effects to 
identify adverse reactions. This 
monitoring is paramount for 
ensuring patient safety.
To this end, the Company has 
established a dedicated portal for 
reporting side effects of its products, 
facilitating the systematic recording 
of Pharmacovigilance risks post drug 
administration. Additionally, a customer 
care number is provided on the portal 
for individuals to report Adverse Drug 
Reactions (ADR) promptly. Furthermore, 
Corrective Action and Preventive Action 
(CAPA) protocols are enforced for each 
ADR incident, incorporating measures 
such as change control and impact 
analysis.
Despite the imperative nature 
of these measures, there may 
be negative implications, 
primarily stemming from the 
additional costs associated 
with monitoring and tracking 
procedures.
6. 	 Clinical Trial 
Conduct
Risk
Clinical trials are pivotal 
in advancing medical 
science, developing novel 
treatments, and safeguarding 
patient welfare. Compliance 
with stringent regulatory 
frameworks is imperative to 
uphold integrity and mitigate 
risks that could adversely 
impact the Company's 
reputation.
The Company diligently ensures 
adherence to all regulatory stipulations 
throughout the clinical trial lifecycle, 
encompassing comprehensive protocols, 
informed consent acquisition from 
participants, prioritization of patient 
safety, preservation of data integrity, and 
protection of participant confidentiality.
While implementing 
these measures may entail 
additional expenditures, 
they are indispensable for 
upholding ethical standards 
and ensuring the reliability 
and success of clinical trials as 
negative implications.

7. 	 Resilient Business 
Performance
Risk
Disruptions to business 
operations can stem from 
various sources such as shifts 
in the business landscape, 
evolving regulatory 
requirements, and natural 
or man-made disasters. 
Therefore, it is crucial for 
a Company to establish a 
robust business continuity 
and resilience mechanism to 
ensure uninterrupted business 
performance.
To address these challenges, we have 
implemented a comprehensive risk 
management mechanism aimed at 
effectively identifying and managing 
emerging risks. This includes the 
development of mitigating strategies to 
address potential threats. Additionally, 
we have formulated and implemented a 
Business Continuity Plan (BCP). This plan 
delineates specific emergency scenarios 
and outlines a structured approach for 
response, rescue, and recovery efforts. 
Initially implemented for our formulation 
unit, we are in the process of extending 
this plan to cover our other facilities in the 
future.
Despite the importance of 
these preparedness measures, 
there may be negative 
implications associated with 
the expenditure required for 
their implementation.
8. 	 Human Resource 
Development
Opportunity
In today's rapidly changing 
technological landscape and 
with the availability of highly 
skilled and knowledgeable 
workers, it has become crucial 
for organizations to focus on 
developing and retaining the 
right talent to ensure effective 
and profitable operations.
Alembic recognizes the 
importance of talent 
development and has 
implemented a comprehensive 
learning management system 
(LMS) designed to provide 
essential training modules to 
all employees.
Moreover, the company emphasizes the 
nurturing of internal talent for leadership 
roles through skill enhancement 
programs.
By investing in the professional 
growth of our workforce, we 
anticipate an improvement 
in productivity and efficiency, 
which will ultimately 
contribute to the overall 
success of the organization as 
positive implications.

9. 	 Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
A sustainable supply 
chain is essential for long-
term business success, 
environmental stewardship, 
and social well-being. By 
integrating sustainability 
into supply chain strategies, 
companies can realize 
numerous benefits, including 
cost savings, risk mitigation, 
enhanced brand value, and 
competitive advantage. 
However, any violation of 
environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) principles 
within the supply chain can 
result in the loss of business 
from reputable customers 
and damage to the company's 
reputation.
To address these challenges, our company 
has implemented comprehensive 
procedures known as 'sustainability 
assurance across the value chain.' This 
involves assessing critical suppliers on ESG 
parameters using two primary methods:
1. Audit Method: Through on-site audits, 
we evaluate our major suppliers on 
sustainability parameters and assign 
ratings. These ratings inform procurement 
activities such as contract renewal.
2. Checklist Method: Sustainability data 
is collected from suppliers through a 
checklist, allowing us to rate them based 
on their adherence to sustainability 
criteria.
While these measures ensure 
sustainability across our supply 
chain, there are associated 
costs involved. However, we 
believe that these investments 
are necessary to uphold our 
commitment to sustainability 
and maintain the trust of our 
stakeholders, thus adhering 
positive implications.
10. 	Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Community engagement is 
vital for fostering trust and 
minimizing conflicts within the 
community. It is imperative 
for a company to align with 
community needs and provide 
comprehensive support.
Alembic actively collaborates with 
various communities based on their 
expressed requirements. The Alembic 
Group has established, nurtured, and 
promoted several non-profit organizations 
focusing on three key areas: education, 
healthcare, and rural development, aimed 
at enhancing the well-being of rural 
populations.
Consequently, positive 
implications arise, including 
an enhanced reputation and 
increased goodwill within the 
community.

11.	Business Ethics 
& Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Ethical conduct in both 
internal operations and 
external engagements is a 
cornerstone of sustainable 
business practices.
The Company has instituted a robust 
policy framework addressing ethics, 
bribery, and corruption, ensuring 
adherence to high standards of integrity 
and transparency across all facets of its 
operations. Our organizational ethos 
underscores the values of patience and 
perseverance, motivating our team and 
partners to pursue excellence while 
upholding ethical principles and fostering 
a culture of good governance.
These concerted efforts 
contribute to maintaining 
our reputation and 
trustworthiness in the business 
landscape without significant 
positive financial implications.
12. 	Availability and 
affordability of 
medicine
Risk
The pricing and availability of 
medicines entail a complex 
process influenced by various 
factors. Balancing the need to 
make medicines affordable for 
customers with maintaining 
a competitive edge in the 
market presents a significant 
challenge.
In response to this challenge, Alembic 
is dedicated to enhancing global health 
by providing affordable, high-quality 
generic medicines. Through consistent 
efforts, Alembic strives to improve access 
to essential medications while upholding 
stringent quality standards.
Furthermore, Alembic is committed to 
strengthening its Intellectual Capital by 
prioritizing innovation. By developing a 
portfolio of high-quality and cost-effective 
medicines, Alembic aims to meet the 
evolving needs of patients worldwide.
While these endeavors may 
initially incur certain costs 
and complexities, they are 
expected to yield positive 
outcomes in the long run. 
Anticipated benefits include 
an expanded market share 
and continued growth and 
development within the 
pharmaceutical industry.
13. Biodiversity
Risk
Being recognized as a 
responsible corporate citizen 
entails aligning with the 
preservation and sustainability 
of biodiversity. The company 
acknowledges the significance 
of maintaining harmony with 
its surrounding biodiversity.
To uphold this commitment, the Company 
prioritizes efforts aimed at nurturing 
and preserving biodiversity. Through 
various initiatives, the company seeks to 
minimize the impact of its operations on 
the surrounding environment, thereby 
safeguarding biodiversity.
While these initiatives require 
investments and resources, 
they are essential for the 
protection and preservation 
of biodiversity. Thus, while 
there may be associated 
costs, the Company remains 
dedicated to fulfilling its 
environmental responsibilities 
and contributing positively 
to biodiversity conservation 
efforts.

14. 	Waste 
Management
Risk
Given the nature of the 
industry, waste generation 
is an inevitable aspect of 
the Company's operations. 
However, irresponsible waste 
management practices, 
such as improper disposal 
or incineration of hazardous 
waste, can have detrimental 
effects on the environment.
To address this issue, the Company has 
implemented several measures aimed at 
ensuring responsible waste management:
The Company has established a robust 
mechanism for diverting high-calorific 
waste to the cement industry for co-
processing. This approach helps minimize 
environmental impact by utilizing waste as 
an alternative fuel source in cement kilns.
Additionally, the Company has 
implemented recycling initiatives for both 
products and waste materials. A special 
drive has been launched to collect plastic 
waste from neighbouring villages, which is 
then recycled and used in the production 
of recycled plastic materials.
Moreover, the Company is committed 
to adopting sustainable practices in its 
packaging materials. Approximately 50% 
of the cardboard boxes used in packaging 
are made from recycled materials, 
reducing the reliance on virgin resources 
and minimizing environmental footprint.
While these initiatives 
contribute positively to 
environmental sustainability, 
it's important to acknowledge 
that there are associated 
costs incurred in handling 
and safely disposing of waste. 
Despite the potential negative 
implications in terms of 
costs, the Company remains 
committed to its responsible 
waste management practices 
as part of its broader 
environmental stewardship 
efforts.

15. 	Climate Change 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Given the increasing focus 
on climate change and 
sustainable practices, it is 
crucial to acknowledge the 
significance of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and their 
impact on the environment.
Managing GHG emissions involves 
navigating through a complex and 
scattered process, which can pose critical 
risks if not properly addressed.
To tackle this challenge, the Company 
has developed extensive plans aimed 
at reducing its GHG emissions. These 
initiatives include:
•	
Internal utilization of solar power 
to reduce reliance on conventional 
energy sources.
•	
Installation of windmills to harness 
renewable energy.
•	
Procurement of renewable power 
for its operations, further reducing 
carbon footprint.
•	
Implementation of efficiency 
measures across its manufacturing 
sites to optimize energy

16. 	Employee Health 
and Safety
Risk
Employees and workers within 
the Company are routinely 
exposed to hazardous 
chemicals and substances, 
which may pose health risks if 
not properly managed.
To address these challenges, the Company 
has implemented comprehensive 
measures aimed at safeguarding the 
health and well-being of its workforce. 
These initiatives include:
•	
Implementation of an Environmental 
Health and Safety (EHS) policy, 
providing a comprehensive 
framework for various environmental-
related systems and processes.
•	
Establishment of dedicated EHS 
personnel at all sites to oversee the 
implementation of safety policies and 
programs.
•	
Provision of physical classroom 
training to all employees on relevant 
EHS topics.
•	
Conducting periodic medical 
checkups for both employees and 
contractual workers to monitor their 
health status.
•	
Regular conduct of robust risk 
assessment exercises to identify and 
mitigate EHS risks effectively.
•	
Provision of appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) to 
employees based on their job roles.
• 	
Adherence to strict Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
chemical handling to minimize risks.
• 	
Continuous efforts to identify and 
address unsafe acts and conditions in 
the workplace.
While these initiatives are 
essential for ensuring the 
safety of employees and 
mitigating EHS risks, they may 
lead to increased operational 
costs associated with safety 
training programs and the 
provision of protective gear. 
However, these investments 
are necessary to uphold the 
company's commitment 
to workplace safety and 
regulatory compliance 
thus adhering to positive 
implications.

17. 	Energy 
Management
Risk
Efficient utilization of energy 
resources is essential for 
managing costs and alleviating 
environmental burdens, 
particularly amid increasing 
concerns about climate 
change.
Recognizing this imperative, Alembic has 
made significant investments in renewable 
energy initiatives, including:
Expansion of solar energy capacity 
through the installation of rooftop solar 
panels and commissioning of 12 MW solar 
plant in the FY 23-24.
Deployment of windmills to bolster the 
proportion of renewable energy sources in 
its energy mix.
Moreover, the company is actively 
engaged in the development of flow 
chemistry techniques for its production 
processes, aiming to enhance yield and 
reduce energy consumption.
While these endeavours 
may entail increased costs 
associated with fuel and 
capital expenditure on 
energy-efficient equipment 
in the short term, they are 
anticipated to yield positive 
financial outcomes in the long 
run through reduced energy 
expenses.
18. 	Water 
Management
Risk
The mismanagement of 
water resources can result in 
adverse outcomes such as 
excessive consumption and 
the discharge of toxins, which 
not only pose regulatory risks 
but also invite stakeholder 
activism and the potential 
shutdown of operations. 
Given the indispensability of 
water across various activities 
like heating, cooling, and 
manufacturing processes, 
ensuring a consistent water 
supply is paramount.
Alembic is committed to responsible water 
management through several initiatives:
•	
Conversion to Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) at all API sites and utilization 
of treated effluents in industrial 
processes and gardening at 
formulation units.
•	
Implementation of groundwater 
restoration measures, including 
the construction of charging wells 
with ongoing efforts to expand this 
infrastructure.
•	
Efficient utilization of wastewater by 
repurposing domestic treated water 
for gardening and industrial treated 
water for boilers and chillers.
•	
Construction of artificial ponds at 
select sites to enhance rainwater 
harvesting capabilities.
While these efforts incur costs 
associated with handling 
and safe disposal, the 
company remains dedicated 
to mitigating environmental 
risks and promoting positive 
sustainable water stewardship.

includes procedures for the recovery of spent solvents, which are then sold for reuse, minimizing waste generation. 
Additionally, high-calorific value waste is directed to cement industries for co-processing, while boiler ash is sent to 
brick manufacturing units in accordance with waste management regulations. Used oil is responsibly sent for recycling 
to further reduce environmental impact. Furthermore, we collaborate with third-party agencies to collect plastic 
waste from end consumers, ensuring its proper disposal or recycling. This comprehensive approach underscores our 
commitment to reducing the usage of hazardous chemicals and effectively managing associated waste.
