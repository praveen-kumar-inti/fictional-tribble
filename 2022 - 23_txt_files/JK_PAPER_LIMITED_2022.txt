Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
The Company ensures responsible waste management practices involving 100% consumer/pre-consumer plastic waste as per EPR 
regulations. Lignin from wood and Wood dust is used as bio-fuel (75% of total energy requirement) in boilers for energy generation. 
Effluent sludge (brown and white) is used for low quality board/papermaking and carbon dioxide emissions are collected and 
used for making Calcium Carbonate used as high-quality filler in paper. Fly ash generated is used for brick making for internal 
use. Elemental chlorine free (ECF) technique is adopted which uses chlorine dioxide for the bleaching of wood pulp. It does not 
use elemental chlorine gas during the bleaching process and thus prevents the formation of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, 
carcinogens.

Production of SPCC with 
flue gas and lime
The Process of Producing SPCC involves the 
following steps, 1. Feeding Process: - Quick lime 
(Cao) pebbles feeding to the lime Silo by using a 
Feeding system. 2. Slacking & Screening Process: 
- Water & Quicklime are mixed in the slaker to 
make Hydrate slurry. This process involved the 
following exothermic reaction. Cao + H2O ïƒ 
Ca (OH)2 3. Carbonation & Screening Process: 
Hydrate Slurry added in the Pressure Reactor. 
Flue gas from JK’s Lime Kiln is purified to remove 
all particulates as well as all Sox and NOx. The 
cleaned flue gas is then injected to the lime 
slurry. The CO2 in the flue gas then reacts with 
the lime slurry to produce calcium carbonate 
while allowing CO2 free gas to escape. Once the 
conditions indicating the end of the reaction, 
the SPCC product is drained from the reactor 
and screened by 325# mesh & transfer to the 
product tank. This process involved the following 
exothermic reaction. Ca (OH)2 + CO2 ïƒ  CaCO3 
+ H2O This SPCC product is then provided to JK 
to incorporate into their paper products, thus 
sequestering the CO2 into a marketable product
Approx. 1,83,43,793 m3 
of flue gas is used in 
the 
SPCC 
production 
from Recovery lime kiln 
according to the last 
financial 
year. 
During 
this time, approximately 
4,358 metric tons of CO2 
has been sequestered 
from process
