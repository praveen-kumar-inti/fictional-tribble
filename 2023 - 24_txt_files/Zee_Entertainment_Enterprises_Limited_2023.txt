misuse and legal/ethical issues, 
potentially causing reputational 
harm, penalties, and financial 
losses.
Data Privacy:

• 
Increasing spectrum of 
cybersecurity threats, ranging 
from conventional hacking 
techniques, sophisticated 
phishing & more advanced 
and emerging threats such as

bring significant consequences, 
including operational disruptions, 
data exposure, legal liabilities, and 
reputation damage.
• 
Increased Content Piracy hinders 
revenue generation through 
legitimate channels such as 
subscriptions, pay-per-view, and 
advertising, resulting in financial

reducing the likelihood of 
breaches and mitigating potential 
consequences. This proactive 
approach not only safeguards

creativity, enhances consumer 
trust, and sustains the growth 
of the media and entertainment

Employee 
Engagement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Across the linear and digital media 
ecosystems, the 'War for Talent' goes 
on unabated. The linear ecosystem 
continues to witness significant 
talent poaching while the continuing 
investments in the digital space has 
led to escalating cost and talent 
retention pressure. It is crucial to 
mitigate the risks of losing our talent 
and the domain knowledge built, by 
deploying multi-pronged approaches.
Opportunity:
Identify and leverage various 
avenues to engage with employees 
and provide them opportunities 
within the organization that cater to 
their individual needs, wants and 
motivators, while meeting the larger 
organization goals.
The organization’s risk mitigation 
strategy for talent development and 
retention focuses on building a brand 
across functions through –
• Deployment of Industry best 
practices tailored to our context.

communication with an intent to 
understand employee morale 
and take proactive steps to retain 
talent.
• Comprehensive Rewards & 
Recognition (R&R) programs that 
allow for timely identification and 
engagement of high potential 
talent.
• Encourage operating through a 
Competency framework cutting 
across businesses, allowing 
for talent movement across job 
families.
• Pioneering an L&D Strategy aimed 
at identification of employee 
level developmental goals and 
training programs and continuous 
upskilling of the workforce.
Positive implications: 
Retention of talent.
Negative implications: 
Increase attrition 
possibilities lead to wages 
inflation and loss of 
continuity.

Media Pluralism
Risk, 
Opportunity
Media pluralism refers to diversity 
in media ownership, independent 
editorial boards, channels, titles, or 
programs, social, racial/ethnic, gender 
and political diversity represented in 
media content.
Risk: Due to the nature of business 
being competitive, there could be 
a potential change in customer 
preferences when consuming 
content. This could lead to a possible 
decline in viewership.
Opportunity:
Online streaming of content is 
increasingly becoming an important 
medium of enhancing content 
accessibility for consumers.
Understanding customer preferences 
can lead to attraction and retention 
of a significant amount of audience, 
thereby enabling higher viewership 
of media.
Implementation of various 
subscription models and providing 
exclusive content can lead to revenue 
generation and build a loyal customer 
base.
• Established framework and design 
to address change in content 
preferences.
• Deeper, richer understanding of 
social and cultural diversity across 
regions, leading to more relevant 
content design for diverse life 
stages of our viewers, in each 
market.
• Soul to screen method to create 
success on linear and digital.
• Content design to appeal to young 
and mid-life TV audiences.
• Insight and Data led Content 
design and Optimization.
• Analytics driven planning for 
content discovery and delivery to 
increase market share.
• Continued investment in ZEE5 to 
leverage the digital opportunity 
and offer consumers access 
to content through plurality of 
economic models (AVOD/SVOD/
TVOD) and content diversity.
• Impact launches in Hindi and foray 
into regional market to expand our 
offering in regional languages.
• While social media is becoming 
increasingly concentrated to a few 
big platforms, Hipi- ZEEL’s home-
grown short video app, helps 
add to pluralism by providing 
opportunities to the creator 
community for content creation 
and monetization.
Positive implication: 
constantly staying 
connected to viewers and 
customer’s expectations.
Negative implication: 
content perception and 
performance.

Emission and

Opportunity
Opportunity:
• Identify areas of improvements 
and implement carbon reduction, 
resource efficiency, energy saving 
& cost saving initiatives.
• Prepare organization’s carbon 
footprints including value chain to 
develop a robust climate strategy 
and a Net Zero road map.
Not applicable
Positive implication:
