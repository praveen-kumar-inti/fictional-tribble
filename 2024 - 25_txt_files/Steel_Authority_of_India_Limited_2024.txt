1
 Water 
Use and 
Recycling
Opportunity
Water is a vital resource 
in steel manufacturing. 
Efficient water use not 
only ensures regulatory 
compliance but also 
reduces operational costs 
and enhances long-term 
sustainability.
SAIL is actively pursuing “Zero Liquid Discharge” 
(ZLD) across all integrated steel plants. This 
involves deploying advanced effluent treatment 
technologies and water recycling systems. 
These efforts reduce freshwater dependency, 
lower effluent discharge costs, and improve 
environmental performance, which can attract 
sustainability-linked financing and improve investor 
confidence.
Positive
2.
 Waste 
Management 
(Slag, Dust, 
Plastics)
Opportunity
Industrial waste, if 
managed effectively, 
can be transformed 
into valuable resources. 
Recycling slag, dust, 
and plastics reduces 
environmental impact and 
creates economic value
SAIL has implemented systems to segregate, reuse, 
and monetize waste. BF Slag is used in cement 
manufacturing, dust is recycled in sinter plants, and 
plastics are handled through authorized recyclers. 
These practices reduce landfill costs, generate 
revenue from byproduct sales, and contribute 
to circular economy goals, enhancing SAIL’s ESG 
profile.

Greenhouse 
Gas 
Emissions 
& Carbon 
Footprint
Opportunity
Reducing emissions 
aligns with global climate 
goals and enhances SAIL’s 
competitiveness in green 
steel markets. It also 
opens doors to carbon 
credits, green bonds, 
and sustainability-linked 
incentives.
SAIL is actively advancing its decarbonization 
agenda across integrated steel plants through 
key technological interventions such as CDQ, 
TRT, CDI, and Waste Heat Recovery systems to 
enhance energy efficiency and reduce fossil fuel 
dependence. The deployment of walking beam 
reheating furnaces is optimizing rolling mill 
operations. On the renewable energy front, SAIL 
aims to scale its capacity to 384 MW by FY 2028–29, 
transition to LED lighting, and pilot green hydrogen 
in steelmaking. R&D efforts are focused on CCUS, 
low-carbon technologies in collaboration with IITs, 
and slag utilization to curb indirect emissions. These 
initiatives are guided by a phased decarbonization 
roadmap, participation in the PAT scheme, and 
alignment with the National Green Hydrogen 
Mission—underscoring SAIL’s commitment to 
sustainable steel production and national climate 
objectives.
 Positive
4
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Ensuring the health and 
safety of employees is 
critical to maintaining 
uninterrupted operations, 
reducing liability, and 
complying with legal 
standards. Workplace 
incidents can lead to 
downtime, reputational 
damage, and financial 
penalties.
SAIL has adopted the ISO 45001:2018 Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System across 
all plants. Regular internal and external audits, 
safety drills, and training programs are conducted. 
A dedicated Board Sub-Committee on Health, 
Safety & Environment monitors performance 
quarterly, driving continuous improvement and 
accountability.
Despite the 
implementation of 
robust safety protocols, 
SAIL remains exposed 
to the risk of workplace 
accidents, which can 
result in operational 
disruptions, legal 
liabilities, and financial 
penalties. Any such 
incidents may also lead 
to reputational damage, 
adversely affecting 
stakeholder trust
5
Employee 
Training and 
Development
Opportunity
A skilled and future-ready 
workforce enhances 
operational efficiency, 
fosters innovation, 
and supports business 
continuity. It also improves 
employee retention and 
engagement.
SAIL runs structured skill development programs 
focused on emerging technologies, process 
optimization, and leadership development. These 
initiatives are aligned with SAIL’s modernization 
and digital transformation goals, helping reduce 
operational errors and improve productivity.
 Positive
6
 Human 
Rights
Risk
With a large and diverse 
workforce across 
multiple states, any 
lapse in human rights 
compliance can result in 
reputational damage, legal 
consequences, and loss of 
stakeholder trust.
SAIL strictly adheres to ILO conventions and 
national labor laws. SAIL  ensures fair wages, safe 
working conditions, and equal opportunities. 
Grievance redressal mechanisms are in place at 
multiple levels, allowing employees to report 
concerns confidentially. Regular training and audits 
reinforce ethical practices and compliance.
Lapses in human rights 
compliance can result 
in regulatory fines and 
penalties for labor 
law violations, while 
operational costs may 
increase due to work 
stoppages, protests, 
or employee unrest. 
Additionally, such 
incidents can cause 
reputational damage 
and erode stakeholder 
trust.
7
Business 
Ethics and 
Anti-
Corruption
Opportunity
Ethical governance is 
foundational to long-term 
business sustainability. 
It fosters transparency, 
reduces exposure to 
legal and regulatory risks, 
and builds trust with 
investors, partners, and 
communities.
SAIL has institutionalized a strong ethical 
framework, including a comprehensive Code 
of Conduct, Whistleblower Policy, and Anti-
Corruption Guidelines. Regular training, internal 
audits, and compliance reviews are conducted 
to ensure adherence. These practices enhance 
stakeholder confidence, reduce litigation risk, 
and improve access to ESG-linked capital.

AI & 
Digitalization 
in Operations
Opportunity
As digitalization 
increases, the risk of 
cyber threats and data 
breaches becomes more 
pronounced. A single 
breach can lead to 
financial loss, reputational 
damage, and regulatory 
penalties.
SAIL has implemented a robust Information 
Technology Security Policy that governs data 
privacy, cyber protection, and digital asset 
management. The company conducts regular 
vulnerability assessments, employee training, 
and infrastructure upgrades. These measures 
help prevent breaches, ensure business 
continuity, and maintain compliance with 
evolving data protection laws.
Data privacy breaches 
and cybersecurity 
incidents can lead to 
regulatory fines for 
non-compliance with 
data protection laws, 
reputational damage. 
Additionally, such 
incidents can disrupt 
operations, requiring 
significant expenditure 
on system recovery, 
infrastructure upgrades, 
and emergency 
response measures.

comprehensive strategy to reduce particulate matter (PM) 
emissions across its integrated steel plants. This includes 
upgrading pollution control systems by installing advanced 
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), bag filters, wet scrubbers, 
and dry fog systems. Process optimization measures such as 
Top Pressure Recovery Turbines (TRT), Coal Dust Injection 
(CDI), and Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) are being adopted to 
minimize emissions. Infrastructure modernization involves 
commissioning taller coke oven batteries with CDQ and waste 
heat recovery, along with cleaner reheating furnaces. Material 
handling is being improved by enclosing conveyors and 
automating operations to reduce dust. Real-time monitoring 
is ensured through Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems 
(CEMS) integrated with a centralized MIS for compliance 
and audits. SAIL is also focusing on 100% utilization of blast 
furnace and BOF slag in construction applications to reduce 
dust from stockpiles. Green belt development is being 
expanded with native species to enhance dust capture and 
biodiversity. Employee engagement is promoted through 
regular environmental training and sustainability initiatives. 
Additionally, SAIL has partnered with BHP to explore 
innovative, low-emission steelmaking technologies using 
hydrogen and biochar, supporting long-term decarbonization 
and PM reduction goals.
	•
Action plan for reduction in water consumption: SAIL is 
advancing a robust water conservation strategy to reduce 
specific water consumption in its integrated steel plants. The 
approach centers on maximizing water recycling through 
closed-loop systems, reverse osmosis, and membrane 
bioreactors, along with cascading water use across processes. 
Traditional cooling systems are being replaced with 
evaporative towers and air-cooled exchangers, while dry 
quenching and high-efficiency descaling are cutting water 
use at the source. Smart sensors, flow meters, and regular 
audits ensure real-time monitoring and rapid leak detection. 
Rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge structures are 
being scaled across facilities. Employee awareness programs 
promote conservation culture, while R&D collaborations 
with IITs and CSIR are piloting low-water steelmaking and 
alternative cooling technologies. These efforts support SAIL’s 
broader goals of sustainability, cost efficiency, and zero-liquid 
discharge.
	•
Action plan for reducing CO2 emission: SAIL is pursuing an 
aggressive decarbonization strategy to reduce CO₂ emissions 
in its integrated steel plants. Key technological upgrades 
include CDQ, TRT, CDI, WHR systems, all aimed at improving 
energy efficiency and cutting fossil fuel use. Walking beam 
reheating furnaces are being deployed to optimize rolling 
mill operations. On the renewable front, SAIL is expanding 
RE to 384 MW by 2028–29, transitioning to LED lighting, and 
piloting green hydrogen for steelmaking. R&D efforts focus 
on Carbon Capture, Utilization & Storage (CCUS), low-carbon 
technologies in collaboration with IITs, and slag utilization to 
reduce indirect emissions. These initiatives are backed by a 
phased decarbonization roadmap, active participation in the 
PAT scheme, and alignment with the National Green Hydrogen 
Mission—reinforcing SAIL’s commitment to sustainable steel 
production and India’s climate goals.

Not applicable.
	
Steel is highly recyclable and considered the world’s most recycled metal. Its durability and versatility allow widespread 
reuse and life extension. Its magnetic properties make it easy to separate from other materials for its recycling. 
It is genuinely cradle-to-cradle material, with end-of-life steel seen as an input rather than waste. Steel recycling is 
environmentally beneficial, conserving vital natural resources and reducing landfill waste. Recycling of steel is a 
sustainable practice that offers significant environmental and economic benefits, contributing to a more circular and 
resource-efficient economy. In FY 2024–25, over 1.41 million tonnes of scrap were effectively reused in the production 
cycle at SAIL Plants.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
SAIL recognizes that stakeholders are central to its inclusive growth agenda. The Company is committed to fostering 
strong, collaborative relationships with a diverse group of stakeholders, including government bodies, shareholders, 
employees, customers, suppliers, communities, NGOs, academic institutions, consultants, competitors, and financial 
entities.
	
SAIL has also established dedicated board-level subcommittees to address economic, environmental, and social matters. 
These subcommittees meet regularly to deliberate on key issues, with their recommendations escalated to the board for 
approval. A robust follow-up mechanism ensures that the board remains informed about the actions taken.
ANNUAL REPORT 
2024-25

SAIL’s Stakeholder Engagement Matrix provides a structured approach, anchored in three core principles:
	y
Completeness: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder concerns and expectations, and ensuring 
transparent, balanced reporting.
	y
Materiality: Prioritizing issues that are most significant to both stakeholders and the organization across economic, 
environmental, and social dimensions.
	y
Responsiveness: Addressing stakeholder concerns in a timely, coherent, and transparent manner.
	
SAIL employs a variety of engagement methods to connect with both internal and external stakeholders, actively 
capturing their expectations. Engagement is carried out through multiple channels—ranging from daily employee 
interactions to formal platforms like Annual General Meetings (AGMs). Regular interactions—particularly with 
suppliers—help identify key focus areas and strengthen mutual trust. Tools such as the Customer Satisfaction Index and 
Employee Satisfaction surveys are used to quantify feedback and assess engagement effectiveness. Insights gathered 
through these mechanisms are integrated into the Company’s medium- and long-term strategic planning.
	
Customer feedback also plays a critical role in shaping product enhancements and service innovations, supporting 
customer retention, market expansion, and overall business growth.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Yes, stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social 
topics. At SAIL we have conducted Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality Assessment for employees. Stakeholder 
engagement is an essential element for the sustainability strategy that helps the company to learn from its stakeholders 
to identify and manage risks, to build trust and strong relationships and to identify ways to improve its performance. We 
try to understand where business interests overlap with the sustainability priorities of a company’s stakeholders. Basis 
the surveys we have highlighted materiality topics and are taking into consideration.
	
The Company is also in the process of incorporating these into our policies and activities. This includes developing new 
policies and procedures, training employees, and reporting on our progress. Yes, stakeholder consultation is actively 
used by SAIL to support the identification and management of environmental and social topics.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
SAIL’s plants have consistently undertaken initiatives to support the development of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) 
through the organization of Vendor Development Programs (VDPs). In addition, Special Vendor Development Programs 
(SVDPs) have been conducted with a focused objective of fostering an enabling ecosystem for SC/ST entrepreneurs. 
These programs were organized in collaboration with the National SC-ST Hub Office (NSSHO), with active participation 
from the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DICCI) and the Tribal Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry 
(TICCI). During these sessions, participants were briefed on SAIL’s procurement processes, vendor registration procedures, 
and the specific provisions available for SC/ST and women-owned enterprises.
	
These engagements also serve to inform vendors about SAIL’s procurement requirements, items earmarked for SC/ST 
and women vendors, and the benefits extended to MSEs from these communities. SAIL has also actively participated in 
various conclaves organized by National SC ST Hub Office (NSSHO) to further promote entrepreneurship among SC/ST 
groups.
	
To enhance financial awareness, representatives from Invoice Mart are invited to select SVDPs to educate participants 
on the advantages of bill discounting through the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS). In FY 2024–25, SAIL 
successfully conducted 56 VDPs and 27 SVDPs across its plants.
	
Furthermore, SAIL plants provide ongoing support to local MSEs through mentoring, training, technical assistance, 
and capacity-building initiatives. To stimulate regional industrial development, SAIL also offers locally based MSMEs—
particularly those situated in the same districts as its five Integrated Steel Plants (ISPs)—access to steel at competitive 
and affordable rates, supported by favorable commercial terms.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
To prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in cases of discrimination and harassment, SAIL has implemented 
several robust mechanisms. We ensure confidentiality of the complainant’s identity and case details to protect their 
privacy and prevent retaliation. We provide support services, including counseling and legal advice, to help complainants 
cope with the situation. All complaints are investigated fairly, thoroughly, and promptly. Regular training sessions and 
awareness programs are conducted to foster a respectful workplace culture and educate employees about their rights 
and responsibilities. Whistleblower protection mechanisms are in place to ensure safe reporting without fear of reprisal. 
Through these measures, SAIL strives to maintain a safe, respectful, and supportive work environment for all employees. 
The mechanism is well laid in the Policy. For more details, refer to the Policy link (Policy for Prohibition, Prevention & 
Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace) https://sail.co.in/sites/default/files/upload/2022-06/Policy-for-

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
SAIL’s integrated strategy combines innovation, compliance, and resource efficiency to manage industrial and hazardous 
waste responsibly, reduce reliance on harmful substances and drive progress toward a circular economy and sustainable 
industrial future. SAIL is committed in its Corporate Environment Policy to minimize source-wise solid waste generation 
and maximise its utilisation to the tune of 100%. The 4Rs principle — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover — is widely 
applied at SAIL plants, enabling significant contributions toward sustainability
	
SAIL generates various by-products such as blast furnace (BF) slag, basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag, mill scale, flue 
dust and refractory waste, etc. These by-products are not treated as waste but are transformed into valuable resources 
through innovative processes. For instance, molten BF is fully granulated for utilization in the cement industry. On the 
other hand, BOF slag is used mainly internally through recycling it in BF & steel melting shop as partial replacement of 
limestone and in sinter making as base-mix. Solid wastes like mill scale and lime/dolo fines are recycled entirely through 
sinter making process and waste refractory bricks are fully utilized through either selling to external agencies or reusing 
internally. 
	
Recognizing the untapped potential of BOF slag, SAIL is investing heavily in R&D to develop advanced waste management 
techniques. Collaborative initiatives with renowned research institutes have paved the way for innovative applications, 
such as:
	y
Eco-Friendly Fertilizer Development:
	
In partnership with ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) under the Ministry of Steel, SAIL is exploring usage 
of BOF slag in developing cost-effective fertilizers. Slag Based Value Added Products (SSBVAPs) have been developed by 
IARI and these SSBVAPs are undergoing field trials at all the five ISPs of SAIL, demonstrating their potential for sustainable 
agriculture and soil improvement
Intelligent Steel Making the Future Green

	y
Paver Blocks Manufacturing:
	
Rourkela Steel Plant launched ‘Eco Brick’, an ecofriendly paver block manufacturing facility for utilizing BOF slag, to 
promote sustainability and waste utilization. The facility is equipped to produce high quality paver blocks with a 
concrete grade of M200 and a block thickness of 80 mm with a daily capacity of 1,000 blocks/day.
	
Durgapur Steel Plant has set up a unit for manufacture of paver blocks by using weathered BOF slag (0-5mm size) in 
place of river sand. As a measure for increasing solid waste utilization, Salem Steel Plant has also started making paver 
blocks by utilizing its EAF slag through outsourced agency.
	
This initiative significantly enhances slag utilization, reducing waste disposal challenges and supporting a circular 
economy in steel production.
	
SAIL’s operations adhere to the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 
and it is ensured that all hazardous waste is carefully inventoried, quantified, and either safely disposed of in captive 
secured landfills facility or through the authorized agencies. Wherever it is feasible, hazardous materials are reused/co-
processed, thereby promoting circularity and reducing dependency on virgin resources.
	
E-wastes and Battery waste are being disposed through authorized recyclers. Negligible quantity of construction & 
demolition waste is generated at some of the plants, which is internally utilized. During demolition/dismantling of 
specifically old structure/building, significant quantity of waste is generated which is disposed of through external 
agencies.
	
The Company also adheres to the EPR in plastic waste management. All SAIL Plants are registered with the CPCB under 
the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.

website: https://www.sail.co.in/en/products
2.	
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or 
services. 	
	
Steel is a widely used material across various sectors. In line with the National Steel Policy’s objective to enhance per 
capita steel consumption in India, SAIL organized around 400 “Gaon Ki Ore” workshops across the Country during the 
year. These workshops aimed to raise awareness and encourage the use of steel in rural and semi-urban areas.
	
In addition to these outreach efforts, SAIL actively participated in trade fairs and exhibitions related to the steel industry 
to further promote its products and applications.
	
To make product information more accessible, SAIL has provided a dedicated webpage where customers, end users, 
and the general public can explore the applications of specific steel products. The webpage can be accessed at: 
https://www.sail.co.in/en/application/bars-and-rods
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
In case of a disruption of essential service, SAIL informs its consumers via its Website, Stock Exchange notifications and 
or other social media channels. Besides that, our Marketing and customer management team regularly interacts with all 
our customers and dealers and gives intimation about any discontinuation of service.
4.	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey regarding consumer 
satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity 
or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, SAIL has implemented advanced product identification and traceability measures for items like TMT bars by 
introducing QR-coded stud welded tags on each bundle. These tags provide detailed product information and, in certain 
plants, link directly to chemical and physical properties via a mobile app. Similarly, products such as PM Plates carry data 
on size, grade, and technical delivery conditions directly on the product.
	
On November 4, 2023, SAIL successfully launched the “Made in India” branding and labeling initiative. In addition to 
standard labeling, a QR code is now affixed to products, which, when scanned, verifies the item’s authenticity through a 
secure server managed by the Quality Council of India. This system confirms key product details-such as manufacturing 
plant, size, grade, and heat number-offering enhanced assurance to customers and stakeholders.
	
SAIL also actively gathers customer feedback to improve service quality. Monthly Customer Satisfaction Reports 
are collected from all Key Account Customers, and service performance feedback is obtained at service points like 
warehouses. Additionally, customers can submit feedback online via SAIL’s website: Customer Feedback Form. Feedback 
covers both product attributes (e.g., quality, dimensional accuracy, surface finish, packaging) and service aspects (e.g., 
delivery order issuance, inquiry handling, credit note processing, and truck turnaround time at warehouses). For the 
current financial year, SAIL achieved a Customer Satisfaction Index score of 96.88, reflecting its strong commitment to 
quality and customer-centric service.
