The company has implemented various systems to encourage recycling and minimize waste 
generation. For instance, chemical wash water from seed treatment is recycled to address 
hazardous waste disposal. Maize shanks generated during dry cob shelling are repurposed 
for heat generation, helping achieve the necessary temperature for drying wet cobs while 
reducing energy use. Used chemical containers are also recycled to limit chemical waste 
and safeguard the environment. Additionally, in the cotton delinting process, dilute sulphuric 
acid is reused multiple times to reduce waste and maintain a safe, environmentally friendly 
operation. These efforts highlight the company’s strong commitment to sustainability and 
responsible environmental practices.

understand their unique requirements and concerns. Based on this understanding, suitable strategies are devised to address these 
needs. Both internal and external stakeholders have identified key material topics related to environmental, social, and governance

its proactive, responsive, and transparent approach to stakeholder interactions. As part of this commitment, the company has 
implemented a whistle-blower policy that encourages employees, channel partners, and vendors to report any significant deviations 
from key management policies, instances of non-compliance, or other improper practices. Additionally, an investor grievance cell 
has been established to address and resolve investor concerns effectively.

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may

Outcome of the initiative
The Company has strategically implemented several measures to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability.
Cold Storage Upgrades – Pamulaparthy Facility
Several enhancements were implemented at the existing cold storage facility in Pamulaparthy to improve operational efficiency and 
storage capacity:
1.	 Racking System Upgrade:
 
 
The existing static racking system was replaced with mobile racking.
 
 
This change significantly improved space utilization, increasing orability (usable storage space) from 35% to 75%.
2.	 Refrigeration System Modernization:
 
 
The earlier centralized ammonia-based refrigeration system was decommissioned.
 
 
It has been replaced with decentralized, independent refrigeration units using Freon compressors.
 
 
This decentralization enhances system reliability, simplifies maintenance, and offers better temperature control across 
different chambers.
These upgrades are expected to result in better energy efficiency, increased storage capacity, and improved operational flexibility
