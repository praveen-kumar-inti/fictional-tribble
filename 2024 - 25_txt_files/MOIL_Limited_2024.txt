by CPMO. Later in 1977, the remaining 
49% shareholding was acquired by the 
Government and MOIL became a 100% 
government company. 
The Company has its underground and 
opencast mines in Nagpur, Bhanadara

developing new vertical shafts to enhance 
access and capacity. However, this approach 
may introduce increased safety challenges for 
workers operating in these environments.
MOIL 
is 
firmly

to 
maintaining 
high 
safety 
standards 
across all its operations. To prevent 
accidents and safeguard the well-
being of its workforce, the company

Impact and 
Sustainability
Risk
The mining and processing of manganese ore 
can lead to substantial environmental effects, 
such as habitat destruction, soil erosion, water 
pollution, and air contamination. As regulatory 
oversight intensifies and societal demands for 
sustainable practices rise, mining companies 
that fail to properly address environmental 
issues face increased risks.
The company reuses non-hazardous 
waste, such as rocks, for landfilling and 
backfilling. 
It also maintains plantation areas 
by regularly watering them around 
all mining sites. The organization 
generates 
electricity 
through 
renewable sources, including solar 
panels and wind turbines. Further, large 
areas at both the mining sites and the 
head office are dedicated to plantation 
activities.
The 
company 
has 
successfully 
implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) system across all its mines, which 
includes Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs). The treated water is repurposed 
for various uses, such as gardening, 
plantation, green belt maintenance, 
and dust suppression. At the head 
office, the Sewage Treatment Plant also 
supplies treated water for gardening 
and plantation activities

Technological 
and Process 
Innovation
Opportunity
The manganese ore industry stands to 
gain greatly from advancements in mining 
technologies 
and 
processing 
methods. 
Innovations like automated mining machinery, 
enhanced ore beneficiation techniques, and 
energy-efficient processing solutions can 
boost productivity, lower costs, and improve 
the quality of manganese ore products. To 
stay competitive and efficient, MOIL should 
invest in research and development to adopt 
and integrate the latest technologies and 
processes.

MOIL Limited is a mining enterprise primarily engaged in the exploration, extraction, and production of manganese ore, along with 
the manufacturing of Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide and Ferro Manganese. Given the nature of mining—where non-renewable 
resources are extracted and processed—there are inherently limited opportunities to reclaim, recycle, or repurpose materials at 
the end of their life cycle. Unlike certain manufacturing industries that can reuse or recycle finished products, mining operations 
focus on the utilization of finite natural resources, making end-of-life recovery particularly challenging. Despite these limitations, 
MOIL remains dedicated to sustainable mining practices, striving to reduce environmental impact and uphold responsible mining 
standards to support long-term ecological sustainability and natural resource conservation.

Further, the company is committed to the well-being of workers operating heavy machinery by providing annual eye 
checkups. MOIL also prioritizes equipping its workforce with life-saving skills through detailed training programs. All 
employees are trained in basic rescue techniques for helping injured colleagues during emergencies, ensuring they can 
offer immediate support when necessary. Workers also receive training to handle critical incidents, such as fires and roof 
collapses, reinforcing a culture of safety and readiness across all mining operations.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
	
	
The company places a strong emphasis on the reliability and performance of its machinery and equipment through rigorous 
maintenance protocols. Regular inspections are carried out to ensure optimal machine functionality, reducing the risk of 
unexpected breakdowns and minimizing operational disruptions. Any malfunctioning equipment is promptly repaired to 
restore operations quickly and prevent delays or productivity losses.
	
	
To maintain the safety and integrity of operational areas, the company performs routine pressure tests to evaluate the 
structural strength of equipment and pipelines. This proactive measure helps identify potential leaks or weaknesses before 
they present safety hazards.
	
	
Additionally, the company employs Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) for critical equipment. NDT is an essential inspection 
method that enables the company to assess the condition of vital machinery without causing damage. By using NDT, MOIL 
can detect defects or irregularities in key equipment, making it possible to take informed actions on repairs or replacements, 
thereby ensuring the continuous and safe functioning of its mining operations.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Y/N)
	
	
Each mine of the Company is equipped with a telephone in the communication area for emergency situations. In the event 
of an injury or emergency, workers are trained to immediately report the incident to the senior-most mine manager or the 
mine manager. Alternatively, they can contact any available supervisor on duty.
	
	
Once the report is received, the mine manager takes charge of the situation and informs the designated emergency response 
officer. This officer then follows the established Safe Operating Procedures (SOP) to assess the situation and determine the 
most appropriate and effective course of action for safely rescuing the injured worker.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
The company provides on-site medical facilities to address minor injuries and medical emergencies that can be managed 
within the mine premises.
	
	
In the event of a more serious medical incident or if specialized care is required beyond the scope of the on-site facility, 
MOIL takes the necessary steps to refer the affected individual to an external hospital. The company covers all expenses 
associated with this external medical treatment.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation. 
	
MOIL Limited has implemented a comprehensive Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) policy to ensure that no liquid waste is released into 
the environment. This policy is uniformly enforced across all 10 of its mines through various initiatives targeting both domestic 
sewage and industrial effluent management.
	
Domestic Sewage Management
	
Each mine colony is equipped with adequately sized Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) that utilize Phytorid bed technology, 
developed by NEERI, Nagpur. These STPs treat domestic sewage effectively, and the resulting treated water is reused for land 
irrigation, including gardening and plantation activities within the colonies, thereby promoting water conservation.
	
Industrial Effluent Management
	
Effluent generated from workshop activities at the mines is treated in appropriately sized Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs). The 
treated water is then reused for purposes such as vehicle washing, reducing the environmental footprint and contributing to 
sustainable water usage.
	
Protection of Natural Water Bodies
	
The Company prioritizes the conservation of natural water bodies, including seasonal and intermittent streams within its mining 
lease areas. The company employs erosion control measures such as stone pitching, grassing, and the plantation of native species 
to prevent contamination and preserve the ecological balance. These efforts are aimed at maintaining the health and integrity of 
the local environment and water resources.

gardening purposes. Industrial effluent generated 
from the mine workshops is processed through 
appropriately sized Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) at 
each mine, with a total treatment capacity of 65 CMD.
The treated outlet water is reused for vehicle 
washing, while the sludge produced by 
the treatment units is disposed of through 
the Common Hazardous Waste Treatment,
