24. 	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
•	
Identifying the universe of relevant ESG topics - This was done basis discussions with internal stakeholders, peer review 
and benchmarking, sector scans, media reports and secondary sources that provided a pool of sustainability topics. These 
were further analyzed and evaluated for consideration at a strategic level. Adherence to crucial issues as per different 
standards and frameworks was also ensured.
	
•	
Detailing the stakeholder engagement methodology: We had sent detailed questionnaires to various stakeholder groups 
that were identified. Our external stakeholders included Customers, Shareholders and Vendors/Suppliers. Our internal 
stakeholders consisted of our employees and management team. While for other stakeholders we have done desktop 
research to incorporate their priorities.
	
•	
Data collection: We used online surveys to collect data and information from stakeholders to prioritize the list of identified 
ESG topics. Diverse responses were captured to understand the length and breadth of all possible issues. The designing of 
the questionnaire was done with the objective of bringing out the key issues, risks and opportunities from the stakeholders’ 
point of view and then map it for the material issues. In addition to the survey, we conducted in-depth discussions with a 
subset of stakeholders to gain a comprehensive understanding of their primary concerns.
	
•	
Discussion with management team, CSR & ESG Committee and the Board: the outcome of the exercise was discussed with 
the leadership to arrive at the key focus areas keeping in view, their relevance to stakeholders and business, as well as their 
impact on sustainability development.
	
The information collected from internal and external stakeholders was analyzed and the key material issues were grouped into 
17 core thematic areas. These issues were assessed and mapped to determine their level of priority for our stakeholders and 
business.
