Energy

Air pollution
R/O
Energy efficiency, carbon emissions, and air 
pollution pose risks and opportunities for our 
organisation.
Neglecting these issues leads to regulatory 
pressures, fines, and reputational damage.
However, embracing efficiency and reducing 
emissions enhances our organisation brand, 
attracts eco-conscious customers, and improves 
competitiveness. Sustainable practices save 
costs and improve efficiency.
Prioritising energy efficiency and emissions aligns 
with environmental goals, driving growth and 
sustainability.
Our organisation has implemented 
effective measures to address energy 
efficiency and carbon emissions/air 
pollution risks. These include dust 
collectors, bed scrubbers, and flue 
gas monitoring. We recycle organic 
vapors and have a green belt and 
environmental management cell for 
ongoing monitoring. These efforts

Water and 
effluent 
management/ 
Waste 
management
Risk
Water scarcity, pollution, and inadequate waste 
management pose risks to our organisation and 
the environment. Insufficient water availability 
disrupts operations, raises costs, and jeopardises 
well-being.
Improper waste handling risks environmental harm, 
health hazards, and non- compliance. Addressing 
these risks is crucial to avoid penalties, reputation 
damage, and strained relationships. Effective 
management brings financial and environmental 
benefits, enhancing our position in the sector.
Our organisation prioritises waste 
and water/effluent management. We 
securely store and responsibly dispose 
of discarded containers, hand them 
over to authorised recyclers, and 
ensure proper recycling practices. 
Specific wastes are securely stored 
and safely disposed of in authorised 
incinerators. 
We 
reprocess 
spent 
solvents using environmentally sound 
technology and government- approved 
recyclers. These measures showcase 
our commitment to responsible waste 
management, reducing environmental 
impact, and complying with regulatory 
requirements.
Negative
3.
Biodiversity 
protection
Risk
We understand that business operations have an 
impact on biodiversity. Pollution and contamination 
worsen the situation, impacting species diversity 
and ecological balance. Addressing these risks 
is crucial to safeguard biodiversity and promote 
responsible practices in our industry.
The green belt near our chemical 
manufacturing factory acts as a 
refuge for diverse species, conserving 
biodiversity. It serves as a buffer 
zone, reducing pollution impacts and 
improving air and water quality. The 
green belt acts as an environmental 
asset, fostering ecological resilience 
and mitigating risks associated with 
our operations.
Negative

green 
chemistry 
offers 
our 
organisation 
numerous 
opportunities. 
It 
showcases our commitment to sustainability, 
ensures compliance with regulations, brings 
cost savings through efficient processes, fosters 
innovation, and differentiates us in the market 
with sustainable products. It opens doors to 
new markets and customers seeking eco- 
friendly options, reduces risks associated with 
hazardous 
substances, 
strengthens 
supply 
chain resilience, and contributes to long-term 
sustainability by conserving resources and 
minimising environmental impact. Adopting green 
chemistry establishes us as leaders in sustainable 
chemistry, benefiting the environment and our 
long- term success.
Positive
5.
Diversity, 
inclusion, 
and equal 
opportunities
Opportunity
Embracing 
diversity, 
inclusion, 
and 
equal 
opportunities brings significant advantages to 
our company. Prioritising these principles fosters 
innovation, expands our talent pool, improves 
decision-making, boosts employee engagement 
and retention, enhances our reputation, ensures 
regulatory compliance, and drives research and 
development innovation. By embracing diversity 
and inclusion, we cultivate a culture of success, 
competitiveness, and long-term sustainability 
while contributing to a more equitable and 
inclusive society.

for our organisation. By creating a positive 
work environment that supports physical and 
mental health, providing benefits and flexible 
arrangements, and offering skill development 
opportunities, we enhance job satisfaction, 
retention, engagement, and attract top talent. 
This fosters a culture of continuous learning 
and growth, boosting productivity, performance, 
competitiveness, and long-term success.
Positive
7.
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety are a critical risk 
for our organisation. Neglecting a safe working 
environment leads to accidents, injuries, and 
illnesses, impacting employee wellbeing, morale, 
productivity, and absenteeism. Non-compliance 
results in legal liabilities, fines, penalties, and 
reputational damage.
Prioritising comprehensive health and safety 
programs, training, and preventive measures 
is crucial to mitigate risks, protect employees, 
and maintain a safe workplace. Investment in 
occupational health and safety ensures the 
wellbeing of our workforce and safeguards our 
organisation’s reputation and success.
The Company prioritises creating a 
safe work environment and preventing 
harm. It regularly identifies hazards and 
develops mitigation plans. Ongoing 
safety 
trainings 
are 
provided 
to 
employees and workers to safeguard 
their overall well-being. The goal is to 
maintain a holistic approach to safety 
and well-being.
Negative
8.
Human rights 
and community 
development
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Human rights violations or perceived violations 
pose a significant risk to our organisation, causing 
reputational damage, legal consequences, and 
loss of stakeholder trust. Failing to uphold labour 
rights can result in employee dissatisfaction, 
protests, and potential boycotts.
Respecting 
human 
rights, 
complying 
with 
laws, and addressing grievances transparently 
are crucial. On the other hand, community 
development 
offers 
opportunities. 
Engaging 
in initiatives like education, skills training, and 
infrastructure development builds relationships, 
enhances reputation, and creates a positive social 
impact, leading to community support, market 
access, and long-term sustainability.
We have well established systems to 
ensure that human rights of our internal 
and external stakeholders are secured. 
There are necessary policy frameworks 
implemented in this regard. We have 
been engaging with local communities 
through our various CSR initiatives to 
make a positive impact on their lives 
and foster sustainable development.

Data integrity & 
security
Risk
Data integrity and security are crucial for 
protecting valuable assets and maintaining 
stakeholder trust. Breaches or unauthorised 
access can lead to financial losses, reputation 
damage, and legal liabilities. Data integrity issues 
undermine decision- making and operational 
efficiency. Implementing robust security measures 
and employee awareness programmes mitigate 
risks and safeguard data assets, reputation, and 
competitive position.
To mitigate risks related to data 
integrity and security, our organisation 
has implemented robust measures. 
These include the implementation of 
encryption technologies to protect 
sensitive data, strict access controls 
and authentication protocols, regular 
data backups, ongoing monitoring of 
network and system vulnerabilities, 
comprehensive employee training on 
data security best practices, and the 
use of advanced firewalls and intrusion 
detection systems. These measures 
aim to safeguard our data assets, 
protect against unauthorised access 
or data breaches, and ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
of our data.
Negative

Risk 
management 
& business 
continuity
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Risk management and business continuity 
pose both risks and opportunities. Inadequate 
management can lead to accidents, disruptions, 
non-compliance, and reputational damage.
Prioritising risk assessment, safety protocols, 
emergency plans, and supply chain resilience 
minimises incidents, protects stakeholders, and 
enhances trust.
Effective business continuity planning ensures 
swift response, essential operations, and efficient 
recovery, securing long-term sustainability and 
success.
To address risk management and 
business 
continuity 
issues, 
our 
organisation has implemented various 
measures. These include conducting 
proactive 
risk 
assessments, 
implementing 
safety 
protocols

plans, 
ensuring 
supply 
chain 
resilience, 
establishing business continuity plans, 
regularly 
reviewing, 
and 
updating 
risk 
management 
strategies, 
and 
conducting drills and simulations to 
test preparedness.
These measures help mitigate risks, 
enhance operational resilience, and 
ensure the continuity of our business 
operations in the face of potential 
disruptions.

Given the nature of our business, we have limited scope to reclaim our products for reusing, recycling, and disposal at 
the end of life. However, we have implemented a waste management system at all our facilities and have dedicated teams 
to ensure its effective implementation. All the categories of wastes are collected, segregated, stored, transported, and 
disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best industry practices. We have detailed SOP for 
collection, storage and disposal of various type of waste generated from process.
	
We are segregating all waste into two categories i.e., recyclable, and non-recyclable wastes. Recyclable waste is disposed 
of in an environmentally sound manner to authorised recyclers, and non-recyclable waste is disposed of via co-processing 
to the cement industry or incineration or secured landfill based on calorific value of waste. The packing material generated 
by raw materials and in-process material are being disposed to authorised plastic recycler or via Common Hazardous Waste 
Collection, Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facilities (CHWTSDF).
	
We have been consistently enhancing our waste management practices and have embedded them with our circular 
economy approach. In terms of process improvements, we have implemented systems to recover the organic solvents and 
reuse them in the same process.
	
We have a dedicated lab working exclusively on waste treatability studies and have converted by-products into desired 
intermediates by using a simple process, which in turn reduced the hazardous organic waste to a great extent.

standardise implementation of safety measures.
	
	
At all our facilities, we have a dedicated EHS team to identify, assess and mitigate risks, monitor the implementation of 
safety measures, conduct a weekly safety inspection, and provide regular training on safety-aspects to employees and 
workers. Also, there are periodic internal and external audits conducted to access the effectiveness of Occupational 
health and safety processes implemented at our facilities.

by a detailed root cause analysis, development and implementation of corrective action plans, and monitoring of 
the effectiveness of safety measures. All the reported issues can be tracked online till its closure with the corrective 
action plan and any employee can access the portal through their login credentials. Apart from this, regular safety 
briefing sessions/toolbox talks take place on a daily basis, where workers actively participate to give suggestions for 
strengthening the safety measures at the sites.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Being a pharmaceutical and specialty chemical manufacturing company, responsible waste management is of utmost 
priority for us. We have been consistently enhancing our waste management practices and have embedded them with our 
circular economy approach. We follow the 3R concept of “reduce, reuse & recycle” and have defined standard operating 
procedures for handling hazardous, non-hazardous, e-waste, and biomedical wastes.
	
All our facilities have dedicated teams to ensure waste segregation at source, safe handling, storage, and disposal of 
waste in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste generated 
from our operations is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner to authorised recyclers, the cement industry, and 
Common Hazardous Waste Collection, Treatment, Storage & Disposal Facilities (CHWTSDF). Similarly, 100% of the e-waste 
generated was sold to authorised vendors. Plastic waste was recycled through authorised recyclers.
	
The other non-hazardous waste such as scrap metal, wood waste, glass, cardboard, paper, etc. was disposed of via 
authorised recyclers.
	
In terms of process improvements, we are using recovered solvents in the process to reduce fresh solvent consumption. 
We have a dedicated lab working exclusively on waste treatability studies and have converted by-products into desired 
intermediates by using a simple process, which in turn reduced the hazardous organic waste to a great extent. Also, we are 
enhancing our effluent treatment plants to enhance wastewater/effluent recycling capabilities.
	
Apart from this, we have been conducting periodic inspections to evaluate the waste handling facilities and implementing 
necessary changes to make them more efficient and environmentally friendly.
	
We have implemented “Wealth from Waste” Programme which aims to identify waste which can be recycled, reduced or 
reused.
10.	 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife 
sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where 
environmental approvals/clearances are required, please specify details in the following format:
S.

Jigani Unit
Manufacturing of 
pharmaceuticals
Yes, as per the Environmental Clearance (EC) recommendation, we have already 
applied for the No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Bannerghatta National Park 
(Forest Department).
	
We have defined processes and implemented necessary pollution control mechanisms to prevent any adverse impact on 
the ecology. Our dedicated team ensure the operations of all the pollution controlling equipment, zero liquid discharge and 
proper waste management in accordance with statutory requirements and industry best practices.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, provide 
details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention 
and remediation activities.
	
We have only Jigani Unit, which is in proximity to Bannerghatta National Park. To conserve the ecology, we have partnered 
with the International Association for Human Values (IAHV) for the development work of Yallammanadoddi lake, which 
is near our Jigani Unit. Three villages in the surrounding area are directly dependent on this lake for water. However, the 
accumulation of mud, waste and weeds made the lake unfit for direct domestic use.
	
We carried out lake desiltation work in collaboration with villagers and provided bunds and silt traps to prevent ingress of 
waste and silt. This has increased the water capacity of lake by four times. In addition, we carried out a plantation of more 
than 40 varieties of aquatic plants and removed water hyacinths from the lake. Development of flora in the area promoted 
suitable eco-system to flourish various local birds and butterflies in the area. This has improved the overall ecology and 
provided clean water to the local communities.
6.

and contingency measures to minimise any business interruptions. To ensure its effective implementation, roles and 
responsibilities have been defined at different levels across the organisation. We revise our SOPs in every two years or 
as when required to make necessary amendments to handle any contingency scenario. In addition, all our manufacturing 
facilities have site-specific on-site and offsite emergency response plans. Regular training and mock drills are being 
conducted as per the statutory requirements.
8.	
Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
