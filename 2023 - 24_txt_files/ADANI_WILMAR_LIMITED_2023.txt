Labor 
Practices
Risk
By upholding human rights and 
ensuring sound labour practices, 
the Company avoids disciplinary 
actions, 
avoids 
penalties, 
and 
empowers its employees.
The Company adheres to all 
applicable 
laws, 
pertaining 
to human rights and labour 
practices. AWL does not engage in

labor. 
The 
policy 
framework

fines 
and 
harm

and 
technology
Opportunity
The 
implementation 
of 
new 
technologies 
and 
digitalization 
will enable the organization to be 
at the forefront as market leaders 
with better quality products. It will 
also help business to counter any 
disruptive business models that 
may pose a threat to our business.
N/A
Positive. Digitalization 
has 
streamlined 
our 
businesses 
leading 
to better capture of 
demand and lower cost 
to manage operations.
5
Data Privacy

Risk
Safeguarding the security of the 
data and the entire value chain, 
particularly customers is important 
for our business operations. Any 
data breach may lead to leakage 
of the Company’s sensitive data 
resulting 
into 
frauds, 
business 
disruptions and continuity.
The Company has established 
a data security mechanism to 
prevent any possible cyber-attack, 
data breach or any sabotage 
attempt 
to 
disrupt 
business 
processes. The Company has also 
put in place a proper business 
continuity plan which includes 
building of redundancy for entire 
IT infrastructure & network.
Negative. 
Data 
leak 
may lead to loss of trust 
of our stakeholders.
6
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity
For responsible consumption and 
production, circular economy plays 
a pivotal role in operating the 
business responsibly. Our business 
adopts multiple initiatives such 
as recyclable packaging material 
which promotes circular economy 
and thereby plays a pivotal role in 
operating the business responsibly.
N/A
Positive. 
Consumers 
prefer 
products 
of 
companies 
that

sustainable practices.
7
Waste 
Management
Risk
Responsible 
disposal 
of 
waste 
and reducing its generation, helps 
the Company to comply with 
environmental rules and regulations 
and 
ensure 
environmental 
sustainability. Any non-adherence 
to waste management / pollution 
control norms may lead to stringent 
action from the authorities such as 
NGT / Pollution control boards. Any 
severe violation can lead to closure 
of manufacturing facility
Our 
Company 
follows 
high 
standards of waste management 
in consultation with Wilmar Group. 
Most of the plants are equipped 
with zero liquid discharge systems 
(ZLD), which ensures that effluent 
is not released in the  environment 
which can be hazardous. Besides 
this, more than 98% of packing 
material is recyclable, thereby 
restricting 
non-biodegradable 
waste. 
Additionally, 
we 
are 
guided by Adani Group’s Resource 
Conservation 
Policy 
which 
provides 
guidance 
to 
various 
business units to incorporate 
the principles of circularity in 
processes and production.
Negative. Any increase 
in waste generation 
will 
lead 
to 
more 
capital expenditure to 
treat the waste.

it.
The 
environment 
related 
initiatives 
and 
policies 
have 
been put in place to reduce the 
impact on the environment. The 
Company has taken initiatives to 
reduce dependence on thermal 
power as well as reduced wastage 
of water at major plant locations.
Negative. 
Any 
harm 
to 
our 
surroundings 
may lead to regulatory

9
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Developing 
a

10
Employee 
Health, 
Safety, and 
well-being
Risk
As the Company's most valuable 
resource, employee safety and 
wellbeing 
are 
of 
paramount 
importance. This is accomplished 
by 
assessing 
and 
controlling 
health and safety risks across the 
operations.
The 
Company 
emphasis 
on 
placing safety as a pre-requisite 
across all its operations. Further, 
the Company also takes various 
measures to ensure the health 
and wellbeing of employees by 
resorting to various interventions 
through 
health 
awareness 
programs.
Negative. Any kind of 
injury in our operations 
is 
considered 
as 
a 
significant 
negative 
outcome 
for 
our 
operations. There can 
be financial risk as well

partner 
organizations. 
N/A
Positive. Many of our 
institutional 
clients 
buy palm oil that has 
been procured only in a 
sustainable manner.
12
Human 
Rights
Risk
Respecting 
human 
rights 
is 
essential to ensuring the safety of 
communities, employees, and other 
stakeholders.
We are guided by Adani Group and 
Wilmar Group’s policy on Human 
Rights, based on international 
standards and frameworks, that

of human rights will 
also lead to reputation 
damage. It may also 
lead to losing the sales 
from the customers who 
has higher emphasis on 
sustainability.
13
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a shared resource, making 
its 
responsible 
consumption 
is 
important to the businesses. For 
the business to be socially and 
environmentally responsible, it must 
adhere to responsible consumption.
Zero liquid discharge systems 
or 
effluent 
treatment 
plants 
installed at all the plants ensures 
recycling of all the water waste, 
thereby ensuring reuse of water.
Negative. 
Water 
shortage can disrupt 
operations.
14
Energy and 
emission 
Management
Risk
Mitigating climate change requires 
reduction in energy consumption 
and emissions footprint through 
implementation 
of 
carbon 
reduction initiatives. 
Adani’s Group level policy on 
Energy 
Management 
serves 
as a guidance to manage and 
optimize energy consumption and 
emissions and align with India’s 
goal to become Net zero.
Negative. 
Any 
new 
regulations for reducing 
emission may require 
capital investments.
15
Training and 
Development
Opportunity
The 
Company 
can 
become 
increasingly 
future-ready 
by 
ensuring requisite technical and 
behavioral skills are imparted to 
its 
workforce 
through 
regular 
trainings.
N/A

7. Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Adani Wilmar’s vision is to be a leading agribusiness company 
committed to sustainably deliver safe, nutritious and quality 
agricultural commodity and food through innovation, highest standards 
of environmental, social and governance practices, and the creation of 
livelihoods in communities in which we operate to deliver long-term 
value to all our stakeholders.
AWL has always prioritized efficiency in its operations, which has an 
associated benefit of reducing the impact on the environment. This 
has always led us to invest in advanced machinery, technologies, and 
process improvements to reduce our resource usage, including plastics 
for packaging. Our Integrated Business model, along with the strategic 
location of our facilities has optimized the movement of materials, thereby 
reducing GHG emissions. We have port-based refineries so that imported 
edible oil can be directly moved to refineries through pipelines, eliminating 
the use of emission-intensive road transport for inward logistics.

A large network of 96 depots along with 50%+ direct shipment from 
factory to distributors, optimizes cargo movements. We are increasingly 
using railways for long-distance shipments, which now accounts for 
around 25% of the volume of our primary dispatches in packaged staples. 
For road movements, we are shifting to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) 
vehicles, by incentivizing the fleet owners. As part of Adani Wilmar’s 
efforts to expand renewable energy usage, we have been adding solar 
panels to our facilities and have covered 11 locations. Renewable 
sources contributed 11% of our energy consumption in FY’24, which we 
plan to enhance significantly in the near future. 98% of our packaging 
material is recyclable. With the assistance of our co-promoter, Wilmar 
International Limited, we have reached 90%+ traceability to mills 
in palm oil sourcing. We are taking steps to improve sustainable 
sourcing in the domestic markets as well. We are also dedicated to 
our societal responsibilities, investing in various social causes through 
Adani Foundation. Notably, our Project, Fortune SuPoshan focuses on 
eradicating malnutrition among children aged 0-5, adolescent girls 
and pregnant & lactating mothers. Moving forward, we will continue to 
expand our efforts in sustainability and social initiatives.

8. 
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
 
The Company is committed to sustainable energy practices and has undertaken the installation of rooftop solar stations 
across its factory premises. These solar stations harness solar energy through photovoltaic panels installed on the 
rooftops of buildings. By utilizing renewable solar energy, the Company aims to reduce its reliance on conventional 
energy sources and minimize its carbon footprint.
 
The installation of rooftop solar stations not only demonstrates the Company’s commitment to environmental 
sustainability, but also contributes to its efforts in adopting clean and renewable energy solutions. By generating 
electricity from solar power, the Company not only reduces its operational costs but also contributes to mitigating the 
effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Utilization of Biomass as Fuel:
 
In addition to solar energy, the Company is also utilizing biomass as a sustainable fuel source in its boilers. Biomass 
refers to organic materials such as wood chips, agricultural residues, or waste from forestry and agricultural activities 
that can be used as fuel for energy generation.
 
Biomass boilers convert biomass materials into heat energy through combustion, which can then be used for various 
industrial processes, including steam generation for manufacturing operations. This approach not only helps in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to the efficient utilization of organic waste materials, thereby promoting 
a circular economy.

Following is a brief summary of the some of the practices adopted by the Company:
 
1) 
Wastewater management: Manufacturing units release waste which is treated at our plants for reuse through 
effluent treatment plants. Over and above this, the Company has also installed ZLD at major plants. The recycled 
water is used for multiple purposes at the plant locations.
 
2) 
Reuse of Lubricant Oil: All the edible oil refineries produce wastage in the form of lubricant oil. This lubricant oil is 
resold to authorized recycler for further reuse. 
 
Besides the above measures of waste management, the Company has also replaced the packaging material used for its 
FMCG products. Today, approximately 98% of the packaging material used is recyclable.
 
Going forward, the Company will assess and closely monitor the usage of various chemicals. The endeavor of the 
Company shall be to find out ways for minimal usage of such chemicals and careful disposal of the same.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
 
The Company has a system in place to address to consumer complaints. The consumers have an option to raise a 
complaint through three sources: (a.) Email (b.) Toll-free number (c.) Social Media platforms
 
We have an internal application and portal in place for recording all the complaints received through the above three 
mediums. Any complaint received is regularly updated on the said platform. The platform is used by cross-functional 
teams across departments. Once a complaint is recorded, the complaint is automatically allocated to the local sales 
team and the concerned plant. The local sales team is required to contact the customer and pay a visit to the customer’s 
home for investigating the complaint and check the product physically. After resolving the complaint, the sales team 
will fill the details in the Samaadhaan Application and generate a ‘Happy Code’ which will go directly to the customer’s 
mobile number. Upon receiving a satisfactory resolution to his/her complaint, the customer shares this Happy Code with 
the local sales team, which is entered into the system to close the complaint at the customer’s level. Simultaneously, 
the plant team needs to upload the Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) report of every complaint in the 
Samaadhaan web portal based on the controlled sample of the same manufacturing date product for which we have 
received the complaint. The team checks the product as per the specifications and submit the CAPA details in the 
Samaadhaan web portal. The plant head then reviews the details in the Samaadhaan web portal and send it to the 
Corporate QA team for approval in the Samaadhaan web portal.
 
When the Complaint Investigation Report is entered in the Samaadhaan app by the sales team and CAPA in the Web 
portal by the plant team, the complaint gets closed at both the levels. 
 
Additionally, on receipt of any complaints, depending on the nature of such complaint, plant officials are required to 
thoroughly reassess the samples of the product as on the manufacturing date suggested by the customer.
