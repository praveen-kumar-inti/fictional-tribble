*The Company’s stakeholders include Customers, Suppliers, Employee/Workers, Business Partners, Board of Directors, Promoters, 
Government, Institution/Industry Bodies, Community, Society and Investors. The Company has a strong Grievance Redressal 
Mechanism through various policies and procedures across all operations. For example, the Company has a well-defined Vigil 
Mechanism/Whistle-Blower Policy (https://www.lumaxworld.in/lumaxindustries/pdf/vigil-mechanism-whistle-blower-policy_LIL.pdf), 
Anti-Bribery Policy (available on Company’s Intranet) and Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace 
(https://www.lumaxworld.in/lumaxindustries/pdf/policy-on-prevention-of-sexual-harassment-of-women.pdf) for all of its female 
employees to allow for the expression of concerns and grievances. Further, there is a defined Escalation matrix for the Company’s 
productive suppliers for addressing their grievances. In addition to this, the Company through its Legal and Secretarial Department 
takes care of other stakeholders’ grievances.

24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along-with its financial implications, as per the following format :
S. 
no.
Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the 
risk/opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive 
or negative implications)
1
Waste management
Handling and disposal of waste 
pose as a risk. Waste reduction 
together with enhanced circular 
economy and performance has 
added environmental benefits as 
opportunity.
Disposal of waste through 
authorized recyclers.
Together with some negative 
implications, this would largely 
have a positive impact on cost-
cutting opportunities through 
waste management, as the 
manufacturing process generates 
waste as a by-product.
2
Water management
Reduction in consumption in the 
Company’s business processes.
This would have minor financial 
implications as the Company 
has already taken significant 
initiatives to reduce water 
consumption and recycle it 
efficiently in past. Hence there 
seems to be a little scope for 
further efficient use of water.
3
Climate and 
environmental 
action
Global warming and industry 
operation and transition risk.
Climate change and industry 
transition are now embedded in 
the Company’s risk management 
process.
There may be negative financial 
consequences for failing to 
implement mitigating strategies. 
However, the Company is 
committed to taking positive 
steps in the right direction.
4
Energy
Use of energy is an inevitable 
part of the Company’s operations. 
However, efficient use and 
the implementation of own 
renewable energy sources will 
help in improving Company’s 
operations.
Active energy management and 
transition to ISO 50001.
In the short-term, there may be 
a negative financial impact from 
investing on Solar Generators; 
however, in the long-term there 
would be a positive financial 
impact from methodical use of 
energy sources and aligning with 
industry expectations.
5
Emissions
Challenging roadmap to address 
Scope 3 Green House Gases 
(GHG) emissions with respect to 
value chain partners.
Roadmap for Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emission is being designed 
with committed timelines. 
Furthermore, the collaboration 
for detailed strategies to address 
Scope 3 GHG emission for 
the entire supply chain of the 
Company will help address the 
issue in a progressive manner.
There may be negative financial 
consequences for failing 
to implement the designed 
roadmap and future strategies. 
However, the Company is 
committed to taking positive 
steps in the right direction.
6
Employee health 
and safety
In a company, managing safety 
and health is an essential 
component of running a 
business. Therefore, businesses 
must conduct a risk assessment 
to identify hazards and risks in 
their workplace(s) and implement 
actions to successfully control 
them.
The Company is committed 
to continuous improvement in 
health and safety best practices 
worldwide, in accordance with 
its global SHE policy, for all 
employees and workers.
There are several initiatives 
and programs that have been 
implemented to cover all aspects 
of health and safety management 
and are being actively monitored 
for continuous improvement.
There may be some financial 
investments in terms of taking 
measures for employee safety; 
that would, in turn have a 
significantly high positive impact 
on employee health and their 
confidence in the Company’s 
culture in the long run, which 
would attract new talent and help 
retain the existing employees.

Insufficient diversity across the

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Waste generation being an inevitable part of the manufacturing process, efforts have been made to create 
value from waste. With the aim of diverting a significant amount of waste from going to landfills, the Company 
has adopted systems and procedures that help repurpose used material and reintroduce excess material 
into the production process. The Company follows the ‘3R’ strategy of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle for its 
waste management. The Company follows legally prescribed procedures and applies environmentally 
sound disposal techniques for disposing of the hazardous waste, whereas the non-hazardous waste is 
sold to the authorized recyclers, as identified by the Company. Further, to reduce the wastage of water, the 
Company has installed ETPs and STPs at 8 of its plants, wherein the Company reuses the treated water for 
gardening and other non-potable purposes. In addition to the above, the Company also optimizes its water 
consumption through rainwater harvesting at the majority of its plant locations.
