Introduc'on
At Time Technoplast Limited, we believe that sustainability is not just a responsibility—it’s a core part of our long­term strategy and 
operaonal ethos. As part of our commitment to responsible growth and innovaon, we have connuously pursued sustainable 
pracces across our business.
We are proud to be the ﬁrst company in India to receive ﬁnal approval for the manufacturing and supply of supply of Type­4 
composite cylinder and now received approval for Type­3 Fully Wrapped Fibre Reinforced Composite Cylinders for Hydrogen­
Powered Fuel Cells, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Drones. This milestone underscores our dedicaon to the Government 
of India’s ‘Make in India’ iniave and reinforces our leadership in advancing green energy soluons within the Hydrogen Energy 
sector. Our innovaons in hydrogen cylinder technology reﬂect our belief that sustainability can drive both environmental impact 
and business value. 
To further strengthen our commitment to sustainability, we have established Time Ecotech Private Limited (TEPL), a wholly­owned 
subsidiary of Time Technoplast Ltd. TEPL will be dedicated to the recycling and reprocessing of used industrial plasc packaging, 
posioning us at the forefront of India’s circular economy. As part of Phase I, we are seang up a greenﬁeld facility in Gujarat, marking 
the beginning of a naonwide iniave aimed at transforming waste management and advancing resource recovery pracces.
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) presents our ongoing iniaves, accomplishments, and future 
commitments as we move toward building a more responsible and resilient organizaon.

The manufacturing operaons of the 
Company require employees to 
interact with plant, machinery, and 
material handling equipment, all of 
which carry an inherent risk of injury.
Opportuni'es:
Priorizing employee well­being can 
lead to increased producvity, 
eﬃciency, and overall job sasfacon.
By promong employee well­being, a 
supporve work environment can be 
created that reduces absenteeism and 
turnover rates.
Adherence to safety standards, 
the Company's EHS Policy and 
highest operaonal standards 
for handling hazardous 
materials at plants

tend to be more movated, focused, 
and commiFed to their work.

their well­being is priorized, they 
are more likely to remain with the 
company, reducing the costs and 
disrupons associated with high 
turnover.

Economy
Opportunity
Opportunies:
Implemenng eﬀecve waste 
management pracces allows for the 
recovery and recycling of plasc waste. 
Recycling and reusing plasc waste 
reduce the expenses associated with 
waste disposal and procurement of 
new raw materials.
Embracing the circular economy 
encourages product innovaon and 
design for recycling. Manufacturers 
can develop products that are easily 
recyclable made from recycled 
materials or designed for extended use 
through repair, refurbishment, or 
manufacturing. 
­
Posi've
Encouraging recyclability and 
circular economy iniaves can 
lead to resource and cost eﬃciency 
in the longer run. 
O p e n i n g  o f  n e w  m a r k e t

Opportunity
Key to consistency is customer 
retenon, sustained business and long­

By priorizing customer sasfacon, 
we can foster customer loyalty and 
improve customer retenon rates. We  
conduct customer sasfacon surveys 
to get the customer feedback and 
valuable insights.
The inadequacy of risk mapping and 
management system adversely aﬀects 
the overall business operaons and 
relaonship with the customers.
Energy conservaon measures o?en 
involve  opmizing processes 
equipment and systems to operate 
more eﬃciently.
Implemenng energy conservaon 
measures can lead to signiﬁcant cost 
savings. 
Approach to capitalise 
opportunity:
Usage of eﬃcient and  
environment friendly 
products, soluons, services, 
technology, automaon &  
digitalizaon. 
Connual engagement,

constuted by the Board 
ensures that mely acons are 
taken on the actual and or 
potenal threats, so as to 
migate the adverse eﬀects.
­
Posi've:
Sasﬁed customers are more likely 
to connue purchasing products 
from the company, reducing 
customer churn, and increasing 
repeat sales.
Sasﬁed customers are more likely 
to make repeat purchases and 
potenally increase their spending 
with a manufacturer. This can lead 
to higher sales volumes and 
revenue growth
Nega've
Weak data integrity and cyber 
security mechanisms may lead to 
data breaches and loss of valuable 
data.
Improved producvity, reduced 
downme and streamlined 
operaons resulng in overall 
business eﬃciency and gains. 
Lowering of ulity bills and

improved proﬁtability.

As the Managing Director of Time Technoplast Limited, I am pleased to 
present our third Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report—a 
reﬂecon of our connued journey toward building a more 
responsible, inclusive, and sustainable enterprise. Over the past year, 
we have not only advanced our ESG goals but have also expanded our 
vision to align more deeply with the naonal and global sustainability 
agenda.
Sustainability is embedded at the core of our strategic decision­
making. We have consistently worked to minimize the environmental 
and social impact of our operaons by focusing on eﬃcient resource 
ulizaon, responsible innovaon, and stakeholder engagement. Our 
ESG roadmap connues to guide our acons, with focused eﬀorts on 
improving energy eﬃciency, strengthening water management, and 
ensuring zero waste to landﬁll across key sites.

goals. As part of Phase I, a greenﬁeld facility will be established in 
Gujarat, laying the foundaon for a naonwide iniave to 
revoluonize waste management and resource recovery.
We view this step not just as a business expansion, but as a 
responsibility to lead by example. It is our aspiraon that TEPL will 
encourage greater collaboraon among stakeholders, policymakers, 
and industry peers—driving collecve progress toward a cleaner and 
more resource­eﬃcient future.
Each year, we connue to strengthen our sustainability pracces, 
learning from experience and raising our standards. Our commitment 
to ESG is not a one­me iniave, but a connuous journey of 
improvement and accountability. With innovaon, collaboraon, and 
purpose­driven leadership, we remain focused on building a more 
sustainable and responsible future for all our stakeholders.
