Energy 
Management
Risk
The 
hospitality 
and 
entertainment parks industry 
(especially theme parks) is 
typically energy-intensive, as 
energy is required to operate 
the rides, lighting, fireworks and 
other facilities. Decisions made 
by a firm regarding the energy 
intensity 
of 
its 
operations 
and the sources from which it 
obtains its energy may vary over 
time, impact the organization’s 
operating efficiency and risk 
profile.
	
Imagicaa is having in-house green initiatives for 
rides and attractions optimum operations and 
thereby the energy consumption. 
	
Presently Imagicaa is having open access power 
arrangement for 8 MW renewable energy (solar 
and wind), through which more than 60% of 
power requirement is getting fulfilled. 
	
Imagicaa is setting up a 8MW captive solar 
project, which is presently in process and will be 
completed by October 2023.
	
Installed EV charging stations for the charging of 
Electric Vehicle.
	
Installed motion control lights as a part of energy 
management.

Water and 
Waste 
Management
Risk
Typically, waste is generated as 
part of a company’s operations, 
maintenance 
of 
machinery, 
office administrative work and 
food discard. Improper waste 
handling may contribute to 
air pollution, climate change 
and various direct and indirect 
impacts on the ecosystem. It 
may also cause health and safety 
risks to personnel exposed to 
the waste.
Non-compliance 
with 
waste 
management regulations may 
lead to the imposing of heavy 
fines.
Rapidly the climate is changing, hence proactive 
environmental action is necessary through Solid 
Waste Management as well as limiting use of water 
and recycling wherever feasible.   
	
Waste is segregated at the source with the 
assistance of color coded biodegradable garbage 
bags/bins into dry, wet & horticulture waste.
	
Park wide waste bins are highly visible and placed 
in easy to access spaces to encourage use.
	
Waste is collect and transport at the designated 
waste segregation yard.


Innovation
Opportunity
The entertainment industry has 
the potential for unleashing 
innovation 
amongst 
various 
talents. Product design and 
innovation can assist theme 
parks to stay competitive and 
relevant in an everchanging 
market. 
By 
embracing 
new 
designs 
paired 
with 
technologies, 
theme 
parks 
can tap advantage of new 
market opportunities and boost 
customer experience.
The management and promoters actively participate 
in trade fairs and industry gatherings to meet various 
manufacturers, innovators, technology providers etc. 
Apart from the same, there are periodic ‘think tanks’ 
sessions with the senior teams members & HODs for 
brainstorming on ideas and concepts which could be 
implemented across all sites.

Employee 
well-being, 
training and 
Retention 
Risk
Higher 
employee 
retention 
rates convey good company 
policies and practices. However, 
a high attrition rate indicates 
low employee satisfaction to 
investors. Ensuring employee 
well-being can boost employee 
morale and reduce hiring and 
onboarding costs.
Imagicaa 
values 
its 
employees 
and 
makes 
considerable efforts to come up with policies that 
benefits its employees
