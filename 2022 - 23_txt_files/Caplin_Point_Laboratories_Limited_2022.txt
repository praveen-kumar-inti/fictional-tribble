1 The Company follows the regulations and circulars issued by SEBI with respect to addressing of investor complaints and there is no specific 
policy in this regard. The Company has appointed M/s. Integrated Registry Management Services Private Limited to receive and dispose of 
complaints from shareholders in a time bound manner.
2 The complaints from employees mainly pertain to Health & Safety and Working Conditions related issues received through safety committee 
meetings which were taken up and closed on timely manner. Many of the complaints were actually suggestions for improvements which were 
taken up and resolved. Complaints which are pending as of the close of Financial Year has been resolved subsequently.
3 Some of the policies are internal in nature and hence has not been posted in the website though it provides for effective redressal of the 
relevant complaints. Policies that are available for external stakeholders are given in the Company’s website at https://www.caplinpoint.net/
index.php/corporate-governance/. 
24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues

(Indicate positive or negative

1
Developing a pipeline 
of talented workforce 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Inability to meet employees’ 
skill upgradation, career growth 
and welfare expectations would 
result 
in 
higher 
employee 
turnover. This is particularly 
so since the manufacturing 
and R&D operations of the 
Company are located in areas 
where strong competition exists 
for relevant skilled manpower. 
Hence, the Company considers 
nurturing internal talent by 
way of upskilling the present 
employees and creating an 
active talent pool by partnering 
with educational institutions 
as the two key initiatives in 
developing a talented and 
robust work force.
--
Positive.
Upskilling the workforce will 
scale up the knowledge and 
awareness 
towards 
good 
manufacturing and business 
practices 
which 
ensures 
compliance with all applicable 
norms and increases quality 
consciousness.
Creating a talent pool which 
can be readily absorbed into 
operations will empower those 
who are entering the industry 
fresh after their education. It will 
also ensure that the company’s 
operations do not suffer due 
to lack of adequate talented 
manpower. 
2
Social License to 
Operate 
 Opportunity Company’s business growth 
and growing economic foot print 
requires increasing acceptance 
of the Company’s fair practices 
and procedures by all the 
stakeholders and in particular 
the community at large where 
the Company operates. 
--
Positive.
Strong Social License to Operate 
will create trust among the 
stakeholders 
and 
enhance 
corporate credibility in the eyes 
of investors.

Risk of Non 
Compliance to 
environment/ health 
& safety regulations 
 Risk
Pharmaceutical manufacturing 
processes falls under the ambit 
of Hazardous processes which 
requires 
strict 
compliances 
and 
stringent 
compliance 
requirements 
increases 
the risk caused due to any 
deviance.
The 
Company 
implements 
measures 
to 
both 
adapt 
and 
mitigate 
risks 
arising 
due 
to 
evolving 
Compliance 
requirements.
Adapting is done by evaluating 
the specific actions to be taken by 
the Company to comply with the 
requirements including change in 
business processes, upgrading/ 
modifying operating procedures 
to meet compliance requirements 
and evaluating Compliance risks 
as part of the Risk Management 
process of the Company.
Mitigating involves a strategy of 
identifying all applicable Acts, 
creating comprehensive checklist 
of 
compliances, 
obtaining 
assurance of compliance through 
internal sources like internal 
compliance audits/ verifications 
and external sources like Internal 
Audit verifications, drawing down 
an action plan for remedying 
non-compliances and escalating 
significant instances of non-
compliances to appropriate levels 
for remedial action.
Negative.
Non-compliance 
may 
have 
detrimental 
effects, 
such 
as financial loss and loss of 
reputation.

Risk of engagement 
with such value 
chain partners who 
do not share the 
vision of sustainable 
development and 
environmental goals
 Risk 
Due to the nature of business, 
Company needs to engage 
with diverse range of value 
chain partners. To ensure that 
those who form the part of the 
value chain are in line with 
the manufacturing standards, 
environmental 
goals 
and 
sustainability objectives of the 
company is a complex task. 
But, the risk of deviation in 
any part of the value chain will 
have significant impact on both 
the sustainability and business 
performance of the Company.
The Company follows a strategy 
of contractually enforcing key 
sustainability goals through its 
sourcing contracts with the value 
chain partners. The Company is 
also subject to similar covenants 
in contracts with its Customers in 
regulated markets which specify 
explicit measures to be taken to 
comply with the environmental 
goals 
and 
sustainability 
objectives. These covenants are 
tracked for performance to avoid 
breach.
Negative.
Risk 
of 
violation 
by 
value 
chain partners will have both 
sustainability 
and 
business 
impact. Breach of contractual 
terms with customers may lead 
to claims.

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements:
The Company is dedicated to conducting its operations and business affairs honestly, morally, and in compliance with all applicable laws and 
ethical principles. However, the Company is also well aware that ESG is not just about meeting the ethical standards and ensuring compliances 
but also about how we incorporate sustainability and social responsibility in to our strategy and decision making process so that the steps we take 
considers the holistic benefits to all the stakeholders.
Towards this, the Company will take further steps to strengthen ESG integration into its decision making process and we will also take steps to 
measure the impact of ESG initiatives for interventions wherever required.
As elsewhere specified in the report, the main challenge remains how we will also bring in the value chain partners into this ESG journey on which 
we had embarked upon. This will be addressed by a multi-pronged strategy like extending the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, Whistle Blower 
mechanism etc to value chain partners, imposing ESG obligations through contractual clauses etc.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes. The Company has plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by retrofitting equipments that use fuel to generate power. Also, change in 
fuel used will be explored to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the Gummidipoondi manufacturing unit, as on 31st March, 2023, 48.89% 
of power utilised was solar power. Similarly, in the Corporate Office, out of the total power consumed, as of 31st March, 2023, 86.47% is from 
renewable energy source. Increasing the proportion of renewable energy utilization will prevent the depletion of natural resources by reducing the 
consumption of coal or other natural resources used to generate power. We are looking forward to reduce our dependency on purchased electricity 
which in turn will have direct impact on our initiatives for incorporating environment friendly and sustainable practices in our operations. Following 
further actions were taken:
	
Installation of heat pump based water heating system which has resulted in an estimated reduction in electricity consumption by 24,145 KWH 
/ Year
	
Steam condensate water transferring to the boiler condensate pump capacity increased, which in turn reduces the water makeup of the boiler 
and fuel consumption.
	
Pumping condensate water near to the boiling point reducing fuel consumption during generation of steam.
