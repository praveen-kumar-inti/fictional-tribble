LETTER FROM MANAGING DIRECTOR
Letter from the Managing Director
Choice has concluded yet another ﬁscal year, and it has 
proven to be an extraordinary period for us in terms of our 
ﬁnancial expansion and reaching unprecedented 
achievements. As we wrap up the ﬁnancial year, we, at 
Choice, have numerous reasons to rejoice. We have not only 
accomplished our targets but also surpassed them, instilling 
in us the determination to strive even harder in the coming 
ﬁscal year. At Choice, we have consistently adhered to the 
principles set forth by our esteemed Founder Promoter, ‘Shri 
Sunil Patodia Ji’. This steadfast commitment has consistently 
propelled us to surpass our performance expectations. 
Against a backdrop of soaring inﬂation, 
rigorous monetary tightening, and 
increased uncertainties, the present 
economic downturn has impeded the 
speed of post-COVID-19 recovery, 
placing numerous nations, including both 
developed and developing ones, at risk 
of recession in 2023.
I feel proud to announce that this year we ended with a 
Revenue of Rs. 3,952 Mn, a growth of 38% and a PAT of Rs. 
601 Mn, a growth of 12%. All our businesses have delivered 
excellent performance with the Broking & Distribution 
contributing 58% to the overall revenues, followed by the 
Advisory business, contributing 32% and the NBFC business 
contributed around 10% to our revenues. We have 
consistently delivered strong growth every year with the 
revenue growing at a 3 Year CAGR of 44% and PAT growing 
at a 3 Year CAGR of 69%. In this ﬁnancial year, EBITDA stood 
at Rs. 1,087 Mn, growing at a 3 Year CAGR of 41%. 
Despite the headwinds in the industry, our Broking business 
stood strong and we have successfully ended the year with a

total of 680k demat accounts. The number of active clients for 
the industry has been subdued due to volatility in the stock 
market, however, we are pleased to announce that Choice 
has held its 16th rank as per NSE’s active (UCC) list. 
The AUM for the Mutual Fund business stood at Rs 3,635 Mn, 
a growth of 11% YoY. We have successfully added more 
products in our Wealth division and are seeing an active 
traction from the customers. Choice Insurance Broking has 
exhibited phenomenal growth, clocked in a total premium 
of Rs. 535 Mn with a total of 17,171 policies sold in FY23.
 
One of the prime focus this year was our NBFC business, 
which was launched full-ﬂedged in June, and we ended 
with a total loan book at Rs. 2,356 Mn and a retail loan book 
of Rs. 1,105 Mn. Our Advisory business is growing steadily and 
has an order book of Rs. 3.80 Bn. We can proudly say that 
we have a family of 31,252 Choice Business Associates 
executing our services on the ground level.
Every year has been a phenomenal year for us where we 
are successful in exceeding our targets. This motivates us to 
set new targets for ourselves and help Choice reach a level 
where we are one of the top most ﬁnancial services 
institution in the country. We strongly believe that our 
agenda for ﬁnancial inclusion is not just a business strategy, 
but a mission that we truly want to achieve.
I would like to thank all Stakeholders, business partners and 
employees for their constant support and for believing in us. 
We at Choice constantly strive to create shareholder wealth 
and we will continue to do so in the years to come. Your faith 
in us is what drives us to deliver our best.
Looking ahead, I am conﬁdent that our continued 
dedication to our mission and our commitment to providing 
the highest level of customer service will enable us to 
achieve our ﬁnancial targets and continue to make a 
positive impact on the lives of people across India.

LETTER FROM JOINT MANAGING DIRECTOR
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global 
growth is expected to decelerate from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% 
in 2023, followed by a rebound to 3.1% in 2024. Despite 
uncertainties on the global scale, inﬂation remains 
persistently high in many countries. The average global 
inﬂation rate is predicted to be 5.2% in 2023, down from the 
two-decade high of 7.5% in 2022. Asian economies are 
projected to drive most of the global growth in 2023, 
beneﬁting from ongoing reopening efforts and relatively 
lower inﬂationary pressures compared to other regions. 
Indian economy is anticipated to achieve stable growth in 
2023, propelled by factors such as private consumption, 
private investment, and government initiatives aimed at 
improving infrastructure and the business environment. 
Indian ﬁnancial services industry is 
expected to continue to grow and evolve 
in 2023, with digital products and services, 
ﬁntech, and digital banking playing a key 
role in driving growth and innovation. 
India has emerged as one of the fastest-
growing ﬁntech markets in the world, 
with a market size estimated at $150 
billion by 2025. The growth of ﬁnancial 
services and the ﬁntech space is 
expected to continue, with sustained 
growth across the industry. 
Choice has been continuing to grow with the same 
momentum every year. This year our yearly revenue has 
exceeded expectations of our initial projections. FY23 was a 
year of consolidation. All the efforts taken during the year 
will pace us for the phenomenal growth expected in the 
coming years. Our Broking business stood strong and we 
have successfully added 217k Demat accounts this year 
Our Broking business

which was a growth of 47% YoY. Our wealth advisory 
business has been expanding with a mutual fund AUM 
growth of 11% YoY. The Insurance business has been growing 
exponentially with increasing awareness and ease of 
buying insurance policy, we have sold more than 17K 
insurance policies this year and this number is growing every 
day. 
Our primary emphasis this year revolved around our NBFC 
business, and we are delighted to announce that we have 
successfully assembled a robust team and developed a 
user-friendly application called "Choice Money." This 
initiative aims to facilitate our shift from institutional lending 
to retail lending. This year we ended with a total loan book 
at Rs. 2,356 Mn and a retail loan book of Rs. 1,105 Mn. 
We are pleased to announce that our Advisory business is 
experiencing steady growth and currently holds an order 
book worth Rs. 3.80 billion. This vertical offers signiﬁcant 
growth potential as we have established ourselves as a 
reliable partner for the Government, ensuring seamless 
project execution at the grassroots level.
As I envision the future of Choice International, a feeling of 
enthusiasm and positivity engulfs me. Our recent 
expansions mark the initial stages of our endeavour to 
introduce ground-breaking ﬁnancial solutions to individuals 
throughout India. We are dedicated to extending our 
services to every part of the nation, guaranteeing ﬁnancial 
inclusion for all. This commitment drives us forward with 
great anticipation for what lies ahead.

LETTER FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
We ended the year with
an active client base of 
211k and a total of 680k 
demat accounts all while 
maintaining our 16th
rank this year as well, 
as per NSE’s active 
(UCC) list. 
As we complete the ﬁnancial year, we at Choice 
have a lot to celebrate.  The past year has been a 
great success for us, with the company achieving 
its ﬁnancial goals and reaching new heights. FY23 
was a year of consolidation. All the efforts taken 
during the year will pace us for the phenomenal 
growth expected in the coming years. 
Our mission is to empower individuals and 
businesses and provide innovative ﬁnancial 
solutions that help them achieve their goals. We 
believe that access to transparent and affordable 
ﬁnancial services is crucial for inclusive growth and 
development, and we're committed to making it a 
reality for millions of people across the country.
Over the years, we have built a reputation for 
excellence and integrity, and our customers trust us 
to deliver quality services that meet their evolving 
needs. With a strong presence in key markets and 
a talented team of professionals, we're well-
positioned to drive growth and value for all our 
stakeholders.
As we reﬂect on our extraordinary achievements 
during FY23, we do not rest on our laurels. Choice 
International Ltd is determined to lead the charge 
towards a future where ﬁnancial inclusion is a 
reality for all, regardless of their location or 
background. With our strong and ever expanding 
network of Choice Business Associates, we will be 
able to increase accessibility of ﬁnancial services 
across the country especially in the tier III and 
beyond regions.
In the recent quarters, the brokerage industry has 
experienced a notable shift in its structure. The 
focus has moved from aggressive client acquisition 
to maintaining proﬁtability in the face of rising 
compliance costs, all while improving unit 
economics. Particularly in the retail broking 
segment, we have witnessed a signiﬁcant increase 
in dynamism. The entry of new players, digitization, 
disruptive technologies, and regulatory changes 
have completely transformed the way business is 
conducted.
We ended the year with an active client base of 
211k and a total of 680k demat accounts all while 
maintaining our 16th rank this year as well, as per NSE’s active 
(UCC) list. With the increase in ﬁnancial literacy in the country 
and more awareness amongst the youth, we expect this 
number to increase in the coming years. 
Mutual Fund industry has seen a surge in investor 
participation especially from the youth in the recent years. 
Factors such as favorable market conditions, strong 
performance of mutual funds, broad range of investment 
options and the availability of online investment platforms 
have contributed to the growth of AUM. We have expanded 
our ﬂeet of products and offerings under this vertical to 
cover the entire gamut of services. This segment has seen a 
growth of 11% YoY with our monthly SIP book increasing to 
Rs. 43 million, representing a 39% YoY growth and is 
expected to expand more going forward. Additionally, we 
have witnessed a signiﬁcant increase in the number of 
clients availing our wealth services, which has grown by 
184% over the past three years.
Another core business vertical, which is Insurance broking 
has demonstrated signiﬁcant growth this year and we are 
aggressively growing this vertical every quarter. We ended 
the year with around 17,171 policies sold and generating a 
premium of Rs. 535 Mn. We are proud to announce 
partnership with Government of Maharashtra under the 
Gopinath Munde Shetakari Accident Insurance Scheme to 
settle insurance claims. Under the scheme, we will be 
serving over 3 crore farmers in Maharashtra, which is in line 
with our vision of meeting the requirements of the 
underserved population of India. 
The major highlight for FY23 for our Broking & Distribution 
business was our initiative to transform the ‘Jiffy’ App into a 
Super App ‘Choice FinX’ in October. With cutting-edge 
technology it provides a simpliﬁed investing experience for 
users. This has enabled us to offer users the ability to 
leverage and easily invest in a variety of ﬁnancial 
instruments all in one place, which has led to the major 
growth in users in the second half of the ﬁnancial year.
Our NBFC business, which was our prime focus this year is 
going to be one of the most growing business for the next 
ﬁnancial year as well. This year we ended with a total loan 
book of Rs. 2,356 Mn and a growing retail loan book. We 
also started digital lending for retail during the quarter two 
with a focus on Tier 3-5 cities, which received a very 
encouraging initial response. Our retail Loan book stood at 
Rs 22.3 Mn within the ﬁrst 15 days of launch. We aim to serve 
the MSME sector and serve 10X more MSME customers in 
the underserved geographies in the next three years.
The Advisory business is standing strong and we have 
successfully won many projects this year and have 
maintained a robust order book in FY23. This is expected to 
grow in the coming ﬁnancial years. Our focus is to assist the 
government in executing projects on the grassroot level. We 
are working closely with the government on their Mission 
projects to ensure the service delivery to the last mile 
beneﬁciary. We are poised for a higher growth with strong 
credentials, digniﬁed talent pool and technology at core for 
operational efﬁciency in the upcoming quarters.
In today's fast-paced world, embracing digital innovation is 
not just an option; it's a necessity. At Choice International Ltd, 
we recognize the signiﬁcance of technology in transforming 
lives and enhancing ﬁnancial accessibility. That's why our 
major focus is on digital ﬁnancial services product 
development.
As the CEO of this organization, I couldn't be prouder of our 
team's dedication and relentless pursuit of excellence. The 
past year has been nothing short of remarkable, as our 
company soared to new heights and achieved its ﬁnancial 
objectives with resounding success. We have entered the 
new ﬁnancial year with great enthusiasm and zeal.
Our journey has just begun, and the road ahead is brimming 
with possibilities. We owe our success to our esteemed 
clients, dedicated employees, and supportive stakeholders. 
Together, we will continue to drive change and build a 
legacy of empowerment that transcends generations.
Thank you for being a part of our journey, and we look 
forward to creating a brighter, more inclusive future for 
everyone.

Global Economy FY23
The Global economy is poised for growth on the surface, for a gradual recovery from the powerful blows of the pandemic and Russia’s 
unprovoked war on Ukraine. China is rebounding strongly following the reopening of its economy. Supply-chain disruptions are unwinding, 
while the dislocations to energy and food markets caused by the war are receding. Simultaneously, the massive and synchronous tightening 
of monetary policy by most Central Banks should start to bear fruit, with inflation moving back toward its targets. 
The baseline forecast is for growth to fall from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, before settling at 3.0% in 2024. Advanced economies are 
expected to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. Global real GDP growth should pick up 
steam in 2024 to 2.5% and be more evenly distributed among regions. Tailwinds to growth in 2024 will largely come from fading shocks 
related to the pandemic, elevated inflation, and monetary policy tightening.

As per the latest industry research, some of the key drivers of global economic growth in 2023:
Management Discussion 
and Analysis
“Your preferred Choice to financial prosperity”
1.	
Asian economies: Asian economies are expected to drive 
most of the global growth in 2023, as they benefit from 
ongoing reopening dynamics and less restrictive monetary 
policies 
2.	
China’s re-opening: The global economy is set to grow by 
1.6% in 2023, driven largely by China’s re-opening following 
a prolonged period of lockdowns and strong expected 
growth 
3.	
Investment growth: Investment growth in emerging market 
and developing economies is predicted to remain below its 
average rate of the past two decades. Overall, investment 
growth is projected to decelerate markedly from 4% in 
2022 to 0.9% in 2023 
4.	
Monetary policy tightening: Tight monetary policy acts as a 
break on economic activity and will likely lead to increases 
in unemployment rates in various economies, particularly in 
Europe and the US
5.	
Global shocks: Any additional adverse shocks could 
push the global economy into recession. Small states 
are especially vulnerable to such shocks because of 
their reliance on external trade and financing, limited 
diversification, elevated debt, and susceptibility to natural 
disasters 
The forecast for the next decade indicates a prolonged period 
of disruption and uncertainty for businesses, but it also presents 
potential opportunities. Once the regional recessions of 2022-
2023 conclude, global growth will revert to a slower trajectory, 
with mature markets playing a smaller role in global GDP. 
However, there are still prospects for companies to invest in 
both mature markets, leveraging their wealth and the need for 
innovation to offset declining labor forces, as well as emerging 
markets, which require both physical and digital infrastructure to 
support their substantial and youthful labor forces.
Share of Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and 
Industrials to aggregate corporate earnings to 
rise over the next two years: 
Global growth slowdown and China’s zero COVID policy severely 
weighed on commodity prices during the year. Consequently, 
there has been a meaningful dip in the share of Materials and 
Energy to aggregate corporate earnings estimates of top 200 
companies in FY23. For instance, Materials accounted for ~21% of 
the aggregate earnings for top 200 companies in FY22, which 
is expected to drop to 11.5% in FY23, rising modestly to 12.5% in 
FY24 amid expectations of revival in Chinese economy. Utility 
companies are also expected to see a drop in their share in 
overall corporate earnings of these 200 companies. The reduced 
share of these sectors to aggregate corporate earnings during 
this period is expected to be taken over by Financials, Consumer 
Discretionary, and Industrials. Clearly, the earnings trajectory 
over the next two years hinges on persistence of consumption 
and investment demand.

public/inline-files/Market_Pulse_April%202023.pdf)
To ensure long-term growth, key strategies involve diversifying 
into new business sectors, fortifying corporate culture, embracing 
digital transformation and automation, recruiting talent with 
novel skills not currently represented in the organization, and 
optimizing the hybrid work model where appropriate. 
(IMF 2023 World Economic Outlook April 2023).
https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-economic-
outlook 
We are entering a precarious phase characterized by below-
average economic growth and increased financial risks, while 
inflation has not yet definitively changed its course. It is now 
more important than ever for policymakers to exercise caution 
and communicate clearly. The appropriate course of action 
depends on the condition of the financial system.
As long as the financial system remains reasonably stable, as it 
is currently, monetary policy should focus on reducing inflation. 
A positive aspect is that the banking turmoil will naturally slow 
overall economic activity as banks reduce lending due to rising 
funding costs and the need to act more cautiously. This, in itself, 
should partially alleviate the necessity for further tightening of 
monetary policy.

Indian Economy
India’s economy has rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But the Russia-Ukraine conflict has triggered inflationary 
pressures and prompted central banks, including India’s, to 
reverse ultra-loose monetary policy adopted during the 
pandemic.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects India’s GDP 
to grow by 5.9% in 2023. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
projects growth in India’s gross domestic product (GDP) to 
moderate to 6.4% in fiscal year (FY) 2023 ending on 31 March 
2024 and rise to 6.7% in FY2024. India to witness GDP growth 
of 6.0 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 2023-24, depending on the 
trajectory of economic and political developments globally. 
Economic survey 2022-23 projects a baseline GDP growth of 
6.5 per cent in real terms in FY24.
The World Bank has revised its FY23-24 GDP forecast to 
6.3 percent from 6.6 percent (December 2022). Growth is 
expected to be constrained by slower consumption growth

and challenging external conditions. Rising borrowing costs 
and slower income growth will weigh on private consumption 
growth, and government consumption is projected to grow at a 
slower pace due to the withdrawal of pandemic-related fiscal 
support measures. 
While betting on consumption-driven growth is obvious given 
India’s large, young, and rising share of the upper middle–
income population (with a high propensity to spend), however, 
investment will play a crucial role over the next two years. It 
is through investments that India will gain the necessary 
momentum to embark on a sustained path of growth driven by 
domestic demand for many decades to come.  
Although headline inflation is elevated, it is projected to decline 
to an average of 5.2 percent in FY23/24, amid easing global 
commodity prices and some moderation in domestic demand. 
The Reserve Bank of India’s has withdrawn accommodative 
measures to rein in inflation by hiking the policy interest 
rate. India’s financial sector also remains strong, buoyed by 
improvements in asset quality and robust private-sector credit 
growth. 
Despite the global economic slowdown, India’s exports have 
performed well, likely due to the depreciated currency in relation 
to the US dollar. While goods exports have remained moderate, 
there has been a remarkable surge of 30% in India’s services 
exports between April and February. This significant growth 
can be attributed to various factors such as the global push 
for digitization, cost-cutting measures adopted by businesses 
to navigate the anticipated slowdown, and the rising trend of 
remote work. These factors have led to an increased demand 
for service exports, particularly in the technology sector, where 
India holds a comparative advantage. 
Interestingly, the share of business and professional services 
in the overall services exports has also expanded. Companies 
worldwide now prefer to outsource a wide range of professions, 
including accounting, audit, research and development, 
quality assurance, and after-sales service. This preference for 
outsourcing has contributed to the growth of India’s services 
exports, further bolstering its position in the global market. 
India is set to become the world’s fastest-growing major 
economy in 2023, with an investment boom likely. Growth 
is expected to be brisk in FY24 as a vigorous credit disbursal, 
and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold in India 
with the strengthening of the balance sheets of the corporate 
and banking sectors. Further support to economic growth will 
come from the expansion of public digital platforms and path-
breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics 
Policy, and the Production-Linked Incentive schemes to boost 
manufacturing output. 
Indian Financial Sector
India’s financial services sector is a significant contributor to 
the country’s economy and also one of the fastest growing 
sector. The sector in India comprises commercial banks, 
insurance companies, non-banking financial companies, co-
operatives, pension funds, mutual funds, and other smaller 
financial entities. 
As of January 2023, AUM managed by the mutual funds 
industry stood at Rs. 39.62 trillion (USD 478.08 billion). Inflow in 
India’s mutual fund schemes via systematic investment plan (SIP) 
stood at Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (USD 18.09 billion). Equity mutual funds 
registered a net inflow of Rs. 22.16 trillion (USD 294.15 billion) by 
end of December 2021. The net inflows were USD 888 million (Rs 
7,303.39 crore) in December as compared to a 21-month low of 
USD 274.8 million (Rs 2,258.35 crore) in November 2022. 
Another crucial component of India’s financial industry is the 
insurance industry. The insurance industry has been expanding 
at a fast pace. The total first-year premium of life insurance 
companies reached USD 32.04 billion in FY23. In FY23 (until 
December 2022) non-life insurance sector premiums reached 
at Rs. 1.87 lakh crore (USD 22.5 billion).  
Furthermore, India’s leading bourse, Bombay Stock Exchange 
(BSE), will set up a joint venture with Ebix Inc to build a robust 
insurance distribution network in the country through a new 
distribution exchange platform. In FY23, USD 7.17 billion was 
raised across 40 initial public offerings (IPOs). The number of 
companies listed on the NSE increased from 135 in 1995 to 2,113 
by FY23 (till December 2022). 
According to the statistics by the Futures Industry Association 
(FIA), a derivatives trade association, the National Stock 
Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) emerged as the world’s largest 
derivatives exchange in 2020 in terms number of contracts 
traded. NSE was ranked 4th worldwide in cash equities by 
number of trades as per the statistics maintained by the World 
Federation of Exchanges (WFE) for CY2020.
Indian Capital Markets
Direct retail participation in Indian equities has risen 
meaningfully in last couple of years, which can be witnessed 
in huge inflows in secondary markets, increase in new investor 
registrations and surge in retail share in the overall cash market 
turnover. In the last eight fiscal years, retail investors have been 
net buyers for last three years. During this period, they have 
invested nearly Rs 2.8 Tn (As on March 31st, 2023) in equities 
directly through secondary markets, of which Rs 1.6 Tn has been 
invested in FY2021-22.
FIIs turned buyers of Indian equities in 2023: In the initial half 
of 2022, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were significant 
sellers, but they transitioned into buyers during the latter half. 
The Indian equity market’s valuations appeared relatively 
stretched, while Asian peers, particularly China, displayed 
improved growth prospects after reopening their economy. 
As a result, FIIs decided to withdraw some investments during 
the first two months of 2023, leading to a net outflow of USD 
4.2 Bn during this period. The comparative underperformance 
of Indian equities in relation to global counterparts 
caused the valuation premium of Indian equities over the 
broader Emerging Market pack to decrease substantially. 
Consequently, Indian equities regained their appeal, enticing 
FIIs to become modest buyers again, resulting in net inflows 
of USD 967 Mn in March 2023. Throughout the fiscal year, 
FIIs remained significant sellers of Indian equities, with net 
outflows totalling USD 5.1 Bn. 
FIIs’ participation in Indian debt remained muted: During 
the majority of 2022, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were 
sellers in the Indian debt market, except for August 2022 and 
September 2022. This shift in behaviour was a result of the 
narrowing spreads between Indian bonds and global bonds. 
However, in the beginning of the New Year, FIIs became modest 
buyers, with net inflows of USD 736 Mn during the first two 
months of 2023. However, their buying spree was short-lived, as 
they resumed selling in March, leading to net outflows of USD 
307 Mn. For the fiscal year 2023, FIIs sold Indian debt worth USD 
1.1 Bn on a net basis, a significant contrast to the net inflow of 
USD 268 Mn witnessed in FY22. 
DII continued to remain buyers in March 2023: Since March 
2021, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have consistently 
shown strong interest in Indian equities. In 2021, DIIs invested 
Rs876 billion, followed by a substantial increase to Rs2.7 trillion 
in 2022. This positive trend continued into 2023, with net inflows 
of Rs832 billion in just the first three months, of which Rs305 
billion was invested in March 2023. This ongoing momentum has 
been supported by robust retail inflows through the Systematic 
Investment Plan (SIP) route. Throughout FY23, DIIs demonstrated 
a robust investment in equities, with net inflows amounting to 
a significant Rs2.6 trillion, in contrast to the net inflows of Rs2.1 
trillion observed during the same period in FY22. 
Retail investors moderated significantly in FY23: Retail inflows 
in FY2022-23 were the lowest in last 3 years to touch Rs 492 bn 
as compared to robust inflows of Rs1, 649 Bn in FY2021-22 and 
Rs 684 bn in FY2020-21. The year 2022 witnessed decreased 
direct participation by retail investors in equities and increased 
investments in mutual funds resulting in growth in SIP flows. 
FO turnover registered a growth of 11.4% YoY to touch Rs 405 
Tn in FY23. While equity futures turnover registered a decline of 
3% YoY, the growth in FO segment was led by equity options, 
registering a growth of 72% YoY in the premium turnover. The 
average daily turnover in equity derivatives segment during the 
year, however, increased by 10.9% MoM to touch Rs 1,626 Bn vs 
Rs 1,466 Bn in the previous fiscal. 
Currency derivatives turnover surged 43.5% YoY in FY23 to touch 
Rs102trn, led by trading in futures in contracts. While turnover 
of currency futures contracts nearly doubled on a YoY basis, 
currency options premium turnover remained flat. However, 
the growth rate in average daily turnover was slightly higher at 
41.7% YoY during the fiscal.

Maharashtra continues to lead in terms of new investor 
registrations in FY23 despite the sharp drop: Out of 13.3 Mn 
new investor registrations in FY23, Maharashtra continued to 
lead with 2 Mn registrations, accounting for 15.4% share. Uttar 
Pradesh grabbed the second spot with 1.8 Mn new registrations, 
dropping 3.7% YoY and accounting for 13.6% of the total new 
registrations. This was followed by Gujarat, Rajasthan, West 
Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh at 6.3%, 6%, 5.8% and 5.7% share

third time in a row with a 5% share and a 46% YoY drop in new

Equity Mutual Funds AUM saw a jump in FY23
Strong inflows into equity mutual funds via the SIP route, relative 
outperformance vis-à-vis other asset classes including debt and 
limited redemptions have all resulted in equity AUM rising sharply 
in FY23. Interestingly, equity AUM surpassed that of debt for the 
first time in 2022, with nearly 10 percentage points increase in its 
share to the industry’s AUM since the pandemic. Debt funds, on 
the other hand, were impacted by a steep rise in interest rates 
last year, leading to its AUM falling by ~7% in FY23. In fact, its 
share in the overall MF AUM has dropped from 50%+ around the 
onset of the pandemic to ~33% currently. Share of Hybrid and 
other schemes has also been rising over the last two years with 
its AUM increasing 145% to Rs12.1 Tn since the pandemic.

Jump in equity AUM aided by strong SIP inflows: Indirect 
participation has picked up meaningfully since the pandemic, as 
reflected in a steady increase in retail inflows into mutual funds 
via the SIP route. Monthly SIP inflows increased by a strong 20% 
YoY but remained broadly flat on a MoM basis at Rs 137bn in 
Feb’23. Average monthly SIP run rate during the 11 months of

Technology: A Game Changer for the Financial services 
industry
Indian financial sector is expected to see investments in 
technology to replace legacy alternatives and the importance 
of AI and ML will be on the rise. India is positioned to become 
one of the largest digital markets with rapid expansion of mobile 
and internet, with over 2,100 fintechs operating currently.
Pandemic, with restrictions in physical banking & insurance 
services propelled the adoption of digital tools, and incumbents 
responded by ramping up their technology transformation 
efforts revitalizing the digital channels.
Financial services firms are keen on a non-branch acquisition 
and service approach, over the past few years they have been 
focusing on a digital-first omni-channel experience and now, they 
are also venturing into deep tech avenues like metaverse and 
web 3.0 which may the customer experience in the time to come.
API-based brokerage firms are leading this trend by offering APIs 
to manage end-to-end flows including opening of accounts, 
funding, trading, management, and market data. Even asset 
management companies are increasingly using AI. A study 
by JPMorgan from 2020, reveals that the algorithmic trading 
market is projected to experience substantial growth, estimated 
at USD 4 billion by 2024. This growth would result in the total 
volume of algorithmic trades reaching USD 19 billion. It is evident 
that AI has surpassed human intelligence in various aspects 
that may exceed our imagination. The increased adoption of 
AI has significantly enhanced decision-making capabilities. 
Furthermore, there has been a significant rise in the number of 
predictions and forecasts utilizing data analysis and machine 
learning (ML) techniques. These advancements highlight the 
transformative impact of AI on the trading industry.

Our Journey
Industry Trends:
The brokerage industry generated a revenue of INR 382.00 Bn in 
FY 2023, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
of ~13.73% from FY 2019 to FY 2023.
Close to 25 million demat accounts were added in FY23, at a 
monthly average of over 2 million despite lackluster returns and 
sustained volatility in the market.
The brokerage industry in India is transitioning to a fee-based 
model, from the earlier transaction-based one. With this shift, 
brokers are now offering new services, including investment and 
wealth management advisory. 
There is also an increased focus on fund-based activities, such as 
margin funding. This is helping broker firms generate sustainable 
earnings. They are also expanding the range of products and 
services to strengthen client relationships.
The shift of trading platforms from offline to a mix of online and 
offline modes resulted in higher revenues for full-service brokers. 
The increase in the activity in equity markets since the beginning 
of the pandemic was driven by robust corporate earnings, 
favourable liquidity in both international and domestic markets, 
higher internet penetration, and retail participation.
In the post-COVID era, Technological advancements have 
brought smart features, such as e-KYC, order management 
systems, analytical and charting tools and much more, to ease 
the investment journey for retail traders. With today’s investor 
being immensely tech-savvy and expecting cutting-edge tech 
solutions for all their needs, brokers are increasingly investing in 
technology.
Post Covid, the broking industry witnessed a substantial surge 
in client accretion competitive pricing, increased marketing and 
digital offerings. There was substantial participation from new 
to market customers from tier-II/III and beyond. However, after 
reaching a peak of ~3.66 crore in June 2022, active clients have 
declined and reached ~3.35 crore in January 2023, owing to a 
large number of clients onboarded earlier being inactive.(3)

Industry Trend:
The insurance industry in India is expected to witness significant 
growth and transformation in 2023, driven by various factors 
such as the increasing adoption of digital technologies, 
regulatory measures, and changing customer preferences. Here 
are some of the trends that are expected to shape the industry 
in 2023.
The Indian insurance market is predicted to reach $200 billion 
by 2027, providing ample opportunities for all insurance players 
to grow (1).
The IPO of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India was the 
largest IPO ever in India and the sixth biggest IPO globally of 
2022. As of November 2022, listing of LIC accounted for more 
than a third of resources mobilized in the primary equity market 
until November 2022.
The insurance sector has pushed insurance companies to adopt 
strategies to remain relevant in a digital-first economy. The 
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority India (IRDAI) 
has unveiled a slew of measures to boost the growth in the 
insurance sector, including the introduction of Bima Sugam, a 
one-stop online platform that will allow insurers to sell products 
directly to customers.
In 2023, the drive for cross-selling & Upsell is likely go hand in 
hand with the growing need for personalized insurance plans 
and premiums. Customers will choose customized insurance 
plans over currently available ‘off-the-shelf products’ in this 
digital economy. In the long run, it is anticipated that P2P 
insurance, flexible coverage options, and microinsurance will be 
the best options.
The adoption of innovative “Customer-First strategies” will 
significantly change how the industry conducts business and 
shapes the customer experience landscape.
The insurance industry is under pressure to keep up with the 
pace of change. New entrants in the form of digital-first insurers 
and innovative start-ups to the market are offering new products 
and services at a much faster rate than incumbent insurers. This 
means that enhancing speed to market with better integrations 
and low-code tools is a must

Industry Trends:
Mutual Fund industry has seen a surge in investor participation 
especially from the youth in the recent years. Factors such as 
favorable market conditions, strong performance of mutual 
funds, broad range of investment options and the availability 
of online investment platforms have contributed to the growth 
of AUM. Some of the key trends that are expected to shape the 
industry in 2023
The India Mutual Fund Industry Market is predicted to develop at 
a CAGR of 22.5% until 2028 (1)
Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds jumped 31% sequentially 
to 205.34 billion rupees ($2.51 billion) in March 2023, the highest 
in 12 months (2)
Contributions to systematic investment plans (SIPs) rose over 4% 
to a record 142.76 billion rupees from 136.86 billion rupees. Over 
700,000 new SIP accounts were opened in March (3)
Numerous governments, regulatory bodies, and other authorities 
are expected to strengthen and develop their current mutual 
fund industries. Additionally, regulatory bodies keep looking for 
ways to work with e-wallets, e-commerce distribution, and 
other comparable platforms to increase the reach of mutual 
funds
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds are 
becoming increasingly popular among Indian investors. As more 
and more investors are becoming conscious of the impact of 
their investments on the environment and society, mutual fund 
companies are now offering more ESG fund options to attract 
these investors.
With the growing popularity of ETFs, mutual fund companies 
are now offering more options to attract these investors. More 
than 160 ETFs are on the offer currently.

2. NBFC Services:
Our main focus and driver of growth in the upcoming years 
have been the NBFC business. We firmly believe that the 
potential in this sector is immense, and we are highly confident 
in our ability to achieve substantial growth in this area. The 
business experienced significant growth in FY23, marking a year 
of progress for us in this domain.
During the financial year, we achieved significant milestones in 
our NBFC business. We successfully pivoted into retail lending 
by launching our Choice Money app, catering to the borrowing 
needs of MSMEs in a smooth, timely, and affordable manner. 
Our retail lending products focused on MSME Business Loans, 
Commercial Vehicle Loans, and Supply Chain Finance. Our 
primary target market was MSMEs located in Tier-3 and below 
geographies.
This year we ended with a total loan book of Rs. 2,356 Mn and 
a retail loan book of Rs. 1,105 Mn. We started digital lending for 
retail during the second quarter of this year with a focus on Tier 
3-5 cities, which received a very encouraging initial response. 
Our retail Loan book reached Rs 22.3 Mn within the first 15 days 
of launch.
We have built a strong team and an easy to use application – 
‘Choice Money’ to facilitate our transformation from institutional 
lending to retail lending. Choice Money has successfully picked 
up with more and more disbursements through the app.  With 
the use of technology and our proprietary credit underwriting 
system, we show the initial loan offer to the customer within 
seconds on our mobile app and are committed to disburse the 
loan within 24 hours of detailed and physical verification. We are 
backed by the lenders like State Bank of India, NabSamruddhi 
Finance Limited (A subsidiary of NABARD) and AU Small Finance 
Bank. We are rated at BBB with stable outlook by India Ratings 
Private Limited (a Fitch group company).
Currently, there is a huge credit Gap in MSME Lending and a 
significant portion of MSME loans are processed by informal 
sectors. Our goal is to regularize and convert them to the formal 
sector of lending through our digital Journey, by giving loans to 
only those businesses which are registered under the Udhyam 
(MSME) portal of the central government
Key services:
• 
MSME Flexi Credit for Micro Enterprises 
• 
Loan against Securities 
• 
MSME Supply Chain Finance 
• 
Vehicle Finance - MSME’s Commercial Vehicle 
• 
Loan against Properties 
• 
Supply Chain Finance 
Here are the key highlights of our achievements:
1.	 Loan Disbursements: We prioritized serving MSMEs and 
classified our loan book as a priority sector lending (PSL) 
book. Our monthly disbursement rate peaked at Rs. 30 
Crores. We anticipate doubling our disbursement rate in the 
upcoming year, aiming for significant growth.
2.	 Geographical Expansion: To strengthen our presence and 
provide personalized services, we expanded our physical 
footprint. We opened 27 branches strategically located 
in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi NCR, and 
Maharashtra. These branches serve as dedicated points for 
customer origination and servicing.
3.	 Technological Advancements: Embracing digital technologies 
and enhancing operational efficiency have been central to our 
business strategy. We implemented a robust loan management 
system, mobile application, and advanced data analytics to 
improve customer experiences and streamline processes. 
Compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity regulations 
is a top priority to safeguard customer information and prevent 
data breaches in the digital era.
4.	 Profitability: We focused on growing our loan book 
profitably. This year marked our expansion phase, during 
which we built an experienced leadership team and state of 
the art tech platform. We maintained a Net Interest Margin 
(NIM) at 7.51% during the year and plan to further expand it 
in the future.
5.	 Asset Quality: We developed a healthy portfolio, with 
0.04% Gross Non-Performing Assets as of March 31, 2023. 
Our robust underwriting mechanism assesses customers 
and their business operations collectively. We implemented 
internal scorecards, leveraging technology and alternative 
data, to expedite credit assessment.
6.	 Diversification of Products and Services: From the start, 
we diversified our product offerings to mitigate risks 
associated with specific sectors. Our focus on Business 
Loans, Commercial Vehicle Loans, and Supply Chain Finance 
ensures a balanced portfolio. Moreover, we plan to launch 
Solar Finance in the coming year, further expanding into a 
growing sector with low delinquency levels.
7.	 Risk Management: We have implemented controls at 
various levels of credit assessment and loan disbursement 
to mitigate associated risks. We have implemented Business 
Continuity Management practices along with establishment 
of Disaster Recovery site. We also prioritize regulatory 
compliance and have established a strong governance 
framework. Our policies, procedures, and internal controls 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
regulatory 
requirements. 
We 
consistently submit various returns to regulatory authorities, 
including Asset Liability Management reports, financial 
statements, risk assessments, and compliance reports.
Overall, our achievements in retail lending, geographic 
expansion, profitability, asset quality, product diversification, 
regulatory compliance, and technological advancements have 
strengthened our NBFC business and positioned us for continued 
growth in the future.

Internal Control System and Policy
The Company’s Internal Control System encompasses the 
Policies and procedures that ensures protection of the Company 
assets, ensure reliable financial reporting, correct disclosures and 
compliance with all required rules and regulations applicable 
in the entire eco system in which Company is operating. It is 
into the Company’s culture to execute the best practices when 
it comes towards Social, Environmental and Governance. The 
Internal Control System is designed to facilitate effective risk 
management system of the Company. The various committees 
of the Board, including the Audit Committee, periodically review 
the observations and recommendations of the internal auditors 
to further improve the systems and processes. The Company also 
has a strong internal audit framework as approved by the Audit 
Committee which ensures effective and efficient functioning of 
the various business operations of the Company. The Company 
conducts internal audits at proper and consistent intervals to 
ensure prevention and detection of errors and frauds, accuracy 
and completeness of accounting transactions thus enabling 
timely preparation of reliable financial information. The Statutory 
Auditors of the Company analyse the Internal Audit Report while 
conducting audit functions to ensure that no transactions clash 
with the Company’s interests or statutory requirements. Further, 
the Audit Committee also evaluates the Internal Audit Report 
and the quarterly Compliance Report that are presented to the 
Committee and ensures that any issues raised in these reports 
are addressed in a timely and structured way by Management. 
Throughout the year, the Company reviewed and documented 
the adequacy and operational effectiveness of internal controls. 
Nonetheless, the organization realizes that every internal control 
framework, no matter how well built, has inherent limitations, 
and as a result, regular audits and review processes ensure 
that such systems are strengthened on an ongoing basis. 
The Audit Committee examines an Action Taken Report (ATR), 
which details the issues that need to be addressed and the 
steps taken to address them. The internal control mechanisms 
and environment are appropriate for the size and volume of 
the firm, with proper role and responsibility segregation and 
redundancy. When the management comes across any internal 
control weaknesses, non-compliance with statutes or area of 
improvement, it invites suggestions for improvements in existing 
practices from the Internal Auditors. The Company has adopted 
policies and procedures covering all financial, operating and 
compliance functions. These controls have been designed to 
provide a reasonable assurance over:
• 
Timely preparation of reliable financial information; 
• 
Accuracy and completeness of the accounting records; and 
• 
Compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
• 
Safeguarding of assets from unauthorised use or losses;
• 
Prevention and detection of frauds and errors;
• 
Effectiveness and efficiency of operations.

Risk Management 
Risk management entails regulating anticipated future 
occurrences that could have a negative influence on corporate 
operations and functioning. It is about taking a proactive rather 
than a reactive strategy. Risk management forms a vital part 
in the Company’s businesses and the Company is cognizant of 
the prominent role it plays in its long-term success. Companies 
are often exposed to various kinds of risks which include market 
risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, fraud risk and cyber 
risk and thus the Board has constituted the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board to put in place a Risk Management 
Policy which acts as a framework to identify, assess, monitor 
and mitigate various risks associated with the business. 
The Company has applied an all-inclusive risk management 
framework to identify, understand and manage risks associated 
with the business. This risk management framework helps in 
conducting business in a well-controlled environment and works 
as a mechanism to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate various 
risks associated with the business. With this as the backdrop, 
Company has in place a Risk Management Committee that 
has approved Risk Management Framework which helps to 
periodically assess the expected and unexpected events, under 
which it is imperative to make effective strategies for exploiting 
opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has identified key 
risks and developed plans for managing the same. The Risk 
Management Committee also reviews various processes in the 
business and takes required corrective decisions to protect the 
value for its stakeholders. The details of the Committee and its 
terms of reference are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report forming part of this Report. The Board of Directors has 
adopted a ‘Risk Management Policy’ which integrates various 
elements of risk management. The risk management policy 
is a comprehensive manual that establishes the framework 
in assessing risk in a structured and well-defined manner. The 
reports of the internal auditors is reviewed and discussed by 
the Audit Committee of the respective operating companies 
including the review by your Company’s Board. The Company 
clearly defines and covers Company-wide qualitative and 
quantitative statements on aggregate risk level and types of 
risks being monitored at the entity level. It is further cascaded 
through individual/ group limits to different business lines across 
various parameters, including products, sectors, geographies 
and, counter-parties. The Risk Management Committee and the 
Board of the Company are continuously monitoring these limits.
1. Regulatory Risk:
Regulatory risk is the risk of a change in regulations and law 
that might affect an industry or a business. Such changes in 
regulations can make significant changes in the framework of 
an industry, changes in cost-structure, etc. The Company is prone 
to regulatory risk which includes potential financial loss due to 
changes in government regulations or enforcement actions that 
might adversely affect as it affects not only the Company but 
the entire industry. It can also result from the failure to comply 
with existing regulations or to adapt to new regulations and on 
account of inadequate observance of regulatory requirements 
or differences in interpretation of regulations vis-à-vis the 
regulators.
Risk mitigation: The Company has a team of proficient 
professionals who manage the compliance with applicable 
laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines affecting our business by 
keeping themselves updated with the changes and amendments 
on regular intervals. The Compliance Team is backed by strongly 
supported Corporate Functions team that helps to quickly put 
into the action any change in regulation. All the new guidelines, 
circulars, notifications are complied with in a timely manner. The 
Board ensures formulation of all the applicable policies as well 
as its implementation. Internal audit is also conducted to identify 
risks early so that the businesses can take proactive steps to 
mitigate potential legal and regulatory issues.
2. Operational Risk:
Operational risk is defined as the uncertainties that an 
organisation is expected to face during its day to day business 
operations in a particular sector or industry. Operational risks 
might result in the breakdown of an organization’s internal 
operations, failure to obtain proper internal authorizations, 
improperly documented transactions, failure of operational and 
information security procedures, computer systems, software 
or equipments fraud, in adequate training and employee errors. 
Unlike external factors, such as economic or political events 
which are also referred to as systematic risks, operational risk 
is entirely internal. Our businesses are dependent on people 
and processes. Although the risks are not expected to result in 
the breakdown of the business, the level of risk is dependent 
on the decisions made by the internal management of the 
organisation.
Risk mitigation: The Company’s effective and pre-emptive 
Operational Risk Framework is overseen by the Company’s key 
management team which consists of professionals of high level 
of commitment and the team is well versed in the key issues 
relevant to the holding company structure. The team examines 
operational risks and incidents in a way to ensure robust 
continuance of processes and systems. Well defined policies, 
operational processes and systems have been devised for 
our operations that are checked on a periodical basis. Regular 
audit are done by internal auditors to monitor the adherence of 
policies and processes. Maker/ Checker mechanism has been 
put in place to ensure compliance with laid down systems and 
procedures in all areas of functioning of the Company.
3. Financial Risk:
The Company is exposed to the following risks arising from 
financial instruments:
i.	
Credit risk;
ii.	
Liquidity risk; and 
iii.	 Market risk (including interest rate risk) 
i. Credit Risk - Credit risk is the probability of a financial loss 
resulting from a borrower’s failure to repay a loan. Essentially, 
credit risk refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the 
owed principal and interest, which results in an interruption of 
cash flows and increased costs for collection for the Company. 
Lenders can mitigate credit risk by analyzing factors about a 
borrower’s creditworthiness, such as their current debt load and 
income. It means a risk when a counter party will default on its 
contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. 
Credit risk arises primarily from financial assets such as trade 
receivables, investments, other balances with banks, loans and 
other receivables. 
Risk mitigation: A Policy has also been adopted by the 
Company for dealing with counter parties that have sufficiently 
high credit rating. The Company’s exposure and credit ratings of 
its counter parties are continuously monitored. The Company is 
able to arrive at decision by considering multiple variables and 
increase use of credit rating scorecards of the opposite parties. 
All these initiatives enable the Company to reduce credit costs, 
improve efficiency, maintain consistency, and, more importantly 
allow Company to build scale cost effectively. Your Company 
also has an effective review mechanism in place, which includes 
the credit risk arising from trade receivables and those are 
reviewed periodically. The Company has taken several steps 
to build a new-age credit portfolio management framework, 
stringent adherence to the prudent risk norms and diligently 
following the institutionalised processes have led to improved 
asset quality and thus, Management is confident of recovering 
all the dues.
Credit Risk reduces automatically when the transation of the 
company are conducted with those counter parties like Bank 
and recognised financial institutions with high credit rating 
assigned by the credit rating agencies.
Trade Receivables: Expected credit losses (ECLs) is used for 
measuring the loss allowance, however ECL does not include 
financial assets on which there has been no significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition. At each reporting 
date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried 
at amortised cost is credit impaired. A financial asset is credit- 
impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
have occurred since initial recognition. It may not be possible 
to identify a single discrete event - instead, the combined 
effect of several events may have caused financial assets to 
become credit-impaired. If a financial asset is deemed to be 
impaired, then this will impact on its carrying amount and future 
cash flows. A simplified approach has been considered for 
measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) of trade receivables at 
an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. The ECLs on trade receivables 
are calculated based on actual historic credit loss experience 
over the preceding three to five years on the total balance 
of trade receivables. For the purpose of computation of ECL, 
the term default implies an event where amount due towards 
margin requirement and / or mark to market losses for which 
the client was unable to provide funds / collaterals to bridge 
the short fall, the same is termed as margin call triggered. 
Based on the Industry practices and business environment in 
which the entity operates, Management considers unsecured 
receivables as default if the payment is overdue for more than 
90 days for direct customer. In some cases the management 
is very confident of its recovery in near future, impairment loss 
would not be provided for such cases based on the approval 
of business head for each reporting period. Probability of 
default (PD) on these receivables is considered at 100% and 
treated as credit impaired.
ii. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is a financial risk that for a certain 
period of time a given financial asset, security or commodity 
cannot be traded quickly enough in the market without

impacting the market price. Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity 
will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated 
with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or 
another financial asset.
Risk mitigation: The Company protects itself against liquidity 
risk with the help of its prudent approach. The organization’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as and 
when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring undesirable losses or risking damage to 
the entity’s reputation. The Company mitigates liquidity risk 
by managing sufficient cash and marketable securities and 
availability of funds through adequate committed credit 
facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out 
market positions. The Company has a view of maintaining 
liquidity with minimal risks while not affecting the investments 
planned by the Company. The Company monitors its cash and 
bank balances periodically in view of its short-term obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities. The Company invests its 
surplus funds in short term liquid assets in bank deposits and 
liquid mutual funds. 
iii. Market Risk / Price Risk:  Market risk is the risk arising from 
the adverse movements in market price for various securities, 
which may impact value of portfolio of investments in securities. 
It arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange 
rates, and commodity prices.
Risk mitigation: The Company has a well organized team that 
guarantess that the Portfolios and collaterals / securities are 
continuously monitored. These cautious and judicious liquidity 
risk management measures and practices clearly reflected the 
robustness of your Company’s asset liability management.
Interest rate risk:  Interest rate risk is the potential risk that 
arises from investment losses that can be triggered by a move 
upward in the prevailing rates for new debt instruments. The 
Company is exposed to Interest risk if the fair value or future 
cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk 
is the risk of changes in fair values of fixed interest-bearing 
investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. 
The Company’s interest rate risk arises from interest bearing 
deposits with bank and loans given to customers. Such 
instruments expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. 
Management believes that the interest rate risks attached to 
this financial asset are not significant due to the nature of this 
financial asset.
4) Product risk:
Product risk refers to the risks arising out of the products a 
company offers to its customer in the market.
Risk mitigation: The group offers its customers a well-diversified 
product range in line with customers need and market conditions 
which includes brokerage, mutual fund distribution, portfolio and 
NBFC management to its customers. This diversification and 
product range helps the Company reduce risks arising out of 
products.
5) Business Continuity Risk:
Business continuity risk refers to threats or risks that disrupt the 
functioning of a business. These threats maybe any untoward 
and troublesome incidents or disasters that negatively impact an 
organization which includes incidents like fire, natural calamity, 
cyber-attacks, data breaches, breakdowns of infrastructure etc. 
The Company is exposed to risk of loss data, clients or business 
that can adversely affect our financial results.

Preservation of documents and records the internal checks are 
kept at regular intervals.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the Members of Choice International Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of Choice International Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the 
Statement of Profit and Loss (Including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes 
to the standalone financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (“Ind  AS”) and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and its profit, other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for 
the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the standalone financial statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the 
audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2023.
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the Annual Report 
but does not include the standalone financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report is expected to 
be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance under SA 720 
‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other Information’.
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the 
Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of 
Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these standalone financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• 
	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
• 
	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by Management.
• 
	 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
Other Matter
The standalone financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended March 31, 2022, were audited by another auditor 
whose report dated May 24, 2022 expressed an unmodified 
opinion on those statements.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) 
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements of Choice International Limited 
(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
(the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements was established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements.
 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
A Company’s internal financial control with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial 
control with reference to standalone financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of Management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With 
reference to Standalone financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation

financial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ii.	 	Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s presentation and functional currency is 
Indian Rupees. All figures appearing in the Standalone 
financial statements are in Indian rupees in lakh rounded 
off to two decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to 
the Act. Per share data are presented in Indian Rupee to 
two decimal places.
iii.		Basis of measurement
The standalone financial statements have been prepared 
on Historical cost convention on the accrual basis as per the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)” except for 
certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair 
value as explained in the accounting policy. Historical cost 
is generally based on the fair value of the consideration 
given in exchange for goods and services. Further assets 
and liabilities are classified as per the normal operating 
cycle (determined as 12 months).
iv.		Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received on sale of an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date 
in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous 
market to which the Company has access at that date.
The best estimate of the fair value of a financial instrument 
on initial recognition is normally the transaction price. 
If the Company determines that the fair value on initial 
recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair 
value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active 
market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a 
valuation technique that uses only data from observable 
markets, then the financial instrument is initially measured 
at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the 
fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. 
Subsequently that difference is recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly 
supported by observable market data or the transaction 
is closed out.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1 - Valuation using quoted market price in active 
markets: The fair value for financial instruments traded 
in active markets at the reporting date is based on 
their quoted market price, without any deduction for 
transaction costs. A market is regarded as active, if 
transactions for the asset or liability take place with 
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing 
information on an ongoing basis.
• Level 2 - Valuation using observable inputs: If there is 
no quoted price in an active market, then the Company 
uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of 
unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique 
incorporates most of the factors that market participants 
would take into account in pricing a transaction.
• Level 3 - Valuation with significant unobservable inputs: 
The valuation techniques are used only when fair value 
cannot be determined by using observable inputs. The 
Company regularly reviews significant unobservable 
inputs and valuation adjustments. Level 3 assets are 
typically very illiquid, and fair values can only be 
calculated using estimates. 
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the 
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use 
of unobservable inputs. 
v.	Use of judgment and Estimates
The preparation of the standalone financial statements 
requires the management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions in the application of accounting policies 
that affects the reported amount of assets, liabilities and 
the accompanying disclosures along with contingent 
liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements 
and revenue & expenses for the reporting period. Although 
these estimates are based on the management’s best 
knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about 
these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes 
different from the estimates. Difference between actual 
results and estimates are recognised in the year in which 
the results are known or materialise i.e. prospectively.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key 
areas involving estimation uncertainty, higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are 
significant to the standalone financial statements include:
i.	
Impairment of financial assets
ii.	
Estimation of fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities 
iii.	 Provisions and Contingencies
iv.	 Useful life and expected residual value of assets
v.	 Tax position for current tax and recognition of deferred 
tax assets/liabilities
vi.	 Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and 
actuarial assumptions
vii.	 Share Based Payments
viii.	Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for 
Trade receivables

A.	Summary of significant accounting policies
1.	 Current versus non-current classification
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet based on current /non-current classification.
An asset is treated as current when it is:
• Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle.
• Held primarily for the purpose of trading
• Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting date, or
• Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
• It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
All other liabilities are classified as non–current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-
current assets and liabilities. 
Based on the nature of products and services offered by 
the Company, operating cycle determined is 12 months for 
the purpose of current and non-current classification of 
assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and 
cash equivalents, 
2.	 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Revenue is recognized to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured 
and there exists reasonable certainty of its recovery.
Sale of services
The Company recognizes revenue on accrual basis when 
the significant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, 
services have been delivered and the collectability is 
reasonably assured. The method of recognizing the 
revenues and costs depends on the nature of the services 
rendered. Revenue is recognized when no significant 
uncertainty exists as to its realization or collection.
The 
Company 
recognizes 
income 
from 
Business 
Support Service on account of providing ‘administrative 
services’ to its Subsidiaries and Group companies. The 
term administrative services will be as per the terms 
of agreement made between the Company with its 
subsidiaries and Group Companies
Interest Income
Interest income from financial assets is recognized when 
it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the 
company and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial assets to that asset’s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
Dividend Income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when 
the shareholder’s right to receive payment has been 
established (provided that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the company and the amount of 
income can be measured reliably).
3.	 Property, Plant and Equipment
Land and buildings held for use in the supply of services, or 
for administrative purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Freehold land is not depreciated.
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially 
recorded at cost. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment comprises its purchase price net of any trade 
discounts and rebates, any import duties and other taxes 
(other than those subsequently recoverable from the 
tax authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on 
making the asset ready for its intended use, including 
relevant borrowing costs for qualifying assets and any 
expected costs of decommissioning. Expenditure incurred 
after the property, plant and equipment have been put 
into operation, such as repairs and maintenance, are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year 
in which the costs are incurred.” The cost of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset 
if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the company and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All items of property, plant and equipment having cost 
more than Rs. 5000/- are recognized as an asset.
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less 
any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes professional 
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized 
in accordance with the company`s accounting policy. Such 
properties are classified to the appropriate categories 
of property, plant and equipment when completed and 
ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on 
the same basis as other property assets, commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Capital Work in Progress and Capital Advances
Capital work-in-progress are property, plant and 
equipment which are not yet ready for their intended 
use. Advances given towards acquisition of fixed assets 
outstanding at each reporting date are shown as other 
non-financial assets. 
Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in progress 
until construction and installation is completed and assets 
are ready for its intended use.
Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment 
(excluding freehold land) are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. When significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the 
company recognizes such parts as individual assets 
with specific useful lives and depreciation respectively. 
Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost 
is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and 
equipment as a replacement cost only if the recognition 
criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance 
costs are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
as incurred.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of 
assets less their residual values over the useful lives as 
prescribed in Schedule II of to the Companies Act, 2013, 
using the straight- line method (“SLM”). Residual value is 
considered nil case of Computers, Server and network 
and 5% is considered in case of other assets.

The cost of property, plant and equipment at April 01, 
2018, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was 
determined with reference to its carrying value recognised 
as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of 
transition to Ind AS.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment 
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
The residual values, useful life and depreciation method 
are reviewed at each financial year-end to ensure that 
the amount, method and period of depreciation are 
consistent with previous estimates and the expected 
pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits 
embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. 
Any gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an 
item of property, plant and equipment is determined as 
the difference between sale proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
4.	 Investment Properties-
Investment properties are properties that is held for long-
term rentals yields or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes) or both, 
and that is not occupied by the Company, is classified as 
investment property. Investment properties are measured 
initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at 
cost less accumulated impairment loss, if any. Though 
the Company measures investment property using cost 
based measurement, the fair value of investment property 
is disclosed in the notes. Investment properties are 
derecognised either when they have been disposed of or 
when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no 
future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. 
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or 
loss in the period of derecognition.
5.	 Intangible Assets
The cost Intangible assets at April 01, 2018, the Company’s 
date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference 
to its carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP 
(deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Intangible asset including intangible assets under 
development are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. The amortization period and 
the amortisation method are reviewed at the end of 
each financial year. The useful lives of intangible assets 
are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets 
with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic 
life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed 
at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of 
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset are considered to modify the amortisation period 
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on 
intangible assets with infinite lives is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms 
part of carrying value of another asset.
Useful life in case of Intangible assets is considered as 6.17 year.

6.	 Foreign exchange transactions and translations
a.	 Initial recognition: Transactions in foreign currencies are 
recognised at the prevailing exchange rates between 
the reporting currency and a foreign currency on the 
transaction date.
b.	 Conversion: Transactions in currencies other than 
Company’s functional currency are recorded on initial 
recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction 
date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign currency 
monetary items are reported at the prevailing closing 
spot rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are generally 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at 
historical cost using exchange rates as on the date of the 
respective transactions and are not retranslated at the 
reporting date.
7.	 Income Tax
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax 
payable on the current period’s taxable income based 
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction 
adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax 
losses.”
Current taxes
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for 
the year. Taxable profit differs from ‘profit before tax’ as 
reported in the Statement of Profit and Loss because of 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other years and items that are never taxable or 
deductible.
Current income tax is recognized at the amount expected 
to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using 
the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The 
Company offsets, on a year to year basis, the current tax 
assets and liabilities, where it has legally enforceable right 
to do so and where it intends to settle such assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognized directly in other comprehensive 
income or equity, in which case it is recognized in other 
comprehensive income or equity respectively.
The promulgated Taxation Law (Amendment) Ordinance 
2019 has inserted section 115BBA in the Income Tax Act, 
1961 providing existing domestic companies with an option 
to pay tax at a concessional rate of 22% plus applicable 
surcharge and cess. The Company has irreversibly opted 
for the new tax rate i.e. 25.17%.
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax is recognized on differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
standalone financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and 
are accounted for using the balance sheet approach. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all 
taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets 
are generally recognized for all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the profit 
and loss is recognised outside profit and loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and 
the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) credit entitlement (i.e. excess 
of MAT paid for a year over normal tax liability for that 
year) eligible for set off in subsequent years is recognised 
as an asset in accordance with Ind AS 12, Income Taxes, if 
there is convincing evidence of it’s realisation.
MAT credit is created by way of credit to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. The Company reviews the same at 
each Balance Sheet date and writes down the carrying 
amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no 
longer convincing evidence to the effect that Company 
will pay normal income tax during the specified period.
8.	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
At the end of each reporting period, the company reviews 
the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of impairment loss (if any). When 
it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of 
allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also 
allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise 
they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-
generating units for which a reasonable and consistent 
allocation basis can be identified.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible 
assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment 
at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating 
unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount,  so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset ( or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in statement of profit and loss.
9.	 Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity. 
Financial Assets
a.	 Initial recognition and measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Company commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
On initial recognition, a financial asset is  measured at:
• Amortised cost
• Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – 
debt instruments
• Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income – 
equity instruments
• Fair Value Through Profit and Loss
Amortised cost - The Company’s business model is not 
assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at 
a higher level of aggregated portfolios being the level 
at which they are managed. The financial asset is held 
with the objective to hold financial asset in order to 
collect contractual cash flows as per the contractual 
terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) 
on the principal amount outstanding. Accordingly, 
the Company measures Bank balances, Loans, 
Trade receivables and other financial instruments at 
amortised cost.
FVOCI - debt instruments - The Company measures 
its debt instruments at FVOCI when the instrument is 
held within a business model, the objective of which 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms 
of the financial asset meet the SPPI test.
FVOCI - equity instruments - The Company 
subsequently measures all equity investments at fair 
value through profit or loss, unless the Company’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably 
some of its equity instruments at FVOCI, when such 
instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 
32 Financial Instruments and are not held for trading.
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period the 
Company changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
All financial assets not classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. This 
includes all derivative financial assets.
b.	 Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using effective interest 
method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment 
losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and 
losses and impairment are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Any gain and loss on derecognition is 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Debt investment at FVOCI are subsequently measured 
at fair value. Interest income under effective interest 
method, foreign exchange gains and losses and 
impairment are recognised in Statement of profit and 
loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI.

CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in 
OCI are reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss.
For equity investments, the Company makes selection 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis to designate 
equity investments as measured at FVOCI. These 
selected investments are measured at fair value with 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the reserves. The cumulative gain or 
loss is not reclassified to Statement of profit and loss on 
disposal of the investments. These investments in equity 
are not held for trading. Dividend income received on 
such equity investments are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss. Equity investments that are not 
designated as measured at FVOCI are designated as 
measured at FVTPL and subsequent changes in fair 
value are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
Financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured 
at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest 
or dividend income, are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
c.	 De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the 
company balance sheet) when:
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
The Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either (a) the company has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, or (b) the company has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset
When the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into 
a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of 
ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, 
nor transferred control of the asset, the company 
continues to recognise the transferred asset to the 
extent of the company`s  continuing involvement. In 
that case, the company also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights 
and obligations that the company has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the company could be required to repay.
d.	 Impairment of financial assets
The Company recognises impairment loss applying 
the expected credit loss (ECL) model on the financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments 
at FVTOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables, other 
contractual right to receive cash or other financial asset 
and financial guarantee not designated as at FVTPL. 
The Company measures the loss allowance for a 
financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime 
expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial 
instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition. If the credit risk on a financial instrument 
has not increased significantly since initial recognition, 
the Company measures the loss allowance for that 
financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months 
expected credit losses.
For trade receivables or any contractual right to 
receive cash or other financial assets that result from 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115, the 
Company always measures the loss allowance at an 
amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime expected 
credit loss allowance for trade receivables, the 
Company applies ‘simplified approach’ permitted by 
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments. This expected credit 
loss allowance is computed based on a provision 
matrix which takes into account historical credit 
loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking 
information. 
In view of the fact that the entire trade receivables are 
from its subsidiaries and other group companies, there 
is no lifetime credit losses expected by the Company.
Write offs – The gross carrying amount of a financial 
asset is written-off (either partially or in full) to the extent 
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering 
the asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is 
generally the case when the Company determines 
that the vendor does not have assets or sources of 
income that could generate sufficient cash flows to 
repay the amounts subject to the write-off and when 
there is no reasonable expectation of recovery from 
the collaterals held. However, financial assets that 
are written-off could still be subject to enforcement 
activities in order to comply with the Company’s 
procedures for recovery of amounts due.
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance 
Sheet – Loss allowances for ECL are deducted from 
the gross carrying amount of financial assets measured 
at amortised cost.
Financial Liabilities
a.	 Initial recognition and measurement
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
b.	 Subsequent measurement
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are 
classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the 
purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category 
also includes derivative financial instruments entered 
into by the Company that are not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined 
by Ind-AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are 
also classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognised in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
at fair value through profit or loss are designated at 
the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as 
FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes 
in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/ 
loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, 
the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss 
within equity. All other changes in fair value of such 
liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 
The Company has not designated any financial liability 
as at fair value through profit and loss.
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at 
amortized cost using the effective interest method, 
except for contingent consideration recognized in a 
business combination which is subsequently measured 
at fair value through profit and loss. For trade and other 
payables maturing within one year from the Balance 
Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair 
value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when and only 
when the obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains 
and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
effective interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. 
Such amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
statement of profit and loss.
10.	 Leases
The Company has adopted Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ with 
the date of initial application being April 1, 2019. The 
Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases 
for Premises. The Company, at the inception of a contract, 
assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A 
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
time in exchange for a consideration. This policy has been 
applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after 
April 1, 2018.
The Company evaluates each contract or arrangement, 
whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116. 
The Company as a lessee 
The Company assesses, whether the contract is, or 
contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract involves– a) the use of an identified asset, b) 
the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits 
from use of the identified asset, and c) the right to direct 
the use of the identified asset.
The Company at the inception of the lease contract 
recognises a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a 
corresponding lease liability, for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with term of less 
than twelve months (short term) and low-value assets 
(assets of less than Rs. 10 Lakhs in value). Certain lease 
arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate 
the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is 
reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
The cost of the ROU assets comprises the amount 
of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any

CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
lease payments made at or before the inception date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease 
incentives received. Subsequently, the right-of-use assets 
is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The ROU 
assets is depreciated using the straightline method from 
the commencement date over the shorter of lease term 
or useful life of ROU assets.
ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount 
(i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the 
value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In such 
cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
For lease liabilities at inception, the Company measures 
the lease liability at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid at that date. The lease 
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit 
in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that 
rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.
The Company recognises the amount of the re-
measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the 
ROU assets. Where the carrying amount of the ROU 
assets is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction 
in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company 
recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
For short-term and low value leases, the Company 
recognises the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company as a lessor
Lease income from operating leases where the Company 
is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term unless the receipts are structured 
to increase in line with expected general inflation to 
compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. 
The respective leased assets are included in the balance 
sheet based on their nature.
11.	 Finance Costs 
Finance costs include interest expense computed by 
applying the effective interest rate on respective financial 
instruments measured at amortised cost. Financial 
instruments include debt and borrowing, Finance costs 
are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
12.	 Dividend distribution to equity holders of the Company
The Company recognises a liability to make distributions 
to equity holders of the Company when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. As per the Act, final dividend 
is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders 
and interim dividend is authorised when it is approved by 
the Board of Directors of the Company.
13.	 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised only when: 
• an entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event; and
• it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation; and
• a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Further, long term provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. A 
provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present 
value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating 
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing 
with the contract. Before a provision is established, the 
Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets 
associated with that contract.
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
• a present obligation arising from past events, when it 
is not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation; and
• a present obligation arising from past events, when no 
reliable estimate is possible.
Contingent Assets: 
Contingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that 
developments are appropriately reflected in the financial 
statements. If it has become virtually certain that an 
inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the 
related income are recognised in the financial statements 
of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow 
of economic benefits has become probable, an entity 
discloses the contingent asset.
14.	 Commitments:
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual 
expenditure, classified and disclosed as follows:
• estimated amount of contracts remaining to be 
executed on capital account and not provided for; 
• uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on investments 
partly paid; and 
• other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the 
extent they are considered material and relevant in 
the opinion of management.
15.	 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into 
account
• The after income tax effect of interest and other 
financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
• Weighted average number of equity shares that would 
have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all 
the dilutive potential equity.
16.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits 
with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances 
(with an original maturity of three months or less from the 
date of acquisition), and highly liquid time deposits that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
17.	 Statement of Cash Flow
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating 
the cash flows into operating, investing and financing 
activities. Cash flow from operating activities is reported 
using indirect method adjusting the net profit for the 
effects of:
i.	 changes during the period in inventories and operating 
receivables and payables transactions of a noncash 
nature;
ii.	 non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, 
deferred taxes, unrealised foreign currency gains and 
losses, and undistributed profits of associates and joint 
ventures; and
iii.	 all other items for which the cash effects are investing 
or financing cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) 
shown in the Statement of Cash Flows exclude items 
which are not available for general use as on the date 
of Balance Sheet.
18.	 Employee Benefits 
Short term employee benefits
Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as short 
term employee benefits and are expensed in the period 
in which the employee renders the related service. 
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee 
benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of 
the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the 
related service.
Long Term employee benefits
Company’s net obligation in respect of long-term 
employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their service in the 
current and prior periods. 
Post-employment benefits
a.	 Defined contribution Plans
Provident fund: Contributions as required under 
the statute, made to the Provident Fund (Defined 
Contribution Plan) are recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. There is no obligation 
other than the monthly contribution payable to the 
Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.
ESIC and Labour welfare fund:  The Company’s 
contribution paid/payable during the year to Employee 
state insurance scheme and Labour welfare fund are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
b.	 Defined benefit Plans
Gratuity liability is defined benefit obligation and 
is provided on the basis of an actuarial valuation 
performed by an independent actuary based on 
projected unit credit method, at the end of each 
financial year. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
i.	 Service cost (including current service cost, past 
service cost, as well as gains and losses on 
curtailments and settlements)
ii.	 Net interest expense or income
iii.	 Re-measurement 
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, 
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the 
asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized 
in OCI, net of taxes. The Company determines the net 
interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit 
liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation

at the beginning of the annual period to the net 
defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account 
any changes in the net defined benefit liability 
(asset) during the period as a result of contributions 
and benefit payments. Net interest expense and 
other expenses related to defined benefit plans are 
recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The Company’s net obligation in respect of gratuity 
(defined benefit plan), is calculated by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that the employees have 
earned in the current and prior periods, discounting 
that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan 
assets. The retirement benefit obligation recognised 
in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or 
surplus in the company’s defined benefit plans. Any 
surplus resulting from this calculation is recognised 
as an asset to the extent of present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of refunds 
from the plans or reductions in the future contribution 
to the plans.
Share based payment arrangements
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined 
by the fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the 
employee share options is based on the Black Scholes 
model.
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of 
awards for which the related service and non-market 
performance conditions are expected to be met, such 
that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the 
number of awards that meet the related service and non-
market performance conditions at the vesting date. For 
share-based payment awards with market performance 
conditions and non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair 
value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect 
such conditions and there is no true-up for differences 
between expected and actual outcomes.
Choice International Limited grants options to eligible 
employees of the Company under Choice Employee 
Stock Option Scheme 2022. The options vest over a 
period of four years. In case of Group equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions, where the Company 
grants stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing the cost of 
investment in subsidiary with a corresponding credit in 
the equity.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share. 
19.	 Investment in Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company 
has control. The Company controls an entity when the 
company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power to direct the 
relevant activities of the entity.
Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment, if any.

Significant estimates- actuarial assumptions and sensitivity 	
The significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:
Sensitivity analysis	
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur,  and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability 
recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

Risk Exposure
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed-
Maturity profile of gratuity liability and Employer contribution
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2023 are Rs. Nil/- (as at March 31, 2022: Rs. 1.28 
lakhs).
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years (March 31, 2022: 13.22 years 
). The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows:
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If 
the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it 
has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other debt instruments.
Interest risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will increase the present value of the 
liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market 
value of the assets depending on the duration of asset.
Asset liability matching risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 
of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk
Moratality risk
Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan 
does not have any longevity risk.
Concentration risk
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance entity and a 
default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance companies 
have to follow regulatory guidelines.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries 
of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase 
the plan's liability.
3. Employee Stock Option Plan
The Company has Choice Employee Stock Option Plan 2022, under which options have been granted to eligible employees to be vested 
from time to time.
The Company has established share option plans that entitle the employees of the Company and its subsidiary companies to purchase 
the shares of the Company. Under these plans, holders of the vested options are entitled to purchase shares at the exercise price of the 
shares determined at the respective date of grant of options.
The key terms and conditions related to the vesting of grants under these plans are continued employment with the company from the 
date of grant of option till the date of vesting; all options are to be settled by the delivery of shares.

loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, 
including Fixed deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.

the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made generally in the fixed deposits and for funding to subsidiary company. The 
investment limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss to make payments for vendors.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is the 
carrying amounts as stated in balance sheet except for balances of subsidiary company.

The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a liquidity planning tool.
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank loans and 
unsecured loans. The Company has access to a sufficient variety of sources of funding which can be rolled over with existing lenders. The 
Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements.

Market Risk
The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over 
the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management objectives and 
policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department include management of 
cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with 
market risk limits and policies.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s long-term debt 
obligations with floating interest rates.	
The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Company’s 
policy is to keep balance between its borrowings at fixed rates of interest. The difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts 
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
The exposure of the Company to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as under:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
To the Members of Choice International Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Choice International Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Holding Company”), its subsidiaries (Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) and its 
jointly controlled operations which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then 
ended, and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, and based on consideration 
of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements 
and on the other financial information of subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled operations referred to in the Other Matters section 
below, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under 
section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of their consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group as at March 31, 2023, and their consolidated 
profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes 
in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year then 
ended.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group and its jointly controlled operations in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics 
issued by Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (“ICAI”), and 
the relevant provisions of the Act and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and on 
consideration of audit reports of other auditors referred to in 
paragraph (a) and (b) of the “Other Matters” section below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 
2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to 
communicate in our report.
Information 
Other 
than 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the other information. The other information comprises the 
Annual Report but does not include the consolidated financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Annual Report 
is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance under SA 720 
‘The Auditor’s responsibilities Relating to Other Information’.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible 
for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated 
financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance, consolidated 
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group 
including its Jointly controlled operations in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the 
Act. The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of jointly controlled operations are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of 
the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the 
Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and 
of its jointly controlled operations are responsible for assessing 
the ability of the Group and of its jointly controlled operations to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate their respective companies or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group and of its jointly controlled operations are responsible 
for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and 
of its jointly controlled operations.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• 
	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• 
	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
• 
	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by Management.
• 
	 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its jointly 
controlled operations to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group and its jointly controlled 
operations to cease to continue as a going concern.
• 
	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• 
	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its jointly controlled 
operations to express an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements, which have been audited by other 
auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion. 
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.

TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF 
EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
[Referred to in paragraph 1 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal 
and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditors’ 
Report of even date to the Members of Choice International 
Limited on the consolidated Financial Statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2023] 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) 
of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 
March 31, 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls 
reference to consolidated financial statements of Choice 
International Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding 
Company”), its subsidiary companies (the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) and its 
jointly controlled operations, which are companies incorporated 
in India, as of that date. 
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the Holding Company, its 
subsidiaries and jointly controlled operations, which are 
companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements and such internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the 
internal with reference to consolidated financial statements 
criteria established by the respective companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the ICAI”).
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding company, 
its subsidiary companies and jointly controlled operations, 
which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based 
on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements criteria established by the respective companies 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
of the Holding company, its subsidiary companies and jointly 
controlled operations, which are companies incorporated in India, 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and 
the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of 
the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matter paragraph below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company, its 
subsidiary companies and jointly controlled operations, which 
are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the

ii.	 Functional and presentation currency.
	
	
The Group’s presentation and functional currency is 
Indian Rupees. All figures appearing in the consolidated 
financial statements are in Indian rupees in lakh rounded 
off to two decimal places as permitted by Schedule III 
to the Act. Per share data are presented in Indian Rupee 
to two decimal places.
	
iii.	 Basis of measurement
	
	
The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost convention on the accrual 
as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013(‘’the 
Act’) except for certain financial assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value as explained in the accounting 
policy. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value 
of the consideration given in exchange for goods and 
services. Further assets and liabilities are classified as per 
the normal operating cycle (determined as 12 months).
	
iv.	 Preparation of Consolidated financial statements
	
	
The Holding Company has surrendered its NBFC license 
therefore as per the format prescribed under Division II 
of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013; the holding 
company presents the Balance sheet, the statement of 
Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity. 
	
v.	 Principle of Consolidation and equity accounting 
Subsidiaries- 
	
	
The consolidated financial statements have comprised 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) 
over which the Group has control. The Group controls 
an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries 
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases. 
	
	
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account 
for business combinations by the Group.
	
	
The Group combines the financial statements of the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries line by line adding 
together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income 
and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and 
unrealized gains on transactions within the Group are 
eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of 
the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
	
	
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of 
subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively. 
Statement 
of 
Profit 
and 
Loss 
including 
Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) is attributable to the 
equity holders of the Holding Company and to the 
non-controlling interest basis the respective ownership 
interest and such balance is attributed even if this results 
in controlling interest is having a deficit balance.
	
Associates-
	
Associates are all entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but not control or joint control. This is 
generally the case where the Group holds between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are 
accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see 
(iii) below), after initially being recognized at cost.
	
Equity Method-
	
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments 
are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognize the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or 
losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share 
of other comprehensive income of the investee in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable 
from associates and joint ventures are recognized as a 
reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
	
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted 
investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including 
any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does 
not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the other entity.
	
Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and 
its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are 
also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of 
an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of equity accounted investees have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.
	
Changes in ownership interests
	
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests 
that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest 
results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of 
the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their 
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between 
the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests 
and any consideration paid or received is recognized within 
equity.
	
When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account 
for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control 
or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is 
re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying 
amount recognized in profit or loss. This fair value becomes 
the initial carrying -amount for the purposes of subsequently 
accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint 
venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously 
recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of

that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean 
that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss.
	
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but 
joint control or significant influence is retained, only a 
proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized 
in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or 
loss where appropriate.
	
vi.	 Fair value measurement
	
	
Fair value is the price that would be received on sale 
of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the 
most advantageous market to which the Group has 
access at that date. 
	
	
	
The best estimate of the fair value of a financial 
instrument on initial recognition is normally the 
transaction price. If the Group determines that the fair 
value on initial recognition differs from the transaction 
price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted 
price in an active market for an identical asset or liability 
nor based on a valuation technique that uses only data 
from observable markets, then the financial instrument 
is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the 
difference between the fair value on initial recognition 
and the transaction price. Subsequently that difference 
is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on an 
appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no 
later than when the valuation is wholly supported by 
observable market data or the transaction is closed out. 
	
 	
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as 
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement as a whole:
	
	 •	 Level 1 - Valuation using quoted market price in active 
markets: The fair value for financial instruments traded 
in active markets at the reporting date is based on 
their quoted market price, without any deduction for 
transaction costs. A market is regarded as active, if 
transactions for the asset or liability take place with 
sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing 
information on an ongoing basis.
	
	 •	 Level 2 - Valuation using observable inputs: If there 
is no quoted price in an active market, then the 
Company uses valuation techniques that maximise 
the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise 
the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation 
technique incorporates most of the factors that 
market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction.
	
	 •	 Level 3 - Valuation with significant unobservable 
inputs: The valuation techniques are used only when 
fair value cannot be determined by using observable 
inputs. The Company regularly reviews significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. Level 
3 assets are typically very illiquid, and fair values can 
only be calculated using estimates. 
	
	
	
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in 
the financial statements on a recurring basis, the 
Company determines whether transfers have 
occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
	
	
	
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs 
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
	
vii	 Use of judgment and Estimates 
	
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
requires the management to make judgments, estimates 
and assumptions in the application of accounting 
policies that affects the reported amount of assets, 
liabilities and the accompanying disclosures along with 
contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated 
financial statements and revenue & expenses for the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based 
on the management’s best knowledge of current events 
and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes different from 
the estimates. Difference between actual results and 
estimates are recognised in the year in which the results 
are known or materialise i.e. prospectively.
	
	
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and 
are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key 
areas involving estimation uncertainty, higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
are significant to the consolidated financial statements 
include:
	
	
i.	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
ii.	
Estimation of fair value measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities 
	
	
iii.	 Effective interest rate
	
	
iv.	 Business model assessment
	
	
v.	 Provisions and Contingencies
	
	
vi.	 Useful life and expected residual value of assets
	
	
vii.	 Tax position for current tax and recognition of 
deferred tax assets/liabilities
	
	
viii.	Measurement of Defined Benefit Obligations and 
actuarial assumptions
	
	
ix.	 Classification of lease and related discount rate
	
	
x.	 Share Based Payments
	
	
xi.	 Measurement of Expected Credit Loss allowance for 
Trade receivables
	
	
Further an entity is consolidated as a subsidiary if the 
Company has control over the said entity based on the 
management evaluation of investments and related 
agreements/ deeds and determines that the Group 
has control over the said entity in terms of Ind AS-110 on 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Control shall include 
the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control 
the management or policy decisions exercisable by a 
person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly 
or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or 
management rights or shareholders’ agreements or 
voting agreements or in any other manner.
	
B.	 Summary of significant accounting policies
	
	
1.	 Current versus non-current classification
	
	
	
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet based on current /non-current 
classification.
	
	
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
	
	
	 •	 Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle.
	
	
	 •	 Held primarily for the purpose of trading
	
	
	 •	 Expected to be realized within twelve months 
after the reporting date, or
	
	
	 •	 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for 
at least twelve months after the reporting period
	
	
	
All other assets are classified as non-current.
	
	
	
A liability is current when:
	
	
	 •	 It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle
	
	
	 •	 It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
	
	
	 •	 There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
	
	
	
All other liabilities are classified as non–current.
	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities. 
	
	
	
Based on the nature of products and services 
offered by the Group, operating cycle determined is 
12 months for the purpose of current and non-current 
classification of assets and liabilities.
	
	
	
The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents.
	
2.	 Revenue recognition
	
	
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable. Revenue is recognized to the 
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably 
measured and there exists reasonable certainty of its 
recovery.
   Sale of services
	
The Group recognizes revenue on accrual basis when 
the significant terms of the arrangement are enforceable, 
services have been delivered and the collectability is 
reasonably assured. The method of recognizing the revenues 
and costs depends on the nature of the services rendered. 
Revenue is recognized when no significant uncertainty exists 
as to its realization or collection.
	
Interest Income
	
Interest income from financial assets is recognized when it 
is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the amount of income can be measured reliably. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of 
the financial assets to that asset’s net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
	
Income from sale of investment
	
Gains or losses on the sale of investments are recognised 
in Statement of profit and loss on trade date basis as the 
difference between fair value of the consideration received 
and carrying amount of the investment securities.
	
Dividend Income
	
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholder’s right to receive payment has been established 
(provided that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably).
	
Brokerage Income
	
Brokerage income in relation to stock broking activity is 
recognised on trade date basis.
	
3.	 Property, Plant and Equipment
	
Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of 
goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated 
in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land is not

depreciated.
	
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially 
recorded at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replaced part 
of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying property, plant and equipment. 
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is 
recognized as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
	
Properties in the course of construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less 
any recognized impairment loss. Cost includes professional 
fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalized 
in accordance with the Group`s accounting policy. Such 
properties are classified to the appropriate categories of 
property, plant and equipment when completed and ready 
for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same 
basis as other property assets, commences when the assets 
are ready for their intended use.
	
All items of property, plant and equipment having cost more 
than Rs. 5000/- are recognized as an asset.
	
Capital Work in Progress and Capital Advances
	
Capital work-in-progress are property, plant and equipment 
which are not yet ready for their intended use. Advances 
given towards acquisition of fixed assets outstanding at 
each reporting date are shown as other non-financial 
assets. 
	
Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in progress 
until construction and installation is completed and assets 
are ready for its intended use.
	
Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment 
(excluding freehold land) are measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses. When significant parts of property, plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the group 
recognizes such parts as individual assets with specific useful 
lives and depreciation respectively. Likewise, when a major 
inspection is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying 
amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement cost 
only if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair 
and maintenance costs are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss as incurred.
	
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over 
their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned 
assets. However, when there is no reasonable certainty that 
ownership will be obtained by the end of the lease term, 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and useful lives.
	
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost 
of assets less their residual values over the useful lives as 
prescribed in Schedule II of to the Companies Act, 2013, 
using the straight- line method (“SLM”). Residual value is 
considered nil case of Computers, Server and network and 
5% is considered in case of other assets.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment 
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
	
The residual values, useful life and depreciation method 
are reviewed at each financial year-end to ensure that the 
amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent 
with previous estimates and the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in 
the items of property, plant and equipment.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any 
gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item 
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between sale proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
	
4.	 Investment Properties-
	
	
Investment properties are properties that is held for long-
term rentals yields or for capital appreciation (including 
property under construction for such purposes) or both, 
and that is not occupied by the Group, is classified as 
investment property. Investment properties are measured 
initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at 
cost less accumulated impairment loss, if any. Though the 
Group measures investment property using cost based 
measurement, the fair value of investment property is 
disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based 
on an annual evaluation performed by an accredited 
external independent valuer. Investment properties are 
derecognised either when they have been disposed of or 
when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no 
future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. 
The difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period of derecognition.
	
	
5.	  Intangible Assets
	
	
 Intangible asset including intangible assets under 
development are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. The amortization period and 
the amortisation method are reviewed at the end of 
each financial year. The useful lives of intangible assets 
are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible 
assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful 
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be 
impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with infinite 
lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of 
another asset.
	
6.	 Segment Reporting 
	
	
The Group operates operations predominately relates to 
four business segment i.e. Broking & Distribution services, 
Advisory services and NBFC services Business segments 
have been identified as separate reportable segments 
as per Ind-AS 108.
  
	
7.	 Functional Currency
	
	
The group`s consolidated financial statements are 
presented in INR (rounded off to lakhs), which is also the 
group’s functional currency.
	
Transaction and balances
	
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by 
the Group in their functional currency spot rates at the date 
the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
	
	
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency spot 
rates of exchange at the reporting period.
	
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary 
items or on translating monetary items are recognized in the 
statement of profit or loss except.
	
	 •	 exchange 
differences 
on 
foreign 
currency 
borrowings relating to assets under construction 
for future productive use, which are included in the 
cost of those assets when they are regarded as 
an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign 
currency borrowings;
	
	 •	 exchange differences on transactions entered into in 
order to hedge certain foreign currency risks
	
	 •	 exchange differences on monetary items receivable 
from or payable to a foreign operation for which 
settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur 
(therefore forming part of the net investment in 
foreign operation), which are recognised initially in 
other comprehensive income and reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss on repayment of the monetary 
items.
	
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation differences 
on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI 
or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, 
respectively).
	
8.	 Income Tax
	
	
Current taxes
	
	
Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
statement of profit and loss except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognized directly in other 
comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is 
recognized in other comprehensive income or equity 
respectively. Current income tax is recognized at the 
amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the 
tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. The Group offsets, on a year to year basis, 
the current tax assets and liabilities, where it has legally 
enforceable right to do so and where it intends to settle 
such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
	
	
Deferred taxes
	
	
Deferred tax is recognized on differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit 
and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized 
for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred 
tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognized if the

temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
	
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
profit and loss is recognised outside profit and loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in equity).
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be 
recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and 
the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
	
9.	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
	
	
At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible 
to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual 
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation 
can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 
individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are 
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units 
for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis 
can be identified.
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and 
intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for 
impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired.
	
	
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
	
	
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-
generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognized in the profit or loss.
	
	
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset ( or a cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset ( or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss.
	
10.	 Financial Instruments
	
	
	
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise 
to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability or equity instrument of another entity. 
	
Financial Assets
	
a)	 	
Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value 
plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., 
the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
	
	
	
On initial recognition, a financial asset is measured  	
	
	
	
at:
	
	
	 •	 Amortised cost
	
	
	 •	 Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income 
– debt instruments
	
	
	 •	 Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income 
– equity instruments
	
	
	 •	 Fair Value Through Profit and Loss
	
	
	
Amortised cost - The Group’s business model is not 
assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but 
at a higher level of aggregated portfolios being the 
level at which they are managed. The financial asset 
is held with the objective to hold financial asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows as per the 
contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payment of principal and 
interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. 
Accordingly, the Group measures Bank balances, 
Loans, Trade receivables and other financial 
instruments at amortised cost.
	
	
	
FVOCI - debt instruments - The Group measures 
its debt instruments at FVOCI when the instrument is 
held within a business model, the objective of which 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets; and the contractual 
terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test.
	
	
	
FVOCI - equity instruments - The Group 
subsequently measures all equity investments at 
fair value through profit or loss, unless the Group’s 
management has elected to classify irrevocably 
some of its equity instruments at FVOCI, when such 
instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind 
AS 32 Financial Instruments and are not held for 
trading.
	
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
	
	
	
All financial assets not classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. 
This includes all derivative financial assets.
	
b)	 	
Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
Equity instruments
	
	
	
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are 
measured at fair value. Equity instruments which 
are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For 
all other equity instruments, the Group may make 
an irrevocable election to present subsequent 
changes in the fair value in OCI. The Group makes 
such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
The classification is made on initial recognition and is 
irrevocable. 
	
	
	
Dividends from such investments are recognized in 
profit or loss as other income. There is no recycling 
of the amounts from OCI to Profit and Loss, even on 
sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within equity. 
	
	
	
Equity instruments subsequently measured at fair 
value through profit or loss are measured at fair 
value with all changes recognized in the statement 
of profit and loss.
	
c)	 	
De-recognition
	
	
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a 
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial 
assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from 
the group’s balance sheet) when:
	
	
	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
	
	
	
The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-
through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset
	
	
	
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a 
pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards 
of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
group continues to recognised the transferred asset 
to the extent of the group`s  continuing involvement. 
In that case, the group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the 
rights and obligations that the group has retained.
	
	
	
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured 
at the lower of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration 
that the group could be required to repay.
	
d)	 	
Impairment of financial assets
	
	
	
The Group recognises impairment loss applying the 
expected credit loss (ECL) model on the financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, debt instruments 
at FVTOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables, 
and other contractual right to receive cash or 
other financial asset and financial guarantee not 
designated as at FVTPL. 
	
	
	
Expected credit losses are the weighted average 
of credit losses with the respective risks of default 
occurring as the weights. 
	
	
	
The Group measures the loss allowance for a 
financial instrument at an amount equal to the 
lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on 
that financial instrument has increased significantly 
since initial recognition. If the credit risk on a financial 
instrument has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance 
for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 
months expected credit losses.
	
	
	
For trade receivables or any contractual right to 
receive cash or other financial assets that result from 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115, 
the Group always measures the loss allowance at 
an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
	
	
	
Further, for the purpose of measuring lifetime 
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables, 
the Group applies ‘simplified approach’ permitted by 
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments. This expected credit

loss allowance is computed based on a provision 
matrix which takes into account historical credit 
loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking 
information.
	
	
	
Write offs – The gross carrying amount of a 
financial asset is written-off (either partially or in full) 
to the extent that there is no reasonable expectation 
of recovering the asset in its entirety or a portion 
thereof. This is generally the case when the Group 
determines that the vendor does not have assets 
or sources of income that could generate sufficient 
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-
off and when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery from the collaterals held. However, financial 
assets that are written-off could still be subject to 
enforcement activities in order to comply with the 
Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
	
	
	
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Balance 
Sheet – Loss allowances for ECL are deducted 
from the gross carrying amount of financial assets 
measured at amortised cost.
	
	
	
For loan given measured at amortised cost or 
FVTOCI, except for investments in equity instruments. 
Group follows a ‘three-stage’ model for impairment 
based on changes in credit quality since initial 
recognition.
	
	
	
Stage 1 (Performing Assets) – includes financial 
assets that have not had a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition or that have low 
credit risk at the reporting date. For these assets, 
12-month ECL is recognised and interest income 
is calculated on the gross carrying amount of 
the assets (that is, without deduction for credit 
allowance). 12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that 
results from default events on a financial instrument 
that are possible within 12 months after the reporting 
date, if the credit risk has not significantly increased 
since initial recognition. 
	
	
	
Stage 2 (Underperforming Assets with significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition) 
– includes financial instruments that have had 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition (unless they have low credit risk at 
the reporting date) but that do not have objective 
evidence of impairment. For these assets, lifetime 
ECL are recognised, but interest income is calculated 
on the gross carrying amount of the assets. Lifetime 
ECL are the expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the expected life of the 
instrument. 
	
	
	
Stage 3 (Non-performing or Credit-impaired 
assets) – includes financial assets that have 
objective evidence of impairment at the reporting 
date. For these assets, lifetime ECL is recognised and 
interest income is recognised on Net exposure (that 
is Gross carrying amount less Provision for Expected 
credit losses).
       
	
	
Financial Liabilities
	
	
a)	 Initial recognition and measurement
	
	
	
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction 
costs.
	
	
b)	 Subsequent measurement
	
	
	
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as described below:
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
	
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are 
classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the 
purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category 
also includes derivative financial instruments entered 
into by the group that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind-
AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments.
	
	
 
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognised in the profit or loss.
	
	
 
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
at fair value through profit or loss are designated at 
the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria 
in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as 
FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes 
in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/ loss 
are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the 
Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The Group 
has not designated any financial liability as at fair value 
through profit and loss.
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method, except for 
contingent consideration recognized in a business 
combination which is subsequently measured at 
fair value through profit and loss. For trade and other 
payables maturing within one year from the Balance 
Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
due to the short maturity of these instruments.
	
	
Derecognition
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when and only 
when the obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange 
or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss
	
	
Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
	
	
Borrowing Costs 
	
	
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets that 
necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use or sale are added to the 
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised in statement of profit 
and loss in the period in which they are incurred.
	
	
Equity Instruments
	
	
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
	
	
Dividends
	
	
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend 
declared, being appropriately authorized and no longer 
at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end 
of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of 
the reporting period.
	
	
Loans and borrowings
	
	
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities 
are derecognised as well as through the effective 
interest rate amortisation process.
	
	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. 
Such amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts
	
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the group are 
those contracts that require a payment to be made 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the 
specified debtor fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially 
as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined 
as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the 
amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.
	
	
c)	 Derecognition
	
	
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss
	
	
d)	 Offsetting of financial instruments
	
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
	
11.	 Leases
	
	
The Group has adopted Ind AS 116 ‘Leases’ with the 
date of initial application being April 1, 2019. The lease 
asset classes primarily consist of leases for Premises. 
The Group, at the inception of a contract, assesses 
whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a time in 
exchange for a consideration. This policy has been 
applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after 
April 1, 2018.
	
	
The Group evaluates each contract or arrangement, 
whether it qualifies as lease as defined under Ind AS 116.
	
	
The Group as a lessee

CHOICE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
	
	
The Group as a lessee the Group assesses, whether 
the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or 
contains, a lease if the contract involves– a) the use of 
an identified asset, b) the right to obtain substantially all 
the economic benefits from use of the identified asset, 
and c) the right to direct the use of the identified asset.
	
	
The Group at the inception of the lease contract recognises 
a Right-of-Use (RoU) asset at cost and a corresponding 
lease liability, for all lease arrangements in which it is a 
lessee, except for leases with term of less than twelve 
months (short term) and low-value assets. Certain lease 
arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate 
the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is 
reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
	
	
The cost of the ROU assets comprises the amount of 
the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease 
payments made at or before the inception date of the 
lease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives 
received. Subsequently, the right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The ROU 
assets are depreciated using the straight-line method 
from the commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of ROU assets.
	
	
ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount 
(i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the 
value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In such 
cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
	
	
For lease liabilities at inception, the Group measures the 
lease liability at the present value of the lease payments 
that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are 
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if 
that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily 
determined, the lease payments are discounted using the 
incremental borrowing rate.
	
	
The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement 
of lease liability as an adjustment to the ROU assets. 
Where the carrying amount of the ROU assets is 
reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the 
measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises 
any remaining amount of the remeasurement in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
	
For short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
	
The Group as a lessor
	
	
Lease income from operating leases where the Group is 
a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term unless the receipts are structured 
to increase in line with expected general inflation to 
compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. 
The respective leased assets are included in the balance 
sheet based on their nature.
	
12.	 Finance Cost 
	
	
Finance costs include interest expense computed 
by applying the effective interest rate on respective 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost. 
Financial instruments include debt and borrowing, 
Finance costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Ancillary and other borrowing costs are amortised 
on straight line basis over the tenure of the underlying 
debt and borrowing.
	
13.	 Goods and Service Input Tax Credit
	
	
 Goods and Services tax input credit is accounted for in 
the books in the period in which the supply of goods 
or service received is accounted and when there is no 
uncertainty in availing/utilising the credits.
	
14.	 Dividend distribution to equity holders of the Group
	
	
The Group recognises a liability to make distributions 
to equity holders of the Group when the distribution 
is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Group. As per the Act, final dividend is 
authorised when it is approved by the shareholders and 
interim dividend is authorised when it is approved by the 
Board of Directors of the Group.
	
15.	 Provisions 
	
	
Provisions are recognised only when: 
	
	
•	 an entity has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event; and
	
	
•	 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation; and
	
	
•	 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation
	
	
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
	
Further, long term provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows specific to 
the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised 
as finance cost. A provision for onerous contracts is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the 
expected net cost of continuing with the contract. 
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises 
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that 
contract.
	
	
Contingent liability is disclosed in case of: 
	
	
•	 a present obligation arising from past events, when it 
is not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation; and
	
	
•	 A present obligation arising from past events, when 
no reliable estimate is possible.
	
	
Contingent Assets:
	
	
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements
	
16.	 Commitments:
	
	
Commitments are future liabilities for contractual 
expenditure, classified and disclosed as follows:
	
	
•	 estimated amount of contracts remaining to be 
executed on capital account and not provided for; 
	
	
•	 uncalled liability on loan sanctioned and on 
investments partly paid; and 
	
	
•	 Other non-cancellable commitments, if any, to the 
extent they are considered material and relevant in 
the opinion of management.
	
17.	 Contingent Liabilities
	
	
 A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group 
or a present obligation that is not recognized because 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation. The Group does not 
recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence 
in the consolidated financial statements. Payments in 
respect of such liabilities, if any are shown as advances.
	
18.	 Earnings Per Share
	
	
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
	
	
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the 
determination of basic earnings per share to take into 
account
	
	
•	 The after income tax effect of interest and other 
financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
	
	
•	 Weighted average number of equity shares that 
would have been outstanding assuming the 
conversion of all the dilutive potential equity.
	
19.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
	
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits 
with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances 
(with an original maturity of three months or less from 
the date of acquisition), and highly liquid time deposits 
that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value. 
	
20.	 Statement of Cash Flow
	
	
Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating 
the cash flows into operating, investing and financing 
activities. Cash flow from operating activities is reported 
using indirect method adjusting the net profit for the 
effects of:
	
	
i.	
	
changes during the period in inventories and 
operating receivables and payables transactions 
of a noncash nature;
	
	
ii.	
	
non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, 
deferred taxes, unrealised foreign currency 
gains and losses, and undistributed profits of 
associates and joint ventures; and
	
	
iii.	 	
all other items for which the cash effects are 
investing or financing cash flows.
	
	
Cash and cash equivalents (including bank balances) 
shown in the Statement of Cash Flows exclude items 
which are not available for general use as on the date 
of Balance Sheet.
	
21.	 Employee Benefits
	
	
Short term employee benefits
	
	
Employee benefits falling due wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as short 
term employee benefits and are expensed in the period 
in which the employee renders the related service. 
Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee 
benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of 
the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the 
related service.
	
	
Long Term employee benefits
	
	
Group’s  net obligation in respect of long-term employee 
benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods. Long-term employee benefit primarily 
consists of Leave encashment benefits wherein 
employees are entitled to accumulate leave subject to 
certain limits for future encashment/availment. Long-
term compensated absences are provided for on 
the basis of an actuarial valuation at the end of each 
financial year using Projected Unit Credit (PUC) Method. 
Actuarial gains/losses, if any, are recognised immediately 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss

interest), are recognised in OCI, net of taxes. 
The Group determines the net interest expense 
(income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) 
for the period by applying the discount rate used 
to measure the defined benefit obligation at the 
beginning of the annual period to the net defined 
benefit liability (asset), taking into account any 
changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) 
during the period as a result of contributions 
and benefit payments. Net interest expense and 
other expenses related to defined benefit plans 
are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. 
	
	
	
	
The Groups net obligation in respect of gratuity 
(defined benefit plan), is calculated by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that the employees 
have earned in the current and prior periods, 
discounting that amount and deducting the 
fair value of any plan assets. The retirement 
benefit obligation recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in 
the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus 
resulting from this calculation is recognised as 
an asset to the extent of present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of 
refunds from the plans or reductions in the future 
contribution to the plans.
	
22.	 Share-based Payments
	
	
The cost of equity settled transactions is determined 
by the fair value at the grant date. The fair value of the 
employee share options is based on the Black Scholes 
model.
	
	
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based 
payment granted to employees is recognized as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of 
awards for which the related service and non-market 
performance conditions are expected to be met, such 
that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the 
number of awards that meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the vesting 
date. For share-based payment awards with market 
performance conditions and non-vesting conditions, 
the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment 
is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no 
true-up for differences between expected and actual 
outcomes.
	
	
Choice International Limited grants options to eligible 
employees of the Company under Choice Employee 
Stock Option Scheme 2022. The options vest over a 
period of four years. In case of Group equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions, where the Company 
grants stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing the cost of 
investment in subsidiary with a corresponding credit in 
the equity.
	
	
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
	
23.	 Collateral
	
	
To mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group 
seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral 
comes in various forms, such as securities, letter of 
credit/guarantees, receivables, inventories, other non-
financial assets and credit enhancements such as 
netting arrangements.
	
	
The Group provides fully secured, partially secured and 
unsecured loans to Corporates and individual.
	
24.	 Business combinations
	
	
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method as per Ind AS 103 – Business 
Combinations. The consideration transferred in a 
business combination is measured at fair value, which is 
calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values 
of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred 
by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition- related costs are 
generally recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss as 
incurred.
	
	
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair 
value at the acquisition date, except that:
	
	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or 
assets related to employee benefit arrangements are 
recognised and measured in accordance with Ind 
AS 12 Income Taxes and Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits 
respectively;
	
	
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value 
of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed.
	
	
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership 
interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate 
share of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation 
may be initially measured at the no controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
	
25.	 Goodwill
	
	
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is 
carried at cost established at the date of acquisition of 
the business less accumulated impairment loss if any. 
	
	
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
(CGU) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination.
	
	
A CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired, if the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the units pro-rata 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit, any impairment loss or goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent period.
	
	
On disposal of relevant CGU the attributable amount of 
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur,  and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability 
recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
Risk Exposure
Through its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed:
Investment risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate 
which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period 
on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan 
deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in 
government securities, and other debt instruments.
Interest risk
A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec. Rate will increase the present 
value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally 
increases the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of asset.
Asset liability matching risk
The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk
Mortality risk
"Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement 
age only, plan does not have any longevity risk."
Concentration risk
Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance entity 
and a default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as 
insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.
Salary risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the 
future salaries of members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more 
than assumed level will increase the plan's liability.
Maturity profile of gratuity liability and Employer contribution
Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the year ending March 31, 2023 are Rs.Nil (as at March 31, 2022: Rs. 105.41 
lakhs).
The weighted average duration (based on discounted cash flows) of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years (13.22 years as at March 31, 
2022). 
The expected maturity analysis of undiscounted gratuity is as follows

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial 
loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including 
Fixed deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major customers. In addition, a large number of 
minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The maximum exposure to credit risk 
at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed .
On account of adoption of Ind-AS 109, the Group uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss or gain. The Group uses 
a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account available 
external and internal credit risk factors and the Group’s historical experience for customers.
The Group has made adjustments in ECL Model to consider the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the provision. The probability of 
default has been assessed considering the likelihood of increased credit risk and consequential default due to pandemic. The impact on 
collateral values is also assessed for determination of loss given default and reasonable haircuts are applied wherever necessary. The 
moratorium benefit wherever extended has been taken into consideration for staging of loans in the Model.
The Group offers loans secured by real estate/housing property/investments. In order to migate credit risk, the Group also seeks collateral 
appropriate to the product segment and also ensure that Loan to value ratio is maintained as specified by regulator.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date based on the facts and circumstances existing on that date to identify 
expected losses on account of time value of money and credit risk. The credit quality of Loans and advances measured at amortised cost 
is primarily assessed by the Days Past Due (DPD) status and other qualitative factors leading to increase in credit risk.
In assessing the impairment of financial assets under the expected credit loss `defines default when a loan obligation is overdue for more 
than 90 days (net of subsequent receipts as on the reporting date) and credit impaired.

necessary. When a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives 
to match the terms of the hedged exposure. The Company hedges its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into INR of its foreign 
payables in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency option or forward contracts.

necessitates registration on various ESPs and maintenance of 
multiple user IDs and passwords by the shareholders.

login credential, through their demat accounts/ websites of 
Depositories/ Depository Participants. Demat account holders 
would be able to cast their vote without having to register 
again with the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating seamless
