26. 	Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to 
environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for 
identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per 
the following format:
	
Our parent company Pfizer Inc. completed an assessment to identify priorities related to responsible 
business growth, in alignment with corporate strategy. As part of the process, Pfizer Inc. identified 30 key 
topics, which were mapped into six priority areas. These priority areas are aligned with our Parent Company’s 
Blueprint Strategy and are further incorporated into its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. 
These six areas are consistent with our Values and our patient centered purpose.
	
In line with our Parent Company, Pfizer Limited has identified the following ESG priorities. Please see 
Pfizer’s enterprise Impact Report (https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/Pfizer_2024_Impact_Report-Performance_
Data_02JUN2025.pdf) for enterprise-level information and description of Pfizer’s ESG priority areas. The 
information that follows is based on locally identified responsible business conduct issues.

1.
Climate 
Change
Risk
At Pfizer, we are committed to 
reducing 
our 
environmental 
footprint, conserving resources, 
and reducing waste arising from 
our operations. We recognize that 
climate change poses significant 
risks to global health as well as to 
our business operations.
1. 	
The Company, through its parent 
company, Pfizer Inc., aims to 
continue its near term commitment 
to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 46% compared to 
2019 baseline, aligned with a 1.50C 
trajectory. Pfizer Inc. also aims to 
reduce GHG emissions by working 
to achieve the voluntary Net Zero 
Standard by 2040, 10 years earlier 
than the timeline prescribed in 
the standard. We aim to decrease 
GHG emissions by reducing the 
energy demand of our operations, 
transitioning away from fossil 
fuels, 
sourcing 
renewable 
electricity, and engaging suppliers 
to catalyze equivalent action.
2. 	
	Pfizer Limited installed a strategic, 
multi-phase 
1,500 
KWp 
solar 
project at its Goa manufacturing 
facility. The site generated 2596 
MWH Green Electricity in the 
financial year 2024-25 out of which 
1,803 
MWH 
electrical 
energy 
was consumed in manufacturing 
process 
and 
793 
MWH 
was 
exported back to National Grid.
Positive:
The Company’s focus on 
its climate change related 
goals helps enable it to 
reduce 
environmental 
risks and create a resilient 
business. 
Through 
replacing our capital assets 
to become more efficient 
and use alternative fuel 
sources, 
Pfizer 
could 
increase 
resilience 
to 
volatile fuel and energy 
prices resulting from the 
low-carbon 
transition 
and 
increase 
returns 
on 
investment 
in 
low 
emissions technology.

quality.
3.

relationships 
with 
our 
stakeholders. This furthers 
our 
business 
objectives

Permanent Workers
Yes.
Pfizer recognizes the critical importance and value of Pfizer’s employees 
and the need to build and sustain a culture where all employees can 
contribute their unique viewpoints and perspectives to all aspects 
of the business. Courage is a core value, and we promote a speak up 
environment. Our whistleblowing policies (e.g., Open Door policy) 
and strict anti-retaliation policies require reporting misconduct and 
encourage raising concerns about any issues. Retaliation against 
anyone who seeks advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or 
provides information in an investigation is prohibited.
The Company takes all policy concerns seriously and, to the extent 
violations of policy are identified, takes appropriate disciplinary action 
and corrective actions, including potential termination. We measure 
our culture of integrity with surveys, and the results are used to focus 
leadership communications, training, and other proactive improvement 
efforts. We provide multiple channels for asking questions and raising 
potential compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting options 
were permitted by law, and keep matters as confidential as possible.
The avenues for raising concerns are listed in the Blue Book and on 
our website www.pfizerltd.co.in, both of which are publicly available. 
Every employee, irrespective of hierarchy, has access to the Employee 
Relations Investigations Group, Compliance or Legal Division, Ombuds 
Office, People Experience Division of the Company and in appropriate 
and exceptional cases, concerns may be raised directly to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee of the Company.

Relations Investigations Group and in certain cases to the Corporate Compliance Group, necessary action is 
taken in line with the underlying internal polices and regulations applicable to the workplace. The Company also 
has the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) which addresses sexual harassment related grievances. Any case 
that is raised is thoroughly and confidentially investigated. If found guilty, appropriate action is taken against 
the accused. In appropriate and exceptional cases, concerns may be raised directly to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee of the Company. The Company has a zero-retaliation policy in place designed to ensure no adverse 
actions against the complainant.

Compliance Division (through email, phone, fax, mail and directly to colleagues), management, and other 
channels supported by our Open Door Policy (which includes our whistleblower policy). This policy encourages 
colleagues to present ideas, ask questions, and raise concerns. Retaliation against anyone who seeks advice, 
raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information in an investigation is strictly prohibited by our 
policy that protects whistleblowers. In addition, our Ombuds Office is an available resource to support colleagues 
with information and guidance to help them address work-related issues.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
	
At Pfizer, our senior leaders and management set the tone for a strong culture of integrity and encourage 
colleagues and partners to raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Retaliation against anyone who seeks 
advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information in an investigation is strictly prohibited by 
our anti-retaliation policy that protects whistleblowers. The Company has adopted a policy in accordance with 
the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 whereby an 
aggrieved woman can submit a complaint which must be investigated by the Internal Complaints Committee 
with absolute confidentiality.
	
The Company has in place a whistle-blower / vigil mechanism through which its directors, employees and 
stakeholders can report their genuine concerns about illegal or unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud 
or violation of the Company’s code of conduct or ethics policy. The mechanism provides for safeguards against 
victimization of persons who use such mechanism. If any individual, regardless of his or her role in the Company, 
retaliates against an employee who has truthfully and in good faith reported a potential violation, the Company 
will take appropriate action—even if it later turns out that the employee was mistaken in reporting the matter 
originally. The Company also conducts training and awareness programs for all its employees on periodic basis 
to embed a Speak Up Culture.

Details of the scope and coverage of any Human Rights due diligence conducted.
	
The Company relies on its parent company Pfizer Inc.’s. global human rights diligence program. Pfizer’s

to be high-risk, assess environment, health, safety (EHS), and sustainability performance, including labour and 
human rights reviews. When assessing whether a supplier is high-risk, we consider the supplier’s geography, 
industry, and other proprietary and public domain information. The risk-based assessment process results in a 
supplier risk score. Suppliers that are determined to have an elevated risk, e.g., EHS and labour and human rights 
risks, are subject to a governance process which may result in the supplier being required by Pfizer to develop 
corrective actions to improve their operations and procedures and/or mitigate identified risks. If the supplier 
does not comply with the agreed corrective actions, Pfizer may seek an alternative supplier. Additionally, Pfizer 
Limited has strong internal processes and checks to help ensure compliance on human rights and related topics.
