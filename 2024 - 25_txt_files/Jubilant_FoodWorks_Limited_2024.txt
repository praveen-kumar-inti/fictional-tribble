Risk
Risk:
•	 The Company operations involve 
various stages, from sourcing 
ingredients to food preparation 
and service, where potential 
food safety hazards may arise.
•	 These food safety incidents may:
-	 Impact the well-being of 
consumers
-	 Erode the brand reputation 
leading to loss of consumer 
trust and loyalty
-	 Result in regulatory 
repercussions, including fines 
or sanctions
-	 Disrupt normal business 
operations, causing 
temporary closures, product 
recalls or supply chain 
disruptions
•	 Therefore, inability to adhere 
to prescribed food safety 
standards or any contamination 
of food product poses a 
significant risk to the Company.
•	 Periodic testing of food 
products and regular 
food safety reviews are 
conducted to ensure 
sustained compliance and 
effectiveness
•	 The Company is highly 
committed in procuring raw 
materials from suppliers 
certified under GFSI 
program
•	 Regular training and 
awareness sessions are 
carried out for restaurant 
and SCC staff on 
adherence to quality norms
•	 The Company is actively 
monitoring and reducing 
food related customer 
complaints
•	 Cost savings 
in production, 
transportation 
and inventory 
management due 
to reduced waste, 
optimized processes, 
and enhanced supply 
chain efficiency
Negative:
•	 Product recall and 
disposal costs
•	 Costs related to 
finding alternative 
suppliers, 
renegotiating 
contracts or even 
temporary production 
halts
•	 Penalties for non-
compliance with food 
safety regulations
•	 Legal fees, 
settlements and 
damages due to 
lawsuits from affected 
consumers or 
regulatory bodies

Safety and 
Wellbeing
Opportunity 
Risk
Opportunity:
•	 Safety and well-being of 
its employees and delivery 
associates is of high importance 
to the Company and a 
cornerstone of its operational 
priorities
•	 Ensuring a secure and 
supportive workplace 
environment, fosters 
productivity, loyalty and 
enhances workforce morale”
Risk:
•	 Given the nature and scale of our 
business, which involves a large 
workforce daily engaged in food 
preparation, delivery logistics, 
and interaction with diverse 
urban environments, ensuring 
workforce safety is paramount.
•	 Health, safety and wellbeing is 
considered as critical because of 
following reasons:
•	 Unsafe working conditions and 
lack of support for employee 
well-being can lead to low 
morale and productivity, violation 
of employee rights and high 
attrition
To mitigate health and safety 
risks, several measures have 
been undertaken:
•	 The Company has 
systematically identified 
potential safety hazards 
at SCCs and restaurants 
and has ensured that 
adequate safety measures 
are implemented in 
compliance with applicable 
occupational health and 
safety regulations
•	 Additionally, the 
management has 
established a safety review 
process to ensure that 
employees comply with 
safety measures
•	 All reported cases undergo 
a comprehensive review 
and corrective and 
preventive actions are 
implemented as necessary
•	 To enhance employee 
awareness and 
preparedness, regular safety 
training and communications 
are carried out
Positive:
Increased workforce 
morale, satisfaction and 
retention leading to:
•	 Enhanced productivity 
and improved service 
resulting in better 
customer satisfaction 
positively impacting 
sales and profitability
•	 Reduced costs 
associated with 
recruiting, training, 
and onboarding new 
employees
Negative:
•	 Costs associated with 
medical treatment, 
rehabilitation, claims 
management and

premiums
•	 Fines and penalties 
due to non-
compliance with 
Occupational Health 
and Safety regulations

for:
•	 Differentiation and competitive 
advantage
•	 Enhancement of brand 
reputation
•	 Fostering trust among

associated with any perceived

•	 Increased investor confidence
Risk:
•	 In today’s dynamic business

around Human Rights policy 
and channels available for 
reporting concerns
c)	Waste Management:
•	 Tie-up with certified vendor

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
	
Dear Readers,
	
I'm excited to share our progress on our 'Jubilant for All' Sustainability Agenda. This agenda symbolizes how we work to create enduring 
value, delighting not only our consumers but all stakeholders through value creation. In our Integrated Annual Report for FY’25, we have 
demonstrated through select case studies how the shared value is benefitting multiple stakeholders.
	
At Jubilant FoodWorks, our sustainability strategy rests on four robust pillars:
	
•	
Responsible Sourcing 
	
•	
Baking Goodness 
	
•	
Emissions, Energy and Waste Management 
	
•	
Benefit People and Community
These pillars form the foundation of our commitment to sustainable and responsible business practices. Let me share some key highlights 
from each of these pillars:
In Responsible Sourcing, we've made significant strides across various fronts. We've achieved 100% farm traceability for key ingredients 
and implemented a corn localization initiative to support local farmers. Our use of Integrated Pest Management techniques for chili 
sourcing in Andhra Pradesh demonstrates our commitment to sustainable agricultural practices. In the dairy sector, we've empowered 
Jubilant FoodWorks Limited 
12
Business Responsibility and  
Sustainability Report
over 14,000 dairy farmers with training and veterinary support, enhancing both productivity and quality. During the year, a key focus area 
for us poultry sourcing, given that the sales mix of chicken products is expected to increase for our Company. Recognizing this trend, we're 
taking proactive steps to ensure responsible and sustainable practices in our poultry supply chain. Having achieved the unique milestone 
of implementing our 'No Antibiotics Ever' policy across our chicken products, we've recently introduced a comprehensive animal welfare 
policy, which has further strengthened our poultry sourcing practices. This policy ensures that our suppliers adhere to strict standards of 
animal care and well-being throughout the supply chain.
Under our Baking Goodness pillar, we've ensured all Domino's ingredients are free from artificial additives. We use 100% dairy-based 
mozzarella cheese. Our Pizza Box is 100% recyclable, and 96% of our vendors for Domino’s are also certified under the Global Food Safety 
Initiative. We have reimagined our consumer-facing packaging by eliminating pizza box lids from dine-in order, significantly reducing GSM 
without compromising strength of the box, and introducing brown boxes — serving millions of consumers with reduced environmental 
impact. The pivot to an edible pizza stool - from a plastic pizza stool - meant for ensuring multiple pizza boxes in an order are delivered 
to customers in the desired state is one of the many examples on how small yet positive changes are helping us advance our Baking 
Goodness agenda while benefitting all stakeholders.  
For Emissions, Energy and Waste Management, we've made significant strides. I'm proud to announce that we have become India's 
largest EV fleet operator in the food service industry. About 56% of our delivery fleet, or ~16,853 vehicles, are now EVs. This achievement is 
particularly impactful as we see an increase in our delivery channel mix. By proactively transitioning to EVs and even electric bikes in some 
cases, we're eliminating tailpipe emissions from a growing segment of our business, significantly reducing the overall carbon footprint for 
the entire ecosystem. 
Additionally, our unique multi-brand, multi-temperature commissary-based manufacturing and sourcing model is leading to substantial 
conservation of natural resources and reduction of wastage through volume-based scale efficiencies. This model helps us in pooling 
the requirements of a very large network of 2,300+ neighbourhood stores into 8 commissaries across India also leading to significant 
improvement in food safety which is a cornerstone of our sustainability efforts and our highest priority. Our NABL-accredited laboratories 
ensure that each batch of raw materials meets rigorous standards. Continued investments in store-level training empower our teams to 
consistently deliver safe, high-quality products, thereby strengthening customer trust and minimizing operational risks. 
In logistics for distribution of multiple SKUs meant for stores from commissaries, during the year, we optimized packaging which led to 
lower fuel requirement while maintain high standards of temperature control.  Through redesigned dough ball placement patterns, we 
were able to enhance delivery efficiencies in addition to continuous focus on route planning. Through ongoing enhancements in our 
auto-indenting and transport management tools, we were able to reduce both logistics costs and emissions. Furthermore, our move to 
in-house manufacturing at SCCs has improved quality consistency and reduced production expenses. 
On the energy front, we are transitioning to a higher renewable energy mix by pooling our energy requirements and investing in operators 
of large-scale solar farms. This helps us reduce our carbon emissions and significantly lowering electricity costs.
Across our value chain, we are also implementing advanced technologies to aid our employees in executing the assigned tasks more 
efficiently while ensuring a safer work environment for everyone. This includes real-time tracking, IoT tagging on assets, face-detection 
based access controls, embedded sensors for automatic door closures in temperature-controlled areas to mitigate operational risks and 
create a safer work environment.
Our fourth pillar, Benefit People and Community, focuses on creating positive impact on society. We've trained over 4,732 students 
through J-FARM, our restaurant management academy. We're building a more diverse workforce with 36% female representation, making 
concerted efforts to increase the participation of women across our operations. We're Great Place to Work Certified and conduct regular 
employee engagement surveys and continuously work on feedback to further improve. Our community initiatives provides healthcare 
access to 469,000 people.
These initiatives and achievements are overseen by our Sustainability and CSR Committee of the Board, ensuring that our sustainability 
strategy is integrated at the highest levels of our organization.
Importantly, we have now pivoted from Limited Assurance to voluntary Reasonable Assurance in FY’25 BRSR report, demonstrating our 
commitment to the highest standards of transparency and disclosure.
As we move forward, we remain committed to our multi-year, time-bound goals anchored around Food, Planet, People and Communities, 
and Governance. We have made significant progress year-on-year in achieving these targets. We recognize that sustainability is an 
ongoing journey, and we're dedicated to continuous improvement and transparent reporting of our progress.

Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the 
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made 
by the entity, respectively. 
P2-E2 A.	Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
Yes, the Company has dedicated policies for Sustainability and a Supplier Code of Conduct, which integrate social, ethical, and 
environmental factors into the supplier evaluation and onboarding processes to support responsible sourcing.
As part of this framework, all suppliers are audited to assess compliance with our standards and to establish a foundation of ethical 
business practices. These audits ensure that suppliers align their operations with applicable environmental laws, regulations, 
and industry best practices. The Supplier Code of Conduct is shared with all suppliers, setting clear expectations regarding 
environmental performance, labour practices, human rights, and responsible sourcing. 
A key example of the Company’s commitment to sustainable sourcing is the procurement of chicken under its ‘No Antibiotics Ever’ 
(NAE) policy. Under this initiative, chicken is sourced exclusively from dedicated poultry farms within its supply network. These farms 
operate under the strict supervision of the Company’s veterinary team and must adhere to detailed Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) and robust animal welfare standards. By eliminating antibiotic use, the Company promotes responsible farming practices 
and sets a benchmark for ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency. 
Additionally, the Company is sourcing responsibly through several other key initiatives:
	
	
	
-	 A Dairy Farmer Development Program focused on promoting ethical farming practices for milk production and 
animal welfare.
	
	
	
-	 Sourcing palm oil exclusively from suppliers certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
	
	
	
-	 Implementing backward integration for chilli procurement utilizing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices.

Safety Management Systems (FSMS). JFL also prioritizes sourcing from Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified suppliers and 
requires FSSAI certification for all raw material suppliers during on-boarding.
In addition to this, some of our suppliers are  certified to ISO 22000, while others hold additional certifications like ISO 14001 
(Environment), ISO 45001 (Health and Safety), HACCP (Food Safety), and RSPO (Sustainable Palm Oil).

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The Company has implemented comprehensive processes to ensure the safe reclaiming, recycling, and disposal of various waste 
streams at the end of their life cycle. 
1.	
Plastics (including packaging): The plastic packaging is designed with an intent to reduce plastic use through lightweight and 
alternative materials. The Company’s recycling partners collect, and process used plastic products from our operations. The 
Company aims to spread awareness to the consumers through various initiatives such as serving in pizza boxes made of 80% 
recycled paper, replacing plastic pizza stool with edible stool, using paper packaging and serving beverages in glass bottles.
2.	
E-waste: The Company ensures the safe disposal of electronic products and equipment. Obsolete or damaged electronics 
are collected and sent to authorised e-waste recycling vendors who follow responsible recycling practices, ensuring that 
valuable materials are recovered and hazardous components are disposed of safely.
3.	
Hazardous waste: The Company does not use hazardous materials in its operations. Limited hazardous waste, such as used 
oil from diesel generators and sludge from Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), is generated from utility operations and is safely 
collected, stored, and disposed of through authorized contractors. A battery buy-back program has been adopted to ensure 
responsible recycling. All hazardous waste is managed in compliance with regulations, with regular monitoring to uphold the 
highest environmental standards.
4.	
Other Waste: The Company manages other types of waste, such as food waste and used oil, through a structured waste 
segregation system. At some of our facilities, the organic food waste is either sent to fisheries for use as feed or composted 
for using in green belt areas, maintained by the Company. Non-recyclable waste is handed over to authorized waste handlers 
to ensure safe disposal with minimal environmental impact. Additionally, under the RUCO (Repurpose Used Cooking Oil) 
initiative, used oil is collected and converted into biodiesel, contributing to cleaner energy solutions. 
P2-E4	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.   
Yes, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the Company’s activities. The Company’s waste collection and 
recycling processes are fully aligned with the EPR plan submitted to the respective Pollution Control Boards. Compliance is ensured 
through partnerships with authorized waste management agencies, regular tracking of waste quantities, and fulfilment of recycling 
obligations as per regulatory requirements.
Leadership Indicators:
P2-L1	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following 
format? The Company does not use any recycled or reused material in production.
Yes, the Company has adopted a Life Cycle Perspective through its Product Lifecycle Policy. The Company strives to create a 
greener and more efficient supply chain by considering the environmental impact of its products and services from design to 
disposal. The Company works closely with stakeholders, including designers, producers, and recyclers, to ensure environmental 
responsibility throughout the value chain. The Company continuously reviews and integrates resource-efficient technologies and 
processes to reduce resource consumption, promote recycling, and ensure safe product disposal. The Company also focuses on 
reducing water and electricity use across its value chain, enhancing sustainability. 
P2-L2	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or 
through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same. 
None of our products are associated with any significant social or environmental concerns. The Company ensures environmentally 
responsible disposal practices across product categories, ranging from biodegradable food items to other forms of waste, which 
are managed through authorized recyclers and certified waste handling agencies.
P2-L3	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for service industry).
Within the entire brand portfolio, the largest network for JFL in India is of Domino’s. The pizza boxes used in Domino’s are 100% 
recyclable. However, with continued progress the fully recyclable Domino’s India boxes in turn are made of 80% recycled paper with

Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as percentage of products sold) for each product 
category. 
As a food service Company, our operations are based on the use of fresh, made-to-order products, and therefore, product 
reclamation is not applicable to our business model. Similarly, due to the perishable nature of our offerings, the concept of reclaiming 
sold products or their packaging materials does not arise. 
However, we remain committed to sustainable packaging practices. Our pizza boxes are made from approximately 80% recycled 
paper, with the inner lining composed of virgin paper to ensure product quality and compliance with food safety standards.

Switching to E-Bikes
The Company has made a significant progress this year, increasing the number of e-bikes and e-cycle to 56%. This is an 
important initiative to reduce carbon footprint and transition to a more sustainable future. The Company is focused to 
implement e-bikes in all of the new stores, taking into account the local terrain. All of the bikes used in Popeyes and Hong's 
kitchen are already electric.
 
 
Energy Savings through VFDs on Exhaust Systems:
To ensure proper ventilation, exhaust fans are essential for our operations. However, they have been running at a full speed 
regardless of the actual demand, leading to unnecessary energy consumption and inefficiency. 
To address this, we installed Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to dynamically regulate fan speeds based on real-time load 
requirements. With the VFDs in place, exhaust fans operate at optimal speeds, delivering full power only when needed and 
reducing their speed during low-demand periods. This targeted solution has significantly reduced energy usage, extended 
equipment lifespan, and enhanced overall operational efficiency.

Purchasing renewable power
To advance our Sustainability goals, we’ve strategically transitioned to renewable energy for our sites with high energy 
demand. We successfully procured renewable power for our Bangalore facility through open access and have signed a PPA 
to power our Greater Noida Commissary with clean energy.   
Through the open access purchase, the renewable energy is generated off-site and is fed into the regional grid from where 
the Company is drawing an equivalent amount for our facilities. This initiative has resulted in procurement of more than 6000 
Mwh of RE energy. 
	
	
In accordance with the Environment Policy, the Company is committed to improve environmental performance by adopting cleaner 
production methods and promoting energy efficient environmental technologies (including renewable energy) in operations to 
reduce Green House Gas emissions.

processes. These advanced treatment stages 
significantly enhance the quality of treated water, 
making it suitable for reuse in various utility 
applications such as cooling towers and hand 
wash stations.
This initiative has enabled the Company to 
achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) at the 
site, thereby reducing the dependency on 
freshwater sources and significantly lowering 
the overall water footprint.
3.
Increasing share 
of EV’s in our 
delivery fleet
The Company is strategically increasing the 
share of electric vehicles in its delivery fleet, 
thereby reducing reliance on petrol-engine bikes.
By adopting EVs, the Company is achieving 
substantial savings on petrol consumption and 
vehicle maintenance costs, which together 
contribute to a lower overall cost per delivery. 
The use of governor-controlled speed 
attachments on EVs has also enhanced delivery 
rider safety. Moreover, this transition supports 
our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and 
minimize our environmental footprint
