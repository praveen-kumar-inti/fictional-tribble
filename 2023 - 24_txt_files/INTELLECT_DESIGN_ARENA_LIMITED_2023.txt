We are all familiar with Sustainability as defined by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by all members of the United Nations. At 
Intellect, we believe in ‘Holistic Sustainability’. Intellect’s lens on sustainability is about building capacity and competency in societies and communities 
wherein people own the problem and solve it themselves. We firmly believe businesses can have a far-reaching societal impact by utilising their 
entrepreneurial energy, creativity, and innovation. Our approach towards Holistic Sustainability revolves around three key areas. 
• 
Initiatives within the organisation across the three dimensions of Environment, Social and Governance 
• 
Influencing our associates and Business partners to contribute towards Holistic sustainability through our Social Impact initiatives 
• 
Impacting the larger ecosystem by influencing the Thinking process in Policy design and deployment 
Our success in approaching sustainability holistically stems from our commitment to First Principles Thinking, deeply ingrained in our DNA, alongside 
Design Thinking. First-principles thinking enables us to deconstruct complex issues and offers a fresh way of understanding and solving sustainability 
challenges and designing resilient and regenerative systems and practices. Design Thinking, on the other hand, fosters innovative solutions, transcending 
linear boundaries to yield nonlinear outcomes. 
Intellect hosted three major events this fiscal. Mission Samriddhi Summit 9 event brought together over 275 delegates from 18 different locations in 
India. School of Design Thinking (SoDT) and Intellect hosted the ‘1st National Conclave on Design Thinking for Academic Leaders’ with the theme ‘Talent 
2040’. We hosted Global eMACH.ai Summit 2024, the world's first open finance summit in our Global Headquarters in Chennai, which was attended by 
over 350 senior Intellect leaders and advisors. 
With the progress made thus far, we are more convinced than ever that we can make a positive difference by being a model of a Sustainable, Inclusive, 
well-governed Human Corporate.

2. A. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
(Yes/No) 
- Yes, In our ongoing commitment to sustainability and responsible

Conduct, a cornerstone of our procurement strategy. This document

environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and business

chain. 
Every supplier engaging in business with us is required to affirm their 
commitment to our Supplier Code of Conduct by signing an agreement. By

Intellect Annual Report 2023 - 24 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report   |  203 
therein, aligning their operations with our values and aspirations for a 
sustainable future. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct encompasses a spectrum of critical areas, 
including Ethical Business Practices, Environmental Responsibility, Labor 
Standards, Human Rights, Health and Safety and Diversity and Inclusion.  
By integrating our Supplier Code of Conduct into our procurement 
processes and supplier relationships, we endeavor to catalyse positive 
change, drive continuous improvement, and mitigate risks associated with 
unethical or unsustainable practices. Together with our suppliers, we 
strive to build a supply chain ecosystem grounded in integrity, 
responsibility, and shared values, ultimately contributing to a more 
sustainable and equitable world. 
Processes followed under Sustainable Value Chain

forced labor, ensuring workplace safety, statutory & regulatory 
requirements and paying fair wages etc. Supplier selection involves 
identifying qualified suppliers, requesting quotations, and evaluating 
financial stability and capability to meet commitments through a 
competitive bidding process. 
Supplier Assessment 
Supplier assessment involves evaluating new suppliers' potential through 
background checks on service quality and financial strength. Onboarding 
includes completing statutory documentation, regulatory formalities, and 
familiarising suppliers with products and services, establishing a detailed 
operational roadmap. This ensures new suppliers comply with our 
standards. 
Supplier Evaluation 
Supplier evaluation assesses long-term vendors' performance to improve 
relations and performance. This involves monitoring project management, 
response to requests, adherence to schedules, and safety practices. 
Periodic feedback is provided to identify performance issues and improve 
quality, health, safety, and environmental standards. Audits on statutory 
regulations and continuous evaluation conducted to ensure suppliers 
meet our expectations.

them to pioneer new concepts. All businesses of the Company comply 
with relevant regulations and voluntary codes concerning marketing 
communications, including advertising, promotion and sponsorship.

Essential Indicators:  
1. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to

of the business unit coordinates with the project teams and 
Intellect Annual Report 2023 - 24 
216  |  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
tracks the complaint to closure. As part of this process, the 
project team needs to come up with a Go To Green Plan (GTGP), 
which details how the project will be brought back on track 
(made Green) by resolving the Customer complaint. Project 
teams can have multiple discussions with customers to 
understand the issue and discuss the resolution. The central 
team, which maintains the record of all such projects, also 
provides a mechanism whereby alert mails to relevant 
stakeholders are automatically triggered at various stages.  
- 
We also have a well-established system to obtain customer 
feedback through the Net Promoter Score which is the industry 
benchmark on customer satisfaction. An independent corporate 
team is tasked with triggering surveys, obtaining feedback and 
consolidation across Intellect. Assurance teams within business 
units ensure Service Delivery, Manufacturing and Support teams 
analyse the feedback, connect back with customers and put 
action plans in place to address customer concerns / Suggestions
