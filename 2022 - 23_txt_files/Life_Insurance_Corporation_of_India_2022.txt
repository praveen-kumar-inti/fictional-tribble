keeping with the personnel policies, there is continuous vertical and lateral 
movement in the organisation. All these factors necessitate that there has to be

within the organization. The pandemic situation necessitated and propelled the 
organization to move towards self learning through digital mode. This has 
enabled standardized content without dependence on physical infrastructure 
and facilitators and is available anywhere any time on intranet/internet web 
browsers. 
The Organisation upgraded its technology infrastructure to give an enterprise 
wide experience at lightning speed. The current focus has been to make 
communication and collaboration easily available as part of the new work 
experience. 
 
Following are the major initiatives undertaken:

centers across India. Developers have been provided with Work From 
Home access to the development center thereby handling data and 
application smoothly.

opportunity (Indicate positive or 
negative implications) 
 
Positive: 
Per employee turnover as well as productivity is enhanced due to retention of 
key talent. 
 
 Negative:

The hardware items which are end-of-life are given to the hardware vendor under buyback option. The vendor, in turn, 
appoints an e-waste disposal vendor who picks up the hardware from all the locations after dismantling/ degaussing and 
gives a certificate in Form-2 to the concerned LIC office. We have disposed 342.15 metric tonnes of e-waste in the financial 
year 2022-23 and 9.37 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2021-22. 
 
As the Corporation is in the Insurance Business, there is limited scope for using recycled material. However, our offices have 
been encouraged to recycle e-waste, such as servers, computers, cartridges, ribbons are primary e-waste generated and is 
being disposed off through authorized vendors, who picks up the hardware from all the locations after dismantling/ 
degaussing, re-cycling certificate are also received from them. For collection and disposal of e-waste and electrical waste for 
safe disposal collection boxes are kept at Yogakshema building premises.

Leadership Indicators 
1. 
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format? 
 
 
The Corporation is in the business of providing life, health and annuity cover to its customers based on their need. The customer 
life cycle starts from sourcing of policies from multiple channels, underwriting of the same, issuing of policies followed by servicing 
of the policy depending on the needs of the customers till the policy matures or results in a claim. 
 
Sourcing: 
 
There are multiple channels involved in sourcing of insurance policies and the authorised sourcing intermediary is required to 
follow the organizational and regulatory guidelines in the matter, Policies are sourced by Agents, bancassurance partners, 
corporate agents, brokers, insurance marketing firms, web aggregators, direct, micro agents, etc. Simultaneously, policies can be 
sourced in the physical as well as the digital format depending on the customer’s need and preference regarding the same. 
 
Proposals sourced through the inhouse Ananda app are digitally processed and results in elimination of submission of various 
documents physically while at the same time saving paper. 
 
Underwriting: 
 
Underwriting is a core activity and is done to assess the risk involved in insuring every life individually. The demographic, financial 
and health parameters as disclosed by the person seeking life insurance is assessed to determine whether the standard rates are 
applicable. Depending on the assessment, if necessary, additional requirements from the financial angle and/or further medical 
tests, etc are called for. Various checks are done to ensure the authenticity of the documents submitted. The underwriting process 
is digitally enabled and ensures that a vast majority of the proposals are underwritten at the branch itself. After underwriting, the 
policy bond is sent to the customer in the physical as well as digital format. 
 
Policy Servicing: 
 
This stage involves transactions like payment of renewal premium, change of nomination, assignment, mode of payment change, 
switching of funds in case of unit linked products, etc during the life time of the policy. 
 
Apart from catering to the needs of the customers through its physical offices, the Corporation also provides digital solutions for 
policy servicing through its website, by whatsapp and customer apps. The Ananda app enables completion of the policy 
electronically without the necessity of the customer to visit any branch office. Additionally, SMS, emails and chatbot enable fast 
and smooth solution for various servicing requirements of the customers. We actively encourage the customer to register 
themselves to enable premium servicing electronically for various requirements thereby ensuring reduction of paper work as well 
as the carbon foot print by considerably lessening the need to travel to our branches/offices. 
 
Claims settlement: 
 
Maturity claim and Death claim by the policy holder/claimants are the means by which based on the terms and conditions, a policy 
can be closed. There may also be other specific events specified in the terms and conditions of the contract which may result in 
its termination. 
 
Maturity of a policy refers to the termination of the life insurance contract at the end of the period of contract as specified in the 
policy bond or at the end of the premium paying term based on the conditions therein. Surrender of a policy is when a policy 
holder voluntarily chooses to terminate the life insurance contract before its expiry. Payment in case of surrender or maturity is 
made as per the terms of the contract. Payments are made electronically which is quicker and saves on cheque printing, dispatch 
of the same, etc. Payments made in the event of illness, hospitalization or death are made as per the terms of the contract. 
Submission of the papers by the policy holder or claimants is enabled at the nearest/concerned branch office. After processing 
the same, all claims are paid electronically. 
 
Grievance Redressal: 
 
Grievances are redressed through a robust grievance redressal mechanism. Customers, employees, investors, etc may have 
grievances at any point of time which are addressed by a standard operating procedure. A vast majority of the grievances are 
resolved at the branch or customer zone level. There are dedicated grievance redressal officials at all levels. The Corporation 
adheres to timely and appropriate manner of grievance redressal in line with the regulatory guidelines. We study and update our 
system by analyzing the nature of grievances from time to time.

employee can register his grievance and the same can be addressed. If the employee is not satisfied, he/she can go for the 
first appeal to the higher authority and further go for a final appeal to the subsequent higher authority.

The Corporation has also developed a portal on the intranet site called e-Samadhan where grievances can be registered by 
any employee which will be forwarded online to the Staff Grievance Officer. There is also a provision for appeal to the next 
 
higher authority through the portal. The e-Samadhan portal serves as the repository of all relevant information pertaining to 
each grievance and for the purpose of monitoring and tracking each grievance for timely resolution.

 LIC has positioned itself as the insurer of choice and continues to sustain its leadership position after 22 years of 
liberalization with dominant business mix coming from the participating business sourced primarily through agency force. 
Further, LIC has capitalized on heightened awareness about life insurance and is pursuing digital engagement and digitized

bionic agents by extending tech support in the form of digital tools and analytics to the agency force is on its way.

growth, expanding participation in health insurance, facilitating the creation of an ecosystem, improving ease of doing 
business, taxation enablers, expanding the retirement segment and liberalized norms for investment. Regulation Review 
Committee (RRC) has been formed with sub-groups for providing inputs/ suggestions to achieve this objective. LIC is a part 
of RRC and a member in all the sub-groups under it.
