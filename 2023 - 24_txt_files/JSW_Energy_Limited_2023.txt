c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. 
	
	
Yes, As part of its safety initiative, JSW requires all employees, business associates, and contractors to 
follow the “10 JSW CRITICAL SAFETY RULES” to reduce injuries and illnesses. These rules encourage safety 
discussions and improvements.
	
	
The company employs a software system for logging safety observations, where employees report 
unsafe acts, conditions, near-misses, hazards, injuries, and accidents monthly. These reports trigger 
alerts for mitigation, monitored weekly by the safety team and reviewed in monthly safety meetings. JSW 
expects all management levels and employees to proactively address hazards and halt unsafe work. The 
Safety Observation (SO) program engages the workforce, with leadership mandated to conduct shop floor 
walkthroughs. High-risk operations are improved using Risk Rating methods, brainstorming teams, new 
technologies, safety barriers, and administrative controls. Each major plant has enhanced at least 20 
high-risk systems through the Barrier Health Management system.
	
d. 	
Do the employees/ workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services?

Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address significant risks / concerns arising

Safety Improvements opportunities were listed and given to value chain partner for implementation at their 
manufacturing unit. Additionally periodic safety assessments are done with our Fabricators, at various other 
locations eg. Baramati, Chakan and Ingole in Maharshtra, Nellore in AP and Trichy in TN. Here the JSW Team does 
regular Safety Pep Talks, Tool Box Talks (TBT) with vendor teams.
	
All contractors & value chain partners, working in the premises of JSW Energy are sufficiently trained on safety 
practices and systems, inline with JSW Energy safety systems, so that there are no safety violations from 
their end. This practice enables the value-chain partner to enhance his safety systems, practices and training 
parameters. Also, JSW Contractor Assessment and Rating for Excellence in Safety (CARES) assessment for 
contractors working within the plant premises helps to identify gaps in their safety systems and guides them 
to improve safety. This further improves their Star ranking amongst all the contractors, highest being 5 STAR. 
The 5 STAR rated contractor becomes a preferred contractor across JSW Group.

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
JSW Energy is dedicated to sustainable waste management practices across its thermal, hydropower, and 
renewable energy projects. Despite the nature of its business, which focuses on electricity generation, the 
company takes proactive measures to manage and minimize waste.
	
The primary hazardous waste generated during operations and maintenance activities is waste oil. This waste 
oil, though produced in minimal quantities, is responsibly recycled through authorized recycling agencies at 
all locations, ensuring environmental compliance and resource efficiency. Beyond waste oil, the electricity 
generation process at JSW Energy does not involve any toxic chemicals, reflecting the company’s commitment 
to minimizing environmental impact.
	
Furthermore, JSW Energy emphasizes continuous improvement in its waste management practices. The 
company engages in regular audits and monitoring to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and 
strives to adopt best practices in waste reduction and recycling. By prioritizing eco-friendly operations, JSW 
Energy not only reduces its environmental footprint but also sets a benchmark for sustainable practices in the 
energy sector.
11.	 If the entity has operations / offices in / around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife 
sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones, etc.)

JSW Energy has established a comprehensive Business Continuity Policy, approved by the Board, and 
implemented Business Continuity Plans (BCP) for its major generation plants at Barmer, Ratnagiri, Vijayanagar, 
and Hydro-Sholtu. These plants have undergone rigorous audits for the Business Continuity Management 
System (BCMS) and successfully achieved certification under ISO 22301.
	
The primary goal of the BCP is to ensure business continuity during disruptive incidents, aiming to minimize the 
impact on human life and other living beings, the environment and related ecosystems, economic losses, and 
all stakeholders, including investors and employees.
	
To strengthen the BCP, JSW Energy conducts regular training and awareness sessions across plant locations. In 
addition to training, the company performs periodic BCP testing to assess its effectiveness and identify areas 
for improvement based on observed gaps. Through these efforts, JSW Energy ensures a resilient and prepared 
response to any potential disruptions.
