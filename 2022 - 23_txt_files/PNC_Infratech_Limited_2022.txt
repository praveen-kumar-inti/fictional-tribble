 1.
Climate change
Risk
The pressing issue of climate 
change has underscored the 
necessity 
to 
enhance 
the 
resilience of urban regions. 
Many 
infrastructures 
and 
public areas weren't planned 
to cope with the environmental 
challenges we currently face, 
including 
severe 
weather 
conditions, air pollution, energy 
deficits, and water scarcity. 
Tackling 
climate 
change 
demands the expansion of 
innovative solutions in areas 
such as energy, efficiency, 
material 
use, 
and 
beyond. 
Government 
policies 
are 
catalysing a shift towards 
eco-friendly construction. The 
climate action agenda presents 
commercial 
opportunities 
that empower us to aid in 
climate change adaptation and 
reduction.
Potential alterations brought 
on by climate change, such as 
regulatory modifications, shifts 
in consumer preferences, and 
other substantial changes in 
the 
Company's 
operational 
context, could also significantly 
affect the business and poses 
a risk.
As an organization, we recognize 
the 
imperative 
to 
address 
carbon emissions as a risk. 
We are committed to adopting 
proactive measures, including 
investing in clean technologies, 
optimizing 
energy 
efficiency, 
and 
promoting 
sustainable 
practices. By taking decisive 
action, we aim to mitigate our 
carbon footprint and contribute 
to a greener, low-carbon future.
 Negative
 2.
Circularity, 
including 
materials and 
resources 
efficiency
 Risk
The Company is in construction 
business and the disruption 
in operations could have the 
risk of creating an adverse 
economic impact. The link 
between circular flows and 
climate emissions is clear, and 
increasing 
circular 
material 
flows 
could 
help 
reduce 
climate impact. Circularity and 
resource efficiency are linked 
to operational efficiency and 
reduced environmental impact.
The 
company 
may 
adopt 
measures 
that 
promote 
circular 
practices, 
such 
as 
utilizing 
recycled 
materials, 
implementing efficient waste 
management, and prioritizing 
resource 
conservation. 
By 
embracing circularity, we aim to 
minimize environmental impact 
and contribute to a sustainable 
construction industry.

3.
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
The Group is engaged in 
executing potentially hazardous 
projects 
that 
necessitate 
ongoing 
supervision 
and 
administration of health and 
safety risks. Neglecting to 
handle these risks could lead 
to serious consequences, such 
as causing fatal or life-altering 
injuries 
to 
our 
employees, 
subcontractors, 
external 
individuals, 
or 
the 
general 
public. Additionally, it could 
expose us to the possibility 
of legal action, substantial 
penalties, 
disqualification 
from tender participation, and 
damage to our reputation.
We 
have 
implemented 
comprehensive risk mitigation 
measures 
to 
ensure 
occupational 
health 
and 
safety. These include regular 
safety training programs, strict 
adherence to safety protocols, 
regular inspections. We prioritize 
the use of personal protective 
equipment (PPE), conduct risk 
assessments, and promote a 
culture of proactive reporting 
and continuous improvement.
Negative
4.
Corporate 
Governance and 
Business Ethics
Risk
Failure to adhere to the Code of 
Ethics may result from a lack of 
adherence to a risk compliance 
approach; an absence of a 
suitable 
corporate 
culture; 
a deficient training program 
and compliance monitoring; 
lack of a robust testing and 
monitoring regime; inadequate 
whistleblowing 
procedures 
and a lack of awareness about 
these channels across the 
organization; or deliberate or 
negligent 
non-compliance. 
Non-compliance 
with 
the 
Code of Ethics can leave the 
Group vulnerable to incidents 
of bribery and corruption, fraud, 
deception, false declarations 
or falsified accounting, unfair 
competitive 
practices, 
and 
violations of human rights such 
as child labour, illegal labour, 
etc. Such failures could trigger 
legal investigations or disputes, 
causing business disruptions, 
financial losses, hefty fines and 
penalties, reputational harm, 
and exclusion from future 
opportunities.
At our organization, we have 
robust policies and procedures 
in place to ensure effective risk 
mitigation and promote sound 
governance 
and 
business 
ethics. We adhere to strict 
regulatory standards, conduct 
regular audits, and maintain a 
strong compliance framework. 
Our employees are educated 
on ethical practices, and we 
foster a culture of transparency, 
accountability, 
and 
integrity 
across 
all 
levels 
of 
our 
organization.

5.
Human Rights 
& Labour 
Conditions
Risk
Companies need to ensure that 
they are not indirectly involved 
in 
human 
rights 
abuses. 
Violations like poor working 
conditions, 
modern 
slavery, 
child labour, or environmental 
infractions at work locations/
sites or by subcontractors or 
suppliers in our supply chain 
can inflict harm on individuals 
and the environment. Such 
transgressions can lead to 
reputational damage, a loss 
of trust in the Company's 
responsibility, 
and 
can 
result 
in 
fines, 
penalties, 
civil litigation, and criminal 
prosecution. It is essential 
for 
businesses 
to 
respect 
and support the principles of 
freedom of association and 
the effective recognition of the 
right to collective bargaining. 
Furthermore, 
businesses 
must actively work towards 
eliminating all forms of forced 
and compulsory labour.
We 
prioritize 
human 
rights 
and 
labour 
conditions 
by 
implementing 
comprehensive 
policies 
and 
practices 
that 
mitigate risks. Our organization 
strictly adheres to regulatory 
compliances 
and 
labour 
standards. We promote fair 
treatment, non-discrimination, 
safe working conditions, and 
provide 
appropriate 
training 
and support to our employees, 
ensuring their rights and well-
being are upheld.
Negative
6.
Supply chain 
management
Risk
As a responsible business, it 
entails conducting operations 
in a fair and ethical manner, 
prioritizing integrity in decision-
making, and establishing trust 
as a reliable partner within 
the supply chain. Sustainable 
supply chains are crucial in 
ensuring safe and equitable 
conditions for all stakeholders. 
Any disruptions or shortages 
of materials and labour can 
lead to both financial and non-
financial repercussions, such 
as environmental or safety 
incidents, violations of human 
rights within the supply chain, 
compromised ability to meet 
customer 
expectations 
and 
project commitments, damage 
to reputation due to suppliers 
and 
subcontractors 
acting 
contrary to the Company's 
values, and potential fines, 
penalties, and lawsuits.
We have implemented various 
risk mitigation measures in our 
supply chain management to 
ensure operational efficiency. 
This 
includes 
establishing 
reliable supplier networks, and 
maintaining strong relationships. 
We have streamlined processes 
for timely supplies and inventory 
management, 
ensuring 
uninterrupted operations.

Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
Risk
One of the key areas of focus is 
the advancement of a circular 
model that emphasizes the 
reduction 
and 
optimization 
of material usage, as well as 
effective waste management. 
By 
optimizing 
resources, 
businesses 
can 
enhance 
operational 
and 
financial 
efficiency while simultaneously 
minimizing waste generation. 
Neglecting 
proper 
waste 
management 
practices 
can 
lead to inefficient utilization of 
raw materials and an escalation 
in production costs.
We 
prioritize 
proper 
waste 
management 
practices 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
associated 
with 
waste 
and 
materials 
management. Our organization 
has 
implemented 
protocols 
for the storage, handling, and 
disposal of waste. We ensure 
compliance with all applicable 
regulations and industry best 
practices.
Negative
8.
Water usage and 
management
Risk/Opportunity
Risk: Water plays a vital role 
in construction activities and 
has significant implications for 
the environment throughout its 
extraction, usage, and discharge 
processes. Given the growing 
strain on water resources and 
the imperative to protect the 
natural environment, effective 
control and management of 
water resources have become 
crucial. Thus, it is essential 
to encourage the responsible 
and efficient use of water, 
along with the development of 
infrastructure that promotes its 
conservation in a sustainable 
and 
environmentally-friendly 
manner. 
Identifying 
and 
mitigating water-related risks, 
as 
well 
as 
implementing 
responsible 
management 
procedures, are necessary steps 
towards achieving these goals.
Opportunity: 
Implementing 
effective 
water 
usage 
and 
management 
practices 
not 
only reduces costs but also 
mitigates the adverse effects 
of groundwater depletion and 
water pollution. By optimizing 
water utilization, businesses 
can achieve cost savings while 
simultaneously minimizing their 
contribution to the depletion 
of groundwater sources and 
pollution of water bodies.
We understand the importance 
of water management and 
subsequently, 
the 
Company 
shall put in efforts for efficient 
water conservation techniques, 
monitor 
water 
consumption 
and 
to 
identify 
areas 
for

Quality of 
Products and

Opportunity
Quality serves as a crucial 
competitive 
advantage 
in 
the 
construction 
sector, 
which requires high levels 
of 
technical 
sophistication. 
Organizations must adhere to 
quality standards to effectively 
identify and fulfil customer 
needs and priorities. Failure to 
meet quality expectations or 
encountering issues related to 
customer health and safety can 
pose potential risks, including a 
decline in sales and damage to 
reputation.

Customer 
Experience &

Risk
Establishing collaborative and 
enduring 
relationships 
with 
customers is the cornerstone 
of achieving success. The 
presence of customers and 
their acceptance of a business 
proposition are vital for its 
survival and sustainability. Any 
decline or cessation in customer 
demand can negatively impact 
the Company's revenue and 
profitability. Aligning delivery 
objectives with those of the 
customer 
is 
essential 
in 
ensuring favourable outcomes 
and 
maintaining 
customer 
satisfaction.
We prioritize risk mitigation 
in customer experience and 
satisfaction by ensuring the 
quality of our services. We 
closely align our processes 
and deliverables with customer 
expectations, 
striving 
for 
excellence in every aspect. 
We take proactive measures 
to 
address 
any 
issues 
promptly, provide timely and 
transparent 
communication, 
and make efforts towards early 
project delivery, all with the 
aim of exceeding customer 
satisfaction and building long-

Environmental 
management

Risk
Companies share a reciprocal 
relationship with the natural 
environment, relying on its 
resources while also having 
an impact on it. Consequently, 
it is imperative for companies 
to prioritize the mitigation 
of biodiversity and natural 
resource impacts throughout 
their projects and operations. 
Assessing ecosystem services 
that directly affect the Company 
is essential. Protecting and 
conserving 
biodiversity 
has 
emerged 
as 
a 
significant 
environmental challenge for 
businesses
We shall adopt the following 
measures 
for 
environmental 
management and protection 
of 
biodiversity. 
Mitigation 
measures 
will 
encompass 
sustainable land use practices, 
conservation efforts, pollution 
reduction, and the adoption of

Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the processes for 
identifying key stakeholder 
groups of the entity.
PNC Infratech, a leading Indian infrastructure and construction company, categorizes 
stakeholders as groups capable of influencing the Company's objectives or those that could 
potentially be impacted by its operations. There are multiple stakeholders that can either 
influence or be influenced by PNC's strategic decisions and actions. The crucial task of identifying 
these stakeholders has been carried out meticulously by top management in collaboration with 
board members and various departments. Stakeholders are selected based on their potential 
to affect or be affected by the Company's operations. This selection encompasses both internal 
and external stakeholders pertinent to the organization. Interactions with some of these 
stakeholders occur on a daily basis. The organization's principal stakeholders encompass its 
employees and workers, investors and shareholders, regulatory bodies, suppliers/contractors 
and strategic partners, customers, and local communities.
