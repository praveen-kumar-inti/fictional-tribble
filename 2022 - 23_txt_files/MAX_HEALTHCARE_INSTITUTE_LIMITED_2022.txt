Implications
1
Energy and 
Emission
Risk
•	 The healthcare industry, 
operates in an electricity-
intensive environment, 
driven by our unwavering 
commitment to providing 
excellent patient care.
•	 To meet the primary needs 
of our patients, such 
as space conditioning, 
lighting, powering medical 
appliances, elevators, 
and other equipment, 
as well as water heating 
and refrigeration, we 
require a continuous and 
uninterrupted power supply 
24/7.
•	 However, our direct 
reliance on fossil fuels for 
heating systems in our 
hospitals raises concerns 
about our carbon footprints 
and its impact on the 
environment.
•	 We recognize the 
importance of energy 
efficiency and 
acknowledge our 
responsibility to address 
this risk proactively.
•	 By implementing 
measures to reduce 
energy consumption and 
transitioning to cleaner 
energy sources, we aim to 
mitigate our impact on the 
environment and promote 
sustainability.
•	 We have implemented 
a comprehensive action 
plan focused on energy 
conservation measures. 
Our primary objective 
is cleaner and reduced 
energy footprint for the 
organization.
•	 Additionally, we are 
committed in reducing 
Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions.
•	 We conduct initiatives 
aimed at raising 
awareness among our 
stakeholders about 
responsible energy 
usage.
•	 We also undertake 
tree-planting initiatives 
to enhance the 
microclimate in the 
areas surrounding our 
hospitals. These efforts 
contribute to offsetting 
carbon emissions.
•	 By combining energy 
conservation measures, 
GHG emission reduction, 
and community 
engagement, we are 
actively working towards 
a greener and more 
sustainable future.
Negative:
•	 High Operational Costs: 
Reliance on non-
renewable energy raises 
operational expenses.
•	 Environmental Impact: 
Carbon emissions can 
harm the environment 
and brand image.
•	 Reputational Risks: 
Environmental concerns 
may affect trust and 
credibility.
Positive:
•	 Cost Optimization: 
Energy-efficient 
practices reduce long-
term expenses.
•	 Environmental 
Stewardship: 
Renewables show 
commitment to the 
environment.
•	 Competitive Advantage: 
Sustainability attracts 
eco-conscious 
stakeholders.

2
Water 
Management
Risk
•	 Water management poses 
a significant risk for Max 
Healthcare, considering 
that hospitals are intensive 
water using establishments.
•	 Water plays a vital role 
in various aspects of our 
hospital’s daily operations, 
medical equipment 
cleaning, personal hygiene, 
sanitation, kitchen activities, 
landscaping, and more. 
•	 A potential risk in water 
management could be 
a disruption in the water 
supply, which could 
severely impact the smooth 
functioning of our hospital. 
In such a scenario, patient 
care, sanitation, and 
essential services could 
be compromised, leading 
to potential operational 
challenges and disruptions. 
•	 To mitigate this risk, it is 
imperative to implement 
robust water management 
strategies, including water 
conservation measures, 
efficient usage practices, 
and contingency plans for 
water supply disruptions. 
•	 We have taken several 
proactive water-
saving initiatives and 
implemented cutting-
edge technologies. 
These include the 
installation of sewage 
treatment plants and 
low-flow fixtures at 
toilets, aiming to 
optimize water usage 
and reduce wastage.
•	 We prioritize the 
implementation of 
reutilization measures 
and ensure that 
newly constructed 
infrastructure adheres to 
water-saving principles.
•	 We also aspire to 
achieve water neutrality 
and water positivity by 
efficiently managing 
water resources and 
offsetting usage through 
sustainable initiatives.
Negative:
•	 Water management risk 
could lead to financial 
risks arising from 
interrupted services 
due to operational 
disruptions caused by 
water scarcity. 
•	 A lack of sufficient water 
supply may hamper 
patient care, sanitation, 
and essential services, 
potentially resulting 
in financial losses and 
reputational damage.
Positive:
•	 By fostering a culture 
of responsible water 
usage, we contribute 
to water conservation 
efforts and reinforce 
our commitment 
to environmental 
sustainability. 
3
Waste 
Management
Risk
•	 Biomedical waste 
management is a significant 
concern to us. We prioritize 
effective mitigation strategies 
to address this risk.  
•	 Inadequate waste disposal 
poses a real threat to 
habitat degradation and 
can lead to pollution of 
air, water bodies, and soil, 
adversely impacting the 
environment. 
•	 We mitigate waste 
management risks 
through conscious and 
responsible efforts 
guided by the 3R model 
- Reduce, Reuse, and 
Recycle.
•	 We ensure proper 
separation of hazardous 
waste, biomedical waste, 
e-waste dry and wet 
waste. 
Negative 
•	 Mishandling of waste 
can have a negative 
impact on our 
sustainability efforts, 
tarnishing our reputation 
and credibility among 
key stakeholders.
•	 Improper waste disposal 
may degrade the 
aesthetic appeal of our 
surroundings, potentially 
leading to community 
dissatisfaction and 
strained relationships 
with stakeholders.

strategies. Our focus is 
on proper segregation,

reputation as a socially 
and environmentally 
responsible organization, 
garnering trust 
and support from 
stakeholders and the 
community.
4
Fire Risk
Risk
•	 Healthcare facilities 
are susceptible to fire 
incidents due to nature of 
our 24x7 operations, the 
utilization of highly complex 
medical equipment and 
presence of inflammable 
materials, including alcohol, 
sanitizers, various gases, 
fuel, and other chemicals 
required for medical 
procedures. 
•	 As a responsible healthcare 
provider, it is essential for 
us to implement robust fire 
safety measures and risk 
mitigation strategies
•	 We have implemented 
robust mitigation 
measures to ensure the 
safety and well-being of 
our patients, staff, and 
visitors.
•	 Standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) 
have been carefully 
formulated and are 
strictly enforced 
throughout the facility. 
These SOPs outline the 
appropriate response 
protocols for fire 
incidents, enhancing 
preparedness and 
minimizing potential 
damages.
Negative:
•	 Patient Safety Concerns: 
In the event of a fire 
incident, patients may 
require immediate 
evacuation and medical 
attention, potentially 
impacting their well-
being.
•	 Disruption of Services: 
Disruptions in hospital

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
We proud to be part of an organization that has consistently been at the forefront of innovation and excellence in the healthcare industry. 
We understand the critical role we play in protecting the environment and serving the communities we operate in. With this in mind, we 
have integrated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our core business framework, placing a strong emphasis on 
ESG considerations to reduce our ecological footprint and promote environmental well-being.
Our comprehensive sustainability roadmap focuses on energy management, GHG emissions, water management and waste management. 
We are actively working towards reducing energy consumption, transitioning to renewable energy and increasing green cover around 
our hospitals. Our commitment to patient safety is reflected in our stringent infection control practices and open communication channels 
for collaborative care.
In our dedication to combat climate change, we are focused on reducing our Energy Performance Index and per capita energy consumption 
through operational efficiencies and technology upgrades. We have also transitioned from diesel to gas-based equipment. Incorporating 
renewable energy is a key target for us, with rooftop solar installations like the 400 kWP capacity program at Max Vaishali, which will 
significantly reduce approximately 395 tCO2 in carbon emissions annually. Furthermore, we are actively enhancing green cover in and 
around our hospital sites, contributing to carbon sequestration and fostering a healthier environment.
At Max Healthcare, we value all our stakeholders, both internal and external. Our commitment to safety underscores our dedication to 
providing high-quality care and maintaining the trust of our patients and stakeholders. Improving communication channels and practices 
is vital for safe healthcare delivery, and we emphasize clear and accurate information exchange among healthcare providers, patients, 
and their families.
We are committed to reducing the risk of healthcare-associated infections within our facilities through strict infection control practices 
and ongoing surveillance. Our robust systems, policies, and standards ensure good corporate governance, prioritizing ethical business 
conduct and transparent disclosures.
Our governance efforts align with key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 
SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). We are committed to positively impacting these areas. 
We at Max Healthcare enforce a strong governance framework which is backed by several necessary policies for guiding stakeholders 
towards engaging operations with ethics and efficiency. Furthermore, we also comply with the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and the Companies Act, 2013, regarding board composition.
These initiatives reflect our commitment to sustainability, responsible management, and making a positive impact on society and the 
environment. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on innovation and excellence in healthcare while keeping sustainability at 
the heart of our operations.
