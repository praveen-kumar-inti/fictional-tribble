Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
The Company recognize the vital role that ESG considerations play in ensuring the sustainability and long-term success of business of the 
Company. We understand that operating responsibly is not only the right thing to do but also crucial for maintaining trust among our 
stakeholders and contributing to a more sustainable future.
We acknowledge that there are several significant challenges when it comes to ESG matters. One of our key challenges is reducing 
our carbon footprint and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We are actively working on implementing energy-efficient practices 
and renewable energy sources, to minimize emissions. Additionally, we are committed to reducing waste generation, managing water 
resources responsibly, and addressing any potential environmental risks associated with our operations.
To address these challenges, we have set ambitious targets aligned with international best practices and frameworks. Our primary goal is 
to reduce our carbon footprints. This includes reducing our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy 
projects, and adopting sustainable value chain. We are also committed to lead best in class standards of safety, health and hygiene and 
foster a culture of continuous benchmarking to world class standards. Our customers are our key stakeholders, and their wellbeing is at core 
of the organization. We are committed to provide best-in-class products and services to our customers in a sustainable and responsible 
manner. Furthermore, we have established targets to enhance our corporate governance practices, ensuring transparency, accountability, 
and ethical conduct at all levels of our organization.
We are pleased to report that we have made significant progress in our ESG initiatives. Over the past year, we have reduced our carbon 
emissions through the implementation of energy-saving measures and the adoption of renewable energy sources. We have also 
implemented comprehensive waste management programs, resulting in a reduction in waste generation. We have also been able to 
reduce water consumption as compared to the previous year. In terms of social impact, we continue to make significant contributions in 
the areas of Education including Technical and Vocational Education, Rural Development, Healthcare and Sanitation, Employability and 
Empowerment, Environment Sustainability, Animal Welfare and Soil Health, Disaster Management, etc. for the underprivileged community 
living in the villages located near our plant in Gadepan. The Company has also made a significant investment to provide awareness and 
resources for crop residue management in selected villages of Punjab and Haryana. This will considerably contribute in addressing the 
problem of pollution arising due to crop residue in the northern part of India. Moreover, we have strengthened our governance practices 
by enhancing our risk management and ESG framework.
Our detailed ESG goals and other achievements are mentioned in the relevant sections of this report. While we celebrate these achievements, 
we recognize that our journey towards sustainable development is an ongoing process. We remain committed to continuous improvement 
and innovation, aiming to surpass our targets and exceed expectations. Our focus on ESG factors will remain at the core of our business 
strategy, ensuring that we create long-term value for our stakeholders and contribute positively to the communities and environments in 
which we operate.
Thanks to all stakeholders for their continued support as we navigate these ESG challenges together.

Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format:
The Company is committed to reduce energy consumption. In line with the same, the Company has adopted following strategies:
 	
Various initiatives being implemented to reduce consumption of energy including future use of Synthesis Gas Turbine
	
Processed licensers hired to develop energy efficiency measures
	
Increase in solar power capacity and consideration towards Green Ammonia
The Company’s commitment to sustainable development helps to carry technological and operational advancements in its operations 
to reduce energy consumption, utilize waste heat, strive for renewable energy options and use energy efficient products, wherever 
possible.
The three hi-tech Urea plants of the Company are highly energy efficient Out of 200 MW of power consumed by the Company at the 
Gadepan plant, only 18 MW is electric power. The rest is steam which is generated within the manufacturing process itself by recycling 
waste heat.

Provide details of the following disclosures related to water, in the following format:
Since the Urea plants of the Company are located in a water stressed state, the Company has , from the beginning, been mindful of the 
need to conserve water, explore ways to recharge natural aquifers in the region, harvest rainwater and treat and recycle wastewater. 
Consequently, water conservation is a key adjunct of our plant operations, business strategies and community outreach programmes. 
In particular, the Company is paying special attention to improve water efficiency in our manufacturing operations. The Company has 
constructed two check-dams (Anicuts) on nearby Kalisindh and Parwan river for rainwater harvesting and process water consumption.
The Company is also committed to not extracting and utilizing ground water for operations. Treated wastewater is being used in 
maintaining the green belt through 65-kilometer-long irrigation network spread all over the Gadepan complex, which, in turn, helps in 
saving fresh water.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company is managing and operating well-designed programmes/ treatment facilities to control pollution. The Company continues 
to follow the 3R concept – Reduce, Re-use and Recycle the effluents being generated. An overwhelming percentage of water used in the 
process is recycled water. Treated wastewater is used in maintaining green belt.
The Company has adopted best methods to manage solid/ hazardous waste disposal after proper categorization. Separate bins are 
provided for collection of various categories of waste. Horticulture waste is converted into manure. Use of polythene bags is banned at 
the plant site. The Company also ensures following:
	
 Sending the waste generated by the Company to cement industry for co-processing instead of sending it to approve landfill site.
	
 Audit through an external consultant and implementation of corrective actions pertaining to our waste management practices.
	
 Awareness amongst contract workers and workers carrying out non-critical activities regarding waste management practices.
77
As best practices in industries, all hazardous waste is recycled through approved vendor and chemical sludge of wastewater treatment 
is used in co-processing in cement plant. Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) salt is sent to approved land fill site . Furthermore, spent catalyst 
are being stored in Metal Sheet drums with sealed lid and same is being sold to authorized parties for recycling. Biodegradable waste 
is being feed to Bio-gas plant available in township premises. The biogas is used for cooking in the Company’s’ Guest House and the 
liquid manure is used for horticulture operations. The filtered liquid is recycled back into the digester. Minor E-waste and Battery waste 
generated from the Plant are being disposed as per E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 and Battery Waste Management Rules, 2020, 
respectively. Waste from Dispensary are disposed as per Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016.

Gadepan II plants. Also, this discharge is made when there is sufficient volume of water flow in the river for dilution and there is necessity 
to discharge. Written information regarding effluent discharge is submitted to relevant regulatory authorities.
Total effluent generated in Gadepan-III plant along with part of Gadepan I & Gadepan II plants effluent is treated in Reverse Osmosis Plant
