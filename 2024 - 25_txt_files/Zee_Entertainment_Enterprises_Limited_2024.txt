non-compliance to existing 
and new regional privacy 
regulations such as Digital 
Personal Data Protection Act 
(DPDPA) and laws may attract 
fines and pose reputational risk.
2. 	 The use of Generative-AI 
tools in corporate operations 
carries risks like biases, data 
misinterpretations, intentional 
misuse and legal/ethical issues, 
potentially causing reputational 
harm, penalties, and financial 
losses.
3.	 Increasing spectrum of 
cybersecurity threats, ranging 
from conventional hacking 
techniques, sophisticated 
phishing & more advanced 
and emerging threats such as 
ransomware attacks may result

bring significant consequences, 
including operational 
disruptions, data exposure, 
legal liabilities, and reputation 
damage.
4.	 Increased Content Piracy 
hinders revenue generation 
through legitimate channels 
such as subscriptions, pay-
per-view, and advertising,

Intellectual 
Property 
Protection & 
Anti-Piracy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
1. 	 ‘Z’ being in the Media & 
Entertainment industry, the 
business model relies heavily 
on the monetization of 
intellectual property—films, 
TV shows, music, scripts, and 
distribution rights.
2. 	 These high-value assets 
are frequently targeted for 
piracy and unauthorized 
distribution via torrent sites, 
illegal streaming platforms, and 
unauthorized duplication. This 
can result in: Revenue loss in 
theatrical releases, streaming, 
and content syndication.
Opportunity:
1. 	 Proactive IP protection 
strengthens our market 
position and supports global 
distribution partnerships.
2. 	 Enables monetization through 
licensing and content 
syndication.
3. 	 Enhances brand trust with 
stakeholders (content creators, 
partners, investors).
Content/IP Protection:
1. 	 The Content Security & 
Anti-Piracy SOP has been 
enhanced to cover ZEE5, Linear, 
Zee Music, and Zee Studios, 
with oversight by a high-level 
governing body and support 
from a cross-functional team 
working collaboratively to drive 
initiatives.
2. 	 Use of industry-leading Digital 
Rights Management (DRM) 
systems and Watermarking 
technology to track and trace 
leaks and illegal distribution of 
Z’s Content IP.
3. 	 Partnership with industry-
leading Cyber Threat 
Intelligence services to monitor 
dark web marketplaces and 
piracy networks.
4. 	 Geo-blocking and region-
specific access control to limit 
illegal streaming of Z’s Content 
outside licensed territories.
5. 	 Rapid legal takedowns using 
DMCA provisions with strategic 
litigation and partnership with 
law enforcement and anti-
piracy coalitions e.g., Dynamic 
John Doe Order - allowing ‘Z’ to 
block content piracy websites 
at the ISP level.
6. 	 Ongoing IP monitoring and 
rights assessment, with 
automated tools to block 
piracy via behavior analysis and 
security measures like strong 
authentication and enhanced 
proxy detection on ZEE5 OTT.
Positive implications:
Nil
Negative Implications:
1. 	
Potential annual revenue 
loss due to piracy or 
unauthorized use of Z's IP 
(e.g., theatrical, web series 
and originals).
2. 	 High upfront and 
recurring costs for DRM 
and Watermarking tools, 
legal enforcement, and IP 
disputes.
3.	
Despite the cost of 
mitigation, these 
investments are necessary 
for long-term protection 
of Z's creative assets and 
sustainable monetization.
4.
Customer 
Experience 
& Content 
Responsibility
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Poor customer experience 
constitutes a critical operational 
and strategic risk, rather than 
merely a design deficiency. Its 
impact is far-reaching, directly 
influencing key business metrics 
such as growth trajectory, 
profitability, and long-term brand 
equity.
1.	 Leveraging in-house 
consumer-centric content 
design expertise by drawing 
on proprietary frameworks like 
Project Kahani, Ikigai and Bharat 
Yatra, we craft culturally rooted, 
insight-driven narratives 
that resonate deeply with 
audiences creating content 
that is authentic, emotionally 
compelling and relevant.
Positive implications
1. 	
Market share growth
2. 	 Better monetization
3. 	 Higher Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) and brand power
4. 	 Positive consumer 
sentiment

Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1. 	 Customer Attrition: Inadequate 
user experience can 
significantly diminish user 
engagement and session 
duration, resulting in increased 
app uninstalls (e.g., ZEE5) and 
elevated customer churn rates, 
thereby adversely affecting 
customer retention.
2. 	 Reputational Risk: Suboptimal 
customer interactions often 
manifest as negative reviews 
and low app store ratings, 
which can erode brand 
reputation and credibility, 
while impeding organic growth 
through reduced positive 
word-of-mouth.
3. 	 Competitive Positioning: 
Poor customer experience 
weakens the brand’s value 
proposition, creating a strategic 
disadvantage relative to 
competitors offering superior 
user engagement, ultimately 
leading to loss of market share.
Responsible content stewardship 
is not only a legal and ethical 
obligation but a strategic 
imperative as well.
1. 	 Dissemination of inappropriate, 
misleading, or insensitive 
content can result in public 
backlash, media scrutiny 
and loss of audience trust. 
Viewers increasingly demand 
accountability and ethical 
storytelling. Irresponsible 
content may alienate core 
demographic segments.
2. 	 Regulatory breaches in 
content compliance such as 
violations of broadcasting 
codes, defamation laws, hate 
speech regulations or children’s 
content guidelines.
3. 	 Advertisers may disassociate 
from content deemed 
controversial or misaligned with 
brand values.
2.	 Brand health monitoring as a 
strategic early indicator system 
by utilizing third-party brand 
health tracking across key 
channels and ZEE5 to measure 
core KPIs such as NPS, brand 
equity and brand power; 
serving as leading indicators 
for market share trends and 
enabling timely strategic 
interventions.
3.	 Integrated consumer 
experience ecosystem across 
platforms with a dedicated 
customer experience practice 
for ZEE5 and response team 
for Linear TV to maintain an 
ongoing feedback loop with 
viewers. This includes active 
social listening to capture 
sentiment trends for our 
launches and shows and 
Focused Group Discussions 
(FGDs) to explore consumer 
aspirations, conflicts, and 
cultural nuances fueling more 
resonant and authentic content 
development.
4.	 An omni-content strategy 
adopted across linear &

Opportunity:
1.	 Seamless, engaging 
experiences encourage 
longer viewing sessions, 
repeated visits and sustained 
subscriptions. Higher consumer 
Life Time Value, reduced churn 
and lower Customer Acquisition 
Cost (CAC) pressure over time.
2.	 Organic growth through 
advocacy where in satisfied 
users become brand 
advocates-sharing content, 
recommending platforms and 
boosting app ratings. This can 
result in enhanced word-of-
mouth marketing, virality, and 
organic user acquisition at low 
cost.
3.	 Monetization Upside - A 
positive customer experience 
drives higher engagement 
allowing for smarter ad 
targeting, personalized 
upselling and bundling 
opportunities resulting in higher 
ad CPMs, increased conversion 
to premium plans and more 
attractive partnership

Talent 
attraction and 
retention
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Our voluntary attrition rate for FY 
2024-25 stands at 17.7%, slightly 
higher than the market average 
of 17.2%. Despite the marginal 
difference, this remains a concern 
for us considering:
1.	 Core Dependency on Talent 
to drive content quality, brand 
differentiation, and audience 
engagement.
2.	 Aggressive competition for 
the same talent pool from 
competitors.
3.	 Turnover-related disruptions, 
which impact project timelines, 
increase risk, and lead to loss of 
institutional knowledge.
1.	 Promote Internal Job Postings 
(IJPs): Encourage transparent 
internal career opportunities 
to reduce retention and 
succession risks by enabling 
employees to apply for new 
roles within the organization.
2.	 Structured Career Paths & 
Development: Implement 
clear career paths, upskilling 
programs, and mentorship to 
support employee growth and 
skill development.
3.	 Strengthen Employer Branding 
& Employee value proposition 
(EVP): Use storytelling and 
employee testimonials to 
showcase our culture and 
values, attracting and retaining 
talent.
4.	 Expand Wellness Programs: 
Offer wellness initiatives 
beyond insurance, including 
mental health support, fitness 
activities, and women-centric 
policies to promote overall 
wellbeing and inclusion.
Negative Implications:
High attrition rates pose 
a financial and strategic 
risk. Beyond recruitment 
and onboarding costs, the 
departure of key talent 
leads to lost productivity, 
delayed projects, and 
erosion of institutional 
knowledge. Critically, it also 
results in missed business 
opportunities—slowing 
innovation, impacting revenue 
pipelines, and increasing the 
risk of market share loss.

Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
1. 	 Potential interruptions in 
operational continuity due to

exclusive reliance on non-
renewable energy sources.
2.	 Impact reputation and financial 
performance.
Opportunity: 
1. 	 Implement energy and cost 
saving initiatives.
2. 	 Develop renewable sources 
of energy consumption 
alternatives for long term 
consumption.
3. 	 Achieve reduction in Green 
House Gas (GHG) emissions 
through energy management 
initiatives.
1. 	 Develop robust GHG inventory 
for Z’s global operations, 
identify sources of energy 
consumption and carbon 
emissions.
2. 	 Identify areas of deployment 
of energy conservation and 
carbon emissions reduction 
strategies.
3. 	 Replace outdated equipment 
and systems with energy 
efficient technology.
4. 	 Develop climate change 
strategy for carbon emissions 
reduction.
5. 	 Conduct Climate risk mapping 
and energy audits.
Positive implications: 
1. 	
Cost saving due to energy 
efficient equipment and 
systems.
2. 	 Strengthen investor’s and 
shareholder’s confidence 
due to sustainable 
business practices.
Negative Implications: 
1. 	
Investments for 
upgrading existing energy 
management system.

Our observations 
The sustainability disclosures of the Company, as defined under the scope and boundary of assurance, are reliable, valid and the Company has appropriately 
consolidated data from different sources at the central level.  
The Company has made considerable efforts to ensure consistency of data for this Report; however, the Company may continue to improve robustness of 
its data collection and collation process. 
Our above observations, however, do not affect our conclusion regarding the Report. 
Conclusion 
Based on the scope of our review, we conclude the following: 
 
Reasonable Assurance of BRSR selected Core indicators: The sustainability disclosures of the BRSR selected Core indicators as mentioned in 
‘Scope and boundary of assurance’ reasonably fulfil the criteria of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability as per 
‘reasonable’ assurance criteria. We found that the information and data provided in all the sections and principles are consistent and adequate 
with regards to the reporting criteria of the BRSR. 
Our conclusions are outlined below: 
Governance, leadership and supervision: The top management’s commitment, business model promoting inclusive growth, action and strategies, focus 
on services, risk management, protection and restoration of environment, and priorities are represented adequately. 
Stakeholder Inclusiveness: We have not identified any discrepancies in this aspect. Internal and external Stakeholder identification and engagement is 
carried out by the Company on a periodic basis to bring out key stakeholder concerns as material aspects of significant stakeholders.  
Materiality: The materiality assessment process has been carried out, based on the requirements of the Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), 
Guidance Note on BRSR and as per GRI 2021 considering aspects that are internal and external to the company’s context of the organization. The Reports 
fairly bring out the aspects and topics and their respective boundaries of the diverse operations of the Company in our view, the Reports meet the 
requirements. 
Responsiveness: We believe that the responses to the material aspects are defined and captured in the Reports, in our view, the Reports meet the 
requirements. 
Completeness: The Reports have fairly disclosed the general and specific standard disclosures including the Disclosure on Management Approach, 
monitoring systems and sustainability performance indicators as prescribed in the standards in accordance with the Core requirement. In our view the 
Reports meet the requirements. 
Reliability: Most of the data and information was verified by the assurance team and found appropriate. Minor inaccuracies in the data identified during the 
verification process were found to be attributable to transcription and interpretation errors and these errors were corrected immediately. Therefore, in 
accordance with the ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance engagement, TÜV SÜD concludes that the sustainability data, parameters, information, and indicators 
presented in the Reports are reliable and acceptable.  
Impact: We observed and assessed that the Company has well-defined procedures to routinely monitor and measure their sustainability impact, and they 
have skilled subject matter experts who are driving sustainability effectively and efficiently.  
Consistency and comparability: The information in the Report is presented in a consistent and comprehensive method. Thus, the principle of consistency 
and comparability is satisfactory. 
During verification we did not come across any such instances or issues where we found anything which has an impact on the ecosystem and well as the 
neighboring infrastructure. In our view, the Reports meet the requirements. 
Our statements do not extend to any disclosures or assertions relating to future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in the reports 
Our Independence, Ethical Requirements and Quality Control 
Our team comprises subject matter experts of multidisciplinary professionals, have complied with independence policies of TÜV SÜD, which address the 
requirements of the ISAE 3000 (Revised) in the role as independent Verifier. TÜV SÜD states its independence and impartiality and confirms that there is
