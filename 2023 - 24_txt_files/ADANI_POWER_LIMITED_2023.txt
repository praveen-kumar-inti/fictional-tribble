1
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Employee and worker 
well-being and safety 
is integral to APL. 
Jeopardizing the health 
and safety can not only 
impact the productivity, 
as well as profitability, but 
also affect the employee 
and worker morale. 
Foster a safe working 
environment and ensure 
zero harm. Hazards and 
risks are identified on 
a periodic basis, and 
mitigation as well as 
prevention plans are 
implemented. Further, 
for employee and worker 
well-being, regular 
trainings on health and 
safety are provided.
Negative 
implications
2
Biodiversity 
Risk 
Reducing the impact of 
business operation on 
biodiversity and focus on 
optimization of natural 
resources to avoid 
negatively impacting the 
environment and the 
biodiversity. 
The biodiversity policy 
drives the Company to 
do business with no net 
loss to biodiversity by 
2025. The approach in 
managing biodiversity 
impacts at the operation 
and construction sites 
is built upon three major 
principles outlined in 
the Biodiversity Policy 
and embedded in the 
Biodiversity Assessment 
process
Negative 
implications
3
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with 
regulatory requirements 
can result in financial 
and reputational 
consequences and erode 
stakeholder trust.
Legal and functional 
teams monitor the 
regulatory compliances 
applicable for respective 
business functions at 
defined frequencies. 
Disciplinary measures 
and reinforcement 
mechanisms are also 
defined.
Negative 
implications

Anti-Bribery 
& Anti-
Corruption
Risk
Failing to uphold ethical 
practices and behaviour 
can lead to severe 
financial and reputations 
damages. It also puts 
stakeholder trust and the 
Company’s leadership 
position at risk
Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption Policy, 
Code of Conduct, 
Whistleblower Policy, 
and other ESG policies 
provide detailed 
guidance on ethical 
conduct and mitigate the 
risk of non-compliance.

Human Rights
Risk
Upholding human rights 
in accordance with all 
applicable national and 
international regulations 
is essential to protect 
employees, communities, 
and other stakeholders.
The Human Rights Policy 
provides guidance on 
adherence to national 
and international 
Human Rights standards 
and principles. From 
a management 
perspective, a body 
has been instituted to 
support in adoption of 
human rights. There 
is mechanism within 
each entity to address 
an issue raised or 
reported pertaining to 
human rights, as well 
as a stipulated timeline 
within which it should be 
resolved.
Negative 
implications
6
Water 
Management
Risk
Water is a shared 
resource, and hence 
ensuring responsible 
consumption is key to the 
business’ social license to 
operate
The Company has 
instituted a Resource 
Conservation Policy, 
which serves as a guiding 
principle to reduce 
consumption of water 
and other resources. 
Negative 
implications
7
Waste 
Management
Risk
Noncompliance with 
regulation and inefficient 
modus operandi can firstly 
have direct financial and 
reputational implications, 
and secondly impact the 
environment. Hence, 
effectively managing 
and reducing the waste 
generated and complying 
with environmental 
rules and regulations 
ensure environmental 
sustainability.
The resource 
conservation policy 
provides guidance 
to incorporate the 
principles of circularity 
in processes and 
production. Complies 
with all applicable 
environmental laws and 
regulations and takes 
initiatives to manage 
and reduce quantities of 
waste generated.

prepare for a future, 
which could bring more 
stringent legislation and

Policy provides guidance 
to reduce energy

interventions to bring 
significant benefits to 
large sections of the 
society.
The Adani Foundation 
has been striving to 
create sustainable 
opportunities for 
the marginalized 
communities by 
facilitating quality 
education, sustainable 
livelihood development, 
promoting a healthy 
society and supporting 
rural infrastructure 
development.
Positive 
implications
11
Climate 
Change 
Adaption and 
Mitigation
Risk
The severe implications 
of climate change make 
it pertinent to control

defines the process for 
measuring, monitoring 
and reducing the 
Company’s environmental 
impact.

Efficiency is an 
important attribute as 
all inputs are scarce. It 
is important to conserve 
them while maintaining 
an acceptable level of

We have a strategic risk 
management process 
in place that supports 
to identify the short, 
medium and long-term 
risks. Within these 
processes, we have 
incorporated systems 
that help our operations 
to become durable to

15
Cultural 
Heritage
Opportunity
The influence of cultural 
factors on business 
is extensive. Culture 
impacts how employees 
are best managed based 
on their values and 
priorities.
Understanding the 
importance that cultural 
heritage holds for current 
and future generations, 
we have identified 
unique cultural heritage 
sites at our locations and 
worked towards restoring 
the local art and culture 
in these locations. One 
such example is the 
Namda craft at Kutch, 
Gujarat. Lastly, through 
the Adani Foundation, we 
have ensured that this 
art survives.

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
At Adani Power Limited, the company is committed to provide 
sustainable, affordable and reliable  power to all. As a thermal 
power producing company, we are driven with the aim of fulfilling 
the country’s energy needs, but we strive to do so sustainably and 
optimally. In the long run we aspire to maintain the trust we share 
with our customers, and other stakeholders, by adhering to high 
business standards, and adopting innovative business ideas.
 In the short- to medium- term, we aim to continually make process 
related changes, such that our operational efficiency improves, and 
we have lesser impact on the total amount of energy consumed and 
GHG emissions generated. We are gradually also looking at newer 
technologies in the power generation industry, to enable flexible 
operations and support more green and intermittent power in grid 
which will form of our long-term business strategy. In the reporting 
period we spent slightly over a crore in technology focused on 
improving our environmental footprint. 
We have a keen sense of responsibility to all our stakeholders. We 
consistently engage with our employees and have successfully 
provided trainings them on a variety of topics such as sustainability 
and inclusivity, mental health and well-being, ethics, etc. In 
furtherance to this, we have a renewed focus on the health and 
safety of our employees and workers and strive to improve our 
LTIFR. We have introduced several development programs and 
projects for the upliftment of community member situated near our 
operational facilities. In FY 2023-24 we have positively impacted 
2,333,855 people.
The power industry is plagued with a myriad of challenges because of 
extreme weather conditions, cybersecurity threats, and the growth 
of variable renewables and distributed energy resources. Hence, we 
believe in undertaking necessary measures from a business viability 
standpoint in terms of resource allocation, strengthening internal 
capacities, and exploring new avenues while exhibiting a strong 
focus on our people and the planet.

Yes.
Yes, 100% percentage of inputs were sourced as per our supply chain management policy, which effectively 
governs our sustainable supply chain management practices. We ensure that our supplier selection process 
integrates the prerequisites of sustainability.
Our supplier Code of Conduct acts as a framework for assessing and disseminating the company’s requirements, 
values, and culture to suppliers. We also encourage our suppliers to adhere to social and environmental standards 
such as SA 8000, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018. Moreover, we have also devised a supplier screening and 
risk assessment programme which serves as an initiatory requirement in our vendor onboarding process.
In addition to the regulatory and qualitative aspects, our supplier assessment scorecard also incorporates ESG 
aspects for screening and prequalification of our suppliers. We have classified our suppliers and identified 
them as critical based on value of business and nature of supply. Further, our supplier screening framework is 
used to assess the identified critical suppliers on predefined ESG parameter which act as a key enabler on our 
Responsible Supply Chain journey.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end 
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
Owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service offerings [Generation of Electricity], the scope for safely 
reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, and disposal at the end of life is not applicable.
In alignment with the UN SDG 12- Responsible Consumption and Production, the company have defined processes 
for managing waste at all our operational sites.
Effective waste management begins with meticulous planning, ensuring that our waste management plan 
prioritizes efficient and cost effective techniques. This plan encompasses a range of activities, including 
waste collection, segregation, transportation, reprocessing, recycling, and disposal of different types of waste. 
Our thermal power plants generate various forms of waste, with fly ash (a by-product of coal combustion) being 
the largest solid waste component. Additionally, we handle other types of waste such as municipal or domestic 
waste, hazardous waste, biomedical waste, and e-waste. The disposal methods depend on the type and quality 
of waste generated.
Fly ash, being a significant solid waste produced from coal-based power generation, poses a landfilling challenge. 
To address this, our Tiroda plant has implemented a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system, which 
solidifies the ash for disposal. Furthermore, we have established infrastructure at other plants to transform fly 
ash into a valuable material in demand by industries such as cement and ready-mix concrete. This approach 
has substantially increased fly ash utilization and supply, benefiting specialised agencies. We are dedicated to 
reducing single-use plastic usage, and 9 out of 7 of our power-generating units have received certification for 
being single-use plastic-free from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). At our Tiroda, Kawai, Udupi, we have 
installed a waste-paper recycling unit.
Regarding hazardous waste, we generate a comparatively smaller quantity, which is stored in designated locations. 
As per regulations, non-recyclable hazardous waste is sent to a State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)- approved 
common treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) for proper management. We recognise the importance 
of waste segregation from the initial stages, and our control measures ensure that relevant information is tracked 
until the final disposal stage.
Additionally, the non-hazardous waste generated at our premises comprises of scrap metal, wood, glass, tires, 
e-waste, cardboard, and paper are sold via auctioned.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to 
Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service offerings, EPR is not applicable to the Company.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
Health and Safety of our people is of utmost importance to us. To achieve this, we have adopted a shared 
responsibility approach, with increased engagements at all levels of workforce and strengthening the safety 
culture across all Company’s site/locations. We are taking steps to reduce reportable incidents, minimize injuries 
and regularly monitor the safety performance of our sites.
Our occupational health and safety management system is also well aligned with Group’s Safety framework and 
covers all employees, contractors, business associates, visitors and the community as well. In addition to that, a 
number of our sites across all Company’s businesses are ISO 45001 (2018) certified.
As a part of our strategy to prevent health and safety related incidents, we have identified two focus areas 
which are contractor safety management (CSM) and operational discipline. CSM procedure provides support in 
manpower deployment whereas the operational discipline ensures that proper measures to eliminate hazards are 
taken at all our sites. Contractor Safety Management is well defined six step processes viz Pre-qualification - To 
Identify contractors compatible with owner operating safety principles, Contract Preparation - Develop contract 
package with specific language in the generic documents to clarify safety expectations for contracting needs, 
Contract Award - for effective review of contract safety specifications at bid meetings & pre-award meetings, 
Orientation & Training - 3 different level Safety Orientation (Generic, Area specific & Job Specific) Training with 
assessment, Managing the work (Safety Risk Field Audit (SRFA) with KPIs, Periodic / Contract closure evaluation. 
We have sets out requirement for evaluating and rewarding Contractors to ensure safety at the workplace. 
It will further result in development of an incident free work environment, by creating a systematic approach to 
manage contractors and making them aware of the risks associated with working on site.
All our employees and contractors are provided with appropriate PPEs and it is ensured that they are not negligent 
in using them. We are providing job related training to our employees to perform given task safely along with 
display of do’s and don’ts at prominent locations of the sites. Beside this, we have stringent work permit system 
in place. Toolbox talks, task briefing, job specific training, job hazard analysis and mock drill help us in building 
safety culture within our sites/locations.
Mental and emotional health is a core part of our work culture. In view of this, an emotional wellness program 
was launched as part of Adani Care- Our integrated suite of health and well-being services and support platform. 
As an inclusive health service, the program offers professional and confidential counselling for our employees. 
Family member of our employee can also avail these services at any time of the day and in any location.
We also have various rewards and recognition programs in place to appraise the champions of safety working at 
Company’s sites/locations.

APL aims to lead India’s initiatives in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets by evaluating the possibility of 
potential implementation of ammonia as a fuel in thermal power generation that will utilize Green Hydrogen-derived 
ammonia in the existing thermal power plant. Kowa supported APL by conducting a global survey of hydrogen 
and ammonia-related technologies being utilised for power generation. IHI Corporation has already successfully 
demonstrated its ammonia co-firing technology at a large-scale commercial coal-fired power plant in Japan and 
responded to many inquiries related to ammonia co-firing globally.
	
To achieve de-carbonization of APL’s coal-fired assets, the parties, by considering the possibility of ammonia 
co-firing through the studies, aim to de-carbonize APL’s coal fired assets with the objective to potentially 
implement the technology in other coal-fired units within India.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. We follow the basic 
principle of segregation of the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept of “reduce, reuse & recycle”.
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation.
Apart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include scrap metal, 
wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the 
generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All our site/
locations are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible.

location (high/low/medium) and reporting system within the 
organization. Sites selected for audits are listed in Annex-II.

Conclusion  
 
Reasonable level of Assurance- BRSR 9 Core Indicators 
Based on our review and procedures followed for reasonable level of assurance, DNV is of the opinion that, in all material 
aspects, the BRSR Core indicators (as listed in Annex I of this statement) for FY 2023-24 are reported in accordance with 
reporting requirements outlined in BRSR Core (Annexure I of SEBI Circular dated 12 July 2023).  
 
Limited Level of Assurance- BRSR Reporting Format  
On the basis of the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the disclosures do not 
properly adhere to the reporting requirements as per BRSR reporting guidelines (Annexure II of SEBI Circular). 
 
Statement of Competence and Independence 
 
DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, which are based on the principles 
enclosed within ISO IEC 17029:2019 – Conformity assessment – General principles are requirements for validation and 
verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.   
 
We have complied with the DNV Code of Conduct1 during the assurance engagement and maintain independence 
wherever required by relevant ethical requirements. This engagement work was carried out by an independent team of 
sustainability assurance professionals. During the reporting period i.e FY 2023-24, DNV, to the best of its knowledge, was 
not involved in any non-audit/non-assurance work with the Company and its Group entities which could lead to any Conflict 
of Interest. DNV was not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the Report except for this 
Assurance Statement for internal use of APL. DNV maintains complete impartiality toward stakeholders interviewed during 
the assurance process. We did not provide any services to APL in the scope of assurance for the reporting period that could 
compromise the independence or impartiality of our work.
