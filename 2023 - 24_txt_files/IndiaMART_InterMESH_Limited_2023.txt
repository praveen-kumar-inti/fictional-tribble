Inadequate corporate 
governance can lead to a series 
of detrimental outcomes for 
an organisation. These may 
include unethical behaviour, 
the mismanagement of 
resources, legal complications 
and damage to both reputation 
and financial stability.
The Company has created a policy 
framework to encourage ethical conduct 
among all employees throughout the

all regulations.
To promote transparency and accountability,

Privacy and 
Data Security
Risk
Failure to prevent, detect 
and mitigate data security 
threats encompassing data 
prevention, storage and 
leakage can significantly 
impact reputation and trust of 
the stakeholders, which could 
lead to adverse consequences 
on customer acquisition and 
retention.
IndiaMART has established an information 
security framework to safeguard its data 
against unauthorized access and external 
threats. Furthermore, the Company’s 
security compliance with global best 
practices for data protection is evident 
through its attainment of ISO 27001 
certification for effective information 
security management and ISO 27701: 
2019 certificate on Privacy Information 
Management Standard apart from other 
ISO’s such as: 
•

System Engineering
•	
ISO 31000:2018 Enterprise Risk 
Management
•	
ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Risk
Discrimination, lack of diversity, 
and a non-inclusive culture 
can lead to legal issues, talent 
retention challenges, and a 
negative public perception 
apart from restricted view 
or perspective. Also, hinders 
innovation, employee morale, 
and organizational adaptability.
The Company is committed to 
implementing policies and procedures 
that promote equal opportunity, 
prevent discrimination, and ensure fair 
treatment for all employees, regardless 
of their background, identity, or personal 
characteristics. These policies are 
regularly reviewed and updated to align 
with best practices and applicable laws 
and regulations in multiple languages.
Positive
Opportunity

distinct yet interconnected. 
The Company firmly believes 
in diversity and inclusion 
as it supports or ensures 
different perspectives 
on different issues. The 
different perspective results 
into the best possible and 
evaluated decision benefiting 
the organization. Diversity

encouraging contributions 
from diverse groups. The

Talent 
Management 
Risk
Ineffective talent management 
may also result in a lack of 
diversity, hindering innovation 
and exposing the organization 
to reputational risks. Failing 
to effectively manage talent 
could result in a lack of a high-
performance culture and a 
loss of competitive advantage. 
Additionally, overlooking the 
significance of our employees 
in our cost structure could lead 
to financial inefficiencies and 
hinder long-term success.
The Company adopts a well-organized 
approach to identify skilled talent, 
employing strategies such as campus 
hiring, participation in job fairs, internal 
employee referrals, periodic hiring 
drives, and collaborations with external 
organizations. Additionally, the Company 
prioritizes career growth retention 
initiatives like grant of ESOP/SAR apart 
from upgrading their skills in consonance 
with the technological advancement 
and evolvement on regular basis. This 
commitment is evidenced by over 950+ 
employees who have been associated with 
IndiaMART for over 5 years.
Negative
Opportunity 
In today’s dynamic 
environment, recognizing the 
invaluable contributions of 
our employees, we prioritize 
both retaining our existing 
talent and attracting new 
professionals to scale up our 
operations effectively. This 
approach not only boosts 
productivity and cultivates 
a high-performance culture 
but also plays a pivotal role in 
ensuring long-term success 
and sustaining a competitive 
advantage as we scale up 
our operations. It’s crucial to 
recognize that employees are 
a significant part of our cost 
structure.
5
Community 
Development
Risk
Failing to address community 
needs, causing environmental 
or social harm, and neglecting 
stakeholder engagement pose 
significant risks. These actions 
can lead to reputational loss 
and connect with community 
at large.
The Company’s focuses on creating 
value through initiatives that support 
economic development, education, and 
environmental conservation. 
Supporting small suppliers with 
free listing, affordable technology 
solutions, and platform training, while 
empowering small city buyers through 
price transparency, fosters fairer market 
practices and enhances value for their 
investments.
Positive
Opportunity
Community development 
creates a positive social 
impact while also benefiting 
the bottom line. By engaging 
in community development 
initiatives, such as sponsoring 
local events, supporting 
education programs, and 
participating in charitable 
endeavors, strengthens 
relationships with key 
stakeholders. It also enhances 
brand reputation., attracts top 
talent, and differentiate the 
Company from competitors.

The Company has a Grievance Redressal Policy, featuring a structured system that relies on employee-generated tickets for issue resolution. 
This system articulates transparent processes and assigns accountable teams to promptly address concerns. It includes mechanisms for 
escalating issues that exceed defined timeframes, ensuring full visibility of issue statuses. Employees have the option to mark tickets as 
unsatisfactory, prompting management to conduct a review if necessary.
The Company has meticulously crafted a process to engage with new employees at critical junctures in their first 7, 30, 60, and 90 days. 
These touchpoints empower employees to share their experiences and feedback up to that point. The feedback gathered is then shared with 
managers and relevant teams for improvement.
Moreover, we sustain regular contact with employees via feedback mailers and surveys.
The Company's Whistleblower Mechanism enables employees, customers, vendors, contractors and other stakeholders, to report any 
concerns or grievances related to potential or actual breaches of the Company’s Code of Conduct or unethical behaviour.  To enhance 
awareness, the organisation employs various communication methods, including email correspondence, training programmes, presentations 
and sessions, encouraging individuals to promptly report genuine, ethical and legal concerns or suspected fraudulent behaviour to internal 
authorities for resolution.
All employees are informed about the Whistleblower Policy, which can be accessed from the intranet, regardless of their work location. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee oversees the proper functioning of the whistleblower mechanism and has access to a designated email 
address, chairmanauditcommittee@indiamart.com.

No, to measure its carbon footprint, IndiaMART calculates all greenhouse gas emissions from both direct and indirect operations. 
The company is dedicated to reducing its overall emissions resulting from operations. To achieve this goal, the company continuously 
evaluates how its operations affect the environment, identifies key factors that contribute to its impact, and develops efficient 
carbon-reduction measures to reduce its carbon footprint. One of the key ways IndiaMART achieves this is by ensuring low electricity 
consumption through a variety of energy-saving measures. These measures include the installation of energy-efficient heating and 
cooling systems to replace fossil fuel heating, enhancing appliance energy efficiency by switching them off while not in use, bringing 
greater control over the being heated, using LED lighting, insulating buildings to prevent heat loss, and installing solar rooftops at its 
corporate headquarters. All of these measures are essential steps in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. By periodically assessing the 
overall effect on the natural environment, identifying primary factors that contribute to its impact, and developing successful carbon 
reduction initiatives, IndiaMART continuously aims to achieve deeper decarbonisation.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals  in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Given the nature of IndiaMART’s business, e-waste is the primary waste generated. As part of its operations, the Company produces 
a minimal amount of e-waste, which is managed in accordance with the relevant laws. This e-waste mainly originates from discarded 
electrical and electronic devices. To manage this, the Company ensures the safe disposal and recycling of e-waste by transferring it to 
certified recyclers. Additionally, the Company refurbishes its IT assets when feasible.
	
The Company’s dry waste primarily includes paper waste. There has been a consistent focus on reducing paper consumption through 
extensive digitisation across various value chains and functions. Waste papers generated in the offices are shredded and subsequently 
recycled into new paper products as part of a wastepaper recycling service.
	
The Company’s initiatives aim to reduce waste and optimise resource efficiency.
