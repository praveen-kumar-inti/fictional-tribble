The acquisition of the Heubach 
Group in March 2025, which had 
earlier integrated Clariant’s pigment 
business in 2022, marked a deﬁning 
moment in Sudarshan’s journey from 
regional pioneer to global 
powerhouse. By bringing together 
three heritage-rich legacies: 
Sudarshan, Heubach, and Clariant 
Pigments, we created ONE 
Sudarshan, a uniﬁed force with over 
270 years of combined expertise 
and a shared vision to inspire the 
colorants industry.

This was more than an acquisition;
it was a transformation.
With 19 manufacturing sites in 11 countries, presence across 120+ 
countries, and one of the world’s most expansive pigment portfolios, 
we are now among the top two pigment players in the world.
But scale is just the beginning.
The integration is rooted in shared values, a deep commitment to 
Seva (selﬂess service), and a relentless drive to lead through 
innovation, sustainability, and precision.
From Day One of integration, we have led with clarity and conviction; 
aligning our systems, harmonizing our culture, and engaging our 
3,900+ employees across continents under a shared Purpose, 
Mission, and Values. Through every plant, every formulation, every 
customer engagement, ONE Sudarshan is bringing its bold 
vision to life.
We are not simply manufacturing pigments.
We are engineering inspiration, enabling progress, and coloring
a sustainable future.
As ONE Sudarshan — uniting legacy, scale, and spirit— we are 
becoming the inspirational leader of the global colorants industry.
Together, we lead with bold purpose, breakthrough solutions, and the 
belief that true leadership inspires others to follow.

Dear Shareholders,
FY25 was a landmark year in the journey of Sudarshan 
Chemical Industries Limited (Sudarshan). I stand not only 
as a leader, but as part of a united global team shaping 
the future of the colorants industry.
This is the ﬁrst annual report I have the honor of 
presenting to you as Chairman and Managing Director of 
your company.
We are no longer just Sudarshan. We are ONE Sudarshan 
— a bold, purpose-led, and performance-driven 
organization built with over 270 years of combined 
legacy expertise from Sudarshan, Heubach Group, and 
Clariant Pigments. Our vision is clear: to become the 
inspirational leader of the global colorants industry, 
delivering sustainable, innovative, and reliable solutions.

Corporate Overview

In March 2025, we opened a new 
chapter with the acquisition of the 
Heubach Group, which had 
acquired Clariant’s pigment 
business in 2022. This milestone 
was the culmination of Sudarshan’s 
deliberate pursuit of strategic 
inorganic growth opportunities, 
delivering a once-in-a-generation 
transformation that brings three 
iconic pigment legacies together 
under one powerful identity.
Heubach carries a legacy of more 
than 200 years, strengthened by 
Clariant’s pigment business. With 17 
manufacturing sites, 2,500+ 
employees, and €1 billion in 
revenue in FY22, the group is 
known for its technical depth and 
trusted partnerships across 
coatings, plastics, inks, automotive, 
electrical, and electronics 
industries.
With this acquisition, Sudarshan is 
among the top two pigment 
manufacturers and the most 
valuable player in the colorants 
industry.
Yet this journey isn’t just about 
scale. It’s about synergy. We are 
combining Heubach’s technical 
excellence with Sudarshan’s agility, 
customer focus, and purpose of 
Seva. With this, we are raising the 
bar for the entire industry.
The new identity isn’t just visual; it 
is a symbol of our united purpose 
— to unleash joy, vibrancy and 
possibilities — and of our mission 
to deliver breakthrough results 
and sustainable solutions for all 
our stakeholders.

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Despite a complex macroeconomic 
environment, ﬂat demand, destocking 
cycles, and geopolitical uncertainties, 
I’m pleased to report that our 
Sudarshan Legacy pigment business 
has delivered a robust ﬁnancial 
performance on revenue and EBITDA 
margins in FY25.
In FY25, Sudarshan Legacy pigment 
business’ (pre-acquisition group) 
revenue stood at ₹2,595 Crore, up 
16.7% year-on-year (y-o-y), compared 
to ₹2,223 Crore in FY24. This growth 
was driven by high-performance 
pigments (HPP) and complex 
inorganic color pigments (CICP). 
Gross margin improved by 190 bps to 
46.2%, led by product mix and 
operating eﬃciencies. Higher growth 
in sales with improved gross margin 
resulted in adjusted EBITDA of ₹396 
crore, up 32% y-o-y, with EBITDA 
margin at 15.2%.
On a consolidated basis, ONE 
Sudarshan reported revenue of ₹3,346 
Crore in FY25, including a ₹525 Crore 
contribution from the acquired group. 
Adjusted EBITDA stood at ₹402 
Crore, with margins of 12.0%, 
underscoring the beneﬁts of scale, 
integration, and disciplined 
execution.
The acquired group had not 
undergone statutory audits of its 
consolidated accounts for the past 
two years. Additionally, we 
encountered challenges due to 
operations being spread across three
separate ERP systems that were not 
integrated.
These complexities caused delays in 
the submission of the audited ﬁnancial 
results. Nevertheless, our teams 
navigated the process with integrity 
and diligence, ensuring the successful 
completion of the audit.
Integration Update and 
Value Creation
We recognized that the integration of 
Legacy Sudarshan and Legacy 
Heubach would be a challenging task 
given the scale, complexity and 
cultural diﬀerences. 
Hence, as soon as we signed the 
deﬁnitive agreement, we initiated the 
integration program, focusing on value 
creation, Day-1 readiness, 
organizational design and business 
continuity. The program targeted 
improvements in operations, ﬁxed cost 
reduction, IT integration, and 
procurement, while ensuring seamless 
Day-1 execution and clarity on 
organizational structure. 
The key challenge lay in turning 
around the acquired group to a 
positive EBITDA. Early execution is 
already reﬂecting signs of structural 
margin improvement.
Some of the key focus areas were:
• Rebuilding the trust and conﬁdence          
...with all customers, suppliers  
• Given the expansion of our 
...manufacturing footprint to 19 sites in 
...11 countries, the vigor needed to be 
...truly world-class and competitive
• Harmonizing the product portfolio 
• Rebuilding and strengthening the 
...Product Management team 
• Unifying the data systems into a 
...single platform
• Integrating the supply chain and 
...developing resilience, especially given 
...the volatile context
• Motivating and rebuilding the 
...organization as we go through the 
...process and fostering the ONE 
...Sudarshan culture
While early results are encouraging, we 
know this journey requires patience, 
discipline, and careful execution. We 
approach it with determination and 
caution. Our progress gives us 
conﬁdence. Each challenge we face — 
ﬁnancial, operational, or cultural — 
strengthens the foundation we are 
building. We view them not as obstacles, 
but as opportunities to embed discipline, 
resilience, and long-term value.
Our message is clear: ONE Sudarshan is 
committed to driving proﬁtable and 
sustainable growth, with a foundation of 
disciplined execution and prudent 
ﬁnancial management.
At the heart of ONE Sudarshan is our 
commitment to science-led, 
customer-driven innovation. With 200+ 
R&D specialists across 12 global 
technical centers, we are pioneering 
sustainable pigment solutions and 
accelerating development in 
high-performance and eco-friendly 
formulations. Strengthened technical 
partnerships and close collaboration 
with customers enable us to co-create 
Innovation and R&D:
Powered by Purpose
Sustainability: A 
Non-Negotiable Imperative
Sustainability is a commitment 
embedded across our innovation, 
operations, and culture. We are 
committed to reshaping our product 
portfolio and processes to align with 
long-term environmental goals and 
global best practices.
Our approach is anchored in tangible 
actions: reducing CO2 emissions through 
greener chemistry and optimized supply 
chains, and adopting cleaner, safer 
manufacturing processes that protect 
both people and the planet. We are also 
incorporating sustainable additives, 
exploring new materials that meet 
stringent environmental standards, and 
designing pigments to extend product 
life cycles, reduce waste, and conserve 
resources.
This commitment is reinforced by 
globally recognized certiﬁcations, 
including ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 
45001, which validate our focus on 
performance, environmental stewardship, 
and workplace safety. Every innovation 
and certiﬁcation strengthens our color 
solutions, designed to perform eﬀectively 
while advancing a more sustainable 
future.

For over seven decades, Sudarshan 
Chemical Industries has been 
synonymous with India’s pigment 
manufacturing excellence, 
engineering its own equipment, 
formulating pioneering products, and 
steadily building global trust. From 
humble beginnings in Pune in 1951, it 
evolved into a forward-looking 
multinational with a strong focus on 
innovation, sustainability, and 
customer centricity.
 
Heubach Group brings an even 
longer industrial heritage, with roots 
tracing back to 1806 in Germany. 
Over two centuries, it established 
itself as a leader in pigment 
technology, known for German 
precision, technical rigor, and a 
portfolio serving high-performance 
applications in coatings, plastics, inks, 
and electronics. Clariant’s pigment 
business, with its own distinguished 
legacy, was acquired by Heubach in 
2022 and further enriched this union. 
The group had a global 
manufacturing base of 17 facilities 
across 11 countries.
   
In 2025, three powerful
legacies united.
Sudarshan’s acquisition of Heubach 
Group, one of the most signiﬁcant 
moves in the pigment industry in 
decades, was a bold statement of 
intent. This integration led to ONE 
Sudarshan, a global pigment force
with more than 270 years of combined 
heritage.
The strategic rationale was clear: 
Sudarshan would not just scale; it would 
transform.
THE HEUBACH
INTEGRATION STORY

By integrating Heubach's portfolio of 
high-end specialty pigments, technical 
talent, and advanced manufacturing 
systems, Sudarshan expanded its reach 
across Europe, North America, South 
America, and Asia-Paciﬁc, gaining 
immediate access to new markets, 
product categories, and 4,000+ 
customers in 120+ countries.
From the outset, the integration was 
built around three themes: value 
creation, organizational alignment,
and customer-centric growth. 
To steer this journey, an Integrated 
Management Oﬃce (IMO) was 
established in October 2024 with the 
signing of the deﬁnitive agreement, 
ahead of the deal closing in March 
2025. Built on four pillars — Master 
Planning, Organization, Value Capture, 
and Change Management. Teams across 
geographies collaborated to unify IT 
systems, streamline procurement, 
integrate supply chains, and build a 
single, agile organizational structure.

organisations, and signiﬁcantly 
broadening the scope of our 
portfolio. The acquisition extended 
our product range, enhanced our 
R&D activities, and expanded 
market coverage, creating a truly 
global innovation network.
Post acquisition, our R&D network 
operates six centres worldwide: 
Pune, Roha, Mumbai, and 
Ankleshwar in India, and Frankfurt 
and Langelsheim in Germany.  We 
also operate innovation centres in 
locations such as Santa Clara, 
Mexico; Suzano, Brazil; and 
Charlotte, North Carolina, US, 
among others, totaling 12

During the year, several initiatives were undertaken to strengthen governance, 
transparency, and service delivery at the village level:
Community Development
Gram Panchayat ISO.....
During the year, four Gram  
 
 
Panchayats from Roha, Mahad, and   
Sutarwadi were developed and  
 
supported in achieving ISO  
 
 
certiﬁcation, promoting improved   
governance systems, transparency,   
and service delivery at the
village level.
Gram Panchayat Capacity
Building Training
A series of capacity-building   
 
trainings and exposure visits were   
conducted across Roha and Mahad   
blocks, engaging key grassroots  
 
stakeholders including Sarpanch,  
 
Deputy Sarpanch, Gram Sevaks,  
 
Community Resource Persons  
 
(CRPs), and ASHA workers. A total   
of 12 trainings were organized,  
 
reaching 1,017 participants. Notable   
outcomes include the adoption of   
innovative practices such as the  
 
barcode system for tax collection    
by two Gram Panchayats in Roha,   
and proactive involvement in the  
 
Gram Panchayat Development Plan   
(GPDP) process, with 10  
 
 
panchayats submitting their annual   
plans. The sessions also led to  
 
increased engagement in CSR  
 
interventions, improved  
 
 
collaboration between Panchayats   
and external stakeholders, and a  
 
strong commitment to conducting   
regular Gram Sabha meetings to  
 
enhance transparency and  
 
 
community participation.
Gram Panchayat Exposure Visit
Gram Panchayats play a pivotal  
 
role in driving holistic village   
 
development as the foundation of   
the Panchayati Raj Institutions  
 
(PRIs). However, to fulﬁll this role  
 
eﬀectively, it is essential that Gram   
Panchayat members and leaders  
 
are aware of the ideal functioning   
of a proactive and  
 
 
 
development-oriented panchayat.

Women Empowerment & Livelihoods
To provide them with inspiration  
 
and a practical learning  
 
 
opportunity, an exposure visit was   
organized to the Ideal Village   
 
“Manyachiwadi” in Satara district, a   
model village recognized for its 
exemplary eﬀorts in sustainable 
development and community 
participation. A total of 47 Gram 
Panchayat members from Roha, 
Mahad, and Sutarwadi participated in 
this visit.
Solar Street Lights
We supported 70 Gram  Panchayats by 
providing solar streetlights. This 
initiative not only.enhances public 
safety and promotes clean energy but 
also helps the Panchayats signiﬁcantly 
reduce their electricity bills, allowing 
them to save funds which can be 
redirected towards other 
developmental activities in the village.
As part of our eﬀorts to promote 
livelihoods, we implemented key 
initiatives such as Uniform Making 
Units, Skill Training, 
Entrepreneurship Development 
Training, CRP Training, and 
Vocational Training. In total, 1,941 
youth were trained, resulting in the 
launch of 198 startups. Among them, 
165 youth received skill training, 198 
completed entrepreneurship 
training, and 411 individuals were 
trained under CSR capacity-building 
programs, including CRPs. One of 
the major highlights was the launch 
of the USHA Stitching Unit, which 
received bulk orders and created 
regular income opportunities for 
women. We also strengthened 330 
Self-Help Groups (SHGs) through 
ongoing support and training.
We aim to expand our collaboration 
with NSDC, state agencies, and 
corporate partners to ensure 
long-term impact and sustainability.

Management Discussion
and Analysis
Global Economic Overview
In 2024, the global economy demonstrated cautious resilience 
amid persistent geopolitical tensions, shifting trade patterns, 
and evolving monetary policy landscapes.  According to IMF’s 
risk-adjusted reference forecast, the global GDP grew by 3.3%, 
with emerging markets playing a pivotal role in sustaining 
growth, even as advanced economies experienced a 
slowdown.
Global inﬂation declined to an estimated 5.7% in 2024 from 
6.7% in 2023. Advanced economies made faster progress on 
price stability, averaging 2.6% inﬂation, while emerging 
markets experienced a more gradual decline. Looking 
ahead, global growth is expected to decline further, with 
the GDP growth projected  at 2.8% in 2025 before hitting 
a slight rebound of 3.0% in 2026. Inﬂation is projected to 
decline further, reaching 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026. 
However, the direction of monetary policy will likely 
diverge across regions, as central banks tailor their 
responses to domestic economic conditions and policy 
objectives.

Indian Economic Overview
India remains the fastest-growing major economy and a 
signiﬁcant uptick in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 
FY 2024-25 pushed GDP growth for the full year to 6.5%. This 
growth was fuelled by strong domestic demand, particularly 
investments in infrastructure and real estate — both public 
infrastructure projects and private development. A rebound in 
the manufacturing sector, supported by the construction 
industry and low input costs, also contributes to the positive 
trend.
Outlook
India's economy is expected to grow at a healthy rate of 6.2% 
in FY26, supported by rising private sector investment, 
sustained infrastructure expansion, strong consumer demand,
and favourable demographic dynamics. With these 
growth drivers in place, India remains ﬁrmly on course to 
become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.
Beyond this, India is on an ambitious growth trajectory, 
targeting a $5 trillion economy by FY28 and $30 trillion by 
2047. This is driven by large-scale infrastructure 
development, rapid digitalisation, and transformative 
government initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and the 
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. For FY26, the 
government has allocated ₹11.21 Lakh Crore to capital 
investment, representing 3.1% of GDP.

India’s macroeconomic landscape continues to exhibit 
resilience amid global uncertainties. The chemical segment 
plays a critical role in India’s aspiration to increase its share in 
global manufacturing, as it sits at the intersection of multiple

industries 
like 
automotive, 
construction, packaging, and consumer goods.

own equipment and formulating products that steadily 
earned global trust. Over the years, Sudarshan evolved 
from a domestic player into a multinational enterprise 
with a strong focus on innovation, customer centricity, 
and sustainability, establishing itself as the backbone of 
India’s pigment manufacturing excellence.
The Company’s growth trajectory was marked by 
continuous investments in technology, R&D, and capacity 
expansion, enabling service to customers in coatings, 
plastics, inks, and cosmetics across the world. Guided by 
values of Seva, ownership, bold ambition, and simplicity, 
Sudarshan built a reputation not just for its products, but 
for the relationships it nurtured with customers, partners, 
employees, and communities.
A deﬁning milestone in Sudarshan’s journey came in 
2025 with the acquisition of the Heubach Group, a global 
pigment leader with more than two centuries of heritage, 
which had earlier acquired Clariant’s pigment business in 
2022. This landmark transaction combined Sudarshan’s 
strong presence in India and other growth markets with 
Heubach’s established footprint across Europe and the 
Americas, giving rise to ONE Sudarshan — now among 
the world’s top two pigment manufacturers, with over 
270 years of combined legacy. The integration has 
brought together complementary portfolios, advanced 
manufacturing systems, and deep technical expertise, 
positioning Sudarshan as a truly global pigment player.
Beyond strategic expansion, ONE Sudarshan continues to 
strengthen functional excellence. Its R&D is anchored in 
12 technology global centers, with investments focused 
on sustainability-driven innovation such as green 
chemistry and circular economy solutions. Manufacturing 
excellence is another cornerstone, with worldclass 
quality, cost improvements, technology upgradation, 
and robust safety systems driving reliability and 
eﬃciency.
Global Color Pigments Market
The global color pigments market* is expanding steadily, with 
a current size of nearly $8.6 billion and an expected CAGR of 
3% over the next ﬁve years. Organic pigments are widely used 
across paints and coatings, plastics, textiles, printing inks, 
cosmetics, and automotive, where their high color strength, 
vivid brightness, and lower environmental impact oﬀer clear 
advantages over inorganic alternatives.
Sudarshan Legacy
Sudarshan legacy delivered a resilient and consistent 
performance in FY25, building on its expansion strategy 
in HPP and CICP. Sales grew by 11.1% year-on-year, up 
from ₹2,539 Crore in FY24 to ₹2,821 Crore in FY25. This 
growth reﬂects both volume expansion and a sharper 
focus on specialty pigments.
Gross margins improved by 1.1 percentage points to 
45.3%, driven by a stronger product mix and operational 
eﬃciencies. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20.3%, 
reaching ₹380 Crore, while EBITDA margins improved by 
1.0 percentage point to 13.5%. Proﬁt before tax (PBT, 
Some Key Observations on the Global Pigments Market
• Market is increasingly consolidated, but not all integrations 
...have created more successful companies.
• Geopolitical volatility underlines the importance of global

• Future growth is driven by custom solutions and deep

before exceptional items) rose signiﬁcantly by 40.0% to ₹217 
Crore, underscoring disciplined cost management and 
improved operating leverage.
Pigment-only business performance further highlights this 
strength. Pigment sales grew 16.7% year-on-year, rising from 
₹2,223 Crore in FY24 to ₹2,595 Crore in FY25, with gross 
margins improving by 1.9 percentage points to 46.2%. 
Adjusted EBITDA from pigments expanded 32.0% to ₹396 
Crore, with EBITDA margins at 15.2%. PBT before exceptional 
items from pigments surged by 65.1% to ₹246 Crore, 
highlighting robust proﬁtability. The strategic push in HPP and 
CICP continues to strengthen the growth trajectory and 
margins.
Our engineering subsidiary faced challenges, with annual sales 
declining by 27.8% to ₹228 Crore, impacted by weak order 
inﬂow in the ﬁrst half and cost overruns from earlier projects. 
Gross margins contracted sharply to 35.5%, while EBITDA 
slipped from a positive ₹16 Crore in FY24  to a negative ₹16 
Crore in FY25. PBT turned negative at -₹28 Crore. However, 
corrective actions were initiated in the second half of the ﬁscal 
year, including tighter project cost controls, restructuring, and 
transformation measures. These actions resulted in improved 
gross margins in Q4 and are expected to stabilize the 
subsidiary’s performance going forward.
Overall, Sudarshan legacy maintained strong momentum in 
pigments, demonstrating resilience despite macroeconomic 
challenges and weaker performance in its engineering 
subsidiary.  
ONE Sudarshan
FY25 marked a deﬁning year for Sudarshan with the 
integration of Heubach Group and Clariant's pigment business, 
creating ONE Sudarshan. The consolidated results underscore 
the scale and ﬁnancial strength of the combined entity.
ONE Sudarshan reported revenue of ₹3,346 Crore in FY25, 
with legacy operations contributing steady growth and 
the acquired group adding ₹525 Crore. Gross margins 
expanded by 2.8 percentage points to 47.0%, reﬂecting 
early synergy gains, operational eﬃciencies.
Adjusted EBITDA stood at ₹402 Crore, with EBITDA 
margins of 12.0%. Proﬁt before tax (before exceptional 
items) was at ₹223 Crore, supported by stronger 
operating leverage and cost discipline.
On a pigment-only consolidated basis, ONE Sudarshan 
reported sales of ₹3,119 Crore in FY25. Gross margins 
improved 
by 
3.5 
percentage 
points 
to 
47.8%, 
highlighting early success in integrating Heubach’s 
high-margin portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA grew 39.3% to 
₹418 Crore, maintaining margins at 13.4%. PBT before 
exceptional items was up 69.1% to ₹252 Crore, 
demonstrating the potential of the uniﬁed pigment 
platform.
Financial ratios also reﬂected the integration dynamics. 
Earnings per share rose to ₹22.5 in FY25, compared to 
₹16.0 in FY24. Adjusted return on capital employed stood 
at 10.3%, slightly lower than FY24 due to higher capital 
deployment for the acquisition. Net debt increased to 
₹652 Crore, with the debt-to-equity ratio stable at 0.3, 
indicating a balanced capital structure. Net working 
capital as a percentage of sales rose to 25.1%, reﬂecting 
integration-linked adjustments, but remains under active 
optimization.
The 
Company 
has 
launched 
a 
comprehensive 
value-creation plan targeting synergies in procurement, 
operations, SG&A eﬃciencies, IT integration, and the 
management 
expects 
these 
initiatives 
to 
yield 
meaningful gains in the medium term.

ensure 
robustness, 
independent

and safeguarding against potential catastrophic losses, 
further strengthening its overall risk preparedness.
Sudarshan believes that Internal Control is one of the key 
pillars of governance, which provides freedom to the 
management within a framework of appropriate checks and 
balances. 
It has developed and established a robust internal control 
framework that considers the nature, size, and risks that could 
hinder it from achieving its objectives. Adequate internal 
control systems and reasonable assurances on authorizing, 
recording and reporting transactions in its operations are in 
place. 
Sudarshan had already developed and implemented a 
framework to ensure internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting. 
This framework includes entity-level policies, processes and 
operating-level 
standard 
operating 
procedures 
(SOPs). 
Internal control systems are integral to the Company’s 
Corporate Governance structure. 
Information Technology (IT) policies and processes are key to 
achieving these objectives. The application systems and 
business processes are continuously improved by adopting 
best-in-class processes and automation and implementing the 
latest IT tools, which further help maintain ﬁnancial and 
commercial discipline. 
The entire control framework is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance about the credibility of data and

its pay-out by the Sudarshan Chemical Industries Limited ("the 
Company") in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act, 
2013 read with the applicable Rules framed there under, as may 
be in force for the time being ("Companies Act").
Preamble
Dividend is the payment made by a Company to its shareholders, 
usually in the form of distribution of its Profits. The Profits earned 
by the Company can either be retained in business and used for 
acquisitions, expansion or diversification, or it can be distributed 
to the shareholder. The Company may choose to retain a part 
of its Profits for further expansion and modernization of the 
business and distribute the balance among its shareholders as 
dividend. This Policy aims to reconcile between all these needs.
The objective of this policy is to ensure a regular dividend 
income for the shareholders and long term capital appreciation 
for all stakeholders of the Company. The Company would ensure 
to strike the right balance between the quantum of dividend 
paid and amount of Profits retained in the business for various 
purposes. The Board of Directors will refer to the policy while 
declaring/ recommending dividends on behalf of the Company. 
Through this policy, the Company would endeavor to maintain 
a consistent approach to dividend pay- out keeping in mind 
the need to provide greater clarity on the dividend pay-out 
philosophy of the Company.
Category of Dividends
The Companies Act provides for two forms of Dividend- Final 
& Interim. The Board of Directors shall have the power to 
recommend final dividend to the shareholders for their approval 
in the general meeting of the Company. The Board of Directors 
shall have the absolute power to declare interim dividend(s) 
during the financial year, as and when they consider it ft.
Factors to be considered while declaring Dividend
The decision regarding dividend pay-out is a crucial decision 
as it determines the amount of profit to be distributed among 
shareholders and amount of profit to be retained in business. 
The Board of Directors will endeavor to take a decision with an 
objective to enhance shareholders wealth and also meets the 
expectations of other stakeholders.
The Dividend pay-out decision depends upon certain financial 
parameters, external and internal factors.

External Factors
State of Economy - in case of uncertain or recessionary economic 
and business conditions, the Board will endeavor to retain larger 
part of Profits to build up reserves to absorb future shocks.

pay-out can be liberal. However, in case of unfavorable market 
conditions, Board may resort to a conservative dividend pay- out 
in order to conserve cash outflows.

restrictions imposed by Companies Act with regard to 
declaration of dividend.

WOMEN EMPOWERMENT –
The objective of the projects under this area is to empower 
underprivileged women in the local community by 
livelihood enhancement and vocational skill development. 
The purpose is to make women proficient enough 
through training to carry out the activities independently 
and earn a living. We have empowered 2,999 women. 
Projects undertaken so far include:
A.	
Paper Bag Project: The Paper Bag Project stands as one 
of Sudarshan’s flagship CSR initiatives, successfully 
running for over nine years. This project empowers 
women by providing training in the production and 
marketing of eco-friendly paper bags of various sizes 
and strengths. These bags are crafted from recycled 
newspapers and can be produced at home, requiring 
no machinery or electricity, making it an accessible 
and sustainable source of income for rural women.
B.	
Sukushal Uniform Centre: The Sukushal Uniform 
Centre is a community-based skill development 
initiative aimed at enhancing employability among 
rural women and youth. It provides practical training 
in tailoring, garment production, and fashion design, 
promoting sustainable livelihoods and encouraging 
local entrepreneurship.
C.	
Skill development tentative: In collaboration with 
like-minded partner organizations, Sudarshan has 
implemented targeted skill development programs 
aimed at rural youth. To date, over 1,700 individuals 
have been trained across a range of vocational skills. 
These programs not only support participants in 
securing gainful employment but also assist them 
in launching their own micro-enterprises, thereby 
promoting economic self-sufficiency within their 
communities.

2.	
ENVIRONMENT
In waste management, at present SUDHA is working 
with more than 40,324 families and 150 farmers for 
organic farming.
	
A.	
Water conservation Project:
Water is an indispensable resource for sustaining life, 
and its conservation is of paramount importance. 
We have undertaken water conservation efforts at 
the Mahad location, utilizing a range of methods, 
including Gabions, Nala Plugging, Farm Bunding, 
CNB, CCT, and other innovative water conservation 
techniques. These initiatives have had a positive 
impact on over 15,000 individuals across eight 
villages in the Mahad block.
	
B.	
Improved Agriculture:
In India agriculture is the backbone of rural 
communities. Given its significance, we are dedicated 
to promoting sustainable agriculture practices and 
advancing the Wadi project, which is presently 
benefiting over 1,000 farmers. Our efforts are 
aimed at increasing the economic stability of these 
communities while also mitigating the environmental 
impact of farming practices. We believe that through 
these measures, we can support the livelihoods of 
rural farmers while also safeguarding the health of 
our environment.
	
C.	
Waste Management:
Waste Management at the village level is actively 
engaging with over 5,000 families, striving to 
create garbage-free villages. We convert wet waste 
into compost and ensure that dry waste is sent for 
recycling.
3. 	
HEALTH
	
A. 	 Collaborative efforts with Government:
We have established collaborative partnerships with 
block level government institutions including rural 
hospitals and primary healthcare centres. The aim of 
these partnerships is to arrange health camps, Eye 
check-up and improve health infrastructure in rural 
communities. As a result of these initiatives, the 
health of the rural population has been enhanced 
and the overall health infrastructure has been 
strengthened.
	
B.	
Capacity building of Asha workers:
Asha workers hold a significant responsibility 
in ensuring the health of rural communities. 
Recognizing their pivotal role, we conduct capacity 
building programs that focus on enhancing their 
leadership, communication, and mental wellbeing 
skills. Such programs are aimed at empowering 
these workers to better serve their communities with 
excellence.
D.	
Awareness Program on Community mental 
health:
In recent times, the prevalence of poor mental 
health has become a pressing concern, attributed 
to evolving lifestyle trends. In response, we have 
initiated a community mental health awareness 
program. This endeavor involved conducting mental 
health awareness sessions for school children, Asha 
Workers, and Community Resource Persons (“CRPs”), 
reaching over 200+ students and Aarogya Sakhies. 
Our objective is to promote understanding of 
mental health issues and foster a culture of seeking 
appropriate support.
	
E.	
Awareness on Menstrual Hygiene:
As India strides into the 21st century, it's evident 
that many women in rural areas still face challenges 
accessing menstrual pads, resorting to unhygienic 
alternatives like cloth, risking their health. To address 
this, we've launched a menstrual health awareness 
program, benefiting over 600 adolescent girls and 
540 Tribal katkari women’s.
4.

1.
Climate 
Change and 
Energy Source 
Diversification
Risk
The IPCC’s Sixth 
Assessment Report 
highlights accelerating 
global warming and 
intensifying extreme 
weather, signaling 
significant physical and 
transitional climate risks. 
These developments 
threaten operational 
stability and market 
dynamics, making 
climate change a critical 
risk.
Sudarshan is actively reducing 
its carbon footprint through 
energy efficiency measures and 
diversification of energy sources. 
Additionally, Sudarshan enhances 
physical infrastructure and expands 
energy mix to mitigate acute 
climate impacts and strengthens 
resilience.
Negative, due to 
higher capex on 
mitigation measures.
2.
Human 
Capital 
Management
Opportunity
India’s transition to 
a knowledge-based 
economy, supported by 
a strong demographic 
dividend and a skilled 
workforce, presents a 
strategic opportunity. 
This talent pool would 
enable us to scale 
operations, drive 
innovation, and support 
long-term growth.
Sudarshan ensures equal 
opportunities for all employees, 
regardless of gender, race, 
or religion. Our policies and 
procedures, supported by 
continuous online training, reflect 
our dedication to employee 
protection and wellbeing. These 
training initiatives form a core part 
of our Human Resource strategy.
Positive due to 
higher productivity
3.
Labor 
Relationship
Risk
Operating within a 
complex global value 
chain in chemical 
manufacturing exposes 
us to potential human 
rights compliance 
risks. Failure to meet 
international human 
rights standards could 
adversely impact on our 
operations, damage our 
reputation, and strain 
business relationships.
Sudarshan has implemented a 
comprehensive Human Rights 
Policy and ensures all employees 
are trained on its principles. It also 
actively engages with its value chain 
partners to promote and manage 
human rights practices.
Negative due to 
expenditure on 
training and due 
diligence.
4.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Given the inherent 
nature of our operations, 
occupational safety 
presents a significant 
risk. Any lapse in safety 
protocols can lead 
to serious incidents, 
affecting workforce 
wellbeing, operational 
continuity, and 
regulatory compliance.
Sudarshan has implemented a 
comprehensive safety strategy that 
includes behavior-based safety 
practices, process automation, 
and asset integrity measures. 
Also, all the sites are certified to 
Occupational Health & Safety 
Management System (ISO 
45001:2018).
Negative, due 
to expenditure 
on automation, 
training, and asset 
management.

5.
Water 
Management
Risk
Climate change-
induced water scarcity 
and disruptions pose 
an increasing risk to 
operations. Additionally, 
inefficient water use, 
and pollution can lead 
to regulatory non-
compliance, reputational 
harm, and potential 
operational downtime.
Sudarshan sources its daily water 
needs from the Maharashtra 
Industrial Development Corporation 
(MIDC) and have implemented 
multiple conservation initiatives. 
These include controlling filtration 
parameters, achieving maximum 
water conservation, and recovering 
condensate to enhance water 
efficiency. Sudarshan also adheres 
to World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development’s 
(WBCSD) WASH Pledge Self-
Assessment Tool to evaluate its 
Safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
(WASH) facilities and identify 
gaps in comparison to leading 
international practices.
Negative, since 
water scarcity or 
contamination can 
disrupt production 
processes, impacting 
supply chains and 
revenue.
6.
Product 
Innovation
Opportunity
Innovative and 
sustainable product 
development presents 
a strategic opportunity 
to expand market reach, 
enhance profitability, 
and strengthen 
competitive positioning. 
Eco-friendly innovations 
also align with 
global sustainability 
trends, attracting 
environmentally 
conscious consumers 
and opening new 
market segments.
In response to the opportunity for 
sustainable innovation, Sudarshan 
implements advanced solutions 
to reduce environmental impact. 
These include minimizing HCB 
content in products, adopting 
Diethyl Sulfate (DES) for ethylation, 
and exploring alternative raw 
materials to improve solvent and 
catalyst recovery.
Positive, as 
successful product 
innovation can drive 
revenue growth and 
profitability
7.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Evolving regulations and 
growing stakeholder 
scrutiny around waste 
management practices 
pose a significant 
risk. Non-compliance 
or inadequate waste 
handling can lead 
to legal penalties, 
reputational damage, 
and operational 
disruptions.
Sudarshan has established robust 
and efficient processes that include 
the use of recyclable packaging, 
solvent recovery and reuse, 
recycling initiatives, and production 
optimization. Sudarshan also 
complies with Pollution Control 
Board guidelines to ensure proper 
waste disposal. Sudarshan also aims 
to adopt 4R approach - reducing, 
reusing, recycling, and recovering 
materials.
Negative due to 
expenditure incurred 
on waste reduction 
measures and safe 
handling.

Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Advancements in 
technology and science 
now enable more 
accurate assessment 
and management of 
environmental and 
social impacts across 
product life cycles. This 
creates an opportunity 
to enhance sustainability 
performance, meet 
regulatory expectations, 
and strengthen 
stakeholder trust.
Sudarshan has implemented 
measures to reduce persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs) and 
ensure low VOC content in our 
products. Sudarshan complies with 
stringent international standards, 
including EU REACH, USFDA, Turkey 
REACH, UK REACH, the US Toxic 
Substances Control Act, and TPCH.
Positive, due 
to enhanced 
stakeholder trust.
9.
Supplier 
Sustainability
Risk
The complexity and 
diversity of global 
supply chains introduce 
risks related to cost 
volatility, quality 
inconsistencies, and 
potential disruptions, 
which can impact 
operational efficiency 
and product reliability.
Sudarshan implements Supplier-51 
program to engage with its 
suppliers on both financial 
and non-financial parameters, 
ensuring greater transparency, 
risk mitigation, and supply chain 
resilience. Also, Sudarshan’s 
Responsible Sourcing Policy ensures 
compliance with labour laws, 
including zero tolerance for child 
and forced labour.
Sudarshan also prioritizes 
suppliers being compliant 
with environmental and social 
standards through 100% 
screening for new suppliers on 
ESG criteria, evaluating factors 
like environmental clearances, 
labour standards and human rights 
protection. The preferred suppliers 
maintain certifications like ISO 
14001, ISO 45001, or equivalent 
standards, ensuring alignment 
with Sudarshan’s sustainability 
objectives.
Negative, due 
to expenditure 
on supplier due 
diligence.
10.
Product 
Quality & 
Excellence
Opportunity
Delivering superior 
product quality presents 
a strong opportunity to 
enhance market share, 
brand reputation, and 
customer loyalty. High 
standards in quality 
can secure long-term 
contracts, differentiate 
offerings, and drive 
sustained revenue 
growth.
Sudarshan focuses on customer 
health and safety by offering 
environmentally sustainable, high-
performance products developed 
through advanced R&D. Our open-
door approach, inviting customers 
to visit our plants and labs, 
reinforces transparency and trust in 
our quality standards.
Positive due to 
higher profit 
margins, increased 
sales, reduced 
operational costs, 
and improved 
overall financial 
performance, 
positioning the 
company as an 
industry leader

11.
Air Pollution
Risk
Stringent emissions 
regulations pose 
financial and 
reputational risks, 
including potential fines 
and compliance costs. 
Environmental harm can 
damage brand image, 
while poor air quality 
may impact employee 
health, leading to 
increased healthcare 
expenses and reduced 
productivity.
Sudarshan complies with rigorous 
air quality standards by using 
low-sulfur coal and equipping 
all exhaust stacks with Electro-
Static Precipitators (ESP) and 
Scrubbers. These measures ensure 
our emissions remain well below 
regulatory limits.
Negative due 
to increased 
operational costs
12.
Corruption 
and Bribery
Risk
Corruption and bribery 
present serious risks by 
undermining ethical 
standards, damaging 
corporate integrity, and 
exposing the company 
to legal penalties and 
reputational harm, 
which can erode 
stakeholder trust and 
business continuity.
Sudarshan ensures effective 
implementation of strict zero-
tolerance policy supported by our 
Code of Conduct (COC) and Whistle 
Blower Policy. These frameworks 
extend across all levels of operation 
to prevent unethical practices and 
ensure integrity throughout the 
organization.
Negative, due to 
potential legal 
fines, penalties, 
and reputational 
damage impacting 
customer trust and 
investor confidence. 
Corrupt practices 
may distort fair 
competition, eroding 
market share and 
profitability.
13.
Competitive 
Practices
Risk
Participation in 
anticompetitive 
practices such 
as price-fixing or 
monopolistic behavior 
can result in severe 
legal consequences, 
substantial financial 
penalties, and 
reputational damage, 
threatening long-term 
business sustainability.
In response to the risks associated 
with anticompetitive behavior, 
Sudarshan provides comprehensive 
training on Sudarshan’s Code of 
Conduct to all employees. This 
reinforces its commitment to 
complying with antitrust, anti-
corruption, and anti-bribery laws 
across all levels of the organization.
Negative, due to 
potential legal 
costs, fines, and the 
erosion of profits.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
At Sudarshan, the workplace is built on mutual trust, free from intimidation, harassment, exploitation, or oppression. 
Sudarshan actively works to prevent, address, and correct any behavior that goes against this commitment through the 
implementation of an Anti-Harassment Policy, along with employee education, mentoring, and guidance. During the period 
under review, two cases of sexual harassment were reported.
	
The following mechanisms have been established to uphold this commitment:
	•
Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH): Sudarshan’s POSH policy strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone 
involved in reporting or investigating sexual harassment complaints. Any such retaliation may result in disciplinary action, 
including termination or legal consequences. The Policy mandates mandatory training for all employees and establishes 
an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to address any reported incidents promptly and impartially.
	•
Reporting Mechanism: A designated committee of investigators reports directly to the Managing Director. If needed, 
they may consult departments not associated with the complaint to ensure impartiality.
	•
Grievances against Internal Committee Members: Any disciplinary or corrective action arising from an inquiry under 
this policy is deemed final. The management ensures full support for effective, timely, and thorough implementation 
of the policy.

Post this acquisition, the Company now has 58 subsidiaries 
(including step-down subsidiaries) and 2 joint venture 
companies. In accordance with Regulation 33 of the SEBI Listing 
Regulations, 2015, the Company was required to submit its 
audited standalone and consolidated financial results for the 
quarter and year ended 31st March, 2025 (including the financial 
results of the newly acquired subsidiaries on consolidated basis) 
by 30th May, 2025. The Company intimated in advance to the 
Stock Exchanges regarding the delay in submission of the 
said standalone and consolidated financial results within the 
statutory timelines. As disclosed in the aforesaid intimation made 
to the Stock Exchanges, the delay was attributable to reasons 
including the challenges faced due to insolvency impact of the 
acquired entities, extensive financial reporting integration and 
complexities arising from business combination accounting. 
Therefore, consequent to closure of the financial year ended 
31st March, 2025, the Company paid fines levied by the Stock 
Exchanges as stated in the table below. The Shareholders are 
requested to note that the Company has submitted its audited 
standalone and consolidated financial results for the quarter

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Timing of recognition of revenue (as described in note 2.3(d) (Summary of material accounting policies) and note 26 forming 
part of the standalone Ind AS financial statements)
The Company manufactures and sells a wide 
range of goods such as organic, inorganic and 
effect pigments. Revenue from sale of goods 
is recognised net of discounts, rebates, sales 
return and taxes when control of the goods are 
transferred to the customer in accordance with 
the recognition and measurement principles of 
Ind AS 115.
Determination of point in time when control of 
the goods is transferred to the customer involves
establishing the present right to receive payment 
for the products, delivery specifications, shipping 
terms, timing of transfer of legal title of the goods 
and determination of the point of acceptance of 
goods by the customers. These considerations 
require exercise of significant judgements by the 
management.
Considering the multitude and variety of 
contractual terms and significant judgments 
involved, determination of point in time of 
transfer of control of goods has been identified 
as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
We obtained understanding of the Company's sales process, including 
design and implementation of controls and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of these controls.
We read the Company's accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition 
and assessed compliance with Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers.
We obtained and read the terms of customer contracts on a sample basis to 
assess various performance obligations in the contract, the point in time of 
transfer of control of goods to customers and pricing terms.
We tested on a sample basis sales invoice for identification of point in time for 
transfer of control and terms of contract with customers. Further, we performed 
procedures to test on a sample basis whether revenue was recognized in the 
appropriate period (including at year end) by testing underlying sales orders, 
sales invoice copies, lorry receipts, shipping records, customer acceptances 
etc. and tested the management assessment involved in the process, wherever 
applicable.
We performed various analytical procedures to identity any unusual sales 
trends for further testing.
We also assessed the disclosure relating to revenue in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards in the standalone Ind AS financial statements 
of the Company.
Hedge accounting including valuations thereof (as described in note 2.3(s) (Summary of material accounting policies) 
and note 15, note 17, note 22 and note 51 of notes forming part of the standalone Ind AS financial statements)
The Company enters into derivative instruments 
which comprise of interest rate swaps, cross 
currency swaps and also designates its foreign 
currency borrowings against highly probable 
forecasted export sales for hedge accounting to 
manage its foreign currency exposure.
These instruments are measured at fair values 
at each reporting period resulting in derivative 
financial assets and derivative financial liabilities. 
The gain / loss on maturity/ termination of 
such derivative instruments is recorded in the 
statement of profit and loss along with the 
relevant hedged item.
Our audit procedures included the following:
We obtained understanding of the Company’s overall hedge accounting 
strategy, derivative instrument valuation and hedge accounting process from 
initiation to settlement of derivative instruments including assessment of the 
design and implementation of controls and tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of these controls.
We read the Company’s accounting policy for hedge accounting in accordance 
with relevant accounting standards.
We tested the existence of derivative instruments by tracing to the independent 
confirmations obtained from respective banks.
We tested management’s hedge documentation and contracts, on a sample 
basis.

Annual Report 24-25
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Considering the significant complexities and 
judgements involved in estimating highly 
probable forecasted sales transactions, future 
foreign exchange rates, determination of 
effectiveness of hedge and the fact that these 
transactions have a significant financial effect 
and extensive accounting and disclosure 
requirements, hedge accounting has been 
identified as a key audit matter.
We tested on a sample basis the fair values of derivative instruments recorded 
by the Company with the independent balance confirmations obtained from 
banks.
We involved valuation specialists in re-performing the year-end fair valuations 
including evaluation of hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments on 
a sample basis and compared these valuations with those recorded by the 
Company and assessed the valuation methodology and key assumptions used 
therein.
We assessed the disclosure is in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company.
Impairment assessment of material investments in subsidiaries (as described in note 2.3(b) (Summary of material 
accounting policies) and note 6 of notes forming part of the standalone Ind AS financial statements)
The Company has significant investments 
in subsidiaries as at March 31, 2025. These 
investments are accounted for at cost 
less allowance for impairment, if any. The 
management assesses at least annually the 
existence of impairment indicators of each 
shareholding in such subsidiaries by reference 
to the requirements under Ind AS 36. If such 
indicator exists, impairment loss is determined 
and recognized in the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements in accordance with the accounting 
policies.
During the year impairment indicators were 
identified for certain material investments. The 
processes and methodologies for assessing and 
determining the recoverable amount of such 
investments are based on complex assumptions 
and require use of significant management’s 
judgment, in particular with reference to forecast 
of future cash flows relating to the period 
covered by the Company’s strategic business 
plan, normalized cash flows assumed as a basis 
for terminal value, as well as the long-term 
growth rates and discount rates applied to such 
forecasted cash flows.
Considering the significant level of judgment 
required in estimating the cash flows and the 
complexity of the assumptions used, this matter 
has been identified as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
We obtained an understanding of the Company’s policy on assessment 
of impairment of investment in subsidiaries and assumptions used by the 
management including design and implementation of relevant controls. We 
have tested the design and operating effectiveness of these controls.
We compared the carrying values of the Company’s investment in these 
subsidiaries with their respective net worth as per audited financial statements.
We have evaluated the valuation model used by the Company’s management 
/ valuation experts of the management. We assessed the competencies, 
capabilities and objectivity of the management’s expert.
We involved valuation specialists to evaluate methodology, assumptions and 
estimates used in the calculations. We considered potential changes in key 
drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management 
to evaluate whether the inputs and assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts 
were appropriate. We also assessed the assumptions around the key drivers of 
the cash flow forecasts including discount rates, expected growth rates and 
terminal growth rates used.
We assessed the recoverable value by performing sensitivity testing of key 
assumptions used, analysed and examined the business plans approved 
along with assumptions and estimates used by management and tested the 
arithmetical accuracy of these models.
We assessed the disclosure is in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company.
We have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report.

Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other 
information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual report, but does not include the 
standalone Ind AS financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available to 
us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is 
materially inconsistent with the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Ind AS Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true 
and fair view of the financial position, financial performance 
including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes 
in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
Those Charged with Governance are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Ind AS Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone Ind AS financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
	•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
	•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the standalone Ind AS 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
196
Annual Report 24-25
	•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone Ind AS financial statements of Sudarshan Chemical 
Industries Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in 
conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Companies 
Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to these standalone 
Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 
“Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, as specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone Ind AS 
financial statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone Ind AS financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to these standalone Ind AS 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these 
standalone Ind AS financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
A company's internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone Ind AS financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone Ind AS financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
Ind AS financial statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone Ind AS financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

1.2	 Basis of preparation and presentation:
The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company have

Financial Statements
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
A liability is current when:
-	
it is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
-	
it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
-	
it is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
-	
there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement 
of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as 
its operating cycle.
(b)	 Investment in subsidiaries:
A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another 
entity. Investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less 
impairment, if any. Where an indication of impairment 
exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed 
and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. 
On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, the difference 
between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(c)	
Foreign currency translation:
The functional currency of the Company is determined on 
the basis of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates. The functional currency of the Company is Indian 
National Rupee (INR).The Company’s financial statements 
are presented in INR.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency’s 
closing rate of exchange at the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences 
which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on 
foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, are 
capitalised as cost of assets.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the 
gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain or 
loss is recognised in OCI or Statement of Profit and Loss 
are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) 
or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial 
recognition of the related asset, expense, or income 
(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on 
which the Company initially recognises the non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in 
advance, the Company determines the transaction date for 
each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
(d)	 Revenue:
	
(i)	
Revenue from contracts with customers:
	
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred 
to the customer at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Company expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
The Company has concluded that it is principal in its 
revenue arrangements, because it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer. Revenue is measured at the amount 
of consideration which the Company expects to 
be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to the customer as specified in the 
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government).
	
Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction 
of performance obligations and a receivable 
is recognised when it becomes unconditional. 
Generally, the credit period varies between 7-120 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
services as the case may be.
	
The Company does not adjust short-term advances 
received from the customer for the effects of 
significant financing component if it is expected at 
the contract inception that the promised goods or 
services will be transferred to the customer within a 
period of one year.
212
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
The disclosures of significant accounting judgments, 
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from 
contracts with customers are provided in Note 2.3 (aa).
The Company has following streams of revenue:
	
(1) 	 Revenue from sale of goods:
	
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point 
in time when control of the asset is transferred to the 
customer. The point-in-time is determined when 
the control of the goods or services is transferred 
which is determined based on when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to 
the customer. Apart from this, the Company also 
considers its present right to payment, the legal title 
to the goods, inco-terms the physical possession and 
the customer acceptance in determining the point in 
time where control has been transferred.
	
The Company considers whether there are 
other promises in the contract that are separate 
performance obligations to which a portion 
of the transaction price needs to be allocated. 
In determining the transaction price for the sale 
of goods, the Company considers the effect of 
variable consideration, the existence of significant 
financing components, non-cash consideration, and 
consideration payable to the customer, if any.
	
Contract balances
(1)	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Company’s right to an amount of consideration 
that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time 
is required before payment of the consideration is 
due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets 
in Note 2.3 (r) Financial instruments.
(2)	
Contract liabilities: A contract liability is the obligation 
to transfer goods or services to a customer for which 
the Company has received consideration in form 
of advance (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Company transfers goods or services 
to the customer, a contract liability is recognised 
when the payment is made. Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when the Company performs 
the obligation as per the contract.
(3)	
Refund liabilities: A refund liability is the obligation to 
refund some or all of the consideration received (or 
receivable) from the customer and is measured at the 
amount the Company ultimately expects it will have 
to return to the customer including volume rebates 
and discounts. The Company updates its estimates of 
refund liabilities at the end of each reporting period.
	
(ii)	
Export incentive (government grant):
	
Income from export incentives are accounted for on 
export of goods if the entitlements can be estimated 
with reasonable assurance and conditions precedent 
to claim are fulfilled.
	
(iii)	 Interest income:
	
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Company and the amount of income can 
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a 
time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial 
recognition.
	
(iv)	 Dividend income:
	
Dividend income from investments is recognised 
when the shareholder’s right to receive payment has 
been established (provided that it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Company and 
the amount of income can be measured reliably).
	
(v)	
Other income:
	
Insurance claims are accounted on the basis of claims 
admitted / expected to be admitted and to the extent 
that there is no uncertainty in receiving the claims. 
Other revenue is recognised when it is received or 
when the right to receive payment is established.
(e)	
Government grants:
Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and 
all attached conditions will be complied with. When the 
grant or subsidy relates to revenue, it is recognised as 
income on a systematic basis in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with 
the related costs, which they are intended to compensate. 
Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as 
deferred income and is allocated to the Statement of Profit 
and Loss over the periods and in the proportions in which 
depreciation on those assets is charged.
(f)	
Taxes:
The tax expenses for the period comprises of current 
tax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive 
Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income.

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
(i)	
Current tax:
	
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at 
the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and 
laws that are enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax 
laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting 
date in the country where the Company operates and 
generates taxable income.
	
Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in the tax returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and considers whether it is probable 
that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. The Company reflects the effect of 
uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by 
using either most likely method or expected value 
method, depending on which method predicts 
better resolution of the treatment.
	
(ii)	
Deferred tax:
	
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred Tax Assets are recognised to the extent it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. 
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, 
the Company relies on the same forecast assumptions 
used elsewhere in the financial statements and in 
other management reports.
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit 
will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are 
recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered.
	
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. The carrying amount of deferred 
tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period.
	
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
Statement of Profit and Loss is recognised outside 
the Statement of Profit and Loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax 
items are recognised in correlation to the underlying 
transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
	
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity which intends either to settle current 
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in 
each future period in which significant amounts of 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be 
settled or recovered.
(iii)	 Indirect taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on 
incurring expenses:
	
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of indirect taxes paid, except:
-	
When the tax incurred on a purchase of 
assets or services is not recoverable from the 
taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition 
of the asset or as part of the expense item, as 
applicable.
-	
When receivables and payables are stated with 
the amount of tax included.
	
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of 
receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
(g)	 Non-current assets held for sale:
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use and 
sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered 
as highly probable when decision has been made to 
sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present 
condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale 
has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 
12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets 
held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. 
214
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured 
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
cost of disposal and are presented separately in the 
Balance Sheet.
(h)	 Property, plant and equipment and Capital-work-in 
progress:
	
(i)	
Recognition and measurement:
	
An item of property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’) is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Company and its cost can be measured 
reliably. These recognition principles are applied 
to the costs incurred initially to acquire an item of 
PPE, to the pre-operative and trial run costs incurred 
(net of sales), if any, and also to the costs incurred 
subsequently to add to, or to replace any part of, or 
service it.
	
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, 
net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any. Freehold land is carried 
at historical cost less impairment losses, if any. 
Cost comprises of the purchase price, including 
import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, 
after deducting trade discounts and rebates, if any, 
and directly attributable cost of bringing the item 
to its working condition for its intended use and 
estimated present value of costs of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site on which it 
is located. Borrowing costs relating to acquisition of 
tangible assets which take substantial period of time 
to get ready for its intended use are also included to 
the extent they relate to the period till such assets 
are ready to be put to use. Cost also includes cost 
of replacement of part of plant and equipment if 
the recognition criteria are met. If significant parts 
of plant and equipment have different useful lives, 
then they are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of plant and equipment. The Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific 
useful lives.
	
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant 
and equipment comprises the cost of materials and 
direct labour, any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the item to working condition for its 
intended use, and estimated costs of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site on which it 
is located. When a major inspection is performed, its 
cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant 
and equipment as a replacement if the recognition 
criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance 
costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss as incurred.
	
Machinery spares which meet the definition of PPE 
are capitalised and depreciated over the useful life 
of the principal asset.
	
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is 
derecognised.
	
Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as at the 
reporting date, are classified as capital work-in 
progress. Capital work-in progress is stated at cost, 
net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.
	
(ii)	
Depreciation:

(2)	
The Company, based on technical assessment made 
by technical expert and management estimate, 
depreciates certain items of building, plant and 
equipment over estimated useful lives which are 
different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule 
II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management 
believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic 
and reflect fair approximation of the period over 
which the assets are likely to be used.
(3)	
The Company reviews the residual value, useful 
lives and depreciation method annually and if 
expectations differ from previous estimates, the 
change is accounted for as a change in accounting 
estimate on a prospective basis.
(i)	
Intangible assets:
	
(i)	
Recognition and measurement:
	
Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition 
at cost and subsequently are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any.
	
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment loss.
	
Research costs are recognised as an expense in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period they 
are incurred.
	
Internally generated intangible assets arising from 
development activity are recognised at cost when the 
project is clearly defined and the costs are separately 
identified and reliably measured, on demonstration 
of technical feasibility of the project, the intention 
and ability of the Company to complete, use or sell 
it is demonstrated, adequate resources are available 
to complete the project and only if it is probable that 
the asset would generate future economic benefits. 
Such costs are capitalised as ‘Technical know-how’. 
Otherwise it is recognised as an expense in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period they 
are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
the intangible assets are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
	
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e. 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition 
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the asset is derecognised.
(ii)	
Amortisation:
(1)	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite.
(2)	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over 
the useful economic life and assessed for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and 
the amortisation method for an intangible asset with 
a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end 
of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are considered to modify the amortisation period or 
method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on 
intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure 
forms part of carrying value of another asset.
(3)	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit 
level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the change 
in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a 
prospective basis.
(iii)	 Research and development costs
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to 
the Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred. 
Development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset 
if it can be demonstrated that the project is expected to 
generate future economic benefits, it is probable that 
those future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
the costs of the asset can be measured reliably, else it is 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies applied 
to the Company’s other intangible assets to the extent of 
depreciable amount is as follows:

(iv)	 Capital work in progress (“CWIP”):
(1)	
Projects under commissioning and other CWIP 
items are carried at cost, comprising direct 
costs, related incidental expenses and eligible 
borrowing costs, if any.
(2)	
Advances given to acquire property, plant and 
equipment are recorded as non-current assets 
and subsequently transferred to CWIP on 
acquisition of related assets.
(j)	
Borrowing costs:
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including 
exchange differences relating to foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an 
adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection 
with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly 
attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset 
which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the 
cost of that asset till the date the asset is ready for intended 
use. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended and 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during 
extended period when active development activity on 
the qualifying asset is suspended. Other borrowing costs 
are recognised as an expense in the period in which they 
are incurred. All other borrowing costs are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they 
are incurred.
(k)	
Leases:
The Company assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Company as a lessee:
The Company applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company 
recognises lease liabilities representing obligations to 
make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing 
the right to use the underlying assets.
(i)	
Right-of-use assets:
	
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets, as follows:
Type of Asset
Useful Life estimated by 
management (years)
Leasehold Land
60 to 95 years
Building
4 to 9 years
Plant & Machinery (IT 
Equipments)
5 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company 
at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (m) Impairment 
of non-financial assets.
	
Sale and leaseback
When the Company (seller-lessee) sells an asset to 
another entity (buyer-lessor) and leases it back from the 
buyer-lessor, the Company determines if the transaction 
qualifies as a sale under Ind AS 115 or whether the 
transaction is a collateralised borrowing.
A sale and leaseback qualifies as a sale if the buyer-lessor 
obtains control of the underlying asset. The Company 
measures a right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback 
as the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the 
asset that relates to the right-of-use retained. The gain 
/ (loss) that the Company recognises is limited to the 
proportion of the total gain / (loss) that relates to the rights 
transferred to the buyer-lessor.
Any difference between the sale consideration and the 
fair value of the asset is either a prepayment of lease 
payments (if the purchase price is below market terms) 
or an additional financing (if the purchase price is above 
market terms), and this is applied if the lease payments are 
not at market rates.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
If the transfer does not qualify as a sale under Ind AS 115, 
the Company does not derecognise the transferred asset, 
and it accounts for the cash received as a financial liability.
(ii)	
Lease liabilities:
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. 
The lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also 
include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably 
certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects 
the Company exercising the option to terminate.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or 
a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred 
to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
(iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets:
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be 
low value (i.e. INR 500,000) Lease payments on short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
Company as a lessor:
Leases in which the Company does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the lease terms and is included in other income 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease 
are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental 
income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the 
period in which they are earned.
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from 
the Company to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees 
under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the 
Company’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease 
income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect 
a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment 
outstanding in respect of the lease.
(l)	
Inventories:
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:
-	
Raw materials, stores and spares and packing 
material: cost includes cost of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is determined 
on weighted average basis.
-	
Finished goods and work in progress: cost includes 
cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion 
of manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.
(m)	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or Company 
of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
218
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly 
traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Company’s CGUs to which 
the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. 
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated 
and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 
To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered 
by the most recent budgets / forecasts, the Company 
extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using 
a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, 
this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the entity operates, or for the market 
in which the asset is used.
Impairment losses of continuing operations including 
impairment on inventories, are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
For the assets, an assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist 
or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company 
estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
either its recoverable amount, or the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in 
which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually as at 31st March at the CGU level, as 
appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
(n)	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets:
	
(i)	
Provisions:
	
Provisions are recognised when the Company has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. When the Company expects some or all of 
a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an 
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised 
as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement 
is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision 
is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net 
of any reimbursement.
	
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to 
the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.
	
(ii)	
Contingent liability
Contingent liability is:
(a)	
possible obligation arising from past events and 
whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control 
of the entity or
(b)	
a present obligation that arises from past events but 
is not recognized because;
-	
it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation or
-	
the amount of the obligation cannot be 
measured with sufficient reliability.
	
The Company does not recognize a contingent liability 
but discloses the same as per the requirements of 
Ind AS 37. The cases which have been determined as 
remote by the Company have not been disclosed.
	
(iii)	  Contingent asset
	
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from 
past events and whose existence will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the entity. The Company does not

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
recognize the contingent asset in its financial 
statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised. However, when 
the realisation of income is virtually certain, then 
the related asset is not a contingent asset and the 
Company recognise such assets.
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
(o)	 Post-employment and other employee benefits:
	
(i)	
Short-term employee benefits:
	
The distinction between short-term and long-term 
employee benefits is based on expected timing of 
settlement rather than the employee’s entitlement 
benefits. All employee benefits payable within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as 
short-term benefits. Such benefits include salaries, 
wages, bonus, short-term compensated absences, 
awards, ex-gratia, performance pay etc. and are 
recognised in the period in which the employee 
renders the related service. A liability is recognised 
at an undiscounted value for the amount expected 
to be paid e.g., under short-term cash bonus, if 
the Company has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past 
service provided by the employee, and the amount 
of obligation can be estimated reliably.
	
(ii)	
Post-employment benefits:
	
	
(1)	
Defined contribution plans:
	
The contributions to provident fund, other 
funds, and superannuation schemes are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss during the period in which the employee 
renders the related service. The Company has 
no further obligations under these schemes 
beyond its periodic contributions.
	
	
(2)	
Defined benefit plans:
	
The Company operates two defined benefit 
plans for its employees, viz. gratuity and 
pension. The present value of the obligation 
under such defined benefit plans is determined 
based on an independent actuarial valuation 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method as at 
the date of the Balance Sheet. The fair value of 
plan asset is reduced from the gross obligation 
under the defined benefit plans, to recognise 
the obligation on a net basis.
	
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included 
in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the 
return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net 
interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised 
immediately in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding 
debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the 
earlier of:
-	
The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
-	
The date that the Company recognises related 
restructuring costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company 
recognises the following changes in the net defined 
benefit obligation as an expense in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss:
-	
Service costs comprising current service costs, 
past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments 
and non-routine settlements; and
-	
Net interest expense or income.
-	
Re-measurement
The Company presents the first two components of 
defined benefit costs in Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
line item ‘Employee benefits expense’. Curtailment gains 
and losses are accounted for as past service costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the 
Balance sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in 
the Company’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to the present value of any 
economic benefits available in the form of refunds from 
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the 
earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer 
of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises 
any related restructuring costs.
(3)	
Compensated absences:
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within 
the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee 
benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such 
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated 
at the reporting date. The Company recognizes expected 
cost of short-term employee benefit as an expense, when 
an employee renders the related service.
220
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
The Company treats accumulated leave expected 
to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as 
long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes. 
Such long-term compensated absences are provided for 
based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit 
credit method at the reporting date. Actuarial gains / 
losses are immediately taken to the Statement of Profit and 
Loss and are not deferred. The obligations are presented 
as current liabilities in the Balance Sheet if the entity does 
not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement for 
at least twelve months after the reporting date.
(p)	 Share based payments:
Employees (including senior executives) of the Company 
receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as consideration for 
equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model. Further details are given 
in Note 50.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and / or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents 
the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at 
the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in 
employee benefits expense.
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date fair 
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being 
met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions 
attached to an award, but without an associated service 
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. 
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of 
an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an 
award unless there are also service and / or performance 
conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and / or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include a 
market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and / or service conditions are satisfied.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair 
value of the unmodified award, provided the original 
vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, 
measured as at the date of modification, is recognised 
for any modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by 
the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element 
of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately 
through the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
(q)	 Finance costs:
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended 
use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. 
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in 
which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the 
borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the 
borrowing costs.
(r)	
Financial instruments:
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
(i)	
Financial assets:
	
(1)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component or 
for which the Company has applied the practical 
expedient, the Company initially measures a financial 
asset at amortised cost, fair value through fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair 
value through profit or loss. Transaction costs that

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial 
recognition. Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component or for which the 
Company has applied the practical expedient are 
measured at the transaction price determined under 
Ind AS 115. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 
2.3 (d) Revenue from contracts with customers.
	
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Company commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
	
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the 
principal amount outstanding. This assessment is 
referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows 
that are not SPPI are classified and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the 
business model.
	
The Company’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its financial 
assets in order to generate cash flows. The business 
model determines whether cash flows will result 
from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the 
financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified 
and measured at amortised cost are held within a 
business model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while 
financial assets classified and measured at fair value 
through OCI are held within a business model with 
the objective of both holding to collect contractual 
cash flows and selling.
(2)	
Subsequent measurement:
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in four categories:
-	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
-	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
-	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
other comprehensive income with no recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition 
(equity instruments)
-	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments):
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if both 
the following conditions are met:
(a)	
The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
(b)	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.
	
This category is the most relevant to the Company. 
After initial measurement, such financial assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost 
is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation 
is included in finance income in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) (debt instruments):
	
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the 
following criteria are met:
(a)	
The objective of the business model is achieved both 
by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the 
financial assets, and
(b)	
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
	
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. For debt instruments, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, interest income, foreign 
exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals 
are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and 
computed in the same manner as for financial assets

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value 
changes are recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, 
the cumulative fair value changes recognised in OCI 
is reclassified from the equity to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (equity instruments):
	
Upon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify 
irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through other comprehensive 
income when they meet the definition of equity under 
Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments - Presentation and are 
not held for trading. The classification is determined on 
an instrument-by-instrument basis. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading and contingent consideration 
recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to 
which Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
	
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never 
recycled to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the right of payment has been established, 
except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as 
a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which 
case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to 
impairment assessment.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL):
	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value with net changes 
in fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
This category includes derivative instruments and 
listed equity investments which the Company had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through other 
comprehensive income. Interest earned on instruments 
designated at FVTPL is accrued in interest income, using 
the EIR, taking into account any discount/ premium and 
qualifying transaction costs being an integral part of 
instrument. Interest earned on assets mandatorily required 
to be measured at FVTPL is recorded using the contractual 
interest rate.
(3)	
Derecognition:
	
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised when:
(a)	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
(b)	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material 
delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Company has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
(4)	
Impairment of financial assets:
	
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected 
Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of 
financial assets other than those measured at Fair Value 
Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected Credit Losses are 
measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
-	
The 12-months expected credit losses (expected 
credit losses that result from those default events on 
the financial instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or
-	
Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit 
losses that result from all possible default events over 
the life of the financial instrument).
	
For trade receivables, the Company applies ‘simplified 
approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be 
recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. 
The Company uses historical default rates to determine 
impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. 
At every reporting date these historical default rates are 
reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed.
	
Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit 
risk but instead recognises a loss allowance based on 
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has 
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors 
specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
	
For other assets, the Company uses 12 month Expected 
Credit Loss to provide for impairment loss where there is 
no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant 
increase in credit risk, full lifetime Expected Credit Loss 
is used. A financial asset is written off when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual 
cash flows.
(ii)	
Financial liabilities and equity instruments:

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. The Company 
classifies a financial instrument issued by it as equity 
instrument only if below conditions are met:
	
The instrument neither includes contractual 
obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset 
to another entity, nor it includes any obligation to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another entity under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the issuer.
	
If the instrument will or may be settled in 
the Company’s own equity instruments, it is 
non-derivative instrument that includes no 
contractual obligation for the Company to deliver a 
variable number of its own equity instruments. If the 
instrument is derivative, then it should be settled 
only by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of 
cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of 
its own equity instruments.
	
All other instruments are classified as financial 
liability and accounted for using the accounting 
policy applicable to the Financial Liabilities.
	
(2)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
	
All financial liabilities are recognised at fair value and 
in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable 
cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost. 
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative 
financial instruments. Equity instruments issued 
by the Company are recognised at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
	
(3)	
Subsequent measurement:
	
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified in two categories:
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and 
borrowings)
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL):
	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at fair value through profit or loss. The Company 
has designated any financial liability as at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and 
borrowings)
	
This is the category most relevant to the Company. 
Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method. For trade 
and other payables maturing within one year from 
the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts 
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of 
these instruments. The EIR amortisation is included 
as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
For more information refer Note 53.
Financial guarantee contracts:
	
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company 
are those contracts that require a payment to be 
made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs 
because the specified debtor fails to make a 
payment when due in accordance with the terms of 
a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are 
recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted 
for transaction costs that are directly attributable to 
the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the 
liability is measured at the higher of the amount 
of loss allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with the 
principles of Ind AS 115.
	
(4)	
Derecognition:
	
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as 
the derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(iii)	 Offsetting of financial instruments:
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.

(s)	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting:
	
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
	
The Company uses various derivative financial instruments 
such as forwards, interest rate swaps and currency swaps 
to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates and 
exchange rates. At the inception of a hedge relationship, 
the Company formally designates and documents the 
hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply 
hedge accounting and the risk management objective 
and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are also subsequently measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair 
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative.
	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives are taken directly to the Statement of Profit and 
Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedge 
which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and 
later to the Statement of Profit and Loss, when the hedged 
item affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment 
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial 
liability.
	
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are 
accounted for as follows:
	
Fair value hedge:
	
The Company designates derivative contracts or 
non-derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value 
of hedged item due to movement in interest rates and 
exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of hedging 
instruments and hedged items that are designated and 
qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment 
to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.
	
Cash flow hedge:
	
The Company designates derivative contracts or 
non-derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest 
rates and exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure 
on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a 
recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions. 
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedging 
reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. 
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Refer to Note 49 for more details.
	
If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold 
/ terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging 
reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in 
cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction 
occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the 
underlying transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in 
cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
(t)	
Cash and cash equivalents, and Bank balances:
	
Cash and cash equivalent comprises of cash at banks 
(which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage), and 
cash on hand and short-term deposits with original 
maturity of three months or less. Bank balances other than 
cash and cash equivalents as explained above comprises 
of earmarked balances of unclaimed dividends, and 
short-term deposits with original maturity of three months 
or more. These items are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and 
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, 
as defined above which are considered as integral part of 
the Company’s cash management.
(u)	 Dividends:
	
The Company recognises a liability to pay dividend to 
equity holders of the Company when the distribution 
is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in 
India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by 
the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised 
directly in equity.
(v)	
Earnings per share:
	
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net 
profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders 
of the Company by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted

average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) that have changed the number 
of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
	
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects 
of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(w)	 Segment reporting:
	
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The Board of Directors of the Company has 
identified the Managing Director as the chief operating 
decision maker of the Company.
(x)	
Rounding-off of amounts:
	
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes 
have been rounded off to nearest lakhs, with one decimal, 
as per the requirement of Schedule III of the Companies 
Act, 2013, unless otherwise stated.
(y)	
Climate-related matters:
	
The Company considers climate-related matters 
in estimates and assumptions, where appropriate. 
This assessment includes a wide range of possible impacts 
on the Company due to both physical and transition 
risks. Even though the Company believes its business 
model and products will still be viable after the transition 
to a low-carbon economy, climate-related matters 
increase the uncertainty in estimates and assumptions 
underpinning several items in the financial statements. 
Even though climate-related risks might not currently 
have a significant impact on measurement, the Company 
is closely monitoring relevant changes and developments, 
such as new climate-related legislation. The items and 
considerations that are most directly impacted by 
climate-related matters are:
(i)	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment: When 
reviewing the residual values and expected useful 
lives of assets, the Company considers climate-related 
matters, such as climate-related legislation and 
regulations that may restrict the use of assets or 
require significant capital expenditures.
(ii)	
Impairment of non-financial assets: The Company 
assesses whether climate risks, including physical 
risks and transition risks could have a significant 
impact. If so, these risks are included in the cash-flow 
forecasts in assessing value-in-use amounts.
(z)	
New and amended standards:
	
The Company applied for the first-time certain standards 
and amendments, which are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st April 2024. The Company has not 
early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment 
that has been issued but is not yet effective.
	
(i)	
 Ind AS 117 Insurance Contracts
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notified the 
Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts, vide notification 
dated 12 August 2024, under the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 
2024, which is effective from annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2024. 
Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts is a comprehensive 
new accounting standard for insurance contracts 
covering recognition and measurement, presentation 
and disclosure. Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 - 
Insurance Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types of 
insurance contracts, regardless of the type of entities 
that issue them as well as to certain guarantees and 
financial instruments with discretionary participation 
features; a few scope exceptions will apply. Ind AS 
117 is based on a general model, supplemented by:
-	
 A specific adaptation for contracts with 
direct participation features (the variable 
fee approach)
-	
 A simplified approach (the premium allocation 
approach) mainly for short-duration contracts
	
The application of Ind AS 117 had no impact on the 
Company’s financial statements as the Company has 
not entered any contracts in the nature of insurance 
contracts covered under Ind AS 117.
(ii)	
 Amendment to Ind AS 116 Leases – Lease liability 
in a sale and leaseback
	
The MCA notified the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Second Amendment Rules, 2024, which 
amend Ind AS 116, Leases, with respect to Lease 
Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.
226
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
The amendment specifies the requirements that a 
seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability arising in 
a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee 
does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that 
relates to the right of use it retains.
	
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2024 and must be applied 
retrospectively to sale and leaseback transactions entered 
into after the date of initial application of Ind AS 116.
	
The amendment does not have a material impact on the 
Company’s financial statements.
(iii)	 Amendment to IND AS 21 – Lack of exchangeability
	
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs notified amendments 
to Ind AS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates to specify how an entity should assess whether a 
currency is exchangeable and how it should determine 
a spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking. 
The amendments also require disclosure of information 
that enables users of its financial statements to understand 
how the currency not being exchangeable into the 
other currency affects, or is expected to affect, the entity’s 
financial performance, financial position and cash flows.
	
The amendments are  effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025. When applying 
the amendments, an entity cannot restate comparative 
information.
	
The amendments are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
	
Standards notified but not yet effective
	
There are no standards that are notified and not yet 
effective as on the date.
(aa)	 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions:
	
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, 
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying 
disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could 
result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to 
the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future 
periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the 
revision and future year, if the revision affects current and 
future year.
Other disclosures relating to the Company’s exposure to 
risks and uncertainties includes:
-	
Financial instruments risk management objectives 
and policies Note 49(A).
-	
Sensitivity analyses disclosures Notes 40, and 49(A).
-	
Capital management Note 49(B).
	
Use of significant judgements
	
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting 
policies, management has made the following judgements, 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements:
(i)	
Determining the lease term of contracts with 
renewal and termination options – Company as 
a lessee:
	
The Company determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it 
is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods 
covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised.
	
The Company has several lease contracts that 
include extension and termination options. 
The Company applies judgement in evaluating 
whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to 
exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. 
That is, it considers all relevant factors that create 
an economic incentive for it to exercise either the 
renewal or termination. After the commencement 
date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there 
is a significant event or change in circumstances 
that is within its control and affects its ability to 
exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to 
terminate (e.g., construction of significant leasehold 
improvements or significant customisation to the 
leased asset).

Refer Note 5 for information on potential future 
rental payments relating to periods following the 
exercise date of extension and termination options 
that are not included in the lease term.
	
Estimates and assumptions:
	
The key assumptions concerning the future and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial year, are described below. 
The Company based its assumptions and estimates on 
parameters available when the ﬁnancial statements were 
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about 
future developments, however, may change due to market 
changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the 
control of the Company. Such changes are reﬂected in the 
assumptions when they occur.
(i)	
Estimating the incremental borrowing rate to 
measure lease liabilities
	
The Company cannot readily determine the interest 
rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it uses its 
incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease 
liabilities. The IBR is the rate of interest that the 
Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar 
term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary 
to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-
use asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR 
therefore reflects what the Company ‘would have to 
pay’, which requires estimation when no observable 
rates are available. The Company estimates the IBR 
using observable inputs (such as market interest 
rates) when available and is required to make certain 
entity-specific estimates (such as the credit rating).
(ii)	
Useful life and residual value of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets:
	
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the Company. 
The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is 
derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s 
expected useful life and the expected residual value at 
the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values 
of Company’s property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets are determined by management at 
the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at the 
end of each reporting period. The lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as 
anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology. Consequently, 
the future depreciation charge could be revised 
and may have an impact on profit for future years. 
The policy for the same has been explained in notes 
2.3 (h) and 2.3 (i).
(iii)	 Recognition of deferred tax assets
	
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts, except when the deferred income tax 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss 
at the time of the transaction, at the rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent 
upon the generation of future taxable profits during the 
periods in which those temporary differences and tax 
loss carry forwards become deductible. The Company 
considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
and projected future taxable income in making this 
assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets 
considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the 
near term if estimates of future taxable income during the 
carry-forward period are reduced. The policy for the same 
has been explained under Note 2.3 (f).
(iv)	  Defined benefit obligation:
	
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan, other 
deﬁned beneﬁt plan and other post-employment plans 
are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial 
valuation involves making various assumptions that may 
diﬀer from actual developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases, expected returns on plan assets and mortality 
rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
	
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans 
operated in India, the management considers the interest 
rates of government bonds where remaining maturity of 
such bond correspond to expected term of defined benefit 
obligation.
228
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality 
tables for India. Those mortality tables tend to change 
only at interval in response to demographic changes. 
Future salary increases, discount rate and return on 
planned assets are based on expected future inﬂation rates 
for India. Further details about deﬁned beneﬁt plans are 
given in Note 2.3 (o).
(v)	
Impairment of non-financial assets:
	
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Unit’s (CGU’s) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
	
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash 
ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risks speciﬁc to the asset. 
In determining the fair value less costs to disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identiﬁed, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators. 
The policy for the same has been explained under 
Note 2.3 (m).
(vi)	 Impairment of ﬁnancial assets:
	
The impairment provisions for ﬁnancial assets are based 
on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss 
rates. The Company uses judgement in making these 
assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing 
market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period. Further, the Company 
also evaluates risk with respect to expected loss on 
account of loss in time value of money which is calculated 
using average cost of capital for relevant ﬁnancial assets.
	
The Company reviews its carrying value of investments 
carried at cost annually, or more frequently when there is 
indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less 
than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is recorded 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When an impairment 
loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of 
the Investment is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the cost of the Investment. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in Statement of Profit or Loss. The policy for the same has 
been explained in Note 2.3 (r) Financial Instruments.
(vii)	 Provision for inventory obsolescence:
	
The Company identifies slow and non-moving stock of 
all inventories on an ongoing basis. These materials are 
then classified based on their expected quality parameters 
to determine the possibility of utilisation / liquidation of 
these materials. Based on this, a provision for slow and 
non-moving inventory is created.
(viii)	 Share based payment:
	
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions 
requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions 
of the grant. This estimate also requires determination 
of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model 
including the expected life of the share option, volatility 
and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. 
For the measurement of the fair value of equity-settled 
transactions with employees at the grant date, the 
Company uses the Black-Scholes model. The assumptions 
and models used for estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions are disclosed in Note 50.
(ix)	 Litigation:
	
The Company has various ongoing litigations, the outcome 
of which may have a material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial 
position, results of operations or cashﬂows. The Company’s 
legal team regularly analyses current information about 
these matters and assesses the requirement for provision 
for probable losses including estimates of legal expense 
to resolve such matters. In making the decision regarding 
the need for loss provision, the management considers the 
degree of probability of an unfavourable outcome and the 
ability to make suﬃciently reliable estimate of the amount 
of loss. The ﬁling of a lawsuit or formal assertion of a claim 
against the Company or the disclosure of any such suit or 
assertions, does not automatically indicate that a provision 
of a loss may be appropriate.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
Considering the facts on hand and the current stage 
of certain ongoing litigations the Company foresees a 
remote risk of any material claim arising from claims 
against the Company. The Management has exercised 
signiﬁcant judgement in assessing the impact, if any, 
on the disclosures in respect of litigations in relation to 
the Company.
(x)	
Determination of timing of satisfaction of performance 
obligation:
	
The Company concluded that sale of goods is to be 
recognised at a point in time because it does not meet 
the criteria for recognising revenue over a period of time. 
The Company has applied judgement in determining the 
point in time when the control of the goods are transferred 
based on the criteria mentioned in the standard read 
along with the contract with customers, applicable 
laws and considering the industry practices. The goods 
manufactured by the Company are on the basis of the 
open purchase order as on date and the order expected 
to be received. Further, the goods are dispatched as per 
the terms mentioned in the purchase order.
(xi)	 Fair value measurement of financial instruments:
	
When the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the Balance Sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their 
fair value is measured using different valuation techniques 
including the DCF model. The inputs to these models are 
taken from observable markets where possible, but where 
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in 
establishing fair values. Judgements and estimates include 
considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk 
and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors 
could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 
Refer note 53 and 54 for further disclosures.

RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES
	
Company as a lessee
The Company has lease contracts for various items of building, land and plant & machinery (IT equipment) used in its operations. 
Leases of building generally have lease terms between 4 and 9 years and certain plant & machinery (IT equipment) have lease 
term of 5 years. Leasehold land pertains to upfront payments made to Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation and 
hence have longer lease terms upto 99 years with no corresponding lease liabilities. The Company’s obligations under its leases 
are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension and termination 
options and variable lease payments. The Company also has certain leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months or 
less and leases of office equipment with low value. The Company applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ 
recognition exemptions for such leases.

its holding in Sudarshan Japan Limited subject to necessary due diligence, approvals, consents, permission from the concerned authority to 
Sudarshan Europe B.V. Pursuant to the requirement of IND AS 105 - "Non current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations", this has 
been classified as "investment in subsidiary (held for sale)" as at 31st March, 2024.  Further, as a part of restructuring/consolidation and with 
the purpose to have a single entity as Global Holding Company for all overseas subsidiaries, the Company, on March 25, 2025, divested it's 
holdings in Sudarshan Japan Limited to Sudarshan Europe B.V. for a total consideration of ₹ 101.3 lakhs, resulting into a profit of ₹ 36.2 lakhs 
which has been disclosed in Miscellaneous Income (refer note 27)
**In light of the recent opinion issued by the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on 
“Consolidation of the financial statements of a Section 8 Company with the Sponsor Company.”, the Company has determined that it exercises 
control over its Section 8 company, 'Sudarshan CSR Foundation'. Consequently, the investment in ‘Sudarshan CSR Foundation’ has been 
reclassified from ‘other investments’ to ‘investment in subsidiaries’ as compared to previous year.

The above change does not impact recognition and measurement of items in the financial statements, and, consequentially, 
there is no impact on total equity and/ or profit (loss) for the current or any of the earlier periods. Nor there is any material 
impact on presentation of cash flow statement. Considering the nature of changes, the management believes that they do 
not have any material impact on the balance sheet at the beginning of the comparative period and, therefore, there is no 
need for separate presentation of third balance sheet.
The Company has complied with the number of layers prescribed under clause (87) of section 2 of the Act read with Companies 
(Restriction on number of Layers) Rules, 2017.
As an Ind AS transition adjustment, as at 31st March, 2017, the fair value of financial guarantee fees receivable for security given 
by the Company for loans taken by subsidiaries has been included in the value of investments. The details of such fair values

Description of nature and purpose of each reserve
	
(a)	 Capital reserve
	
Capital reserve includes surplus on re-issue of shares made in the financial year 1996-97 amounting to C 0.4 Lakhs.
	
(b)	 Securities premium
Securities premium is used to record the premium on issue of shares. The reserve can be utilised only for limited purposes 
such as issuance of bonus shares in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.
	
(c)	
General reserve
Under the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, general reserve was created through an annual transfer of net income at a 
specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. The purpose of these transfers was to ensure that if a 
dividend distribution in a given year is more than 10% of the paid-up capital of the Company for that year, then the total 
dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year. Consequent to introduction of Companies 
Act 2013, the requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to general reserve has been 
withdrawn. However, the amount previously transferred to the general reserve can be utilised only in accordance with 
the specific requirements of Companies Act, 2013.
	
(d)	 Effective portion of cash flow hedge
The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of gains or losses arising on changes in fair 
value of designated portion of hedging instruments entered into for cash flow hedges. Such gains or losses will be 
reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction occurs (refer note 
49 and 51).
	
(e)	 Share options (ESOP) outstanding reserve
The share options-based payment reserve is used to recognise the grant date fair value of options issued to employees 
under employee stock option plan (refer note 50).

The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan for its employees and every employee who has completed five years of 
service is entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits provided depends on the employee's length of service and salary at 
retirement age. An employee who has completed five years or more of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary 
(last drawn) for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with insurance companies in the form of qualifying 
insurance policies. The Company accounts for liability of such future benefits based on an independent actuarial valuation on 
projected accrued credit method carried out for assessing the liability as on the reporting date.
	
Risk exposure and asset-liability matching
Provision of a defined benefit scheme poses certain risks, as the Company take on uncertain long-term obligations to make 
future benefit payments.
	
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss, the funded status and amounts recognised in Balance Sheet for the plan.

Sensitivity analysis indicates the influence of a reasonable change in certain significant assumptions on the outcome of the 
present value of obligation and aids in understanding the uncertainty of reported amounts. Sensitivity analysis is done by 
varying one parameter at a time and studying its impact.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumptions namely Discount rate and Salary assumptions have been shown 
in the table above at the end of the reporting period, showing how the defined benefit obligation would have been affected 
by the changes.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The method used to calculate the liability in these scenarios is by keeping all the other parameters and the data same as in the 
base liability calculation except the parameters to be stressed.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
There is no change in the method from the previous period and the points / percentage by which the assumptions are stressed 
are same to that in the previous year.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The assumptions for mortality and attrition do not have a significant impact on the liability, hence are not considered a significant 
actuarial assumption for the purpose of sensitivity analysis.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Risk Exposure	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The gratuity scheme is a salary defined benefit plan that provides for lump sum payment made on exit either by way  of 
retirement, death, disability or voluntary withdrawal. The benefits are defined on the basis of final salary and the period of 
service and paid as lump sum at exit. The plan design means the risk commonly affecting the liabilities and the financial results 
are expected to be:	 	
	
	
	
	
	
(a)	
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds, if bond 
yield fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(b)	
Salary inflation risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
(c) 	 Demographic risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight 
forward and depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria.
	
The following is the maturity profile of undiscounted defined benefit obligation:

49	 RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
A	
Financial instruments risk management objectives and policies
	
The Company’s principal financial liabilities other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, lease liabilities, trade and other 
payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations and to support its operations. 
The Company’s principal financial assets include investments, trade and other receivables, deposits, loans and cash and cash 
equivalents that derive directly from its operations.
	
The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks. The Company's senior management is supported by an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
team that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The ERM 
team provides assurance to the Company’s senior management that the Company’s financial risk activities are governed by 
appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the 
Company’s policies and risk objectives. The ERM team process seeks to provide greater confidence to the decision maker and 
thus enhance achievement of objectives. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, 
which are summarised below.	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(a)	
Market risk	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, investments, trade 
and other receivable, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis in the following 
sections relate to the position as at 31st March, 2025 and 31st March, 2024.
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
i) Interest rate risk
The Company is mainly exposed to 
interest rate risk due to its variable 
interest rate borrowings. The interest 
rate risk arises due to uncertainties 
about the future market interest rate of 
these borrowings.
In order to manage its interest rate 
risk arising from variable interest rate 
borrowings, the Company uses Interest 
rate swaps to hedge its exposure to 
future market interest rates whenever 
appropriate. The hedging activity is 
undertaken in accordance with the 
framework set by the Risk Management 
Committee and supported by the 
Treasury department.
As an estimation of the approximate 
impact of the interest rate risk, with 
respect to financial instruments, the 
Company has calculated the impact 
of a 25 bps change in interest rates. 
A 25 bps reduction in interest rates 
would have led to approximately an 
additional ₹ 100.3  lakhs and (Previous 
Year: ₹ 89.7 lakhs) gain in Statement 
of Profit and Loss. A 25 bps increase 
in interest rates would have led to an 
equal but opposite effect.

ii) Foreign exchange risk
The Company has international 
operations and is exposed to 
foreign exchange risk arising from 
foreign currency transactions. 
Foreign exchange risk arises from 
future commercial transactions and 
recognised Financial assets and 
liabilities denominated in a currency 
that is not the Company’s functional 
currency (INR). The risk also includes 
highly probable foreign currency cash 
flows.
The Company has exposure arising 
out of export, import, loans and other 
transactions. The Company hedges its 
foreign exchange risk using foreign 
exchange forward contracts and 
currency options after considering the 
natural hedge. The same is within the 
guidelines laid down by Company's 
Risk Management policy.
As an estimation of the approximate 
impact of the foreign exchange 
rate risk, with respect to financial 
statements, the Company has 
calculated the impact on the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.  
The following tables demonstrate the 
sensitivity to a possible change in EUR 
and USD exchange rates, with all other 
variables held constant. The Company’s 
exposure to foreign currency changes 
for all other currencies is not material. 
For derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments, a 2% increase 
in the spot price as on the reporting 
date would have led to an increase 
in additional gain of ₹ 810.0 lakhs. 
(Previous Year: loss of ₹ 701.0 lakhs). 
A 2% decrease would have led to an 
increase in additional  loss of ₹ 810.0  
lakhs. (Previous Year: gain of  ₹ 701.0 
lakhs).

The Company basis their assessment believes that the probability of the occurrence of their highly probable forecasted 
transactions is not significantly impacted by the current geopolitical scenario. The Company has also considered the effect of 
changes, if any, in both counterparty credit risk and own credit risk while assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge 
ineffectiveness. The Company continues to believe that there is no impact on effectiveness of its hedges.
	
Disclosure
How the risk arises
How the Company manages risks
The Company has a significant portion of its revenue 
in foreign currency (other than INR). This exposure 
in foreign exchange risk affects the profitability and 
financial position of the Company due to variation in 
the foreign exchange rates.
The risk management strategy is as follows:
- To use the foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the 
foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted 
sales.
- To use the non-derivative contracts (cash flow legs of foreign 
currency borrowing) to hedge the foreign currency risk associated 
with highly probable forecasted sales.
- To use the cash flow legs of foreign currency borrowing 
combined with the cash flow legs of Cross Currency Interest Rate 
Swap to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with highly 
probable forecasted sales.
The Company has certain amount of its purchases 
in foreign currency (other than INR) which results in 
exposure to fluctuation of exchange rate affecting the 
profitability and financial position of the Company.
The risk management strategy is to use the foreign exchange 
forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk associated 
with highly probable forecasted purchases.
The Company has taken loans denominated in EUR 
which have floating interest rate. This results in 
exposing the Company to fluctuations in cash flow 
due to floating interest rate risk.
The risk management strategy is to use the Interest Rate Swap 
(IRS) to hedge the interest rate risk associated with floating 
interest rate cash flow.
	
The Company uses derivatives (forward contract, interest rate swap and cross currency interest rate swap) or non-derivative 
or a combination of both to hedge its exposure of forex / interest rate related risk. These instruments are either used to lock 
in a lower purchase price or / and a higher sales prices / fixed interest rate. The gain or loss on hedging instrument are aligned 
and effectively an offset compared with hedged item. 
	
The economic relationship between hedged item and hedged instrument is established to ensure that both are moving in 
the opposite direction because of the same hedged risk.
	
The credit risk associated with the hedge relationship is negligible due to the highly rated counterparties.
	
The Company's hedging policy only allows for effective hedge relationships. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception 
of the  hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship 
exists between hedged item and hedging instrument. The Company enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms 
of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of  the hedged item, and so a qualitative assessment of effectiveness 
is performed. If the critical terms of the hedged item do not match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, 
the company uses the quantitative analysis to assess effectiveness.
	
Ineffectiveness is recognised on a cash flow hedge where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the 
hedging instrument exceeds, on an absolute basis, the change in value of the hedged item that attributes to the hedged 
risk. This may arise if there is any change in the timing of the underlying hedged item or if the critical terms of the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item do not match exactly.

(b)	 Credit risk
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
i) Trade Receivables:
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty 
will not meet its obligations under 
a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The 
Company is exposed to credit risk from 
its operating activities.
Customer credit risk is managed 
subject to the Company’s policy, 
procedures and control relating to 
customer credit risk management. 
Outstanding customer receivables are 
regularly monitored and any shipments 
to major customers are generally 
covered by letters of credit or other 
forms of credit insurance.
An impairment analysis based on 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is 
performed at each reporting date.
The Company considers the probability 
of default upon initial recognition and 
whether there have been significant 
increase in the credit risk on ongoing 
basis throughout each reporting 
period, to assess increase in the credit 
risk, the Company compares the rate 
of default on the date of reporting and 
initial recognition.
The maximum amount to which the 
Company is exposed is ₹ 67,902.0 lakhs 
and ₹ 52,483.6 lakhs for 31st March 
2025 and 31st March 2024 respectively.
Against these receivables, a provision 
for expected loss allowance is 
recognised.
ii) Deposits and financial instruments 
(other than trade receivables):
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty 
will not meet its obligations under 
a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The 
Company is exposed to credit risk from 
its operating activities.
The Company maintains exposure in 
cash and cash equivalents and mutual 
fund schemes. Investments of surplus 
funds are made with assigned credit 
limits with approved counterparties 
who meet requirements of ratings, 
financial strenght, credit spreads, etc. 
Counterparty credit limits are set to 
minimize concentration risks and are 
reviwed periodically by the Board.
Long term credit ratings of these 
banking institutions are considered 
to be of investment grade. No 
impairement has been recorded in 
respect of fixed deposits that are with 
recognised commercial banks and not 
past due.

In addition to the historical pattern of credit loss, the Company has also considered the likelihood of increased credit risk 
considering emerging situations due to the current geopolitical scenarios. This assessment is based on the likelihood of 
the recoveries from the customers in the present situation. The Company closely monitors its customers who are going 
through financial stress and assesses actions such as change in payment terms, recognition of revenue on collection basis 
etc., depending on severity of each case.  Basis this assessment, the allowance for doubtful trade receivables is considered 
adequate.	
	
In addition, financial instruments that are subject to concentration of credit risk include loans, cash and cash equivalents, 
other balances with banks and other financial assets. None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material 
concentration of credit risk. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invest in deposits 
with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies.

Liquidity risk
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk 
that the Company will not be able to 
settle or meet its obligation on time 
or at a reasonable price or there could 
be excessive concentrations of risks. 
The Company's treasury department 
is responsible for liquidity, funding as 
well as settlement management.
Excessive concentrations of risks arise 
when a number of counterparties are 
engaged in similar business activities, 
or activities in the same geographical 
region, or have economic features 
that would cause their ability to 
meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes 
in economic, political or other 
conditions. Concentrations indicate the 
relative sensitivity of the Company's 
performance to developments 
affecting a particular industry.
The Company’s objective is to maintain 
a balance between continuity of 
funding and flexibility through the use 
of bank overdrafts and bank loans. The 
Company has access to a sufficient 
variety of sources of funding and debt 
maturing within 12 months can be 
rolled over with existing lenders.
In order to avoid excessive 
concentrations of risk, the Company’s 
policies and procedures include 
specific guidelines to focus on the 
maintenance of a diversified portfolio. 
Identified concentrations of credit 
risks are controlled and managed 
accordingly. Selective hedging is used 
to manage risk concentrations at both 
the relationship and industry levels.
The Company's principal sources of 
liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, 
borrowings and the cash flow that 
is generated from operations. The 
Company believes that current 
cash and cash equivalents, tied up 
borrowing lines and cash flow that is 
generated from operations is sufficient 
to meet requirements. Accordingly, 
liquidity risk is perceived to be low.
The Company assessed the 
concentration of risk and concluded it 
to be low.
The following table shows the maturity 
analysis of the Company's financial 
liabilities based on contractually 
agreed undiscounted cash flows as at 
the Balance Sheet date:

Capital management
For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, securities premium and all 
other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of capital management is 
to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise 
shareholder value.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the 
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend 
payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors capital using a gearing 
ratio, which is net debt divided by total equity. Net debt are non - current borrowings and current borrowing as reduced by 
cash and cash equivalents.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
The management assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalent, bank balances, trade receivables, trade payables, 
and other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities 
of these instruments.
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value:
(i)	
Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables / borrowings are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such 
as interest rates, specific country risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of 
the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these 
receivables.
(ii)	
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks, lease liabilities and other current financial liabilities as well 
as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for 
debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
(iii)	 The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions and banks with investment grade 
credit ratings. Foreign exchange Forward Contracts and Interest Rate Swap are valued using valuation techniques, 
which employ the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward 
pricing models, using present value calculations. The model incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of 
counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads 
between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.
(iv)	 The fair values of the Company’s interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using Discounted Cash Flow 
method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own 
non-performance risk  was assessed to be insignificant.
54	 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
	
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Company’s assets and liabilities
	
Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of mutual fund investments.
	
Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, 
measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e.; as prices) or indirectly (i.e.; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy include Company’s over-the- counter (OTC) 
derivative contracts.
	
Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets 
and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are 
determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from 
observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	
The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on 
a recurring basis as at 31st March, 2025 and 31st March, 2024.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value of fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy are shown below:
Type
Valuation Technique
Forward exchange 
contracts
Forward pricing: The fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the 
reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curves in the 
respective currencies.
Interest rate /
Currency swaps
Swap models: The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. 
Estimates of future floating - rate cash flows are based on quoted swap rates, futures prices and 
interbank borrowing rates. Estimated cash flows are discounted using a yield curve constructed 
from similar sources and which reflects the relevant benchmark interbank rate used by market 
participants for this purpose when pricing interest rate swaps. The fair value estimate is subject 
to a credit risk adjustment that reflects the credit risk of the respective group entity and of the 
counterparty; this is calculated based on credit spreads derived from current credit default swap 
or on credit spreads derived from current credit default swap or bond prices.
Investment in others
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payments, discounted using a 
current risk adjusted discount rate. They are classified as Level 3 Fair values.
Investment in mutual 
funds
The fair values of the mutual funds are based on net asset value as at reporting date
	
There were no significant inter-relationships between unobsevable inputs that materially affect fair values.	
	
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
	
In determining fair value measurement, the impact of potential climate-related matters, including legislation, which may 
affect the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities in the financial statements has been considered. The Company 
has assessed whether its properties are exposed to physical risks, such as flooding and increasing wildfires, but believes that 
this is currently not the case. However, the Company believes it is, to some extent, impacted by transition risks, and, more 
specifically, increasing requirements for energy efficiency of buildings due to climate-related legislation and regulations as well 
as tenants’ increasing demands for low-emission buildings. The Company, therefore, takes into account necessary upgrades 
required to ensure future compliance with those requirements when measuring the fair value of investment properties (if

statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of 
procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. 
The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in 
their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide 
the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial statements.
Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Timing of recognition of revenue (as described in note 2.3(f) (Summary of material accounting policies) and note 26 of notes 
forming part of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements)
The Group manufactures and sells a wide 
range of goods such as organic, inorganic and 
effect pigments. Revenue from sale of goods 
is recognised net of discounts, rebates, sales 
return and taxes when control of the goods are 
transferred to the customer in accordance with 
the recognition and measurement principles of 
Ind AS 115.
Determination of point in time when control of 
the goods is transferred to the customer involves 
establishing the present right to receive payment 
for the products, delivery specifications, shipping 
terms, timing of transfer of legal title of the goods 
and determination of the point of acceptance of 
goods by the customers. These considerations 
require exercise of significant judgements by the 
management.
Considering the multitude and variety of 
contractual terms and significant judgments 
involved, determination of point in time of 
transfer of control of goods, has been identified 
as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
We and other auditors obtained an understanding of the Group's sales process, 
including design and implementation of controls and tested the operating 
effectiveness of these controls.
We and other auditors read the Group's accounting policies pertaining to 
revenue recognition and assessed compliance with Ind AS 115 - Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers.
We and other auditors obtained and read the terms of customer contracts on 
a sample basis to assess various performance obligations in the contract, the 
point in time of transfer of control of goods to customers and pricing terms.
We and other auditors tested on a sample basis sales invoice for identification 
of point in time for transfer of control and terms of contract with customers. 
Further, we performed procedures to test on a sample basis whether revenue 
was recognized in the appropriate period (including at year end) by testing 
underlying sales orders, sales invoice copies, lorry receipts, shipping records, 
customer acceptances etc. and tested the management assessment involved 
in the process, wherever applicable.
We and other auditors performed various analytical procedures to identify any 
unusual sales trends for further testing.
We and other auditors assessed the disclosure relating to revenue in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards in the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements of the Group.
Hedge accounting including valuations thereof (as described in note 2.3(s) (Summary of material accounting policies) and 
note 15, note 17, note 22 and note 48 of notes forming part of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements)
The Holding Company enters into derivative 
instruments which comprise of interest rate 
swaps, cross currency swaps and also designates 
its foreign currency borrowings against highly 
probable forecasted export sales for hedge 
accounting to manage its foreign currency 
exposure.
These instruments are measured at fair values 
at each reporting period resulting in derivative 
financial assets and derivative financial liabilities. 
The gain / loss on maturity/ termination of 
such derivative instruments is recorded in the 
statement of profit and loss along with the 
relevant hedged item.
Our audit procedures included the following:
We obtained understanding of the Holding Company’s overall hedge 
accounting strategy, derivative instrument valuation and hedge accounting 
process from initiation to settlement of derivative instruments including 
assessment of the design and implementation of controls and tested the 
operating effectiveness of these controls.
We read the Holding Company’s accounting policy for hedge accounting in 
accordance with relevant accounting standards.

confirmations obtained from respective banks.

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Considering the significant complexities and 
judgements involved in estimating highly 
probable forecasted sales transactions, future 
foreign exchange rates, determination of 
effectiveness of hedge and the fact that these 
transactions have a significant financial effect 
and extensive accounting and disclosure 
requirements, hedge accounting has been 
identified as a key audit matter.
We tested management’s hedge documentation and contracts, on a sample 
basis.
We tested on a sample basis the fair values of derivative instruments recorded 
by the Holding Company with the independent balance confirmations 
obtained from banks.
We involved valuation specialists in re-performing the year-end fair valuations 
including evaluation of hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments on 
a sample basis and compared these valuations with those recorded by 
the Holding Company and assessed the valuation methodology and key 
assumptions used therein.
We assessed the disclosure is in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of the Holding 
Company.
Determination of fair value of acquired assets including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed in accordance with Ind AS 
103 – ‘Business Combinations' (as described in note 2.3(b) (summary of material accounting policies) and note 44 of notes

subsidiary of the Holding Company acquired 
the global pigment business operations of the 
Heubach Group of Germany on March 03, 2025, 
for a purchase consideration of INR 138,990.0 
lakhs.
The accounting for this transaction includes 
significant judgement, estimates, and 
assumptions as to whether the acquisition is in 
the nature of ‘business’ or ‘asset’, identification 
and fair valuation of acquired assets including 
intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, 
consequent allocation of the purchase price 
to the assets and liabilities arising from this 
transaction, and management's use of external 
valuation experts.
Considering the significance of the transaction 
and significant estimates and judgements 
involved, we have identified the determination 
of fair value of acquired assets including 
intangible assets, and liabilities assumed as a 
key audit matter.
Our procedures included the following:
We obtained an understanding of the Holding Company’s process, including 
design and implementation of controls over the accounting of business 
combinations and tested the design and operating effectiveness of these 
controls.
We read the Holding Company’s accounting policies pertaining to business 
combination and assessed compliance with Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations.
We obtained and read relevant transaction agreements, meeting minutes and 
the underlying documentation for the consideration paid to assess that the 
accounting treatment is in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS - 103 
Business Combinations.
We obtained and read the report of the management’s expert to evaluate 
the reasonableness of the methodology and key assumptions used by 
management and its expert for identification and fair valuation of the acquired 
assets including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed by corroborating this 
identification with our understanding of the business based on our discussion 
with the management.
We evaluated the competence and objectivity of the management’s experts.
We obtained an understanding of the purchase price allocation process 
followed by the management.
We tested the arithmetical accuracy of management’s calculations of capital 
reserve.
We involved internal valuation experts to review the reasonableness of the 
valuation methodology and key assumptions used by the management and 
its expert in the determination of fair value of the acquired assets including 
intangible assets, and liabilities assumed.

accordance with applicable accounting standards in the consolidated Ind AS

Key audit matters
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Assessment of contingencies and provision relating to ongoing litigations for Direct Tax, Indirect tax and other matters in 
respect of Heubach Colorants India Limited (as described in note 39 of notes forming part of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements)
The auditors of Heubach Colorants India Limited, 
a step-down subsidiary of the Holding Company, 
have reported assessment of contingencies and 
provision relating to ongoing litigations for 
Direct Tax, Indirect tax and other matters as a 
key audit matter on account of the following 
reasons:
The step-down subsidiary has various ongoing 
Direct tax, Indirect tax and other matters under 
litigation.
The assessment of the likely outcome of the 
tax and other matters and related outflow of 
resources that are probable, involve significant 
management judgment and uncertainty of 
assumptions, since they are based on the 
application and interpretation of law.
This has been considered to be a key audit 
matter because of the significant impact on 
the financial statements and uncertainty of the 
possible outcomes.
The step-down subsidiary’s auditors (being other firm of chartered accountants) 
have performed the audit procedures including but not limited to the following:
Obtained a detailed understanding of the management’s process for 
determining provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining to tax claims and 
other litigation disputes.
Verified the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls in 
respect of assessment of direct tax, indirect tax, other matters and provisions 
related thereon, if any.
Obtained the details and understood the nature of tax positions and litigations 
pending against the Company by reading the minutes of various meetings 
and discussing the developments during the year for litigations with the 
Management, the Audit Committee and management expert for the future 
course of action by the Company.
Read the orders received by the Company from the tax authorities and opinions 
sought from the management’s experts.
Involved auditor’s tax experts to assist them in the assessment of the possible 
outcome of certain cases, evaluation of underlying assumptions in estimating 
the tax provisions and related expenses thereon.

any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. As described in the ‘Basis for

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind 
AS financial statements in terms of the requirements of the 
Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and 
consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group 
including its joint ventures in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
302
Annual Report 24-25
Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements by 
the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing 
the ability of their respective companies to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are also responsible for 
overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective 
companies.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit.  We also:
	•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
Ind AS financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
	•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint 
ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint 
ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
	•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
	•
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group and its joint ventures of which we are 
the independent auditors. For other entities included 
in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, which 
have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements

Financial Statements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the 
public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
a)	
We did not audit the financial statements and other financial 
information, in respect of fifty-seven (57) subsidiaries 
whose financial statements include total assets of INR 
7,82,199.7 lakhs as at March 31, 2025, and total revenues of 
INR 1,31,727.9 lakhs and net cash inflows of INR 1,07,591.8 
lakhs for the year ended on that date. Those financial 
statements and other financial information have been 
audited by other auditors, which financial statements, 
other financial information and auditor’s reports have been 
furnished to us by the management. The consolidated 
financial statements also include the Group’s share of 
net profit of INR 45.2 lakhs for the year ended March 31, 
2025, as considered in the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, in respect of one (1) joint venture, whose 
financial statements, other financial information have 
been audited by other auditors and whose reports have 
been furnished to us by the Management. Our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it 
relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect 
of these subsidiaries and joint venture, and our report in 
terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far 
as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries and joint venture, 
is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.
b)	
The consolidated Ind AS financial statements also include 
the Group’s share of net profit of INR 241.4 lakhs for 
the year ended March  31,  2025, as considered in the

of one (1) joint venture, whose financial statements, 
other financial information have not been audited and 
whose unaudited financial statements, other unaudited 
financial information have been furnished to us by the 
Management. Our opinion, in so far as it relates amounts 
and disclosures included in respect of this joint venture, 
and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of 
the Act in so far as it relates to the aforesaid joint venture, 
is based solely on such unaudited financial statements and 
other unaudited financial information. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to us 
by the Management, these financial statements and other 
financial information are not material to the Group.
Our opinion above on the consolidated Ind AS financial 
statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of the above

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
consolidated Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of 
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial control 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With 
Reference to Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated Ind AS financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group and its joint venture, which are 
companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated Ind AS 
financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 
2025, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Holding Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy 
and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated Ind AS financial statements of 
the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to six (6) subsidiaries, 
and one (1) joint venture, which are companies incorporated in 
India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of 
such subsidiaries, and joint venture incorporated in India.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
2.3	 Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
as at 31st March 2025. Control is achieved when the 
Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if 
the Group has:
-	
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give 
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of 
the investee)
-	
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
-	
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
its returns
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting 
rights result in control. To support this presumption and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting 
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all 
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it 
has power over an investee, including:
- 	
The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee
- 	
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
- 	
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
- 	
The size of the group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of 
the other voting rights holders
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three elements of control. 
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group 
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date the Group gains control until the 
date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other 
events in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group 
uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the 
consolidated financial statements for like transactions and 
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments 
are made to that Group member’s financial statements in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure 
conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose 
of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as 
that of the parent company. When the end of the reporting 
period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary, 
the subsidiary prepares, for consolidation purposes, 
additional financial information as of the same date as the 
financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to 
consolidate the financial information of the subsidiary, 
unless it is impracticable to do so.
Consolidated financial statements present assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent 
and its subsidiaries as those of a single economic entity. 
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, 
below key consolidation procedures are followed:
(a)	
Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent 
with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, 
assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash 
flows of subsidiaries are based on the amounts 
of the assets and liabilities determined as per 
the Business Combination policy and recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements at the 
acquisition date.
(b)	
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the 
parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to 
account for any related goodwill.
(c)	
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between entities of the Group. Profits or 
losses resulting from intragroup transactions that 
are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed 
assets, are eliminated in full. Intragroup losses may 
indicate an impairment that requires recognition 
in the consolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 
- Income Taxes applies to temporary differences 
that arise from the elimination of profits and losses 
resulting from intragroup transactions.
(d)	
In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items 
are consolidated at the functional currency spot 
rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for 
recognition. All assets and liabilities are converted at 
rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

is recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation 
Reserve (FCTR).
(e)	
The difference between the proceeds from disposal 
of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying 
amount of its assets less liabilities as on the date of 
disposal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss being the profit or loss on disposal 
of investment in subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the owners of the parent 
of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit balance.
2.3	 Summary of material accounting policies:
	
(a)	
Current versus non-current classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet based on current / non-current 
classification.
	
	
An asset is treated as current when it is:
-	
expected to be realised or intended to be sold 
or consumed in normal operating cycle;
-	
held primarily for the purpose of trading;
-	
expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
-	
cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
-	
it is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle;
-	
it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
-	
it is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting period, or
-	
there is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
(b)	 Business combinations, Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or 
at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the 
periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are 
received, with the exception of the costs of issuing debt or 
equity securities that are recognised in accordance with 
Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.
The Group determines that it has acquired a business 
when the acquired set of activities and assets include an 
input and a substantive process that together significantly 
contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired 
process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability 
to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired 
include an organised workforce with the necessary 
skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process 
or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue 
producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or 
cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay 
in the ability to continue producing outputs.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, 
and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their 
acquisition date fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities 
assumed include contingent liabilities representing 
present obligation and they are measured at their 
acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact that outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits is not 
probable. However, the following assets and liabilities 
acquired in a business combination are measured at the 
basis indicated below:
-	
Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the liabilities or 
assets related to employee benefit arrangements are 
recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 
12 - Income Tax and Ind AS 19 - Employee Benefits 
respectively.
-	
Liabilities or equity instruments related to share 
based payment arrangements of the acquiree 
or share – based payments arrangements of the 
Group entered into to replace share-based payment 
318
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 
accordance with Ind AS 102 - Share-based Payments 
at the acquisition date.
-	
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 - Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are 
measured in accordance with that Standard.
-	
Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined 
on the basis of the remaining contractual term of the 
related contract. Such valuation does not consider 
potential renewal of the reacquired right.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the 
financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the 
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by 
the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its 
acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.
When additional payments contingent on future events 
are negotiated and agreed as part of the business 
combination agreement, the entity analyses the nature 
as well as economic substance of these payments, 
particularly, payments made to those who remain 
as employees of the business after it is acquired, to 
determine whether these whether they are in the nature 
of payment for future employee services or they represent 
contingent consideration for business combination. 
In the former case, depending on the exact terms of the 
arrangement, the payments to be made are accounted for 
as remuneration for services to be received subsequent 
to the acquisition, rather than as part of the consideration 
paid for the business. Any contingent consideration to 
be transferred by the acquirer, i.e., contingent payment 
to be treated as such, is recognised at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified 
as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and 
within the scope of Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments, 
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss in accordance with Ind AS 
109. If the contingent consideration is not within the 
scope of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance with 
the appropriate Ind AS and shall be recognised in profit or 
loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity 
is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and 
subsequent its settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the 
amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any 
previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the 
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the 
reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value 
of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and 
accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if 
there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity 
recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, 
without routing the same through OCI.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are 
assigned to those units.
A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been 
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is 
recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed 
in these circumstances is measured based on the relative 
values of the disposed operation and the portion of the 
cash-generating unit retained.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional 
amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
through goodwill during the measurement period, or

additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and circumstances 
that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would 
have affected the amounts recognized at that date. 
These adjustments are called as measurement period 
adjustments. The measurement period does not exceed 
one year from the acquisition date.
(c)	
Investment in joint venture:
The group holds an interest in joint ventures - Heubach 
Toyo Colour Private Limited, and Hangzhou Baihe 
Heubach Pigments Co. Ltd. The financial statements of 
Heubach Toyo Colour Private Limited, and Hangzhou 
Baihe Heubach Pigments Co. Ltd. are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the Group. The accounting policies of 
these entities are aligned with those of the Group.
Therefore, no adjustments are made when measuring and 
recognising the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the 
investees after the date of acquisition.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have 
rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control 
is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the 
parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining whether 
significant influence or joint control are similar to those 
necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.
The results, assets, and liabilities of jointly controlled entities 
are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity 
method, an investment in a jointly controlled entity is 
initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognise the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits 
or losses and that of other comprehensive income of 
the jointly controlled entity. Distributions received from 
a jointly controlled entity reduce the carrying amount of 
the investment. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from 
transactions between the Group, jointly controlled entities 
are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the jointly 
controlled entity. Goodwill relating to the joint venture is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment and is 
not tested for impairment individually. Thus, reversals of 
impairments may effectively include reversal of goodwill 
impairments. Impairments and reversals are presented 
within ‘Share of profit/(loss) of joint ventures’ in the 
statement of profit or loss.
The statement of profit and loss reflects the Group’s share 
of the results of operations of the joint venture. Any change 
in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s 
OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in 
the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and 
losses resulting from transactions between the Group 
and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the 
interest in the joint venture.
If an entity’s share of losses of a joint venture equals or 
exceeds its interest in the joint venture (which includes 
any long-term interest that, in substance, form part of 
the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the 
entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. 
Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the joint venture. If the joint 
venture subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes 
recognising its share of those profits only after its share 
of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of 
a joint venture is shown separately on the face of the 
statement of profit and loss and represents profit or loss 
after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries 
of the joint venture.
The financial statements of the joint venture are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its joint venture. 
At each reporting date, the Group determines whether 
there is objective evidence that the investment in joint 
venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and 
its carrying value, and then recognises the loss as ‘Share of 
profit of joint venture’ in the statement of profit and loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the joint control 
over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises 
any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference 
between the carrying amount of the joint venture upon 
loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair 
value of the retained investment and proceeds from 
disposal is recognised in profit or loss

(d)	 Foreign currencies:
The functional currency of the Group is determined on 
the basis of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates. The functional currency and presentation 
currency of the Group is Indian National Rupee (INR). 
The Group's financial statements are presented in INR. 
For each entity, the Group determines the functional 
currency and items included in the financial statements 
of each entity are measured using that functional currency. 
The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and 
on disposal of a foreign operation the gain or loss that is 
reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises 
from using this method.
	
(i)	
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective 
functional currency spot rates at the date the 
transaction first qualifies for recognition. However, for 
practical reasons, the Group uses average rate if the 
average approximates the actual rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss exception 
to the following:
-	
Extent of exchange differences which are 
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on 
foreign currency borrowings that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost 
of assets.
-	
Exchange differences arising on monetary 
items that forms part of a reporting entity’s 
net investment in a foreign operation are 
recognised in profit or loss in the separate 
financial statements of the reporting entity or 
the individual financial statements of the foreign 
operation, as appropriate. In the financial 
statements that include the foreign operation 
and the reporting entity (e.g., consolidated 
financial statements when the foreign operation 
is a subsidiary), such exchange differences are 
recognised initially in OCI and accumulated 
in equity in a separate reserve, viz., Foreign 
Currency Translation Reserve. These exchange 
differences are reclassified from equity to profit 
or loss on disposal of the net investment.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented 
in the Statement of profit and loss on a net basis within 
other income or other expenses.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the 
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the 
gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation differences on items whose fair value gain or 
loss is recognised in OCI or Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income (OCI) or Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, 
respectively).
In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial 
recognition of the related asset, expense, or income 
(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on 
which the Group initially recognises the non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts 
in advance, the Group determines the transaction date for 
each payment or receipt of advance consideration.
(ii)	
Group Companies
The results and financial position of foreign operations 
(except group subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey which 
has currency of hyperinflation (refer policy described in 
note z below), none of the Group’s subsidiary and joint 
ventures has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency as follows:
-	
assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate 
at the date of that balance sheet
-	
income and expenses are translated at average 
exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the dates of 
the transactions), and
-	
all resulting exchange differences are recognised in 
other comprehensive income.

On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit and loss
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and 
of borrowings and other financial instruments designated 
as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold, 
the associated exchange differences are reclassified to 
profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at 
the closing rate. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
(e)	
Fair value measurement:
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
-	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
-	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be 
accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a 
liability is measured using the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their economic 
best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s ability 
to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the 
use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use 
of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each 
reporting period.
The Group determines the policies and procedures for 
both recurring fair value measurement, such as derivative 
instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at 
fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, such as 
assets held for distribution in discontinued operations.
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant 
assets and liabilities, if any. At each reporting date, the 
Group analyses the movements in the values of assets 
and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or 
re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting policies.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability 
and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. 
Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.

Revenue:
	
(i)	
Revenue from contracts with customers:
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised 
when control of the goods or services are transferred 
to the customer at an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the Group expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
The Group has concluded that it is principal in its 
revenue arrangements, because it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer. Revenue is measured at the amount 
of consideration which the Group expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to the customer as specified in the 
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government).
Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction 
of performance obligations and a receivable 
is recognised when it becomes unconditional. 
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-180 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
services as the case may be.
The Group does not adjust short-term advances 
received from the customer for the effects of 
significant financing component if it is expected at 
the contract inception that the promised goods or 
services will be transferred to the customer within a 
period of one year.
The disclosures of significant accounting judgments, 
estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from 
contracts with customers are provided in Note 2.3 (z).
The Group has following streams of revenue:
	
	
(1)	
Revenue from sale of goods:
If the criteria for revenue under over-a-period 
of time as mentioned below in 'revenue from 
projects' are not met, the Group recognises 
revenue at a point-in-time. The point-in-time 
is determined when the control of the goods 
or services is transferred which is determined 
based on when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership are transferred to the customer. 
Apart from this, the Group also considers its 
present right to payment, the legal title to 
the goods, inco-terms the physical possession 
and the customer acceptance in determining 
the point in time where control has been 
transferred.
The Group considers whether there are other promises in 
the contract that are separate performance obligations 
to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be 
allocated. In determining the transaction price for the 
sale of goods, the Group considers the effect of variable 
consideration, the existence of significant financing 
components, non-cash consideration, and consideration 
payable to the customer, if any.
(2)	
Revenue from projects:
In relation to Group’s revenue from manufacture and sale 
of pollution control equipment, size reduction equipment 
and pneumatic conveying systems, the equipment are 
customised based on specific customer requirements. 
Most of such revenue is derived from fixed price contracts 
and therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from 
each contract is determined by reference to those fixed 
prices. In respect of customised products based on 
specific customer requirement, each equipment/ system 
is considered as a separate performance obligation.
The Group may promise to provide distinct goods or 
services within a contract, in which case the Group 
separates the contract into more than one performance 
obligation. If a contract is separated into more than one 
performance obligation, the Group allocates the total 
transaction price to each performance obligation in an 
amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling 
prices of the promised goods or services underlying each 
performance obligation. The Group uses the expected cost 
plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling 
price of each performance obligation in case of contracts 
with more than one distinct performance obligations.
The Group assesses for the timing of revenue recognition 
in case of each distinct performance obligation. The Group 
first assesses whether the revenue can be recognized over 
a period of time if any of the following criteria is met:
-	
The customer simultaneously consumes the benefits 
as the Group performs, or
-	
The customer controls the work-in-progress, or
-	
The Group’s performance does not create an asset 
with alternative use to the Group and the Group 
has right to payment for performance completed 
till date.
The Group recognizes revenue over time as the Group’s 
performance does not create an asset with alternative use 
to the Group and the Group has right to payment for the 
performance completed till date.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
The Group uses cost-based measure of progress (or 
input method) for contracts because it best depicts 
the transfer of control to the customer which occurs 
as it incurs costs on contracts. Under the cost-based 
measure of progress, the extent of progress towards 
completion is measured based on the ratio of 
costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs 
at completion of the performance obligation. 
Revenues, including estimated profits, are recorded 
proportionally as costs are incurred.
When it becomes probable that the total contract 
costs will exceed the total contract revenue, the 
Group recognizes the expected losses from onerous 
contract as an expense immediately.

Revenue from services
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
over time by measuring the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations at 
the reporting period.

transferred to the customer. If the Group performs

before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for 
the earned consideration and are transferred to 
Trade receivables on completion of milestones and 
its related invoicing. Contract assets are subject 
to impairment assessment. Refer to accounting 
policies on impairment of financial assets in section 
r) Financial instruments – initial recognition and 
subsequent measurement.
(2)	
Trade receivables: A receivable represents the 
Group's right to an amount of consideration that 
is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is 
required before payment of the consideration is due). 
Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in Note 
2.3 (r) Financial instruments.
(3)	
Contract liabilities: A contract liability is the 
obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer 
for which the Group has received consideration in 
form of advance (or an amount of consideration is due) 
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Group transfers goods or services to the 
customer, a contract liability is recognised when the 
payment is made. Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when the Group performs the obligation 
as per the contract.
	
(ii)	
Export incentive (government grant):
Income from export incentives are accounted for on 
export of goods if the entitlements can be estimated 
with reasonable assurance and conditions precedent 
to claim are fulfilled.
	
(iii)	 Interest income:
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a 
time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial 
recognition.
	
(iv)	 Dividend income:
Dividend income from investments is recognised 
when the shareholder’s right to receive payment has 
been established (provided that it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
amount of income can be measured reliably).
	
(v)	
Other income:
Insurance claims are accounted on the basis of claims 
admitted / expected to be admitted and to the extent 
that there is no uncertainty in receiving the claims. 
Other income is recognised when it is received or 
when the right to receive payment is established.
	
(g)	 Government grants:
Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. 
When the grant or subsidy relates to revenue, it is 
recognised as income on a systematic basis in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the 
periods necessary to match them with the related 
costs, which they are intended to compensate. 
Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as 
deferred income and is allocated to the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods and 
in the proportions in which depreciation on those 
assets is charged.
(h)	 Taxes:
The tax expenses for the period comprises of current 
tax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other 
Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also 
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
(i)	
Current tax:
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Current income tax 
assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. 
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount 
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date in the country where the Group operates 
and generates taxable income.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation and considers 
whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept 
an uncertain tax treatment. The Group reflects the effect 
of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment by using 
either most likely method or expected value method, 
depending on which method predicts better resolution 
of the treatment.
(ii)	
Deferred tax:
Deferred tax is provided using the balance-sheet approach 
on temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit.
Deferred Tax Assets are recognised to the extent it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry 
forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. In assessing 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Group relies 
on the same forecast assumptions used elsewhere in the 
financial statements and in other management reports.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will 
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
-	
When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to 
equal taxable and deductible temporary differences
-	
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences (“outside-basis differences”) can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is 
settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. The carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities 
and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is recognised outside 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are 
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either 
in OCI or directly in equity.
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but 
not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, 
are recognised subsequently if new information about facts 
and circumstances change. Acquired deferred tax benefits 
recognised within the measurement period reduce goodwill 
related to that acquisition if they result from new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances existing at the 
acquisition date. If the carrying amount of goodwill is zero, any 
remaining deferred tax benefits are recognised in OCI / capital 
reserve depending on the principle explained for bargain 
purchase gains. All other acquired tax benefits realised are 
recognised in profit or loss.
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity 
which intends either to settle current tax liabilities and assets 
on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant 
amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be 
settled or recovered.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses 
whether the realisation of future tax benefits 
is sufficiently probable to recognise deferred 
tax assets. This assessment requires the use of 
significant estimates with respect to assessment 
of future taxable income. The recorded amount of 
total deferred tax assets could change if estimates 
of projected future taxable income or if changes in 
current tax regulations are enacted for any of the tax 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
(iii)	 Indirect taxes paid on acquisition of assets or on 
incurring expenses:
Expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of indirect taxes paid, except:
-	
When the tax incurred on a purchase of 
assets or services is not recoverable from the 
taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid 
is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition 
of the asset or as part of the expense item, as 
applicable.
-	
When receivables and payables are stated with 
the amount of tax included.
The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable 
to, the taxation authority is included as part of 
receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
(i)	
Property, plant and equipment and Capital work in 
progress:
	
(i)	
Recognition and measurement:
An item of property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’) is 
recognised as an asset if it is probable that the future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow 
to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
These recognition principles are applied to the costs 
incurred initially to acquire an item of PPE, to the 
pre-operative and trial run costs incurred (net of 
sales), if any, and to the costs incurred subsequently 
to add to, or to replace any part of, or service it.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, 
net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any. Cost comprises of the purchase 
price, including import duties and non-refundable 
purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates, if any, and directly attributable cost 
of bringing the item to its working condition for its 
intended use and estimated present value of costs of 
dismantling and removing the item and restoring the 
site on which it is located. Borrowing costs relating to 
acquisition of tangible assets which take substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use 
are also included to the extent they relate to the 
period till such assets are ready to be put to use. 
Cost also includes cost of replacement of part of 
plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are 
met. If significant parts of plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, then they are accounted for 
as separate items (major components) of plant and 
equipment. The Group depreciates them separately 
based on their specific useful lives.
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant 
and equipment comprises the cost of materials and 
direct labour, any other costs directly attributable 
to bringing the item to working condition for its 
intended use, and estimated costs of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site on which 
it is located. The present value of the expected cost 
for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is 
included in the cost of the respective asset if the 
recognition criteria for a provision are met. When a 
major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised 
in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment 
as a replacement if the recognition criteria are 
satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss as incurred.
Machinery spares which meet the definition of PPE 
are capitalised and depreciated over the useful life 
of the principal asset.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any 
significant part initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when 
the asset is derecognised.
Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as at the 
reporting date, are classified as capital work-in 
progress. Capital work-in progress is stated at cost, 
net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.
Advances given to acquire property, plant and 
equipment are recorded as non-current assets and 
subsequently transferred to CWIP on acquisition of 
related assets.

(ii)	
Depreciation:
(1)	
Depreciation on items of property, plant and 
equipment (except freehold land) is provided on 
the straight-line method on pro-rata basis, over the 
useful lives of assets as prescribed in Schedule – II 
of the Companies Act, 2013, except in respect of the 
following assets where, useful life of assets has been 
determined based on technical evaluation done by 
the management’s expert:
(in years)

8.0
*The above-mentioned useful lives are on a three-shift basis, 
except for vehicles.
(2)	
The Group, based on technical assessment made 
by technical expert and management estimate, 
depreciates certain items of building, plant and 
equipment over estimated useful lives which are 
different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule 
II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management 
believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic 
and reflect fair approximation of the period over 
which the assets are likely to be used.
(3)	
The Group reviews the residual value, useful lives and 
depreciation method annually and if expectations 
differ from previous estimates, the change is 
accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
on a prospective basis.
(j)	
Intangible assets and Intangible assets under 
development:
	
(i)	
Recognition and measurement:
Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition 
at cost and subsequently are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment loss, if any.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment loss.
Internally generated intangible assets arising from 
development activity are recognised at cost when the 
project is clearly defined and the costs are separately 
identified and reliably measured, on demonstration of 
technical feasibility of the project, the intention and ability 
of the Group to complete, use or sell it is demonstrated, 
adequate resources are available to complete the project 
and only if it is probable that the asset would generate 
future economic benefits. Such costs are capitalised as 
‘Technical know-how’. Otherwise, it is recognised as an 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss in the period they are incurred. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, the intangible assets are measured at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal (i.e. 
at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included 
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
asset is derecognised.
(ii)	
 Amortisation:
(1)	
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite.
(2)	
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over 
the useful economic life and assessed for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and 
the amortisation method for an intangible asset with 
a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end 
of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption 
of future economic benefits embodied in the asset 
are considered to modify the amortisation period or 
method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes 
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense 
on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value 
of another asset.

(3)	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, 
either individually or at the cash-generating unit 
level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the change 
in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a 
prospective basis.
(iii)	 Research and development costs
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as and when 
incurred. Development expenditures on an individual 
project are recognised as an intangible asset when the 
Group can demonstrate:
-	
The technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale
-	
Its intention to complete and its ability and intention 
to use or sell the asset
-	
How the asset will generate future economic benefits
-	
The availability of resources to complete the asset
-	
The ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development
A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies applied 
to the Group's other intangible assets to the extent of 
depreciable amount is as follows:

For acquired Technical Know-How in business combination 
transaction, management has considered 10 years as 
useful life.
	
(i)	
Capital work in progress (“CWIP”):
(1)	
Projects under commissioning and other CWIP 
items are carried at cost, comprising direct 
costs, related incidental expenses and eligible 
borrowing costs, if any.
(2)	
Advances given to acquire property, plant and 
equipment are recorded as non-current assets 
and subsequently transferred to CWIP on 
acquisition of related assets.
(k)	
Borrowing costs:
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including 
exchange differences relating to foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an 
adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection 
with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly 
attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset 
which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get 
ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the 
cost of that asset till the date the asset is ready for intended 
use. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended and 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
during extended period when active development activity 
on the qualifying asset is suspended. Other borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
they are incurred. All other borrowing costs are charged 
to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the 
period for which they are incurred.
(l)	
Leases:
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset 
for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
	
Group as a lessee:
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities representing obligations to make lease payments 
and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
	
(i)	
Right-of-use assets:
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the 
amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term 
and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Type of Asset
Useful Life estimated by 
management (years)
Leasehold Land
1 to 95 years
Building
1 to 15 years
Plant & Machinery (IT 
Equipment’s)
1 to 8 years
Vehicles
2 to 4 years
328
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at 
the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. 
Refer to the accounting policies in section (r) Impairment 
of non-financial assets.
	
Sale and leaseback
When the Group (seller-lessee) sells an asset to another 
entity (buyer-lessor) and leases it back from the 
buyer-lessor, the Group determines if the transaction 
qualifies as a sale under Ind AS 115 or whether the 
transaction is a collateralised borrowing.
A sale and leaseback qualify as a sale if the buyer-lessor 
obtains control of the underlying asset. The Group 
measures a right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback 
as the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the 
asset that relates to the right-of-use retained. The gain / 
(loss) that the Group recognises is limited to the proportion 
of the total gain / (loss) that relates to the rights transferred 
to the buyer-lessor.
Any difference between the sale consideration and the 
fair value of the asset is either a prepayment of lease 
payments (if the purchase price is below market terms) 
or an additional financing (if the purchase price is above 
market terms), and this is applied if the lease payments are 
not at market rates.
If the transfer does not qualify as a sale under Ind AS 115, 
the Group does not derecognise the transferred asset, and 
it accounts for the cash received as a financial liability.
(ii)	
Lease liabilities:
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. 
The lease payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an 
index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include 
the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain 
to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for 
terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or 
a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred 
to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, 
the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the interest rate 
implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced 
for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying 
amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine such 
lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying asset.
(iii)	 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets:
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the 
commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be 
low value (i.e. C 500,000). Lease payments on short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
	
Group as a lessor:
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset 
are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms 
and is included in other income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Initial direct costs incurred 
in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period 
in which they are earned.
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from 
the Group to the lessee. Amounts due from lessees under 
finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Group’s 
net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is 
allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant 
periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding 
in respect of the lease.
(m)	 Inventories:
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present 
location and condition are accounted for as follows:

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
-	
Raw materials, stores and spares and packing 
material: cost includes cost of purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition. Cost is determined 
on weighted average basis.
-	
Finished goods and work in progress: cost includes 
cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion 
of manufacturing overheads based on the normal 
operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs. 
Cost is determined on weighted average basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to 
make the sale.
(n)	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's 
recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is 
the higher of an assets or cash-generating unit's (CGU) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or group 
of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly 
traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecasts calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the 
individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. 
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated 
and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth 
year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods 
covered by the most recent budgets / forecasts, the Group 
extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a 
steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, 
unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, 
this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate for the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the entity operates, or for the market 
in which the asset is used.
Impairment losses of continuing operations including 
impairment on inventories, are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
For the assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised impairment losses no 
longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the 
Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. 
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the assumptions used to 
determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last 
impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed 
either its recoverable amount, or the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in 
prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as 
a revaluation increase.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31st March 
and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. If impairment exists, it is determined for 
goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each 
CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. 
When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than 
it’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill, if booked, cannot 
be reversed in future periods.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually as at 31st March at the CGU level, as 
appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
(o)	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets:
	
(i)	
Provisions:
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation. When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, 
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is 
330
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented in the statement 
of Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss net of 
any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are discounted using a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is 
used, the increase in the provision due to the passage 
of time is recognised as a finance cost.
	
Decommissioning Liability
Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value 
of expected costs to settle the obligation using estimated 
cash flows and are recognized as part of the cost of 
the particular asset. The unwinding of the discount is 
expensed as incurred and recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss as a finance cost. The estimated future costs 
of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted 
as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future costs or in 
the discount rate applied are added to or deducted from 
the cost of the asset.
	
Provision for Onerous Contract
If the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present 
obligation under the contract is recognized and measured 
as a provision. However, before a separate provision for an 
onerous contract is established, the Group recognizes any 
impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to 
that contract. An onerous contract is a contract under 
which the unavoidable costs (i.e., the costs that the Group 
cannot avoid because it has the contract) of meeting the 
obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable 
costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting 
from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling 
it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to 
fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs 
that relate directly to the contract (i.e., both incremental 
costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract 
activities).
(ii)	
Contingent liability Contingent liability is:
(a)	
possible obligation arising from past events and 
whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control 
of the entity or
(b)	
a present obligation that arises from past events but 
is not recognized because;
-	
it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation or
-	
the amount of the obligation cannot be 
measured with sufficient reliability.
The Group does not recognize a contingent liability 
but discloses the same as per the requirements of 
Ind AS 37. The cases which have been determined as 
remote by the Group have not been disclosed.
A contingent liability recognised in a business 
combination is initially measured at its fair value. 
Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the 
amount that would be recognised in accordance 
with the requirements for provisions above or the 
amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, 
cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance 
with the requirements for revenue recognition.
	
(iii)	 Contingent asset
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from 
past events and whose existence will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the 
control of the entity. The Group does not recognize 
the contingent asset in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised. However, when 
the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the 
related asset is not a contingent asset and the Group 
recognise such assets.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent 
assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.
(p)	 Post-employment and other employee benefits:
	
(i)	
Short-term employee benefits:
The distinction between short-term and long-term 
employee benefits is based on expected timing of 
settlement rather than the employee’s entitlement 
benefits. All employee benefits payable within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as 
short-term benefits. Such benefits include salaries, 
wages, bonus, short-term compensated absences, 
awards, ex-gratia, performance pay etc. and are 
recognised in the period in which the employee 
renders the related service. A liability is recognised 
at an undiscounted value for the amount expected 
to be paid e.g., under short-term cash bonus, if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service provided 
by the employee, and the amount of obligation can 
be estimated reliably.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
(ii)	
Post-employment benefits:
	
(1)	
Defined contribution plans:
The contributions to provident fund and 
superannuation schemes are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss during 
the period in which the employee renders the related 
service. The Group has no further obligations under 
these schemes beyond its periodic contributions.
	
(2)	
Defined benefit plans:
The Group operates two defined benefit plans for its 
employees, viz. gratuity, and pension. The present 
value of the obligation under such defined benefit 
plans is determined based on an independent 
actuarial valuation using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method as at the date of the Balance Sheet. 
The fair value of plan asset is reduced from the 
gross obligation under the defined benefit plans, to 
recognise the obligation on a net basis.
Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains 
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding 
amounts included in net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability and the return on plan assets 
(excluding amounts included in net interest on the net 
defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately 
in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit 
or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the 
period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on 
the earlier of:
-	
The date of the plan amendment or 
curtailment, and
-	
The date that the Group recognises related 
restructuring costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
The Group recognises the following changes in the 
net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss:
-	
Service costs comprising current service 
costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on 
curtailments and non-routine settlements; and
-	
Net interest expense or income.
-	
Re-measurement
The Group presents the first two components of 
defined benefit costs in Statement of profit and 
loss in the line item ‘Employee benefits expense’. 
Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as 
past service costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the 
Balance sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus 
resulting from this calculation is limited to the 
present value of any economic benefits available in 
the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in 
future contributions to the plans.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at 
the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw 
the offer of the termination benefit and when the 
entity recognises any related restructuring costs.
	
(3)	
Compensated absences:
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized 
within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term 
employee benefit. The Group measures the expected 
cost of such absences as the additional amount that it 
expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated at the reporting date. 
The Group recognizes expected cost of short-term 
employee benefit as an expense, when an employee 
renders the related service.
The Group treats accumulated leave expected to be 
carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term 
employee benefit for measurement purposes. 
Such long-term compensated absences are provided 
for based on the actuarial valuation using the 
projected unit credit method at the reporting date. 
Actuarial gains / losses are immediately taken to 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and 
are not deferred. The obligations are presented as 
current liabilities in the Balance Sheet if the entity 
does not have an unconditional right to defer the 
settlement for at least twelve months after the 
reporting date.
(q)	 Share based payments:
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group 
receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services as consideration for 
equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model. Further details are given 
in note 46.
332
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and / or service 
conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting 
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or 
credit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for 
a period represents the movement in cumulative expense 
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and 
is recognised in employee benefits expense.
Service and non-market performance conditions are not 
taken into account when determining the grant date 
fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions 
being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate 
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest. Market performance conditions are reflected 
within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions 
attached to an award, but without an associated service 
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. 
Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of 
an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an 
award unless there are also service and / or performance 
conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest because non-market performance and / or service 
conditions have not been met. Where awards include a 
market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are 
treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance and / or service conditions are satisfied.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair 
value of the unmodified award, provided the original 
vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, 
measured as at the date of modification, is recognised 
for any modification that increases the total fair value 
of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise 
beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by 
the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element 
of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately 
through Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
(r)	
Financial instruments:
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
	
(i)	
Financial assets:
	
(1)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component 
or for which the Group has applied the practical 
expedient, the Group initially measures a financial 
asset at amortised cost, fair value through fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair 
value through profit or loss. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets, which are not at fair value through 
profit or loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial 
recognition. Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component or for which 
the Group has applied the practical expedient are 
measured at the transaction price determined under 
Ind AS 115. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 
2.3 (f) Revenue from contracts with customers.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require 
delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., 
the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and 
measured at amortised cost or fair value through 
OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the 
principal amount outstanding. This assessment is 
referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows 
that are not SPPI are classified and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the 
business model.
The Group’s business model for managing financial 
assets refers to how it manages its financial assets 
in order to generate cash flows. The business 
model determines whether cash flows will result 
from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the 
financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified 
and measured at amortised cost are held within a 
business model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while 
financial assets classified and measured at fair value 
through OCI are held within a business model with 
the objective of both holding to collect contractual 
cash flows and selling.

(2)	
Subsequent measurement:
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in four categories:
-	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
-	
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
-	
Financial assets designated at fair value through 
other comprehensive income with no recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition 
(equity instruments)
-	
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)
	
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments):
A ‘financial asset’ is measured at the amortised cost if both 
the following conditions are met:
(a)	
The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
(b)	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.
This category is the most relevant to the Group. After initial 
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income 
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. This category 
generally applies to trade and other receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVTOCI) (debt instruments):
A ‘financial asset’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the 
following criteria are met:
(a)	
The objective of the business model is achieved both 
by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the 
financial assets, and
(b)	
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. For debt instruments, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, interest income, foreign 
exchange revaluation and impairment losses or reversals 
are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss and computed in the same manner as for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair 
value changes are recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, 
the cumulative fair value changes recognised in OCI is 
reclassified from the equity to Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
The Group’s debt instruments at fair value through OCI 
includes investments in quoted debt instruments included 
under other non-current financial assets.
Financial assets designated at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (equity instruments):
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify 
irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through other comprehensive 
income when they meet the definition of equity under 
Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments - Presentation and are 
not held for trading. The classification is determined on 
an instrument-by-instrument basis. Equity instruments 
which are held for trading and contingent consideration 
recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to 
which Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled 
to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss when the right of payment has been 
established, except when the Group benefits from such 
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. 
Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI 
are not subject to impairment assessment. The Group 
has not elected to classify irrevocably any of its equity 
investments under this category.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL):
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes 
in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
This category includes derivative instruments and 
listed equity investments which the Group had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through other 
comprehensive income. Interest earned on instruments

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
designated at FVTPL is accrued in interest income, using 
the EIR, taking into account any discount/ premium and 
qualifying transaction costs being an integral part of 
instrument. Interest earned on assets mandatorily required 
to be measured at FVTPL is recorded using the contractual 
interest rate.
	
Derecognition:
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognised when:
(a)	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
(b)	
The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
(b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the 
asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. 
In that case, the Group also recognises an associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability 
are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Group has retained.
(3)	
Impairment of financial assets:
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses ‘Expected 
Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of 
financial assets other than those measured at Fair Value 
Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected Credit Losses are 
measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
-	
The 12-months expected credit losses (expected 
credit losses that result from those default events on 
the financial instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or
-	
Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit 
losses that result from all possible default events over 
the life of the financial instrument).
For trade receivables, the Group applies ‘simplified 
approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be 
recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. 
The Group uses historical default rates to determine 
impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. 
At all reporting date these historical default rates are 
reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed.
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk 
but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime 
ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a 
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to 
the debtors and the economic environment.
For other assets, the Group uses 12 month Expected 
Credit Loss to provide for impairment loss where there is 
no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant 
increase in credit risk full lifetime Expected Credit Loss 
is used. A financial asset is written off when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual 
cash flows.
(ii)	
Financial liabiliti es and equity instruments:
	
(1)	
Classification as debt or equity
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. The Group 
classifies a financial instrument issued by it as equity 
instrument only if below conditions are met:
The instrument neither includes contractual 
obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset 
to another entity, nor it includes any obligation to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another entity under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the issuer.
If the instrument will or may be settled in the 
Group’s own equity instruments, it is non-derivative 
instrument that includes no contractual obligation 
for the Group to deliver a variable number of 
its own equity instruments. If the instrument is 
derivative, then it should be settled only by the 
Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another 
financial asset for a fixed number of its own equity 
instruments.
All other instruments are classified as financial 
liability and accounted for using the accounting 
policy applicable to the Financial Liabilities.

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
(2)	
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial liabilities are recognised at fair value and 
in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. 
Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other 
payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial 
instruments. Equity instruments issued by the Group 
are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs.
(3)	
Subsequent measurement:
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial 
liabilities are classified in two categories:
-	
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
-	
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and 
borrowings)
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL):
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair 
value through profit or loss. The Group has not designated 
any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and 
borrowings)
This is the category most relevant to the Group. 
Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. For trade and other 
payables maturing within one year from the balance 
sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
due to the short maturity of these instruments. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss 
when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
EIR amortisation process. The EIR amortisation is included 
as finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss. For more information refer Note 32.
(4)	
Derecognition:
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, 
such an exchange or modification is treated as the 
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
	
	
(5)	
Reclassification of financial assets:
The Group determines classification of financial 
assets and liabilities on initial recognition. 
After initial recognition, no reclassification 
is made for financial assets which are 
equity instruments and financial liabilities. 
For financial assets which are debt instruments, 
a reclassification is made only if there is a 
change in the business model for managing 
those assets. Changes to the business model 
are expected to be infrequent. The Group’s 
senior management determines change in 
the business model as a result of external or 
internal changes which are significant to the 
Group’s operations. Such changes are evident 
to external parties. A change in the business 
model occurs when the Group either begins or 
ceases to perform an activity that is significant 
to its operations. If the Group reclassifies 
financial assets, it applies the reclassification 
prospectively from the reclassification date 
which is the first day of the immediately next 
reporting period following the change in 
business model. The Group does not restate any 
previously recognised gains, losses (including 
impairment gains or losses) or interest.
	
(iii)	 Offsetting of financial instruments:
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to 
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously.
(s)	
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting:
	
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
The Group uses various derivative financial instruments 
such as forwards, interest rate swaps and currency swaps 
to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates and 
exchange rates. At the inception of a hedge relationship, 
the Group formally designates and documents the 
hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply 
hedge accounting and the risk management objective 
and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are also subsequently measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair 
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative.
336
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are taken directly to the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the effective 
portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income and later to the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss, when the hedged item 
affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment if 
a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial 
liability.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are 
classified as:
(a)	
Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability or an unrecognised firm commitment
(b)	
Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to 
variability in cash flows that is either attributable to 
a particular risk associated with a recognised asset 
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction 
or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm 
commitment
(c)	
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the 
Group formally designates and documents the 
hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to 
apply hedge accounting and the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identification of the 
hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of 
the risk being hedged, and how the Group will assess 
whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge 
effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of 
sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge 
ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies 
for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following 
effectiveness requirements:
- 	
There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument.
- 	
The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the 
value changes’ that result from that economic 
relationship.
- 	
The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is 
the same as that resulting from the quantity of 
the hedged item that the Group actually hedges 
and the quantity of the hedging instrument that 
the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity 
of hedged item.
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are 
accounted for as follows:
	
Fair value hedge:
The Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative 
financial assets / liabilities as hedging instruments to 
mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item 
due to movement in interest rates and exchange rates. 
Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and 
hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value 
hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets 
the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the 
carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective 
interest method is used is amortized to the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.
	
Cash flow hedge:
The Group designates derivative contracts or 
non-derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates for exchange exposure 
on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a 
recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions. 
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair 
value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow 
hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive 
Income. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair 
value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Refer to Note 
50 for more details.
If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is 
sold / terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow 
hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective 
remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying 
transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred 
to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the 
occurrence of the underlying transaction. If the forecasted 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount 
accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
cash and cash equivalents as explained above comprises 
of earmarked balances of unclaimed dividends, funds for 
open offer made under Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) 
Regulations, 2011, and short-term deposits with original 
maturity of three months or more. These items are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above 
which are considered as integral part of the Group’s cash 
management.
(u)	 Dividends:
The Group recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity 
holders of the Group when the distribution is authorised, 
and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the 
Group. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. 
A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.
(v)	
Earnings per share:
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net 
profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders 
of the Group by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the period. The weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus 
element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split 
(consolidation of shares) that have changed the number 
of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding 
change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per 
share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects 
of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(w)	 Events after the reporting date:
If the Group receives information after the reporting 
period, but prior to the date of approved for issue, about 
conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, 
it will assess whether the information affects the amounts 
that it recognises in its consolidated financial statements. 
The Group will adjust the amounts recognised in its 
financial statements to reflect any adjusting events after 
the reporting period and update the disclosures that 
relate to those conditions in light of the new information. 
For non-adjusting events after the reporting period, the 
Group will not change the amounts recognised in its 
consolidated financial statements, but will disclose the 
nature of the non-adjusting event and an estimate of 
its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate 
cannot be made, if applicable.
(x)	
Segment reporting:
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The Board of Directors of the Group has 
identified the Managing Director as the chief operating 
decision maker of the Group.
(y)	
Rounding-off of amounts:
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and 
notes have been rounded off to nearest lakhs, with one 
decimal, as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless 
otherwise stated.
(z)	
Hyperinflation
The financial statements of the Group entities whose 
functional currencies are the currencies of hyperinflationary 
economies are adjusted in terms of the measuring unit 
current at the end of the reporting period (Refer note 52).
	
(aa)	 Climate-related matters:
The Group considers climate-related matters in 
estimates and assumptions, where appropriate. 
This assessment includes a wide range of possible 
impacts on the Group due to both physical and 
transition risks. Even though the Group believes 
its business model and products will still be viable 
after the transition to a low-carbon economy, 
climate-related matters increase the uncertainty in 
estimates and assumptions underpinning several 
items in the financial statements. Even though 
climate-related risks might not currently have a 
significant impact on measurement, the Group 
is closely monitoring relevant changes and 
developments, such as new climate-related 
legislation. The items and considerations that 
are most directly impacted by climate-related 
matters are:
(i)	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment: 
When reviewing the residual values and 
expected useful lives of assets, the Group 
considers climate-related matters, such as 
climate-related legislation and regulations 
that may restrict the use of assets or require 
significant capital expenditures.
(ii)	
Impairment of non-financial assets: The Group 
assesses whether climate risks, including 
physical risks and transition risks could have a 
significant impact. If so, these risks are included 
in the cash-flow forecasts in assessing value-in-
use amounts.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
(bb)	 New and amended standards:
The Group applied for the first-time certain standards 
and amendments, which are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1st April 2024. The Group has not 
early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment 
that has been issued but is not yet effective.
	
i.	
IND AS 117 Insurance Contracts
The Ministry of corporate Affairs (MCA) notified the 
Ind AS 117, Insurance Contracts, vide notification 
dated 12 August 2024, under the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2024, 
which is effective from annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts is a comprehensive 
new accounting standard for insurance contracts 
covering recognition and measurement, presentation 
and disclosure. Ind AS 117 replaces Ind AS 104 
Insurance Contracts. Ind AS 117 applies to all types of 
insurance contracts, regardless of the type of entities 
that issue them as well as to certain guarantees and 
financial instruments with discretionary participation 
features; a few scope exceptions will apply. Ind AS 
117 is based on a general model, supplemented by:
-	
A specific adaptation for contracts with 
direct participation features (the variable 
fee approach)
-	
A simplified approach (the premium allocation 
approach) mainly for short-duration contracts
The application of Ind AS 117 has no significant 
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
ii.	
Amendment to IND AS 116 Leases – Lease liability 
in a sale and leaseback
The MCA notified the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Second Amendment Rules, 2024, which 
amend Ind AS 116, Leases, with respect to Lease 
Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.
The amendment specifies the requirements that 
a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability 
arising in a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure 
the seller-lessee does not recognise any amount 
of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use 
it retains.
The amendment is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2024 and must 
be applied retrospectively to sale and leaseback 
transactions entered into after the date of initial 
application of Ind AS 116.
The amendment does not have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements.
	
Standards notified but not yet effective
There are no standards that are notified and not yet 
effective as on the date.
(cc)	 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions:
The preparation of the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, 
and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure 
of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that 
require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of 
assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the 
year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that year, or in the year of the revision and future year, 
if the revision affects current and future year.
Other disclosures relating to the Group’s exposure to risks 
and uncertainties includes:
-	
Financial risk management objectives and 
policies Note 43.
-	
Sensitivity analyses disclosures Notes 38, 43(A) and 50.
-	
Capital management Note 43.
	
Use of significant judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, which 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements:
(i)	
Determining the lease term of contracts with 
renewal and termination options – Group as a 
lessee:
The Group determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it 
is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods 
covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is 
reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group has several lease contracts that include 
extension and termination options. The Group applies 
judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably 
certain whether or not to exercise the option to 
Sudarshan Chemical Industries Limited

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all 
relevant factors that create an economic incentive 
for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. 
After the commencement date, the Group reassesses 
the lease term if there is a significant event or change 
in circumstances that is within its control and affects 
its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to 
renew or to terminate (e.g., construction of significant 
leasehold improvements or significant customisation 
to the leased asset).
Refer Note 5 for information on potential future 
rental payments relating to periods following the 
exercise date of extension and termination options 
that are not included in the lease term.
	
Estimates and assumptions:
The key assumptions concerning the future and other 
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, are described 
below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates 
on parameters available when the ﬁnancial statements 
were prepared. Existing circumstances and ass umptions 
about future developments, however, may change due to 
market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond 
the control of the Group. Such changes are reﬂected in the 
assumptions when they occur.
	
(i)	
Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations and intangible assets 
Business combinations are accounted for using 
Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 
requires the identifiable intangible assets and 
contingent consideration to be fair valued in order 
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. 
Significant estimates are required to be made in 
determining the value of contingent consideration 
and intangible assets. These valuations are conducted 
by independent valuation experts. Refer note 50 & 51.
(ii)	
Estimating the incremental borrowing rate to 
measure lease liabilities
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate 
implicit in the lease; therefore, it uses its incremental 
borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. 
The IBR is the rate of interest that the Group would 
have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a 
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset 
of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects 
what the Group ‘would have to pay’, which requires 
estimation when no observable rates are available. 
The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs 
(such as market interest rates) when available and 
is required to make certain entity-specific estimates 
(such as the credit rating).
(iii)	 Useful life and residual value of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets:
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant 
proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge 
in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after 
determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful 
life and the expected residual value at the end of its 
life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
are determined by management at the time the asset 
is acquired and reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period. The lives are based on historical experience 
with similar assets as well as anticipation of future 
events, which may impact their life, such as changes 
in technology. Consequently, the future depreciation 
charge could be revised and may have an impact on 
profit for future years. The policy for the same has 
been explained in notes 2.3 (h) and 2.3 (i).
(iv)	 Recognition of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts, except when the deferred 
income tax arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of 
the transaction, at the rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is 
dependent upon the generation of future taxable 
profits during the periods in which those temporary 
differences and tax loss carry forwards become 
deductible. The Group considers the expected 
reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected 
future taxable income in making this assessment. 
The amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realisable, however, could be reduced in the near 
term if estimates of future taxable income during the 
carry-forward period are reduced. The policy for the 
same has been explained under Note 2.3 (f).
340
Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of 
complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the 
amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the 
nature of business differences arising between the actual 
results and the assumptions made, or future changes to 
such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments 
to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group 
establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates. 
The amount of such provisions is based on various 
factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and 
differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable 
entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences 
of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues 
depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective 
domicile of the companies.
Valuation of recoverable income tax assets especially with 
respect to deferred tax assets on tax loss carry forwards. 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous 
jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in 
determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. 
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit 
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will 
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is 
different from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the current and deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such 
determination is made.
(v)	
Defined benefit obligation:
The cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt gratuity plan, other 
deﬁned beneﬁt plan and other post-employment plans 
are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial 
valuation involves making various assumptions that may 
diﬀer from actual developments in the future. These include 
the determination of the discount rate, future salary 
increases, expected returns on plan assets and mortality 
rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and 
its long-term nature, a deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. 
In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans 
operated in India, the management considers the interest 
rates of government bonds where remaining maturity of 
such bond correspond to expected term of defined benefit 
obligation.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality 
tables for respective countries. Those mortality tables tend 
to change only at interval in response to demographic 
changes. Future salary increases, discount rate and return 
on planned assets are based on expected future inﬂation 
rates for respective countries. Further details about deﬁned 
beneﬁt plans are given in Note 2.3 (o).
(vi)	 Impairment of non-financial assets:
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's 
recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is 
the higher of an assets or Cash Generating Unit's (CGU's) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. It is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset or CGU 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash 
ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risks speciﬁc to the asset. 
In determining the fair value less costs to disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. If no such 
transactions can be identiﬁed, an appropriate valuation 
model is used. These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples or other available fair value indicators. 
The policy for the same has been explained under 
Note 2.3 (m).
(vii)	 Impairment of ﬁnancial assets:
The impairment provisions for ﬁnancial assets are based on 
assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. 
The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions 
and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on Group's past history, existing market conditions 
as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each 
reporting period. Further, the Group also evaluates risk 
with respect to expected loss on account of loss in time 
value of money which is calculated using average cost of 
capital for relevant ﬁnancial assets.
The Group reviews its carrying value of investments 
carried at cost annually, or more frequently when there 
is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount 
is less than it carrying amount, the impairment loss is 
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, 
the carrying amount of the Investment is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the cost of the 
Investment. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. 
The policy for the same has been explained in Note 2.3 (q) 
Financial Instruments.

(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
(viii)	 Provision for inventory obsolescence:
The Group identifies slow and non-moving stock of all 
inventories on an ongoing basis. These materials are then 
classified based on their expected quality parameters to 
determine the possibility of utilisation / liquidation of 
these materials. Based on this study, a provision for slow 
and non-moving inventory is created.
(ix)	 Share based payment:
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions 
requires determination of the most appropriate valuation 
model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions 
of the grant. This estimate also requires determination 
of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model 
including the expected life of the share option, volatility 
and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. 
For the measurement of the fair value of equity-settled 
transactions with employees at the grant date, the Group 
uses the Black-Scholes model. The assumptions and 
models used for estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions are disclosed in Note 51.
(x)	
Litigation:
The Group has various ongoing litigations, the outcome of 
which may have a material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial position, 
results of operations or cashﬂows. The Group's legal team 
regularly analyses current information about these matters 
and assesses the requirement for provision for probable 
losses including estimates of legal expense to resolve such 
matters. In making the decision regarding the need for 
loss provision, the management considers the degree of 
probability of an unfavourable outcome and the ability to 
make suﬃciently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. 
The ﬁling of a lawsuit or formal assertion of a claim against 
the Group or the disclosure of any such suit or assertions, 
does not automatically indicate that a provision of a loss 
may be appropriate.
Considering the facts on hand and the current stage of 
certain ongoing litigations the Group foresees a remote risk 
of any material claim arising from claims against the Group. 
The Management has exercised signiﬁcant judgement in 
assessing the impact, if any, on the disclosures in respect 
of litigations in relation to the Group.
(xi)	 Determination of timing of satisfaction of performance 
obligation:
For revenue recognised at a point in time, the Group 
has applied judgement in determining the point in time 
when the control of the goods are transferred based on 
the criteria mentioned in the standard read along with the 
contract with customers, applicable laws and considering 
the industry practices. The goods manufactured by the 
Group are on the basis of the open purchase order as on 
date and the order expected to be received. Further, the 
goods are dispatched as per the terms mentioned in the 
purchase order.
For revenue recognised over a period of time, at each 
reporting date, the Group is required to estimate costs 
to complete on fixed-price contracts. Estimating costs to 
complete on such contracts requires the Group to make 
estimates of future costs to be incurred, based on work to 
be performed beyond the reporting date. This estimate 
will impact revenues, cost of sales, work-in-progress, 
billings in excess of costs, estimated earnings, and accrued 
contract expenses.
(xii)	 Fair value measurement of financial instruments:
When the fair values of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the Balance Sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their 
fair value is measured using different valuation techniques 
including the DCF model. The inputs to these models are 
taken from observable markets where possible, but where 
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in 
establishing fair values. Judgements and estimates include 
considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk 
and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors 
could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. 
Refer note 50 and 51 for further disclosures.
(xiii)	Climate – related matters
The Group considers climate-related matters in estimates 
and assumptions, where appropriate. This assessment 
includes a wide range of possible impacts on the Group 
due to both physical and transition risks. Even though the 
Group believes its business model and products will still 
be viable after the transition to a low-carbon economy, 
climate-related matters increase the uncertainty in 
estimates and assumptions underpinning several items 
in the financial statements. Even though climate-related 
risks might not currently have a significant impact on 
measurement, the Group is closely monitoring relevant 
changes and developments, such as new climate-related 
legislation. The items and considerations that are most 
directly impacted by climate-related matters are: - Useful 
life of property, plant and equipment. When reviewing 
the residual values and expected useful lives of assets, 
the Group considers climate-related matters, such as 
climate-related legislation and regulations that may 
restrict the use of assets or require significant capital 
expenditures.

Goodwill on acquisition of business of Rieco Industries Limited -
	
Goodwill of ₹ 684.4 lakhs (Previous year: ₹ 684.4 lakhs) relates to the CGU - Engineering Equipments Business (refer note 47).  The 
estimated value in use of the CGU is based on future cash flows assuming an annual terminal growth rate of 5% for the period 
subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and a discount rate of 25% which considers the operating and macroeconomic 
environment in which the entity operates. An analysis of the sensitivity of the change in key parameters (operating margin, 
discount rates and long term average growth rate) based on reasonably probable assumptions, did not result in any probable 
scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below the carrying amount. The discount rate was 
estimated based on past experience and Holding Company's weighted average cost of capital. The values assigned to the 
key assumptions represent the management's assessment of future trends in the industry and based on both internal and 
external factors.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
E. 	
There are no projects whose completion is overdue or have exceeded their cost compared to original plan.
F.	
Refer Note 44 for additions on account of business combination.
G.	
On transition to Ind AS (i.e. 1st April, 2016), the Holding Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all intangible 
assets measured as per the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of intangible assets.

RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES
	
Group as a lessee
	
The Group has lease contracts for various items of building, land, plant & machinery (IT equipment) and vehicles used in its 
operations. Leases of building generally have lease terms between 1 and 15 years, certain plant & machinery (IT equipment) 
have lease term of 1 to 8 years and vehicle have lease term of 2 to 4 years. Leasehold land pertains to upfront payments and 
hence have longer lease terms upto 99 years with no corresponding leasehold liabilities. The Group’s obligations under 
its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension and 
termination options and variable lease payments. The Group also has certain leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months 
or less and leases of office equipment with low value. The Group applies the ‘short-term lease’ and ‘lease of low-value assets’ 
recognition exemptions for such leases.

Description of nature and purpose of each reserve

Capital reserve
Capital reserve includes surplus on re-issue of shares made in the financial year 1996-97 amounting to ₹ 0.4 Lakhs and 
capital reserve generated on account of bargain purchase arising through business combination. The reserve is not 
available for distribution.
	
(b)	 Capital redemption reserve
Capital redemption reserve is created pursuant to redemption of Preference Share Capital (₹ 400.0 Lakhs) in the Financial 
Year 2013-14 and buy-back of Equity Shares (₹ 10.0 Lakhs) in the Financial Year 2006-07.
*During the previous year, Capital redemption reserve amounting to ₹ 400.0 Lakhs has been reclassified to Retained 
earnings as per regulatory requirements.

such as issuance of bonus shares and adjustment on account of transaction costs in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act, 2013.
	
(d)	 General reserve
Under the erstwhile Companies Act 1956, general reserve was created through an annual transfer of net income at a 
specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations. The purpose of these transfers was to ensure that if a 
dividend distribution in a given year is more than 10% of the paid-up capital of the Company for that year, then the total

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025

dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year. Consequent to introduction of Companies 
Act 2013, the requirement to mandatorily transfer a specified percentage of the net profit to general reserve has been 
withdrawn. However, the amount previously transferred to the general reserve can be utilised only in accordance with 
the specific requirements of Companies Act, 2013. 
	
(e)	 Foreign currency translation reserve
For the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated

value of designated portion of hedging instruments entered into for cash flow hedges. Such gains or losses will be 
reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction occurs (refer note 
43 and 48).

38	 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
A	
Defined Contribution Schemes
	
The Group deposits an amount determined at a fixed percentage of basic pay every month to the State administered Provident 
Fund, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and other funds for the benefit of the employees. Accordingly, the Group's contribution 
during the year that has been recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss amounts to ₹ 3,060.5 Lakhs (31st March, 
2024 : ₹ 1,161.1 Lakhs).
B	
Defined Benefit Plans of the Group
	
I Gratuity
	
Funded Scheme : 
	
The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan for its employees and every employee who has completed five years of service is 
entitled to specific benefit. The level of benefits provided depends on the employee's length of service and salary at retirement age. 
An employee who has completed five years or more of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary (last drawn) for each 
completed year of service. The scheme is funded with insurance companies in the form of qualifying insurance policies. The Group 
accounts for liability of such future benefits based on an independent actuarial valuation on projected accrued credit method 
carried out for assessing the liability as on the reporting date.	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Risk exposure and asset-liability matching
	
Provision of a defined benefit scheme poses certain risks, as the Group takes on uncertain long term obligations to make future 
benefit payments.

Sensitivity analysis indicates the influence of a reasonable change in certain significant assumptions on the outcome of the 
Present value of obligation and aids in understanding the uncertainty of reported amounts. Sensitivity analysis is done by 
varying one parameter at a time and studying its impact.
	
Sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumptions namely discount rate and salary assumptions have been shown 
in the table above at the end of the reporting period, showing how the defined benefit obligation would have been affected 
by the changes.	
	
The method used to calculate the liability in these scenarios is by keeping all the other parameters and the data same as in 
the base liability calculation except the parameters to be stressed.
	
There is no change in the method from the previous period and the points /percentage by which the assumptions are stressed 
are same to that in the previous year
	
The assumptions for mortality and attrition do not have a significant impact on the liability, hence are not considered a 
significant actuarial assumption for the purpose of sensitivity analysis.

Risk Exposure
	
The gratuity scheme is a salary Defined Benefit Plan that provides for lump sum payment made on exit either by way of 
retirement, death, disability or voluntary withdrawal. The benefits are defined on the basis of final salary and the period of 
service and paid as lump sum at exit. The plan design means the risk commonly affecting the liabilities and the financial results 
are expected to be:
	
(a)	
Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds, if bond 
yield fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(b)	
Salary inflation risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation.
(c) 	 Demographic risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality, 
withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on the defined benefit obligation is not straight 
forward and depends upon the combination of salary increase, discount rate and vesting criteria.
	
The following is the maturity profile of undiscounted defined benefit obligation:

Sensitivity analysis indicates the influence of a reasonable change in certain significant assumptions on the outcome of the 
Present value of obligation and aids in understanding the uncertainty of reported amounts. Sensitivity analysis is done by 
varying one parameter at a time and studying its impact.
	
Sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumptions namely Discount rate and Salary assumptions have been shown 
in the table above at the end of the reporting period, showing how the defined benefit obligation would have been affected 
by changes.
	
The method used to calculate the liability in these scenarios is by keeping all the other parameters and the data same as in 
the base liability calculation except for the parameters to be stressed.
	
The assumption for mortality and attrition do not have a significant impact on the liability, hence are not considered a 
significant actuarial assumption for the purpose of sensitivity analysis.

Leave Encashment / Compensated Absences / Sick Leave
	
The leave obligations cover the Group's liability for sick leave, privilege leave and casual leave.

right to defer the settlement for any of these obligations. However, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all 
employees to take the full amount of accrued leave or require payment within the next 12 months. The following table shows 
bifurcation of current and non-current provision for leave encashment.

the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the 
Balance Sheet date carried out by qualified actuary on projected accrued credit method carried out for assessing the liability 
as on the reporting date.

Tax, Excise, Custom and other authorities. The Group has reviewed all its pending litigations and proceedings and has 
adequately provided for where provisions are required and disclosed as contingent liabilities where applicable, in its 
financial statements. The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect 
on its financial statements.
ii	
It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the timing of cash outflows, if any, in respect of the above pending resolution 
of the respective proceedings as it is determinable only on receipt of judgments / decisions pending with various forums 
/ authorities.The Group has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources will 
be required in this regard.
iii	
The Group does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the above contingent liabilities.
iv	
The Group has received demand orders from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Department pertaining to the fiscal 
years 2017-18 to 2020-21. These orders are appealable and the Group believes that it has a good case on all the points 
raised by the GST Department. Hence there is no impact on the financial, operation or other activities of the Group due 
to  issuance of these Orders.
v	
The Government of Maharashtra revised electricity duty payable on captive power generation ("CPP") vide notification 
dated 13th April, 2015 and accordingly MSEDCL issued a Circular no 214 dated 23rd April, 2015, the revised rates for CPP 
was revised to 120 paise per unit from 30 paise per unit. The rates for CPP increased by 4 times, which was very high, 
therefore the Captive Power Producers Association filed writ petition with Bombay High Court which has been admitted 
by H.C. vide case No. WP/4963/2015 and WP/906/2017. The High Court passed interim stay order, subsequently during 
the last hearing held on 24th January, 2020, the bench passed the order to continue the interim stay granted previously. 
The Group has obtained an opinion from a subject-matter expert ('SME') on the Electricity Duty contingency. The matter

43	 RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
A	
Financial instruments risk management objectives and policies
	
The Group’s principal financial liabilities other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, trade and other payables. The main 
purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to support its operations. The Group’s principal 
financial assets include investments, trade and other receivables, deposits, loans and cash and cash equivalents that derive 
directly from its operations.
	
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the management 
of these risks. The Group's senior management is supported by an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team that advises on 
financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. The ERM team provides assurance 
to the Group’s senior management that the Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and 
procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk 
objectives. The ERM process seeks to provide greater confidence to the decision maker and thus enhance achievement 
of objectives. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised 
below.	
	
	
	
	
(a)	 Market risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, investments, 
other receivable, payables and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate 
to the position as at 31st March, 2025 and 31st March, 2024. 
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
i) Interest rate risk
The Group is mainly exposed to interest 
rate risk due to its variable interest 
rate borrowings. The interest rate risk 
arises due to uncertainties about the 
future market interest rate of these 
borrowings.
In order to manage its interest rate 
risk arising from variable interest rate 
borrowings, the Group uses Interest 
rate swaps to hedge its exposure to 
future market interest rates whenever 
appropriate. The hedging activity is 
undertaken in accordance with the 
framework set by the Risk Management 
Committee and supported by the 
Treasury department.
As an estimation of the approximate 
impact of the interest rate risk, with 
respect to financial instruments, the 
Group has calculated the impact of a 25 
bps change in interest rates. A 25 bps 
reduction in interest rates would have 
led to approximately an additional
₹ 521.2 lakhs and (2023-24: ₹ 110.2 
lakhs) gain in Statement of Profit and 
Loss. A 25 bps increase in interest 
rates would have led to an equal but 
opposite effect.

Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
ii) Foreign exchange risk
The Group has international operations 
and is exposed to foreign exchange 
risk arising from foreign currency 
transactions. Foreign exchange 
risk arises from future commercial 
transactions and recognised Financial 
assets and liabilities denominated 
in a currency that is not the Group’s 
functional currency (INR). The risk 
also includes highly probable foreign 
currency cash flows.
The Group has exposure arising out 
of export, import, loans and other 
transactions. The Group hedges its 
foreign exchange risk using foreign 
exchange forward contracts and 
currency options after considering the 
natural hedge. The same is within the 
guidelines laid down by Group's Risk 
Management policy.
As an estimation of the approximate 
impact of the foreign exchange 
rate risk, with respect to financial 
statements, the Group has calculated 
the impact on the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
The following tables demonstrate the 
sensitivity to a possible change in EUR 
and USD exchange rates, with all other 
variables held constant. The Group’s 
exposure to foreign currency changes 
for all other currencies is not material. 
For derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments, a 2% increase 
in the spot price as on the reporting 
date would have led to an increase 
in additional loss of ₹ 1,200.9 Lakhs. 
(2023-24: loss of ₹ 942.3 Lakhs). A 2% 
decrease would have led to an increase 
in additional gain of ₹ 1,200.9 Lakhs. 
(2023-24: gain of ₹ 942.3 Lakhs).

The Group, basis their assessment, believes that the probability of the occurrence of their highly probable forecasted 
transactions is not significantly impacted by the current geopolitical scenario.
	
The Group has also considered the effect of changes, if any, in both counterparty credit risk and own credit risk while 
assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge ineffectiveness. The Group continues to believe that there is no impact 
on effectiveness of its hedges.

How the risk arises
How group manages risks
The Group has a significant portion of 
its revenue in foreign currency (other 
than INR). This exposure in foreign 
exchange risk affects the profitability 
and financial position of the group 
due to variation in the foreign 
exchange rates.
The risk management strategy is as follows:
- To use the foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk 
associated with highly probable forecasted sales.
- To use the non-derivative contracts (cash flow legs of foreign currency 
borrowing) to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with highly probable 
forecasted sales.
- To use the cash flow legs of foreign currency borrowing combined with the cash 
flow legs of Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap to hedge the foreign currency risk 
associated with highly probable forecasted sales.
The Group has certain amount of its 
purchases in foreign currency (other 
than INR) which results in exposure to 
fluctuation of exchange rate affecting 
the profitability and financial position 
of the Group.
The risk management strategy is to use the foreign exchange forward contracts 
to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted 
purchases.
The Group has taken loans 
denominated in EUR which have 
floating interest rate. This results in 
exposing the Group to fluctuations 
in cash flow due to floating interest 
rate risk.
The risk management strategy is to use the Interest Rate Swap (IRS) to hedge the 
interest rate risk associated with floating interest rate cash flow.
	
The Group uses derivatives (forward contract, interest rate swap) or non-derivative or a combination of both to hedge its exposure 
of forex / interest rate related risk. These instruments are either used to lock in a lower purchase price or / and a higher sales prices 
/ fixed interest rate The gain or loss on hedging instrument are aligned and effectively an offset compared with hedged item. 
The economic relationship between hedged item and hedged instrument is established to ensure that both are moving in 
the opposite direction because of the same hedged risk.
	
The credit risk associated with the hedge relationship is negligible due to the highly rated counterparties
	
The Group's hedging policy only allows for effective hedge relationships. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of 
the  hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship 
exists between hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of 
the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of  the hedged item, and so a qualitative assessment of effectiveness 
is performed. If the critical terms of the hedged item do not match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, 
the company uses the quantitative analysis to assess effectiveness.
	
Ineffectiveness is recognised on a cash flow hedge where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the 
hedging instrument exceeds, on an absolute basis, the change in value of the hedged item that attributes to the hedged 
risk. This may arise if there is any change in the timing of the underlying hedged item or if the critical terms of the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item do not match exactly

(b)	 Credit risk
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
A) Trade Receivables:
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty 
will not meet its obligations under 
a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The 
Group is exposed to credit risk from its 
operating activities.
Customer credit risk is managed 
subject to the Group’s policy, 
procedures and control relating to 
customer credit risk management. 
Outstanding customer receivables are 
regularly monitored and any shipments 
to major customers are generally 
covered by letters of credit or other 
forms of credit insurance.
An impairment analysis based on 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is 
performed at each reporting date.
The Group considers the probability 
of default upon initial recognition and 
whether there have been significant 
increase in the credit risk on ongoing 
basis throughout each reporting 
period, to assess increase in the credit 
risk, the Group compares the rate of 
default on the date of reporting and 
initial recognition.
The maximum amount to which the 
Group is exposed is ₹ 1,22,495.2 Lakhs 
and ₹ 58,531.9 Lakhs for 31st March 
2025 and 31st March 2024 respectively.
Against these receivables, a provision 
for expected loss allowance is 
recognised.
B) Deposits and financial 
instruments (other than trade 
receivables):
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty 
will not meet its obligations under 
a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The 
Group is exposed to credit risk from its 
operating activities.
The group maintains exposure in 
cash and cash equivalents, term 
deposits with banks and mutual fund 
schemes. Investments of surplus 
funds are made with assigned credit 
limits with approved counterparties 
who meet requirements of ratings, 
financial strength, credit spreads, etc. 
Counterparty credit limits are set to 
minimize concentration risks and are 
reviewed periodically by the Board.
Long term credit ratings of these 
banking institutions are considered to 
be of investment grade. No impairment 
has been recorded in respect of fixed 
deposits that are with recognised 
commercial banks and not past due.

In addition to the historical pattern of credit loss, the Group has considered the likelihood of increased credit risk considering 
emerging situations due to the current geopolitical scenarios. This assessment is based on the likelihood of the recoveries 
from the customers in the present situation. The Group closely monitors its customers who are going through financial stress 
and assesses actions such as change in payment terms, recognition of revenue on collection basis etc., depending on severity 
of each case.  Basis this assessment, the allowance for doubtful trade receivables is considered adequate.

In addition, financial instruments that are subject to concentration of credit risk include loans, cash and cash equivalents, other 
balances with banks and other financial assets. None of the financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration 
of credit risk. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group generally invest in deposits with banks and 
financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies.
(c)	
Liquidity risk
Potential impact of risk
Management policy
Sensitivity to risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that 
the Group will not be able to settle 
or meet its obligation on time or at 
a reasonable price or there could be 
excessive concentrations of risks. 
The Group's treasury department is 
responsible for liquidity, funding as 
well as settlement management.
Excessive concentrations of risks arise 
when a number of counterparties are 
engaged in similar business activities, 
or activities in the same geographical 
region, or have economic features 
that would cause their ability to 
meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions. 
Concentrations indicate the relative 
sensitivity of the Group's performance 
to developments affecting a particular 
industry.
The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding 
and flexibility through the use of bank 
overdrafts and bank loans. The Group 
has access to a sufficient variety of 
sources of funding and debt maturing 
within 12 months can be rolled over 
with existing lenders.
In order to avoid excessive 
concentrations of risk, the Group’s 
policies and procedures include 
specific guidelines to focus on the 
maintenance of a diversified portfolio. 
Identified concentrations of credit 
risks are controlled and managed 
accordingly. Selective hedging is used 
to manage risk concentrations at both 
the relationship and industry levels.
The Group's principal sources of 
liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, 
borrowings and the cash flow that 
is generated from operations. The 
Group believes that current cash and 
cash equivalents, tied up borrowing 
lines and cash flow that is generated 
from operations is sufficient to meet 
requirements. Accordingly, liquidity 
risk is perceived to be low.
The Group assessed the concentration 
of risk and concluded it to be low.
The following table shows the maturity 
analysis of the Group's financial 
liabilities based on contractually 
agreed undiscounted cash flows as at 
the Balance Sheet date:

Capital management
	
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital and all other equity reserves 
attributable to the equity holders of the Group. The primary objective of capital management is to ensure that it maintains a 
strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
	
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the 
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend 
payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, 
which is debt divided by total equity. Net debt are non current borrowings and current borrowings as reduced by cash and 
cash equivalent.

44 	 Business Combination
I) 	
Acquisition made during the year ended 31st March, 2025
	
Sudarshan Europe B.V. ("SEBV"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company had entered into a definitive agreement 
on 11th October, 2024 for the acquisition of global pigment business operations of the Heubach Group through a combination 
of an asset and share deal, subject to completion of customary conditions and receipt of requisite regulatory approvals. 
The said acquisition was completed on 3rd March, 2025 ("Closing Date") by SEBV for a preliminary purchase consideration of 
€151.9 million (approx. ₹ 1,38,990.0 Iakhs). The acquisition comprises of the acquisition of (collectively hereinafter referred to

remaining for initial working capital requirements) have been netted against the issue proceeds. Refer note 16 (h)
C	
Accounting policy choice for fair valuation of Non-Controlling Interest (NCI)
	
The Group has elected to measure the non-controlling interests in one of the components of the acquired Heubach Group 
(Heubach Colorants India Limited) at their acquisition date fair value using the Level 1 inputs. Considering Heubach Colorants 
India Limited is a listed entity in India, the Group has used market price method with 10 days volume weighted average market 
price as an input for fair valuation of non-controlling interests.

The above fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary and are based on facts and circumstances 
that existed at the date of acquisition. These fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined 
using the income, market and cost approaches. In many cases, the determination of the fair values required estimates about 
discount rates, future expected cash flows and other future events that are judgmental and subject to change. The fair value 
measurements are primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 
measurement of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Ind AS 113 - Fair Value Measurements. Intangible assets consisting of 
technical know how and customer relationships have been valued using the relief from royalty (“RFR”) and the multi-period 
excess earnings method (“MPEEM”) method respectively, both of which are forms of the income approach. A cost or market 
approach has been applied, as appropriate, for property, plant and equipment, including land, and inventory. Investment in 
joint venture have been valued using income approach. 
	
The Group believes that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of the acquired assets and 
assumed liabilities, but considering the size, complexity, and timing of the acquisition, the potential for measurement period 
adjustments exists based on the Group’s continued review of the matters related to the acquisition. The Group is in the process 
of analysing the estimated values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; therefore, the allocation of the purchase price is 
preliminary and is subject to measurement period adjustments. The Group expects to complete the purchase price allocation 
no later than one year from the date of acquisition.

*Bargain purchase gain amounting to ₹ 1,24,385.1 Lakhs has been recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 
34 of Ind AS 103; 
#Gross of foreign currency exchange differences
	
The acquisition has resulted in bargain purchase gain on account of distress sale of the pigment operations of the Heubach 
Group following the insolvency of the German subsidiaries of the Heubach Group.
	
From the date of acquisition, the acquired Heubach Group has contributed ₹ 52,500.0 lakhs of revenue and ₹ 600.0 lakhs to 
the profit before tax of the Group. It is presently impractical to provide the value of revenue from operations for full financial 
year due to paucity of complete information for the period prior to this acquisition.
F	
Fair value measurement for significant items
	
Technological Know-how
	
Technological know-how are valued using the Relief from royalty ('RFR') method under Income approach. The fundamental 
principle underlying the RFR is to discount the hypothetical savings in royalty payable for using the trademark. The significant 
assumptions used include the estimated annual net cash flows (including appropriate revenue attributable to the asset, 
applicable tax rate), royalty rate, the discount rate, and the tax amortisation benefit, among other factors.
	
Property, plant and equipment	
	
	
Property, plant and equipment, including land, are valued using the cost or market approach, as appropriate. For assets 
valued using the cost approach, the Depreciated Replacement Cost method has been used. The cost approach estimates 
value using the economic principle that a buyer will pay no more for an asset than the cost to obtain a new asset of equal 
utility. However, the asset being valued may be subject to age and obsolescence. The market approach, which estimates value 
considering prevailing market/ circular rates, has been specifically used to value land.
	
Inventory	
	
Inventory has been valued using the replacement cost or market approach, as appropriate. The replacement cost approach, 
which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, has 
been used to determine the estimated replacement cost of raw materials and packing materials. The market approach has 
been used to determine the estimated selling price less costs to completion and sale for work in progress and finished goods.
	
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities	 	
	
The Group has measured the acquired lease liabilities using the present value of the remaining lease payments at the date 
of acquisition. The right-of-use assets were measured at an amount equal to the lease liabilities and adjusted to reflect the 
favourable terms of the lease relative to market terms.
	
Contingent Liabilities	
	
	
A provision of ₹ 31,760.0 lakhs has been recognised on account of fair valuation of contingent liabilities of the acquired 
Heubach Group in accordance with Ind AS 103. 
	
A provision of ₹ 26,359.7 lakhs was recognised towards the potential decommissioning liability taking into consideration 
contractual agreement, local regulations, and estimated costs, etc. The potential undiscounted future outflow for this 
decommissioning is estimated to be ₹38,838.6 lakhs which has been discounted over an estimated period of 8 years. 
As of 31st March, 2025, there has been no change in the liability amount recognised as at acquisition date considering 
the probability and timing of settling the decommissioning liability remain unchanged, apart from an impact of 
₹ 13.9 lakhs which is on account of unwinding of provision due to the aforesaid discounting.
	
Remaining provision of ₹ 5,400.3 lakhs includes provision on account of fair valuation of other contingent liabilities pertaining 
to claims and potential liabilities related to ongoing taxation matters and environmental liabilities of the acquired Heubach 
Group. These are expected to settle post conclusion of outcome of the claims / litigations.

Annual Report 24-25
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)	
	
The management assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalent, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current 
financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
	
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in 
a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
The following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
(i)	
Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables / borrowings are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such 
as interest rates, specific country risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of 
the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected credit losses of these 
receivables.
(ii)	
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks, related parties and other financial liabilities as well as other 
non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on 
similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
(iii)	 The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions and banks with investment grade credit 
ratings. Foreign exchange Forward Contracts and Interest Rate Swap are valued using valuation techniques, which employ 
the use of market observable inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing models, 
using present value calculations. The model incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, 
foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the 
respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.
(iv)	 The fair values of the Group’s interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using Discounted Cash Flow 
method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own 
non-performance risk was assessed to be insignificant.
51	 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
	
The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s assets and liabilities
	
Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of mutual fund investments.
	
Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured 
using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.; 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy include Company’s over-the- counter (OTC) derivative 
contracts.
	
Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities 
measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in 
whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current 
market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	
The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on 
a recurring basis as at 31st March, 2025 and 31st  March, 2024.

Valuation technique used to determine fair value of fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy are as show below:
Type
Valuation Technique
Forward exchange contracts
Forward pricing: The fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the 
reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curves in 
the respective currencies.
Interest rate/
Currency swaps
Swap models: The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows. Estimates of future floating - rate cash flows are based on quoted swap rates, 
futures prices and interbank borrowing rates. Estimated cash flows are discounted using 
a yield curve constructed from similar sources and which reflects the relevant benchmark 
interbank rate used by market participants for this purpose when pricing interest rate 
swaps. The fair value estimate is subject to a credit risk adjustment that reflects the credit 
risk of the respective group entity and of the counterparty; this is calculated based on 
credit spreads derived from current credit default swap or on credit spreads derived from 
current credit default swap or bond prices.
Investment in others
The valuation model considers the present value of expected payments, discounted 
using a current risk adjusted discount rate. They are classified as Level 3 Fair values.
Investment in mutual funds
The fair values of the mutual funds are based on net asset value as at reporting date.
Also refer note 44 for valuation technique as result of business combination.
	
There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect fair values.
	
There have been no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.
	
In determining fair value measurement, the impact of potential climate-related matters, including legislation, which may affect 
the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities in the financial statements has been considered. The group has assessed 
whether its properties are exposed to physical risks, such as flooding and increasing wildfires, but believes that this is currently 
not the case. However, the Group believes it is, to some extent, impacted by transition risks, and, more specifically, increasing 
requirements for energy efficiency of buildings due to climate-related legislation and regulations as well as tenants’ increasing 
demands for low-emission buildings. The Group therefore, takes into account necessary upgrades required to ensure future 
compliance with those requirements when measuring the fair value of investment properties, if any.
52	 HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMIES
	
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Group has acquired subsidiaries operating in Argentina (Heubach Colorants 
Argentina S.A.U.) and Turkiye (Sudarshan Turkey SLO Boya Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.) (refer note 54), both of which are considered 
hyperinflationary economies based on the criteria set out in Ind AS 29. The consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31st March, 2025 includes results and financial position of subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkiye which does not have a 
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the application of hyperinflation accounting.

During the year 2019, Heubach Colorants India Limited ("HCIL"), a subsidiary of the Holding Company (acquired as part of the 
Heubach Group acquisition w.e.f. 3rd March, 2025), on the basis of an independent valuation, obtained approval from its Board 
of Directors for the transfer of certain furniture and fixtures and other assets located at the Airoli Office to Clariant India Private 
Limited ("CIPL"), a related party at ₹ 2,581 Lakhs. Due to various reasons, the transfer of these assets could not be concluded 
till 2021. The current management noticed that certain identified assets belonging to HCIL were unauthorisedly transferred 
to CIPL without due approval from their Board of Directors. Upon becoming aware of the matter, their Board of Directors 
engaged external independent agencies to conduct a fact-finding exercise relating to the transaction. HCIL continued to 
engage in negotiations to recover the assets and mitigate any potential adverse impact arising from the transaction. As on 
the date of these financial statements, the matter remains under review. Additionally, based on the fact-finding report, HCIL 
is evaluating various legal options to determine the appropriate course of action. A final resolution including effects, if any, 
on the consolidated financial statement is pending.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2025
(All amounts are in C Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)

In light of the recent opinion issued by the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (ICAI) on “Consolidation of the financial statements of a section 8 company with the Sponsor Company.”, the 
Holding Company has determined that it exercises control over its Section 8 companies, 'Sudarshan CSR Foundation' 
and ‘Heubach Foundation’. Consequently, the financial statements of these Section 8 companies in the Group have been 
included in the consolidated financial statements, reflecting change in its consolidation status as compared to previous year. 
In addition, the Group has reviewed its presentation of segment information in line with the IFRS Interpretations Committee's Agenda 
Decision titled “Operating Segments – Disclosure of Revenues and Expenses for Reportable Segments”. Based on this guidance, the 
Group has enhanced its segment disclosures to include segment-wise break-up of specified and material income and expense items. 
To ensure consistency and comparability, the corresponding figures for the year ended 31st March,2024 have also been revised. 
 
The above changes do not impact recognition and measurement of items in the financial statements, and, consequentially, 
there is no impact on total equity and/ or profit for the current or any of the earlier periods nor there is any material impact on 
presentation of the statement of cash flows. Considering the nature of changes, the management believes that they do not 
have any material impact on the balance sheet at the beginning of the comparative period and, therefore, there is no need 
for separate presentation of third balance sheet.
