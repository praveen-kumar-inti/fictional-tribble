The number of beneficiaries stated above is an estimated number, which is a determining parameter of 
the Company’s partnership with the NGO. Based on the Company’s strategic focus areas, they specifically 
look to fund projects for girls/women, underprivileged/poor youth, the elder, the physically and mentally 
challenged and communities that live in remote locations and have limited access to healthcare, clean 
drinking water, electricity, and other basic necessities. Based on the projects and targeted beneficiaries, the 
Company estimates that 100% of beneficiaries of the programs were from vulnerable and underprivileged 
communities.	
	
The Company has the following approach to assess the impact of its grants and projects:
•	 Reach out to the NGO partner every 3 or 4 months to fill an update form with quantitative data	
•	 Schedule surprise visits by the Company’s local teams to check the progress on the field - conversations 
with implementing partners as well as beneficiaries
•	 NGO partners send the Company photographs regularly to view how functions are carried out	
•	 A final report details particulars of the project upon completion.
•	 Going forward, through the Company’s newly established CMS Info Foundation, the Company plans 
to have a dedicated resource for quarterly site visits (planned as well as surprise), to evaluate real time 
progress of the projects, from a quantitative as well as qualitative perspective.	
•	 The Company plans to create comprehensive templates to track actual impact numbers against estimated 
ones on an ongoing basis. Similarly, the Company plans to create a comprehensive template for easy 
reporting in tables and graphs. The idea is to have all the relevant information updated regularly, in a 
structured and easy to understand way.
