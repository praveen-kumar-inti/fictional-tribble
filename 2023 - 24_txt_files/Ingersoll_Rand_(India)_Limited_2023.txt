8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases. 
 
IR’s global Code of Conduct states that the organization has a strict non-retaliation policy. If a complainant feels retaliated against for 
raising a concern/helping investigate a concern, the person can reach out to Global Ethics Hotline or the Legal or Compliance 
Department. Furthermore, the global human rights policy clearly states that no retaliatory action will be tolerated against the 
complainant for reporting, in good faith, a violation or suspected violation of the Policy. Except where restricted by local laws, each 
employee is required to cooperate in any internal or external investigation of suspected wrongdoing.  
IRIL has commissioned an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to investigate into the complaints of sexual harassment. The inquiry 
committee shall maintain confidentiality of the complainant, the respondent, and the witnesses. The Company shall ensure that the 
complainant(s) and the witness(es) are not subjected to any unfavorable treatment whatsoever during the course of her/his 
employment.  
 
With respect to whistle blower cases, the identity of the complainant and the witnesses (if any), will be kept confidential to the extent 
possible and any such disclosure be made only on a need-to-know basis and the requirements of the investigation by the Audit 
committee. As per the IRIL’s whistleblower policy, complete protection will be given to Whistle Blower against any unfair practice like 
retaliation or any type of harassment, biased behavior or the like including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the Whistle 
Blower’s right to continue to perform his/her duties or functions including making further Protected Disclosure. However, the 
complainant may face disciplinary action if the allegations were found to be made despite knowing it to be false or bogus or with a 
male fide intention. 
 
9. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No) 
 
Yes.  Human rights requirements form a part of Company's business agreements and supplier contracts. For suppliers, we expect human rights 
compliance as they have to abide by Ingersoll Rand’s supplier code of conduct which explicitly  states prohibition of child and forced labour, 
discrimination and harassment, and mandates compliance to applicable wage and hour laws, and freedom of association. Suppliers shall ensure 
full compliance with all local laws and regulations including but not limited to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, data protection, minimum wages, 
prevention of sexual harassment, and payment of statutory dues.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce 
usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
 
Waste generation being an inevitable part of manufacturing process, efforts have been taken to create value from waste. With an aim to divert a 
significant quantum of waste from going to the landfills, the Company has adopted systems and procedures that helps repurpose used material and 
reintroduce excess material into the production process. The Company follows the ‘3R’ strategy of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle for our waste 
management. The Company follows legally prescribed procedures and applies environmentally sound disposal techniques for disposing hazardous 
waste whereas the non-hazardous waste is sold to authorized recyclers. 
 
The company has implemented use of low air pressure system for painting operations which has reduced solvent and paint emissions. Furthermore, 
the company has transitioned to using low VOC paint instead of traditional paints in the process. Since VOCs evaporate, subsequently transferring 
harmful chemicals into the air, switching to low VOC paint will is better for improving air quality as these paints off-gas lesser than the traditional paints.
