In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications 
of the risk opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1
Employee 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
It’s a risk because any issue with 
employee health and safety will 
have a direct negative impact 
on the production activity 
which will eventually affect the 
business
To mitigate the risk the 
Company has adopted the 
following approach:
	 Employee 
well-being 
program
	 Training 
program 
on 
health & safety
	 Adherence 
to 
plant 
manuals
The absence of such an 
initiative impacts employee 
morale 
and 
business 
reputation 
leading 
to 
the 
negative 
financial 
implication 
2
Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Energy management planning 
assists them in setting up their 
renewable energy target
The Company has decided to 
install an 8 MW solar power 
project
Such initiatives act as a 
brand-building 
exercise 
that has a positive impact 
both on employees and on 
business
3
GHG 
Emission
Opportunity
GHG 
emission 
reduction 
targets will help to improvise 
operational efficiency
Baseline assessment of Scope 
1, 2, and 3 is completed
The initiative taken around 
such climate change issues 
has positive implications on 
business
4
Code of 
Conduct
Risk
A breach in the code of conduct 
will have a negative influence 
on the business
Webinar 
and 
induction 
training sessions for the 
employee

code of conduct might 
result in loss of business 
and will impact the image 
of the Company 
5
Water 
Management
Opportunity
Reduction 
in 
freshwater 
consumption level will help in 
saving costs for the organization
The 
water 
management 
study helped us to identify 
the leakage as well as 
improvement areas
Water is a limited resource 
and conservation of same 
will help in building the 
brand image along with 
saving water-related cost
6
Waste 
Management
Risk
Failure 
to 
manage 
waste 
will 
negatively 
impact 
the 
Company’s image and may 
attract 
fines/penalties 
from 
regulating authority
Conducted 
waste 
management 
study 
to 
identify 
better 
ways 
of 
handling it
Proper waste management 
will positively impact the 
business 
7
Board 
Structure and 
Management
Risk
Lack of diversity in the board 
structure can have a negative 
impact and might result in loss 
of business opportunities
To further improve diversity 
in the Board structure and 
to   increase the women 
representative in the board
The lack of diversity in the 
Board can affect business 
decisions
8
Risk 
Management
Opportunity
Risk Management including 
ESG risk management will help 
in identification, managing and 
mitigating the future potential 
risks.
To 
redesign 
the 
entire 
enterprise risk management 
plan of the Company and to 
integrate climate change risk 
management in the overall 
enterprise risk management
Proficiently managing ESG 
risk will positively impact 
the business and help in 
building the brand image 
of the organization
