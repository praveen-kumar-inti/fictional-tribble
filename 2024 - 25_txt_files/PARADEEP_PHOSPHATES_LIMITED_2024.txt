(Indicate positive or

1
Occupational 
health and 
safety (OHS)
Risk
Ensuring a safe and 
healthy 
workplace 
is 
crucial 
for 
employee welfare and 
productivity. Poor OHS 
measures can lead to 
accidents, 
illnesses, 
and 
a 
subsequent 
increase 
in 
labor 
costs due to lower 
productivity and higher 
medical 
expenses. 
Additionally, 
it 
can 
result in legal liabilities 
and regulatory fines.
Proactive measures are in 
place to implement an effective 
OHS program at PPL. 
 Both of PPL’s manufacturing 
plants, located in Paradeep 
and Goa, are certified to the 
prestigious ISO 45001 standard, 
underscoring our commitment 
to the highest international 
benchmarks for occupational 
health and safety. We have 
implemented a comprehensive 
suite of safety protocols that 
include well-defined Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
regular 
health 
and 
safety 
training for all employees, and 
ongoing monitoring to ensure 
a safe working environment. To 
further bolster our safety culture, 
we conduct rigorous initiatives 
such as Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA), 
Hazop studies, and process 
safety audits. Additionally, our 
safety framework is reinforced 
through external safety audits 
and 
inspections, 
including 
the CICG inspection by the 
Government of Odisha, ensuring 
continuous improvement and 
regulatory compliance.
Negative: 
 
Workplace 
incidents not only pose 
risks to employee safety 
but can also damage the 
company’s 
reputation, 
leading 
to 
negative 
publicity and a decline in 
public perception. This 
can erode customer trust, 
result in missed business 
opportunities, and create 
challenges in attracting 
and retaining top talent. 
Additionally, 
regulatory 
fines and compliance-
related 
penalties 
can 
impose 
significant 
financial strain, further 
complicating 
the 
organization’s operations 
and long-term growth.

Chemical 
Safety
Risk
The 
production 
and 
handling 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals 
like phosphates and 
ammonia are integral 
to 
the 
company’s 
operations, 
but 
are 
inherently 
risky. 
Improper management 
of these substances 
can result in spills, leaks, 
and other accidents, 
posing 
severe 
risks 
to 
employee 
safety 
and the environment. 
Such 
incidents 
can 
attract 
regulatory 
scrutiny, environmental 
penalties, and disrupt 
our 
production 
processes.
Our comprehensive SOPs and 
safety manuals outline clear, 
step-by-step guidelines for the 
safe handling of chemicals. 
To reinforce these protocols, 
we conduct regular training 
sessions, periodic safety audits, 
and ensure that all employees 
are 
equipped 
with 
the 
necessary Personal Protective 
Equipment 
(PPE). 
These 
proactive measures not only 
prepare our team to recognize 
and address potential hazards 
but 
also 
guarantee 
strict 
adherence to safety standards, 
fostering a culture of safety 
and compliance across the 
organization.
Negative: 
 
Chemical 
safety 
incidents 
can 
significantly tarnish the 
company’s 
reputation 
with 
stakeholders. 
Major 
accidents 
or 
environmental violations 
may disrupt operations, 
causing 
delays 
or 
shutdowns that impact 
financial 
performance. 
Additional costs from 
cleanup 
efforts 
and 
potential legal liabilities 
further strain resources.
3
Business 
Ethics
Opportunity
Good governance and 
ethical 
conduct 
are 
fundamental to building 
stakeholder 
trust 
and sustaining long-
term growth. Ethical 
practices help prevent 
legal issues, enhance 
corporate 
reputation, 
and ensure sustainable 
business operations.
The 
Company’s 
Code 
of 
Business 
Conduct 
and 
Ethics underscores its firm 
stance 
against 
unethical 
practices, 
including 
bribery, 
gifts, 
insider 
trading, 
and 
harassment. The code also 
outlines 
clear 
escalation 
mechanisms for individuals to 
raise concerns or complaints, 
ensuring accountability and 
transparency.
To further our commitment to 
sustainability and responsible 
corporate 
governance, 
we 
have 
established 
an 
ESG 
Steering 
Committee. 
This 
committee plays a pivotal role 
in steering initiatives related 
to environmental stewardship, 
corporate social responsibility, 
and governance.
Positive: Good corporate 
governance 
systems 
ensure the company is 
managed in the interests 
of all shareholders. This 
can lead to increased 
investor 
confidence 
and better access to 
capital. Ethical conduct 
enhances 
customer 
loyalty 
and 
employee 
morale, contributing to 
overall business growth 
and financial stability.

4.
Environmental 
management
Risk
Our industry is under 
constant scrutiny for its 
environmental impact. 
A strong commitment 
to 
environmental 
protection and resource 
conservation 
is 
crucial for sustainable 
operations 
and 
meeting 
regulatory 
requirements. 
Non-
compliance can result 
in 
legal 
penalties, 
cleanup 
costs, 
and 
significant reputational 
harm.
Our 
manufacturing 
plants 
are 
ISO 
14001 
certified, 
demonstrating 
our 
commitment to international 
environmental 
management 
standards. 
We initiated a comprehensive 
Climate Risk Analysis (both 
physical and transition) to 
understand 
future 
possible 
climate risk for our facilities. In 
addition, Life cycle analysis of 
three of our key products was 
done to identify environmental 
impact. A Biodiversity Risk 
Assessment 
at 
Paradeep, 
aligned with GLOBIO and IUCN 
standards, is also completed. 
We have also set up targets 
across 
key 
Environmental 
parameters/KPIs 
and 
subsequently assessing our 
year-on-year progress.
Negative: 
Non-
compliance 
with 
environmental 
norms 
can result in significant 
financial repercussions, 
including 
fines, 
legal 
fees, 
and 
increased 
operational costs due 
to mandated corrective 
actions. 
Additionally, 
This may also lead to 
reputational 
damage 
that can can cause loss 
of customer trust and 
business opportunities, 
further 
impacting 
financial performance.
5.
Inclusion and
Diversity
Opportunity
A 
diverse 
and 
inclusive 
workforce 
fosters 
creativity 
and 
innovation, 
essential for solving 
complex 
problems 
and 
maintaining 
a 
competitive edge. In 
the agricultural sector, 
where diverse needs 
and 
challenges 
are 
prevalent, 
inclusivity 
can drive better product 
development 
and 
customer satisfaction.
 We have a board diversity 
policy in place that ensures a 
robust governance. We also 
focus on inclusive approach 
to talent attraction to acquire 
the right talent for the right role 
during recruitment, irrespective 
of 
the 
candidate’s 
gender, 
religion, region, caste, sexual 
orientation, creed, race, etc.
Positive: 
A 
positive 
and 
inclusive 
work 
environment 
drives 
productivity and overall 
better 
performance, 
translating to improved 
financial 
outcomes. 
Additionally, 
a 
strong 
reputation for diversity 
and inclusion can attract 
top talent and enhance 
the company’s market 
position.

6.
Responsible
Supply Chain
Risk
An efficient and resilient 
supply chain is critical 
for the uninterrupted 
production and meeting 
customer 
demands. 
Disruptions can lead 
to production delays, 
increased costs, and 
potential loss of market 
share.
We 
ensure 
supply 
chain 
resilience 
through 
various 
initiatives such as shifting 
to 
Molten 
Sulphur 
supply 
from IOCL to reduce carbon 
footprints and establishing a 
vendor evaluation system with 
ESG criteria. 
Maintaining 
critical 
vendor 
partnerships 
and 
creating 
alternative domestic sources 
further 
secure 
our 
supply 
continuity.
Positive: A diversified 
supply 
chain 
builds 
resilience to disruptions 
such as natural disasters, 
geopolitical 
issues, 
or 
supplier 
problems. 
Having 
alternative 
suppliers or contingency 
plans 
ensures 
operational 
continuity, 
mitigating financial risks 
associated with supply 
chain disruptions.
7.
Community
Relations
Opportunity
Building 
and 
maintaining 
positive 
relationships 
with 
local communities is 
essential for fostering 
mutual 
trust 
and 
support. 
Being 
a 
responsible corporate 
citizen 
helps 
ensure 
that 
our 
operations 
are 
welcomed 
and 
supported, 
which is crucial for 
sustainable growth and 
development.
 
Our 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
policy 
shapes our commitment to 
fostering positive community 
relationships 
and 
driving 
sustainable development. With 
a strong focus on livelihoods, 
education, health (specifically 
Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene 
- WaSH), and environmental 
sustainability, we strive to make 
a tangible impact. Through 
proactive 
and 
meaningful 
community engagement, we 
aim to build lasting trust and 
improve the well-being of the 
communities we serve.
Positive: Building strong 
community 
relations 
not 
only 
enhances 
our 
reputation 
and 
brand image but also 
strengthens our position 
with 
consumers, 
investors, 
and 
other 
key 
stakeholders. 
By 
fostering 
trust 
and 
demonstrating 
a 
commitment to social 
responsibility, we create 
deeper customer loyalty 
and more robust investor 
relationships, ultimately 
driving 
long-term 
business success.

for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements.
At PPL, sustainability is the cornerstone of everything we do. We are committed to 
not only meeting but exceeding the highest environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) standards. Our dedication is reflected in multiple ISO certifications, including ISO 
9001, 14001, 50001, 45001, and 27001, which highlight our relentless focus on quality, 
energy efficiency, safety, and environmental management. Over the past year, we have 
introduced new policies, launched innovative ESG initiatives, and made significant 
advancements in our data management practices. Through our annual, sustainability 
and BRSR reports, we transparently share the progress we have made toward a greener, 
more responsible future.
At the heart of our mission lies our unwavering commitment to the farmers of India. 
We understand that the success of agriculture is crucial not just to the economy but to 
the very fabric of rural life. That is why we focus on providing farmers with innovative, 
affordable solutions that empower them to thrive. By supporting India’s agricultural 
growth, we aim to contribute to both food security and rural prosperity. As we continue 
to enhance our products and services, we remain steadfast in our goal to offer lasting 
benefits to the agricultural community.
Looking ahead, we are building on this foundation to further strengthen our 
sustainability efforts. We’re rolling out an extensive program to evaluate and support 
our key suppliers, aiming to foster a more resilient, responsible, and sustainable supply 
chain. Beyond mere compliance, we are actively working to reduce our carbon footprint, 
improve the wellbeing of our employees, and uplift local communities.
Innovation, thoughtful decision-making, and a commitment to continuous improvement 
are guiding our journey. As we continue to evolve, we remain focused on transparency 
and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. We are confident that this 
approach will not only contribute to a more sustainable future but also to a food-secure 
and prosperous India.

Plastics (Including packaging) – 
	
	
PPL handles all plastic waste in accordance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and any subsequent 
amendments. Pre-consumer plastic waste generated within the factory premises, such as packaging for raw materials 
and waste bags produced during the packing of fertilizers, is collected and stored in designated yards or bins allocated 
specifically for plastic waste. The company then collaborates with an authorized recycler approved by the Goa State 
Pollution Control Board for proper disposal of the collected plastic waste. Additionally, PPL has implemented Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance for packaging products, as per the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.
b)	
E-Waste – 
	
	
PPL manages all e-waste in compliance with the E-Waste Management Rules, 2016. A dedicated shed is maintained for 
the storage of e-waste to ensure proper handling. All e-waste generated is sold exclusively to dismantlers or recyclers 
authorized by the Goa State Pollution Control Board. Records are meticulously maintained in accordance with the E-Waste 
Management Rules, 2016, and annual returns in Form 3 are submitted to the Goa State Pollution Control Board each year.
c)	
Acid Batteries – 
	
	
The Company has a buyback policy with vendors for used lead-acid batteries.
d)	
Hazardous waste – 
	
	
Hazardous waste generated from various plant areas is collected in closed MS drums or barrels and stored in designated 
areas within the hazardous waste shed. Labels, as per Form 8 of the Hazardous Waste Management Rule 2016, are affixed 
to the drums or containers for disposal. Chemical sludge from the effluent treatment plant is dried in sludge drying beds 
and then fully recycled into the NPK-A and NPK-B plants. The management of hazardous waste adheres to a Standard 
Operating Procedure.
e)	
Other waste such as metal scrap, waste activated carbon, rubber scrap etc-  
	
	
Solid waste is segregated into separate bins. Bio-degradable waste is collected in green bins, non-bio-degradable waste in 
blue bins, and oil-containing waste in gray bins. 
 
 
Bio-degradable waste from canteens, offices, and households in the township is sent to a vermicomposting unit at 
PPL premises, producing organic manure (bio-fertilizer). 
 
 
Non-bio-degradable waste generated at PPL is sent to Goa Waste Management Corporation Limited for co-processing, 
recycling, or disposal. 
 
 
Construction debris is used for backfilling material in structures, building foundations, and road making. 
 
 
Sand from filters is similarly used for backfilling and road construction projects.

internationally recognized occupational health and safety management framework. This certification covers 100% of our 
entity, including both regular employees and our contractors.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
entity?
	
	
We employ a comprehensive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both a routine and non-routine 
basis. This strategy involves active participation from senior executives, zonal safety members, and contract workers. We 
utilize Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) as a foundational step in our safety management process.
 
 
Routine safety measures include conducting thorough Why-Why analysis and process safety audits, often involving 
external agencies for unbiased observations. The company also undergoes annual statutory inspections by the 
Government of Odisha’s CICG (Chief Inspectorate of Factories)  & Government of Goa by Factory Inspectors  to ensure 
adherence to safety standards.
 
 
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies and Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA) provide deeper insights into 
potential risks, guiding the creation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Operational Control Procedures (OCP), 
and Safety Management Plans (SMP).
 
 
For non-routine activities involving higher risk levels, we conduct job safety analysis (JSA)/HIRA to thoroughly assess 
and mitigate potential hazards. We have a Safety Mobile App for instant recording and sharing of unsafe observations. 
 
 
Safety touch initiatives and safety hot spots are implemented to identify unsafe conditions and vulnerable areas on 
the shop floor. 
 
 
Dedicated safety officers carry out daily inspections to ensure continuous monitoring of safety protocols.

Describe the internal mechanism in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The company has put in place an effective grievance redressal mechanism to address employee concerns, including those 
related to human rights. The process follows a three-tier escalation structure, offering employees several channels to raise 
their concerns—such as direct discussions with departmental heads or supervisors, emails, or written letters. All grievances are 
reviewed by a designated committee that assesses, investigates, and recommends appropriate corrective actions to the relevant 
Business Units. To ensure oversight and accountability, the Member Secretary prepares a quarterly summary of any human 
rights-related complaints and corresponding actions, which is submitted biannually to the Chief Human Resources Officer and 
the Managing Director.

three of our sulphuric acid plants, which harnesses steam produced in the Sulphuric Acid Plant for captive power generation, 
thus improving energy efficiency and reducing our environmental impact. 
	
Additionally,
 
 
The company has implemented steam air preheater in one of the granulation train. Way forward steam air preheater will be 
installedin other 3 trains in phased manners. 
 
 
Goa Unit has undertaken phase wise implementation of Energy saving projects aimed to reduce specific energy consumption 
and GHG emissions.
 
 
Phase-II of the project is currently in the engineering phase and is scheduled for commissioning by April 2026 to reduce 
Urea specific energy consumption by 0.3 GCal/MT. The corresponding reduction in GHG emission will be approximately 
36000 MT/year. 
 
 
Phase-III will be implemented by April 2027. Post implementation, Urea Specific energy consumption will further reduced 
by 0.3 GCal/MT. The corresponding reduction in GHG emission will be approximately 36000 MT/Year.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Our waste management strategy is anchored on the 3R principle of 'Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.' This approach ensures that 
we manage waste in a compliant and ecologically responsible manner. We prioritize maximizing the reuse of waste across our 
operations, and any waste that cannot be reused is disposed of according to regulatory requirements and statutory guidelines. 
We are also committed to reducing the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at our manufacturing facilities. For 
example: ETP Sludge – ETP sludge is also utilized as a filler in fertilizer production. We are also continuously working to reduce 
effluent to ETP and minimize the generation of ETP sludge.
	
We have taken significant steps to comply with the Charter on Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Protection (CREP) for 
Fertilizer Industries. One of the key initiatives was phasing out the use of Arsenic in the CO2 absorption system at our Ammonia 
plant.
