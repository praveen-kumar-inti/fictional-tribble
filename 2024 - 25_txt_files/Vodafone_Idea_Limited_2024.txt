BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Introduction to BRSR
At Vodafone Idea Limited (Vi), we believe that responsible business practices and sustainable growth are inseparable from 
long-term success. As one of India’s leading telecommunications service providers, we recognize our role in shaping a 
sustainable future through ethical governance, environmental stewardship, and positive social impact.
In alignment with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) mandate and our commitment to transparency, 
accountability, and stakeholder engagement, Vodafone Idea presents its Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(BRSR) for the Financial Year (FY) 2024–25. This report marks an important step in deepening our Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) disclosures, and strengthening our sustainability journey.
Our sustainability strategy is closely aligned with national priorities like Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and climate 
action initiatives. We are committed to integrating responsible practices across our value chain, fostering innovation for a 
greener future, and empowering our partners, employees, and customers to thrive sustainably.
In alignment with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) directives, the 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) continues to be mandatory 
for the top 1,000 listed entities by market capitalization for the FY 2024–25. This 
requirement, which initially began as a voluntary disclosure in FY 2021–22, was made 
mandatory from FY 2022–23 onwards.
Strengthening the regulatory framework for sustainability reporting, SEBI issued Circular 
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 dated December 20, 2024, titled “Industry 
Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core,” mandating that listed entities comply with 
standardized industry guidelines for BRSR Core disclosures from FY 2024–25 onwards.
This report is in compliance with SEBI’s requirements.

1.
Climate Change
Risk 
There is a need to keep a watch on emerging regulations 
within the telecom sector and globally on climate change 
(India has taken a Net Zero target by 2070 because of 
the UNFCCC negotiations in the COP), which focuses on 
clean technologies and renewable energy. 
Over recent years, India has faced severe consequences 
of climate change, affecting both humans and physical 
infrastructure. Telecom disruptions not only threaten 
Vodafone Idea with significant restructuring costs but also 
hinder essential communication pre and post disaster, 
crucial for disaster prevention and rescue efforts.
• C re a t i n g  a  s t r u c t u re d

oversee climate change related 
issues.
• Designating a Sustainability/ 
ESG committee to overlook all 
the risks, mitigation measures 
and contingency plans if there 
is a risk.
Negative
2
E-waste 
Management
Risk
Telecom equipment, networking infrastructure, contributes 
significantly to e-waste generation. Inadequate e-waste 
management poses environmental and health hazards, 
regulatory non-compliance risks, and reputational 
damage. Effective management strategies are essential 
to mitigate these risks, ensure regulatory compliance.
• Partnering with relevant 
government agencies to ensure 
proper handling, recycling, and 
disposal of electronic waste.
• A d h e r i n g  t o  e - w a s t e

3.
Customer Privacy 
& Data Security
Risk 
Instances of usage and selling of consumer data / data 
privacy breaches are leading to rising privacy concerns. It is 
important for VIL to communicate transparently about the 
policies regarding the quantity, kind, and use of consumer 
data that is provided to third parties.
In the age of increased cybersecurity threats, 
protecting customer data is paramount to maintaining 
competitiveness and safeguarding the integrity of their 
services.
In India, there are ongoing efforts to update regulations 
regarding privacy and personal data protection through 
the DPDP Act. This proposed Act aims to regulate the 
usage and protection of customer data. 
Data security concerns can affect customer acquisition 
and retention, decrease market share, and decrease 
the demand for VIL services. Data loss can result in the 
unintentional disclosure of private information, which 
could result in non-compliance, legal ramifications, and 
damage to our brand’s reputation.
• VIL is bound by /complies 
with license terms to ensure 
confidentiality of subscriber 
information. 
• VIL has also been taking steps 
such as meticulous planning, 
rigorous assessment, and 
proactive measures to align our 
practices with the requirements 
outlined in the DPDP Act. 
• Conducting customer privacy 
audits regularly.
• Disciplinary action in case of 
breaches.
• Creating stringent measures to 
ensure customer privacy.
• Minimize data retention.
• Remaining complaint with the 
regulation.
Negative
4.
Quality of Network 
Infrastructure
Risk
Network infrastructure is vulnerable to technological 
failure which can be caused by either human mistake 
or natural disasters, which can affect the quality of VIL’s 
services. Rapid technological advancements in the IT 
industry makes it necessary for VIL to make technological 
upgrades that are necessary to satisfy growing client 
demand for stronger and better network connectivity. 
Failure to do so could adversely affect VIL’s business and 
market share.
• Conducting regular quality 
checks. 
• Recording the number of 
complaints to mitigate risks.
Negative
5.
Talent Attraction 
and Development 
Opportunity 
An organisation with talented employees presents an 
opportunity for VIL to promote innovation, improve service 
delivery, and enhance customer satisfaction. As we evolve 
from a traditional telecom firm to a digital enterprise, our 
ability to attract and upskill talent will be critical to improve 
our business performance and increase market share.

In line with our commitment to reducing emissions and enhancing energy efficiency, we are steadily increasing our use 
of renewable energy. In FY 2024–25 alone, ~47 Mn kWh of energy was sourced from renewables. We have implemented 
impactful initiatives within our Commercial Warehouses, including energy efficient infrastructure, solar adoption, and 
resource reutilization. These efforts have not only led to significant carbon emission reductions and cost savings but 
have also contributed to the conservation of natural resources - saving 482 trees and redeploying materials worth 
₹ 3035 crore in FY25 alone.
We are equally proud of the strides made in promoting diversity and inclusion. With 34% of our warehouse workforce 
now comprising women and persons with disabilities, we are setting new benchmarks in inclusive employment. 
Our supplier diversity policy further strengthens our ecosystem by encouraging partnerships with marginalized and 
underrepresented enterprises.
In our supply chain, the Value Engineering Centre (VEC) in Pune has emerged as a key innovation. By repairing equipment 
deemed beyond repair, the VEC has achieved a 70% recovery rate and delivered ₹49 crore in cost avoidance - far 
exceeding industry averages.
We remain committed to transparent governance, safety first operations, and ESG led innovation. As we look ahead, 
our focus will remain on deepening our impact and driving sustainable, long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Additionally, our robust governance framework has ensured adherence to regulatory requirements and ethical business 
conduct, enhancing trust and credibility among stakeholders.
We remain steadfast in our commitment to ESG principles. Through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we 
are confident in our ability to create long-term value for our stakeholders while contributing to a sustainable future.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of 
the Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.
	
As part of its strong governance framework, Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) has established robust mechanisms to manage 
conflicts of interest. The Company’s Code of Conduct explicitly requires all Board Members to avoid situations where 
their personal interests could conflict with the interests of VIL.
	
In the event that an individual within the organization finds themselves in a situation that could potentially lead to a 
conflict between personal and professional interests, they are expected to declare the conflict, seek appropriate approval, 
and ensure it is duly recorded. To assist in evaluating such situations, individuals are encouraged to reflect on whether 
they would be comfortable explaining their actions to colleagues, friends, or even the media.
	
The Code of Conduct applies to all employees and members of the Board of Directors. It provides clear guidance on 
identifying, avoiding, and reporting both actual and perceived conflicts of interest.
	
In addition, VIL has in place a Related Party Transactions Policy that governs all interactions between the Company and 
Related Parties. The policy ensures appropriate reporting, approval, and disclosure mechanisms are followed. It also 
mandates that any Director with an interest in a Related Party Transaction must recuse themselves from discussions 
or decisions pertaining to such contracts or arrangements, thereby preventing any potential conflict of interest.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes:
	
At Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL), site return materials are systematically classified into four categories: usable, faulty 
repairable, obsolete, and scrap. Emphasis is placed on maximizing reutilization by repairing and redeploying usable 
and repairable items. In FY25, VIL successfully redeployed materials worth approximately ₹ 3,035 crores (based on 
standard prices), reflecting our strong focus on asset optimization and cost efficiency. For materials that are deemed 
obsolete and beyond repair, VIL adopts a robust and environmentally responsible scrap disposal management process.
132
VODAFONE IDEA LIMITED
	
Scrap Management Process
	
1.	
Identification & Segregation:
	
	
Scrap items are first identified by the functional users. These items are then segregated based on:
	
	
o	
Material composition: e.g., metal, plastic,
	
	
o	
Type of waste: solid, hazardous, e-waste, and plastic
	
2.	
Scrap Note & Disposal:
	
	
A scrap note is prepared and routed through the designated approval workflow within VIL. Once approved, 
disposal is carried out through authorized scrap vendors—certified by relevant Government/Regulatory bodies 
and holding necessary licenses. These vendors are responsible for ensuring that the material is handled, disposed 
of, or repurposed in compliance with environmental and societal regulations.
	
Value Engineering Center (VEC) – Pune
	
To further enhance value recovery, VIL has set up a dedicated Value Engineering Centre (VEC) in Pune. The VEC 
specializes in the evaluation and repair of equipment classified as “Repair Not Possible (RNP)” by OEMs. Rather 
than scrapping such equipments, it is redirected to the VEC for further examination and repair. The center has been 
proven highly effective, achieving a recovery rate of 70%, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 
30% seen with other local repair partners. Approximately, around 9,000 cards are categorized as RNP annually across 
all clusters. As of March 25, the VEC has delivered a total cost avoidance of ₹49 crore, underscoring its vital role in 
resource optimization and sustainability.

Initiative
VIL’s scrap and asset recovery initiatives, including 
redeployment and the VEC-led repair of RNP 
equipment, have significantly contributed to our 
circular economy goals. 
These initiatives have led to reduced material 
waste, lower e-waste generation, and minimized 
environmental footprint—strengthening our 
commitment to sustainable operations
Water initiative
Renovated washrooms at multiple circle offices—
including Indore, TNC, and KWB—where we ensured 
the installation of water-efficient fixtures
Replaced conventional manual dishwashing processes 
with energy- and water-efficient dishwashers.
Traditional water taps, which typically discharge 
2.2 gallons per minute (GPM), were replaced 
with new fixtures operating at 1.5 GPM, thereby 
reducing water flow without compromising 
functionality.
Handwashing typically consumes 10–15 gallons 
of water per cycle, the newly installed dishwashers 
operate with only 3–4 gallons per cycle, resulting 
in a substantial reduction in water usage and 
effluent discharge.
