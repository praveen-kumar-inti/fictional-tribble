operational areas, adhering to the Companies Act, 2013, which mandates Directors to recuse themselves from discussions where 
they have a personal interest, thus maintaining high governance standards. The Company adheres to a Board-approved 'Framework 
for managing conflicts of interest', applicable to all employees, directors and subsidiaries' employees. This Framework, part of 
Angel One's strong corporate governance, mandates annual compliance affirmations from Directors, ensuring no conflicts of 
interest occurred during the year. The governance framework, emphasizing independence and transparency, separates the Board's 
supervisory responsibilities from management, with critical areas overseen by committees chaired by Independent Directors.

As part of this commitment, the company has formed its Internal Complaints (IC) and Appeals Committees, specifically designed 
to address and resolve complaints related to sexual harassment in the workplace.
In addition, the company has established a Vigil mechanism and Whistle Blower Policy which is as per the requirements of ‘Listing 
Regulations’ and provides adequate safeguards against victimization of employees, directors or any persons who avails the 
provisions of this policy to report inappropriate behaviors or cases. A dedicated Investigation Committee is created under this 
policy for addressing and investigation any concerns of unethical practices reported.
Moreover, recognizing the importance of an internal grievance mechanism for employees, the company has implemented a system 
to address and resolve grievances. This comprehensive approach underscores the company's dedication to creating a secure and 
supportive work environment while promoting ethical practices and accountability.
5. 
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
The grievances related to human rights are primarily under the purview of PRoSH policy and Vigil Mechanism and Whistle Blower 
policy. The Company maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy towards any form of violation or misconduct, particularly related to 
misdemeanors. In ensuring a safe and supportive environment for employees to pursue their professional aspirations, the company 
has implemented employee-centric policies. These policies aim to establish a secure space for employees and provide an effective 
mechanism for addressing their grievances.
Upon receiving a complaint, the company mandates the formation of a committee comprised of members with no conflicts of interest 
related to either party involved, i.e., the complainant or respondent. This committee is tasked with investigating the matter. An HR 
representative is assigned to brief the committee about the complaint and facilitate committee meetings.
The committee is empowered to seek assistance from the investigation team or any company officer for the purpose of collecting 
evidence and conducting a thorough inquiry in alignment with the allegations raised in the complaint. Following a comprehensive 
review and unanimous approval by the committee members, the final report is shared with the affected parties and the management. 
Any necessary actions are then taken based on the committee's findings and recommendations.

company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
The Company operates in the Financial Services sector and does not engage in the manufacturing or production of physical goods. 
As a result, there is no generation of hazardous or toxic waste. The waste generated within our facilities is strictly administrative 
in nature.
All waste materials are meticulously segregated and stored in accordance with regulatory norms. The general waste is collected 
periodically from Angel One offices and is disposed through the local municipal corporation. Electronic waste is specifically collected 
and disposed of through authorized recyclers, leading to the recognition of our initiatives with a green certificate. This certification 
underscores our commitment to environmentally responsible practices, even in areas beyond our core business activities.

operations with minimum of built-up area. Hence EIA is not applicable. However, Angel One has embarked on a comprehensive ESG strategy 
exercise in FY 2024 whereby the material ESG topics that might have a direct and indirect impact on the environment have been identified 
through a rigorous process that involved obtaining stakeholder inputs too. The Company will establish strategic targets and initiatives to 
address any negative environmental impacts from such material topics.

9The significant difference in e-waste between FY22-23 and FY23-24 is due to a major laptop update in FY22-23, making it an exceptional year. We expect future 
e-waste trends to align with FY23-24 levels.
10Due to nature of its operations and being predominantly located in leased buildings, the company currently does not monitor the non-hazardous waste 
generated from its offices on a standalone basis. However, such waste which predominantly includes paper, food, plastics are segregated and disposed to the 
respective municipal corporation through the building management for treatment and disposal.
