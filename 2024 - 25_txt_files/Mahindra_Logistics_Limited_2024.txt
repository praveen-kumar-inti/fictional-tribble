1
Climate, 
Environment 
and GHG
R
As transportation is the 
primary activity, MLL remains 
conscious of its contributions 
to climate change through 
emissions.
The Company is a 
signatory to the Science 
Based Target initiative 
(SBTi) and is committed to 
becoming carbon neutral 
by 2040. The revalidation 
of its SBTi targets is 
currently in progress. In 
addition, the Company is 
a member of The Climate 
Pledge (TCP), working 
collectively with other 
member organisations to 
mitigate climate change.
Negative: There has been an 
increase in operating costs 
to meet environmental 
standards, coupled with 
a low willingness among 
stakeholders to share 
or bear the additional 
expenses.
2
Customer 
satisfaction
O
It remains among the 
top priorities and holds 
significant importance for 
MLL’s continuously growing 
business.
Continuous formal and 
informal interactions 
with customers, along 
with annual customer 
satisfaction surveys, assist 
MLL in understanding 
precise requirements and 
resolving queries on a 
periodic basis.
Positive: MLL aims to 
improve competitiveness 
and adapt to client 
expectations by leveraging 
its expertise in low-carbon 
solutions.
3
Energy 
efficiency
O
Energy efficiency supports 
organisations in reducing 
both environmental impact 
and costs.
This is addressed through 
the Accelerated Cost 
Efficiency (ACE) energy 
efficiency project 
implemented across 
locations with defined 
targets. The 'Green Hour', 
which involves switching 
off lights on the last 
Saturday of every month 
across facilities, also 
contributes to this effort.
Positive: Cost savings, 
decreased environmental 
impact, are the outcomes.
4
Employee 
training and 
development
O
Well-trained employees 
contribute positively to MLL’s 
operational performance.
Training needs are 
identified at the 
beginning of the year, 
and relevant trainings are 
provided to employees 
accordingly. Training 
has been incorporated 
as a mandatory Key 
Result Area (KRA) for all 
employees.
Positive: The Company 
facilitates a best-in-class 
employee experience, 
positively influencing its 
ability to attract, hire, train, 
engage, and retain quality 
talent.
S.

(Indicate positive or

5
Ethics and 
Code of 
Conduct
R
Deviations by employees 
from ethical norms and 
the code of conduct can 
significantly impact MLL's 
reputation.
MLL’s Code of Conduct 
is a comprehensive 
document that covers 
all relevant aspects, with 
regular training sessions 
conducted for employees.
Negative: Impact on the 
Company’s reputation 
and the trust of its 
stakeholders.
6
Focus on 
renewable 
energy
O
Renewable energy helps 
organisations reduce their 
environmental impact.
All new built-to-suit 
(BTS) facilities and select 
brownfield locations 
have been equipped with 
rooftop solar installations.
Positive: Ensuring the 
Company’s sustainable 
growth while contributing 
to environmental well-
being.
7
Occupational 
health and 
safety
R
Health and safety is a top 
priority for the Company, as 
any accident significantly 
impacts costs, lives, 
reputation, and other areas.
MLL holds ISO 45001 
certification and 
conducts regular training 
sessions for employees 
across locations through 
multiple channels.
Negative: Impact on MLL's 
reputation and the trust of 
employees and partners in 
the Company.
8
Corporate 
governance
R
Strong corporate 
governance supports the 
achievement of MLL's 
purpose and mission while 
mitigating risks that could 
undermine stakeholder trust, 
damage reputation, and 
disrupt business.
Corporate governance 
framework
Negative: Impact on the 
Company’s reputation and 
on stakeholder trust.
9
Supply chain 
sustainability
O
Functioning on an asset-light 
model makes our operations 
heavily dependent on 
our suppliers or business 
associates (BAs) and hence 
sustainable operations of our 
BA’s play a critical role for 
our operations
BA engagement cell plays 
a vital role for keeping 
a regular connect with 
our BAs ensuring smooth 
operations, regular 
updates, conducting 
awareness sessions, skill 
building etc.
Positive: Well performing 
and compliant BAs will 
provide efficient and 
uninterrupted services 
ultimately ensuring 
smooth and prospering 
business
10
Community
R
Community is a very 
important stakeholder 
for any business and can 
have extreme impacts 
positive/negative. The 
mandate on CSR spend 
as per the regulations 
by the government for 
the community with its 
publication in public domain 
is another important aspect 
that can impact a business 
activity
MLL is well connected 
to the urban/rural 
communities in and 
around its operations 
with listening 
mechanisms to 
understand the needs 
of the community and 
attempt to address them 
as per our CSR policy
Negative: Impact on the 
Company’s reputation and 
stakeholder trust

Note 1 
The Additional Commissioner of State Tax, Telangana State, Hyderabad, by an Order dated 11 October 2023, partially allowed 
the appeal filed by the Company concerning the disallowance of VAT levied under the Composite Scheme for the period April 
2015 to June 2017. The Order granted a conditional stay on the collection of 50% of the disputed penalty, directing the 
Company to pay the remaining 50% to the Appellate Deputy Commissioner.
Accordingly, the Company in its Annual Report for FY 2023-2024, had mentioned that it had paid a penalty of Rs 1.75 crore 
during the financial year 2023-2024.
Subsequently, the Additional Commissioner of State Tax, Telangana State, Hyderabad, issued another Order dated 3 May 2024 
(Order), granting a conditional stay on one-third of the disputed penalty and directing the Company to pay two-thirds of the 
disputed penalty. This resulted in a further reduction of the stay on the penalty by ` 0.58 crores.
Following this in 2023-2024, MLL filed a Writ Petition with the Hon’ble High Court of Telangana challenging the Order. The 
Hon’ble High Court of Telangana, by an Order dated 11 June 2024, allowed the petition, set aside the Order of the CST, and 
granted a stay on the collection of 50% of the disputed penalty, amounting to ` 1.75 crores. This restored the Company’s 
status to what it was prior to the CST’s Order.
Details of the penalty are as follows:
a) The total disputed penalty amounts to ` 3.50 crores.
b) As per the Order dated 11 June 2024, an amount of ` 1.75 crores (50% of the total disputed penalty) is stayed.
c) The penalty paid in FY 2023-24 was ` 1.75 crores.
d) No penalty has been paid in FY 2024-25.

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web link.
The Mahindra Logistics – India Business Continuity Plan (BCP), hereafter referred to as ‘the Plan’, outlines the necessary 
steps for recovering defined critical services in the event of a disaster or emergency.
The Plan is intended as a dynamic, evolving document. As MLL integrates more advanced and complex applications and 
technologies, continuous updates are essential. Any changes in the scope or depth of services provided must be reflected 
within the Plan to ensure continued relevance.
Its structure is designed to minimise the confusion typically associated with crises and ensure that the required 
information and resources for recovery are readily available. By identifying key requirements and documenting roles and 
responsibilities in advance, the Plan provides organisational structure and clearly defined teams throughout the recovery 
process. Establishing priorities for actions and events beforehand improves decision-making and supports team members 
who may need to assume unfamiliar responsibilities during a high-pressure situation.
The Plan also outlines anticipated recovery activities to assist MLL employees in preparing and planning ahead. This clarity 
supports realistic expectations and strengthens the collaborative effort required for effective recovery.
A disaster or emergency refers to an unexpected man-made or natural event that affects normal operations and may 
result in severe damage to business operations or personnel unless timely actions are taken. This Plan serves as a 
guide to ensure the continuity of MLL’s operations and its customers’ automated applications by providing emergency 
management and recovery strategies until critical services are restored to near-normal levels.
	
Purpose: The primary objective of this document is to offer a predefined framework of actions for MLL employees to 
respond effectively during disasters or emergencies. It is designed to empower the Emergency Response Team in managing 
both identified and unforeseen threats to operations. Additionally, it outlines the responsibilities of the Management Team 
and relevant departmental or sectional heads in supporting business continuity efforts.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
Transportation is the core activity of MLL’s business, and given its asset-light model, the Company relies heavily on value 
chain partners for the assets required for transport. MLL recognises the environmental impact of these operations, 
particularly in terms of emissions. In response, its value chain partners have initiated measures such as integrating 
EVs into their fleets, transitioning from diesel to CNG, shifting transportation modes from road to rail, and engaging in 
tree plantation drives, among others. Additionally, several climate change awareness sessions and workshops have been 
conducted with the involvement of BAs.
7.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for 
environmental impacts.
	
Business Associates are implementing sustainability-related projects at their respective facilities and regularly sharing 
updates, which are reported through the Internal BA Newsletter. These initiatives are also presented to other BAs 
during site visits, with the aim of encouraging similar efforts. However, no environmental impact assessments have been 
conducted for these partners.
