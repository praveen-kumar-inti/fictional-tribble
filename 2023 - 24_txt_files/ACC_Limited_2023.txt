(Indicate positive

1.
Water 
management
Risk and
Opportunity
Risk – Water being a shared resource, 
it is essential for business to use 
it in a responsible way. These risks 
comprise conflicts with local 
communities and stakeholders 
over water rights and usage, 
potential water scarcity or quality 
issues due to over-extraction or 
pollution, and regulatory constraints 
on water abstraction permits or 
discharge standards.
Opportunity – By demonstrating 
commitment to conserving water 
resources, we can build stronger 
relationships with local communities 
and government. This will help us 
in securing and maintaining social 
license to operate, especially in 
water-stressed regions. In future, the 
company may qualify for government 
incentives aimed at promoting water 
conservation and sustainability 
initiatives.
We have been investing in 
rainwater harvesting initiatives, 
restoring village ponds, 
construction of check dams, 
water conservation at closed 
mines and groundwater recharge 
for a long time to mitigate 
the risk of lack of water. As 
a result, the company is now 
water positive.
Negative/Positive
2.
Air quality
Risk
Exposure to dust, Sox, Nox and other 
pollutants from cement plants can 
lead to respiratory issues among 
employees and nearby communities. 
This may lead to increased costs 
associated with healthcare for 
affected employees, and insurance 
premiums. The company may also 
face opposition, protests and even 
legal restrictions on its operations.
We focus on improving air 
emissions and the surrounding 
environment. We monitor the 
plants’ stack emissions through 
the Continuous Emission 
Monitoring System. We work 
on upgradation of electrostatic 
precipitations and replacement 
of damaged bags to control dust 
emissions. We take primary and 
secondary measures to control 
NOx emissions.
Negative
3.
Circular 
Economy
Opportunity Circular economy offers great 
opportunity to lower the use of 
natural resources and fossil fuels 
in cement production and reduces 
carbon emissions.

4.
Climate and 
Energy
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Climate change poses 
multiple physical risks like flooding, 
temperature rise, water stress etc. 
Emerging and potential regulations 
may introduce or escalate regulatory 
risks. These extreme weather events 
can cause infrastructure damage, 
may hinder the supply chain network 
affecting timely delivery of raw 
materials and finished products. It 
may also cause power outages and 
affect the manufacturing processes.
Opportunity – Energy cost is a major 
cost in cement manufacturing. We 
continuously strive to reduce our 
specific thermal energy consumption 
and specific electrical energy 
consumption to optimise our energy 
costs. In addition, it is directly 
related to carbon emissions and by 
optimising energy consumption, we 
can lower our carbon emissions.
The Company has approximately 
90% of products in its portfolio 
which are blended products with 
lower carbon footprint.
Further, we are investing more 
and more in renewal energy and 
green energy from WHRS. In 
addition, we have set ambitious 
targets for Thermal Substitution 
Rates (TSR) by using alternate 
fuels.
Negative/Positive
5.
Biodiversity
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Land disturbance and habitat 
fragmentation from operational 
activities can lead to biodiversity 
degradation.
Opportunity – Restored ecosystems 
can provide long-term environmental 
benefits, including enhanced 
ecosystem services such as water 
filtration, carbon sequestration, and 
soil preservation. These benefits 
not only contribute to global 
environmental goals but also can 
have positive economic implications 
for the company and local 
communities in the long run.
We adhere to Indian national 
regulations and are a signatory 
to the India Business and 
Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) of 
the Confederation of Indian 
Industry (CII), and Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). We assess 
the impacts on biodiversity and 
ecosystem services through set 
KPIs. This helps in conservation 
of ecosystem.
Negative/Positive
6.
Sustainable 
Construction
Opportunity Intervention of sustainable practices 
and technologies such as substitute 
cementitious materials, CO2 capture 
in the built environment, and 
efficient concrete use help drive 
down carbon emissions from cement 
production and hence help to reduce 
the carbon footprint.
_
Positive
7.
Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity Through continuous learning and 
development and strengthened 
employee relations, we can mitigate 
succession planning risks, address 
skills gaps and ensure continuity 
of leadership and expertise. It will 
also help in being competitive in 
the marketplace and stay ahead of 
trends. Human Capital development 
will also contribute to an overall 
learning culture in the organisation.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity Employee diversity leads to increased 
creativity and innovation, improved 
communication and teamwork, 
and a greater understanding and 
appreciation of different cultures. 
Additionally, a diverse workforce 
can help to attract and retain top 
talent and can provide a competitive 
advantage for organisations.
_
Positive
9.
Human 
Rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Concerns related to child/
forced labour, discrimination or any 
other human rights-related aspects 
within the workforce and value chain 
may lead to statutory violations 
which may negatively impact the 
brand image.
Opportunity – Alignment with 
the human rights principles and 
procedures safeguard the employees 
and value chain partners and ensure 
zero incidents of non-compliance 
with regards to International and 
National Human Rights Standards 
and Regulations.
We are committed to respecting 
and promoting human rights 
across the value chain by 
inculcating a human rights policy. 
The policy is in line with The 
Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, Social Accountability 
8000 (SA8000) Standard 
and International Treaties & 
Conventions related to Human 
Rights.
Negative/Positive
10.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk – Failure to protect workers from 
occupational hazards can result in 
legal action, fines, and compensation 
claims against the company. These 
risks can lead to significant financial 
liabilities and damage the company's 
reputation. Also, potential employees 
may hesitate from joining the 
company, and current employees may 
leave if they perceive their health and 
safety are not adequately protected, 
leading to challenges in attracting 
and retaining a skilled workforce.
Opportunity – By prioritising the 
well-being of all employees and 
workers, the company can enhance 
its employer brand, making it a more 
attractive place to work. Employees 
are more likely to join and stay with 
a company that prioritises their well-
being, leading to lower turnover rates 
and higher employee satisfaction.
We have developed safety 
initiatives including competency 
development, training, audits, 
inspections, surveys, We Care 
initiatives, Critical Control 
Management to prevent 
unwanted events, and especial 
cross-functional teams to 
drive process safety. Also, we 
conduct safety audits across our 
manufacturing sites to ensure 
that the actions are timely closed 
and implemented
Negative/Positive
11.
Community 
Relations
Opportunity Uplifting livelihood opportunities 
improves community relations which 
is essential for the social license to 
operate. Also, a healthy community 
will ensure availability of strong local 
labour force, if required at any given 
point of time.

Customer 
Relationship 
Management
Opportunity CRM empowers to build a positive 
customer experience based on 
relevant, real-time information and 
customer needs that matters to the 
business. It would enable data driven 
decision making, improved customer 
experience and hence drive growth 
in business by increasing loyalty and 
enhancing relations.
_
Positive
13.
Corporate 
Governance 
and business 
ethics
Opportunity Effective governance mechanism in 
the organisation gives an opportunity 
of building greater trust among the 
stakeholders and creates long-term 
value for them.
_
Positive
14.
Risk 
Management
Opportunity Enhanced Risk awareness and 
in-place emergency preparedness 
plans help to better foresee risks 
that may emerge due to climate 
change, regulations, and geopolitical 
developments. This helps to stay 
one step ahead and ensure business 
continuity and regulatory resilience.
_
Positive
15.
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk – Improper usage of resources, 
human rights violations, non-
compliance with Supplier Code 
of Conduct, zero adoption of 
sustainable practices by suppliers can 
adversely impact the environment, 
social wellbeing, value chain and 
brand image. Additionally, it might 
also lead to cases of regulatory non-
compliances and fines.
Opportunity – The company can 
leverage suppliers near operations 
to reduce costs, for greater control, 
quicker response and helps in cutting 
down significant emissions related to 
transportation.
Supply chain and sourcing 
process has a direct impact 
on the environment and 
communities such as emissions, 
circular economy, water usage, 
biodiversity, material usage and 
human rights. We have taken 
measures to ensure an optimum 
supply chain with competent 
suppliers.
Negative/Positive
16.
Information 
technology 
and data 
privacy
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk – Instances of information 
security breaches could lead to 
loss of sensitive data of customers 
including personal information. 
It could also lead to increased 
media scrutiny resulting in a loss 
of stakeholder trust, company 
reputation and regulatory fines or 
penalties.
Opportunity – In the ever-evolving 
landscape of digitalisation and 
innovation, monitoring and analysis 
of data in real time would lead to 
quicker identification and resolution 
of issues. As a result, this will 
ensure management of systems and 
processes more effectively.
With increased digitisation, and 
heavy dependence on technology 
systems, it has become critical 
for us to ensure implementation 
of SOPs and policies, conduction 
periodic internal and external 
(third-party) audits and tests 
to check the resilience of the 
IT infrastructure from hackers, 
cyber-attacks, malware etc.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
The successful involvement of our stakeholders is essential to the achievement of our strategic goals because 
it provides us with the opportunity to understand their expectations, respond to their concerns, and assist us 
in prioritising the areas in which we should be concentrating our efforts. Our mechanism for engaging with 
stakeholders is governed by our Stakeholder Engagement Policy (https://www.acclimited.com/assets/new/pdf/
Stakeholder%20Engagement%20policy.pdf), which is further aligned with global best practises.
	
We identify stakeholders as groups and individuals, who can influence or/are impacted by our operations/activities, 
change in technology, regulations, market and societal trends either directly or indirectly. Stakeholders comprise 
of communities, employees, supply chain partners, customers, investors, regulators, industrial organisations etc. 
Against each group, the potential ways in which stakeholders will be affected as well as the magnitude of both 
the actual and perceived impacts have been determined. This assists the company in developing a bespoke plan 
for engaging with stakeholders, which can then be kept up to date as and when is necessary.
	
Throughout the course of the year, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the many stakeholders by utilising a variety 
of channels of contact. The insights that we gain from these projects are tremendously helpful, because they 
allow us to continually enhance both our strategy and our operations. The process of engaging stakeholders also 
includes regular feedback and grievance redressal methods, both of which are vital components of the process.
