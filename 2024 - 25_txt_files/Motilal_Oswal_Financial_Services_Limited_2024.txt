Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace: The Company has implemented a comprehensive 
Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (“POSH”) at the Workplace and it is applicable to all associates/
employees across locations, events, and training programs. In alignment with the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition And Redressal) Act, 2013 and the Vishaka Guidelines, this policy 
aims to ensure a safe, respectful, and gender-sensitive work environment by preventing and redressing 
incidents of sexual harassment. The policy defines sexual harassment broadly and applies to interactions 
between employees, and between employees and outsiders, both within and outside the workplace, while 
offering support for any related legal proceedings. A duly constituted Internal Complaints Committee (“ICC”), 
comprising internal and external members, is empowered to investigate complaints confidentially and 
recommend disciplinary actions including warnings, demotion, dismissal, or legal escalation, depending on 
the gravity of the offence. The committee follows a structured procedure for handling complaints, ensuring 
impartiality, protection for complainants, and timely resolution within 30 days. The policy is governed and

interpretation and application, and subject to periodic review and amendment.

to encourage employees, directors, and associated individuals to report unethical behavior, violations of laws, 
company policies, or any form of misconduct, including leakage of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information 
(UPSI), without fear of retaliation. The policy ensures confidentiality, protection against victimization, and 
a structured procedure for investigation and resolution of complaints by the Audit Committee. It applies 
to internal and external whistleblowers and outlines roles, eligibility, protections, and possible disciplinary 
actions while reinforcing the company’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and compliance with 
regulatory provisions. 
	
An employee may send communication through e-mail to whistleblower@motilaloswal.com. The employee 
may also send a communication directly in writing through a letter (Protected Disclosures) to Chairman, 
Audit Committee. Additional modes of communication or access may be made available to employees in 
appropriate or exceptional situations.
	
Equal Opportunity Policy: the Equal Opportunity Policy of the Company is aimed at fostering an inclusive 
and diverse workplace free from discrimination based on age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, or other 
personal characteristics, in line with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. It outlines responsibilities 
of the HR Department and a designated Liaison Officer to ensure accessibility, prevent discrimination, and 
maintain confidentiality regarding disability-related information. As part of its grievance redressal mechanism, 
the policy allows employees to report any irregularities or concerns related to equal opportunity by emailing 
whistleblower@motilaloswal.com with a commitment to address and resolve such queries within 48 hours, 
while the Head of HR holds the final authority in case of any policy interpretation issues.
	
Code of Conduct for employees: The Company’s Code of Conduct applies to all employees and mandates 
ethical behavior, integrity, client confidentiality, and compliance with laws and company policies. Employees 
must avoid corruption, unauthorized communications, and misuse of company resources. Violations can

through employee volunteering, resulting 
in the planting of 1,100 trees. Additionally, 
3,000 saplings were planted under the 
Company’s CSR initiatives. The Company 
also supported a mass fruit tree plantation 
initiative on the lands of marginal farmers 
to promote sustainable livelihoods.
The initiative contributed to promoting 
ecological balance by enhancing 
green cover, improving air quality, and

Irrigation 
Plant
The Company, in collaboration with MO 
Foundation and Keshav Srushti, has 
implemented a Solar Water Irrigation Plant 
in Dhindepada Village, located in Wada, 
Palghar.
The project has benefited several marginal 
farmers by ensuring reliable access to 
water for irrigation, thereby improving 
crop yields, reducing dependence on 
traditional water sources, and enhancing 
agricultural productivity in the region.

Installation 
of Farmers 
Training 
Centre
The Company, in collaboration with Global 
Vikas Trust, has established “GVT Krishikul,” a 
25-acre training center for farmers in Beed, 
Maharashtra. The center provides practical 
training on modern and sustainable 
farming techniques, crop diversification, 
and efficient resource use.
More than 2,000 farmers have been 
trained at the center, leading to improved 
agricultural practices, increased farm 
productivity, and enhanced income levels 
for farming communities in the region.
6.
Installation 
of LED Lights 
instead of 
Conventional 
lights
Over 3,000 units of LED light fixtures were 
installed to replace conventional lighting 
systems.
The initiative resulted in substantial 
energy savings by replacing traditional 
bulbs with energy-efficient LED lights, 
which consume up to 75% less electricity. 
It also contributed to lowering the carbon 
footprint, reducing maintenance costs 
due to longer lifespan of LEDs, and 
promoting environmental sustainability 
through improved energy efficiency.
7.
Waste 
recycling
We have engaged ourselves with Registered 
Vendor who manage waste for us at our 
tower locations for wet and dry waste.
Currently we have only commissioned 
Registered Vendor for one location but 
subsequently we would engage them for 
other locations as well depending on the 
quality of service.
In FY 2024-25, 8.17 metric tonnes of dry 
waste and 8.19 metric tonnes of wet waste 
were generated and recycled.
Further, 2.90 metric tonnes of e-waste was 
generated and disposed safely.
8.
Tap Water 
Installation
The Company has installed tap water 
purification system at our Head Office with 
the goal of reducing the environmental 
impact of consuming tap water versus 
bottled water and having better mineral 
content.
In addition, tap water systems are more 
affordable than bottle water.
Tap water is safe, better for the 
environment, less expensive and offers 
health benefits such as fluoride that 
may be lacking in many bottled water 
products.
9.
Dual Flush 
Valves 
Toilets
With a view of less water consumption 
for flushing liquid waste and positive 
environmental impact, the Company has 
installed dual flush valves toilets in Head 
& Corporate Office and in some of the 
branches.
Under dual flush system, we have two 
options to select i.e. a half flush and a full 
flush. A half flush is ideal for liquid wastes 
and a full flush is used for solid wastes.
Older toilet valves models would use as 
much as 15 liters per flush, a dual toilet 
loaves flush system uses only about 7 
liters each flush.
10.
Moved from 
physical 
server to 
virtual 
servers
The Company has undertaken a significant 
infrastructure upgradation. We have 
transitioned from traditional physical 
servers to more efficient and flexible virtual 
server environments.
This initiative of the Company ensure 
scalability, improved resource utilization, 
enhanced disaster recovery, increased 
flexibility and mobility, reduced downtime 
and saves operating expenses.

a comprehensive framework to manage and mitigate cyber risks, including those related to data privacy. 
The policy is aligned with regulatory guidelines, including SEBI’s cybersecurity circulars, and follows global 
standards such as NIST and ISO/IEC. It outlines critical areas such as identity management, access control, 
vulnerability assessments, incident response, and business continuity planning, helping Company proactively 
prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.
	
The policy also defines governance mechanisms, including the formation of a Cybersecurity Committee 
comprising senior leadership and independent experts. This Committee is responsible for overseeing 
implementation, conducting bi-annual reviews, and responding to incidents. The policy ensures that all

The Information Security Policy further includes a Data Privacy section, which lays down controls for managing 
personally identifiable information (PII) in compliance with applicable regulations. It sets out data classification 
guidelines, usage protocols, secure storage, and secure destruction processes. The Company also mandates 
confidentiality agreements, privacy training for employees, and clearly defined roles and responsibilities for 
information owners and custodians to uphold data protection.
	
While these policies are not publicly available due to their confidential nature, they are accessible internally 
to all relevant stakeholders and are reviewed bi-annually to remain aligned with evolving cybersecurity risks 
and regulatory expectations. Together, these frameworks demonstrate Company’s strong commitment to 
maintaining a secure and resilient information environment.

The Board of Directors,
Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited, 
Motilal Oswal Tower, Gokhale Sayani Road, 
Prabhadevi, Mumbai - 400 025
Subject: Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on KPIs/Metrics in the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (hereafter 
referred to as “the Company”) for the Financial Year Ended March 31, 2025
1. 	
Introduction and Scope
	
Moore Singhi Advisors LLP (“Moore Singhi” or “we” or “us”) has been engaged by Motilal Oswal Financial 
Services Limited to provide independent reasonable assurance on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / 
metrics under nine (9) ESG attributes (listed in Annexure 1) that form part of Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (“BRSR Core”) issued under SEBI Master Circular: SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155, Section 
IV-B, issued on November 11, - 2024 titled “Master circular for compliance with the provisions of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 by listed 
entities” read with SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42, on March 28, 2025 titled “Measures to facilitate 
ease of doing business with respect to framework for assurance or assessment, ESG disclosures for value 
chain, and introduction of voluntary disclosure on green credits.” and under the terms of the engagement 
letter dated November 21, 2024. 
	
Our assurance on disclosures is for the period starting from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. We have not 
performed any procedures for the earlier periods or any other elements included in the BRSR report, and 
therefore do not express any opinion thereon.
	
The reporting boundary for the BRSR disclosures includes the Company’s operations, comprising eighty eight 
offices across India, covering North, East, West and South zones. (Refer Annexure 2)
2. 	 Management Responsibilities
	
The Company’s management is responsible for the selection of the reporting criteria, reporting period, reporting 
boundary, preparation, and disclosure of BRSR information and the BRSR Core KPIs / metrics under the nine 
attributes as per “Annexure I – Format of BRSR Core” of the aforesaid Circular.  This responsibility includes 
stakeholder engagement; design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control, including policies 
and processes; maintenance of adequate records; calculations; making estimates that are reasonable in the 
circumstances; and ensuring that they are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Moore 
Singhi was not involved in the preparation of the BRSR report, BRSR Core KPIs and/or related backup data.
3. 	 Moore Singhi’s Responsibilities
	
Our responsibility is to provide reasonable assurance on the BRSR Core KPIs based on the procedures we 
have performed and the evidence we have obtained from the Company. We do not accept or assume any 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organization. We have considered quantitative 
materiality and qualitative factors in; (i) planning the scope of our work and evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) evaluating the effect of any identified misstatements in the BRSR Core. Moore Singhi expressly 
disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity would make based on this 
assurance statement and for any damages in case erroneous data is reported. This assurance engagement 
relies on the assumption that all data and information provided by the Company is accurate and complete.
	
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information, and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410: Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements. In addition, we have also referenced SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/
CIR/P/0155, November 11, 2024, SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 December 20, 2024, as well as the 
terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with the Company in the engagement letter dated 
November 21, 2024.

Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether, in all material respects, the KPIs presented to us are prepared in accordance with the reporting 
criteria chosen by the Company as per the Circular.
	
A reasonable assurance engagement includes performing procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
evidence assessing the risk of material misstatement of the KPIs disclosed in BRSR Core. In this connection, 
we have performed the following procedures:
	
1.	
Evaluated the suitability of the quantification methods used for the BRSR Core KPIs.
	
2.	
Engaged in discussions with the personnel at both corporate and facilities responsible for the information 
presented in the report.
	
3.	
On a sample basis, verified the data collected, recorded, and aggregated to ensure the veracity of the 
reporting. 
	
4.	
Enquired with the senior management of the Company and obtained management representation 
towards all the stated matters of the report.
	
Exclusions:
	
•	
Management controls, including testing internal controls or verifying the aggregation and calculation 
of data within the IT systems.
	
•	
The Company’s statements that describe expressions of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or 
future intentions or any forward-looking assertions and/or data.
	
•	
Review of the ‘economic and/or financial performance indicators’ included in the Report or on which 
KPI reporting is based.
4.	
Inherent Limitations
	
The reliability of assurance on non-financial information is subject to uncertainties inherent in the assurance 
process.  The lack of a significant universal body of established practice for measuring and evaluating non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques, potentially 
affecting comparability between entities.  Specifically, the uncertainties in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
estimation arise due to incomplete scientific knowledge, limitations in quantification models, assumptions, 
or conversion factors used to arrive at results. Due to these inherent limitations, there are possibilities that 
material misstatements in the sustainability information of the BRSR Core KPIs in the Report may remain 
undetected. The application of this assurance statement is limited to the aforementioned “Circular”.
5. 	 Opinion 
	
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, as detailed in Section 3 of this report, along 
with the information, explanations, and management representations provided to us, we are of the opinion that 
the BRSR Core KPIs, as listed in Annexure 1 to this report, have been prepared in accordance with the criteria 
selected by the Company, in line with the requirements outlined in the Circular.
6. 	 Restriction on Use 
	
Our work was performed solely to assist management in meeting their responsibilities in relation to the 
Company’s assurance requirements as per the Circular. The report is addressed and provided to the 
Board of Directors of the Company, solely for the purpose of enabling it to comply with the aforementioned 
requirements of the Circular, and should not be used, referred to or distributed for any other purpose or to 
any other party without our prior written consent. Accordingly, we do not accept or assume any liability or 
duty of care for any other purpose for which or to any other person to whom this assurance report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come without our prior consent in writing. 
	
Other than as described in paragraph 1, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform 
any assurance procedures on the remaining information. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on that 
information.
