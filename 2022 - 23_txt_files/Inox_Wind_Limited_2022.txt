Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or 
negative)
1
Chemicals used 
as raw materials 
and the process 
waste of 
composites 
in blades are 
hazardous in 
nature.
Risk
1.	 Chemicals scrap, if not 
disposed of safely as 
per Pollution Control 
norms, may harm the 
soil.
2.	 Epoxy chemicals 
in its raw form 
(without mixing with 
its hardener) will 
contaminate ground 
water, if they are 
touching directly the 
soil.
The Company is disposing 
of the uncured and/or 
hazardous waste as per 
norms prescribed by the 
State Pollution Control 
Board for incineration 
& then land filling, co-
processing, etc. by 
generating the Statutory 
Manifest.
The Company is bearing 
the cost of such safe 
disposal of hazardous 
waste in terms of internal 
segregation, processing in 
machines, transportation 
to safe processing units, 
etc. as a part of its daily 
production activities. 
Required resources are 
accordingly budgeted, 
which is a major cost to 
the company for the safe 
disposal of hazardous 
wastes.
2
Risk of lawsuits
Risk
Any error of judgment in 
execution of contract or 
selection of projects site 
will lead to litigation and 
loss of repute.
In order to have better 
control and take timely 
steps towards risk 
mitigation, alongside the 
quarterly review, we have 
also started a monthly 
review mechanism and 
a weekly MIS update 
to management about 
potential risk and mitigation 
for the litigations listed 
in the next week or next 
month.
Defending against lawsuits 
can be expensive, which 
includes Legal fees, expert 
witness costs, and other 
related expenses that can 
quickly add up and strain 
the company’s financial 
resources.
3
Risk of not 
getting 
additional funds
Risk
Wind Generation 
projects typically require 
significant upfront capital 
investment. If additional 
fund are not obtained, 
it may lead to delays 
or even cancellation 
of critical project 
components, hindering 
the project’s successful 
implementation.
We are in the process of 
launching a 3.3 MW turbine, 
which will be a cash cow 
for the organization. Also, 
we are about to raise 
money through the IPO 
of our wholly owned 
subsidiary, which will 
deleverage the company. 
Further, promoters are 
also infusing equity into the 
company. We do not see 
any challenge in obtaining 
the desired funds & 
servicing the debts.
Insufficient funds can 
lead to delays in project 
development or in more 
severe cases, result in the 
cancellation of the project. 
These delays can increase 
overall project costs and 
may cause the company 
to miss out on potential 
revenue streams.

A limitless journey towards Sustainability:
The Company is pledged to develop sustainable solutions that will benefit the future generations and underscores our 
commitment to promoting renewable energy as a key pillar of India’s energy mix. Following are objectives for which we strive 
for:
•	 Renewable Energy Generation: The primary objective of our company is to generate clean and renewable energy from 
wind resources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.
•	 Carbon Emission Reduction: We often set targets to reduce carbon emissions associated with energy production. This 
can include monitoring and minimizing emissions from the construction and operation of wind farms, as well as the entire 
supply chain.
•	 Resource Efficiency: Maximizing the efficiency of wind turbines and wind farms is crucial. The company aims to optimize 
the design and operation of turbines to extract the maximum energy from the wind, minimizing waste and maximizing the 
use of available resources.
Short term Priorities:
1.	 Reduction in Resources Consumption: The Company will improve the energy efficiency of its wind turbines and 
manufacturing processes, which will result in higher energy output per unit and reduce resource consumption.
2.	 Waste Reduction: The Company will ensure sustainable sourcing of materials and responsible waste management 
practices to reduce waste.
Mid-term Priorities:
1.	 Environment Conservation: Wind energy companies prioritize environmental conservation. The Company will conduct 
environmental impact assessments before constructing wind farms, ensuring proper land use and wildlife protection while 
minimizing any negative effects on the ecosystem.
2.	 Health and Safety: The Company may implement robust safety measures, training programs, and occupational health 
incentives to protect its workforce and minimize any adverse impact on local communities.
Broader Trends Influencing Sustainability Priorities are: 
1.	 Climate Change: As the world becomes more aware of climatic changes, we harness the power of wind to generate clean, 
renewable electricity. By displacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation, wind energy reduces CO2 and other pollutants 
that contribute to climatic changes.
2.	 Resources Depletion: Wind energy is a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based power generation. Here we are 
promoting electricity generation from Wind turbines that will reduce the depletion of non-renewable sources such as coal, 
natural gas etc.
3.	 Consumer demand: Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social impacts of traditional energy 
sources. As we produce renewable energy, we contribute to meeting consumer demand.
4.	 Regulations and standards: Governments and industry bodies are introducing regulations and standards to promote 
sustainability while mitigating the potential impact on wildlife, ecosystem and local communities. The company needs to 
comply with these regulations to ensure that their projects meet the required environmental standards.
5.	 Noise and Visual Impact Mitigation: Address concerns related to noise and the visual impact on local communities. 
Employ advanced turbine designs, including quieter blades and tower structures, to reduce noise levels. Engage with local 
communities to ensure their input and address any visual concerns by considering appropriate turbine placements and 
designs.

followed by land filling. Disposal at the TSDF (Treatment 
Storage and Disposal Facility) site and for co-processing at 
the CHWIF (Common Hazardous Waste and Incineration 
Facility) facility for hazardous waste.
