True to our purpose, “Reimagining a healthier planet”, we believe that growth of society and community around organization is integral to 
PI’s growth.
A common thread ties our stakeholders together- our purpose to create value while keeping mankind at the center. We emphasize strongly 
on holistic well-being of our employees which is reflected in our human centric policies, career-oriented learning and development opportu-
nities and Health and Safety practices at our plants and offices.
Communities near our plant sites are an important stakeholder. We make constant efforts to enhance their livelihoods, access to good 
healthcare and education and promote rural value chains.
PI’s focus on creating value is also demonstrated in our focus on circularity and resource efficiency and minimizing environmental footprint. 
Eighty-nine percent of solvent used in our processes was recovered and used in last FY. Thirty-nine percent of the raw materials procured 
come from renewable sources, which makes up approximately 30% of our total products.
At PI, we recognize the urgent need to address challenges to achieve sustainable long-term growth and we have set ambitious targets for 
2025 to address these challenges.
One of the key challenges is reducing our carbon footprint, and we have set a target to reduce our specific CO2 emissions by 25% by 2025. 
. To achieve this, we have implemented various measures such as investing in renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and 
encouraging sustainable practices among our employees. We are also working towards reducing our waste and increasing use of sustainable 
materials.

a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, we strive to promote sustainability practices across the value chain. Our Sustainable procurement policy guidelines are applicable 
during our vendor on-boarding process. Usage of solar, wind energy, water conservation and waste reduction are encouraged among 
the vendors. As a Responsible Care company, we have been committed and compliant to absolute environmental safety and regulatory 
compliances.
The company has taken multiple initiatives:
•	
Annual Vendor meet: To understand sustainability objectives and progress on initiatives taken by each supplier. Suppliers are supported 
by our technical team’s guidance in running their business in a sustainable manner and compliant to all environmental rules and 
regulations.
•	
Packaging: Ongoing initiatives on the packaging of both raw materials and finished products are being taken. Procurement of raw 
materials in bulk, tankers or jumbo bags is encouraged to reduce handling of various types of packaging materials. The same leads to 
adherence of environmental and safety standards and helps in better utilization of container space resulting in a lower number of trips. 
Through our concentrated efforts, we continue to modify the packaging of its finished products to reduce the use of plastics and switch 
to recycled paper instead.
•	
Standardization of Packaging: Our new packaging is tamper-proof and adopts customer-friendly design architecture.
•	
Product Stewardship: We have introduced processes to strengthen product stewardship reviews by ensuring the involvement of 
technical experts from key departments such as operations and supply chain.
•	
Material Handling: We are sourcing bulk products and storing in tankers/ISO tankers instead of drums. The same has resulted in 
reduced drum handling and ensured adherence to key environmental and safety standards.
•	
The Company has engaged in dialogue with value chain partners regarding sustainable sourcing. Going forward, The Company is 
aiming to establish policies, implement goal setting and periodic reviews to ensure continuous improvement in the rate of sustainable 
sourcing

evaluating the significance of various issues raised by stakeholders based on their potential impact on our business and the broader social, 
environmental, and economic context. The materiality assessment helps us identify key areas where stakeholder expectations align with our 
business strategy and sustainability goals.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
At PI, we manage waste scientifically by segregation at source as per waste’s characteristics. The waste management philosophy of PI 
Industries is to reduce the amount of waste generated and effectively manage the waste generated. 
Low COD/Lows TDS wastewater is treated in Effluent Treatment Plant while High COD/High TDS wastewater is treated in in-house Multiple 
Effect Evaporator (MEE) first and then Common approved MEE facilities outside. Incinerable waste (solid and liquid) is sent for disposal to 
common incinerator facilities (TSDF) and to cement industries for co processing.
In line with principles of Responsible Care, use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in products is discouraged. At PI, we believe “what gets 
measured gets managed”. A ‘Product Lifecycle Approach’ to assess impacts of products across all stages of development has been adopted. 
At R&D stage, waste generation-based E-factor calculation has been adopted.
