Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk and 
opportunity
As a vertically integrated 
EV manufacturer with 
ambitious production 
targets, our supply chain 
is extensive and complex. 
It involves sourcing a wide 
array of components, 
from high-value battery 
cells (which often contain 
minerals, like cobalt and 
lithium, with environmental 
and social risks) to 
semiconductors, plastics, 
metals, and electronic 
components.
1.Resource Scarcity 
& Geopolitical Risk: 
Dependence on specific 
regions for critical 
minerals can lead to supply 
disruptions and price 
volatility.
2.Human Rights & Labor 
Practices: Risks of child 
labour, forced labour, and 
unsafe working conditions, 
particularly in raw material 
extraction and lower tiers 
of the   chain.
3.Environmental Impact: 
High carbon footprint 
from manufacturing 
and transportation of 
components, water 
usage in processing, 
and hazardous waste 
generation.
4.Brand Reputation: 
Any lapse in responsible 
sourcing can severely 
damage our progressive, 
tech-driven brand image.

and Audits: Beyond 
initial checks, OEM have 
implemented regular, risk-
based audits (third-party 
and internal) of direct and 
critical indirect suppliers, 
focusing on environmental 
performance, labour 
practices (e.g., working 
hours, wages, freedom of 
association), and human 
rights.
2.Supplier Code of Conduct 
and Capacity Building: OEM 
has set the expectations 
with the suppliers to ensure 
the code of conduct is 
adhered with. As part of 
the onboarding process, 
due diligence is performed 
to ensure the suppliers are 
compliant to the code.  
3.Supply Chain 
Diversification and 
Localization: OEM 
strategically have diversified 
the sourcing across 
regions and suppliers in 
a calculated manner to 
reduce geopolitical and 
concentration risks. The 
company have also actively 
promoted localization of 
component manufacturing 
within India to shorten 
supply lines, reduce transit 
emissions, and foster local 
economic development.

At OEM, we are deeply committed to ensuring the environmentally sound management of our 
products and packaging throughout their lifecycle, including their end-of-life. Our processes are 
designed to facilitate maximum material recovery through authorized reuse, recycling, and safe 
disposal through our vendor partners. We operate in full compliance with all legal requirements 
as specified by our operating permits, consents, and authorizations in India. Moving forward, our 
efforts are more focused to achieve the ambitious status of ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ across our 
operations. 
Our primary role in end-of-life management to ensure proper segregation, collection, and 
channelization of waste materials to specialized government-authorized vendors. We do not 
directly perform the physical acts of reuse, recycling, or complex disposal; instead, we collaborate 
with a network of certified recyclers and re-processors who undertake these specialized activities.

	y
Manufacturing Facility Practices: In our manufacturing facility, we ensure robust management 
of plastic waste. Waste is meticulously segregated as per material type at the source.
	y
Channelization & Destination: These segregated plastic materials are sold to authorized 
recyclers for conversion and utilization. This includes plastic components from our 
manufacturing process and packaging materials used internally.
	y
Product Packaging (End-Consumer): For the plastic packaging of our products and spare 
parts supplied to consumers and service centres, we aim to minimize plastic usage and 
maximize recyclability.

STATUTORY STATEMENTS
10.    Health and Safety management system:
a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ 
     No).If yes, the coverage such system?
Yes. OEM has implemented an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System. Our OHS Management 
System is designed to proactively manage risks and ensure a safe working environment for all employees and 
contractors.
The coverage of the OHS Management System includes the following key components, namely:
	y
OHS Policy: A formal policy outlining out commitment to health and safety which is distributed to all relevant 
stakeholders.
	y
Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA): We have formalized EHS guidelines and procedures to 
proactively identify workplace hazards, assess associated risks, and implement effective control measures to 
reduce risks to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable
	y
Incident Reporting & Investigation: We have formalized systematic processes for the reporting, investigation, 
and analysis of all work-related incidents, injuries, and near-misses to prevent recurrence.
Additionally, we have also instituted operational control procedures, such as:
	y
Factory Layout: We have formalized EHS Guidelines on Factory Layout that inform occupants of the premises 
about the safe design and layout of factory floors, equipment, and workstations.
	y
Work Permit System: We have formalized a robust Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) governing high-
risk activities to ensure necessary safety precautions are in place prior to the commencement of work and 
operations.
b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and  non-routine 
     basis by the entity?
OEM’s workplaces are equipped with Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) systems, and we have 
protocols in place for reporting and analyzing near-miss incidents and conducting post-impact assessments. We 
regularly conduct health and safety audits, run safety campaigns, and carry out periodic occupational health 
surveillance to ensure a safe working environment.	
At OLA Electric Mobility, we utilize a structured and multi-layered approach to identify and assess work-related 
hazards for both routine and non-routine activities. Our core approach is a combination of scheduled assessments 
and task-specific analysis.
At OEM, identification for Routine Activities include the following processes, namely: 
	y
Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA): A thorough HIRA is conducted for all the routine operational 
activities. These assessments are documented and reviewed periodically to ensure that they are current and 
relevant.
	y
Workplace Inspections & Audits: We have instituted formal schedules for regular workplace inspections and 
Fire & Safety Audits. To ensure corrective actions are implemented promptly, we have designed the schedules 
to proactively identify unsafe conditions, equipment, and practices, and to track non-conformities
Additionally, identification for Non-Routine Activities include the following assessments, namely:
	y
Job Safety Analysis (JSA): For any non-routine tasks, we perform a JSA prior to the commencement of work and 
operations. Under this process, we break down the task into steps to identify potential hazards and establish 
safe work procedures.
	y
Work Permit System: We manage high-risk, non-routine work through a formal Work Permit System. This 
Permit process is designed to mandate a specific risk assessment for the task at hand, ensuring hazards are 
identified and controlled before authorization is given. The identification processes that we have designed for 
both Routine and Non-Routine Activities are supported by our SOPs, safety training programs, and health & 
safety campaigns to ensure that our employees are aware of known hazards and control measures.
30
STATUTORY  STATEMENTS
c.

multiple channels in order to ensure that there are no barriers to communication. These channels include 
reporting to their immediate supervisor, contacting the EHS Department directly, or raising the issue with 
a representative of the on-site Safety Committee.
	y
All reports are formally investigated by the safety team, which includes a review of the relevant HIRA and 
the implementation of appropriate corrective actions to mitigate the risk.
Furthermore, we have also instituted processes for the assistance of our employees and workers to safeguard 
themselves from immediate risk and harm, namely:
	y
We have a firm ‘Stop Work Authority’ culture to empower every employee and worker, and relevant third 
parties (i.e., contractors) to stop any work activity that they believe poses an immediate risk or harm to the 
health, safety, or wellbeing of their own, or of others, without fear of retaliation.
	y
As per our culture and ethos, work in such instances will not resume until a qualified supervisor and a safety 
representative have assessed the situation and confirmed that the hazard has either been eliminated or 
controlled.
