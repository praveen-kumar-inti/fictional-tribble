Objectives 
and 
principles 
have 
been 
mapped with various industry trends and 
global frameworks, including Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), ESG matrices, 
and National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs). 
This analysis has enabled the identification 
of risks and opportunities for Black Box. 
Further, our engagements with both 
internal and external stakeholders give 
us better insights into their concerns 
and help us identify material issues that 
can 
potentially 
impact 
our 
business 
operations and value creation abilities, our 
stakeholders, and the larger ecosystem.
We prioritize, review, and refine our list of 
material issues in line with the findings from 
our continuous Stakeholder engagements. 
They are also aligned with the guidelines 
of sustainability standards and current 
business and economic realities.

Privacy and

Risk & 
Opportunity
Rationale:
Businesses are increasingly reliant on 
digital 
communications 
and 
Internet-
based transactions to operate in a seamless 
geotechnical landscape.
Taking steps to address the security of the 
organization’s critical data can help prevent 
business problems by showing resiliency, 
minimizing impacts, and recovering from 
security breaches.
The privacy of data and its security 
specifically is becoming a major risk 
generally due to increasing digitization, 
interconnectivity, multiple and fluid entry 
points, and the need to meet regulatory 
compliance and contractual customer 
requirements.
Black Box has 
implemented controls to 
reduce and mitigate cyber 
threats and data privacy 
and security-related risks 
and constantly seeks 
to improve security 
by having a robust 
information security 
posture implemented 
through the use of 
policies, processes, and 
controls that reduce the 
overall risk and/or impact 
of a cybersecurity threat 
as well as safeguard and 
secure sensitive data. 
Our risk mitigation can 
be categorized into 
three control areas- a) 
Prevention, b) Detection, 
and c) Remediation.
General Positive: 
Easier business 
process automation, 
increased trust 
and credibility 
from customers 
and stakeholders, 
improved data 
management 
control procedures 
and security, brand 
reputation. 
General Negative: 
Breach of privacy 
and data security 
leading to financial 
and reputational 
loss.

In case of risk, approach 
to adapt or mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)
Tangible Impacts of Risks –
1)	 Financial /customer impacts, reputational 
damage, and loss of customer trust and 
future engagements
2)	 This may lead to higher premiums for 
getting globally cyber-insured.
3) 	Impact 
on 
technology-related 
operational efficiency and productively 
service customers and increases costs.
Tangible Opportunities –
1)	 Reduce 
security 
and 
data 
privacy 
violation-related 
incidents, 
building 
customers’ trust.
2)	 Grow and expand existing business 
accounts/revenue while winning new 
accounts.
3)	 Easier to get cyber-insured globally 
with lesser premiums as confidence in 
security controls grows.
4)	 Lower costs by building operational 
efficiency due to fewer security incidents 
leading to better customer support and 
service through a resilient infrastructure.
Through adequate 
preventive, detective, 
administrative, and 
technical controls spread 
across the above areas 
and constantly trying to 
improve them, Black Box 
safeguards the business 
interests of the company, 
by reducing cyber 
incidents, and protecting 
sensitive data of itself & 
its customers benefitting 
stakeholders at large.
1)	 Financial 
Implications of 
Risks -
a)	 Positive - None
b)	Negative –
Risk of loss 
of revenue, 
customer trust, 
contracts, 
higher global 
cyber-insurance 
premiums, 
operational 
efficiency 
impacts, and 
lower overall 
security posture.
2)	 Financial 
Implications of 
Opportunities–
a)	 Positive
	
Better privacy 
and data security.
	
This leads to 
existing account 
expansion and 
new customer 
account 
creation, leading 
to revenue. 
Lowers costs 
on operational 
efficiency and 
possibly cyber 
insurance.
b)	Negative –  None

ahead of time.

and vaccination related 
assistance to ensure 
their well-being. We 
have invested in hiring 
key and critical talent to 
accelerate digital product 
and process offerings 
to our customers. We 
invest in initiatives 
to promote learning 
and development, 
performance support, 
career growth, 
engagement, diversity 
and inclusion at the 
workplace.
We have a robust 
grievance redressal 
mechanism to address 
employee concerns. 
We measure employee 
alignment at regular 
intervals to take correct 
actions, if any.
Positive: Easier 
business process 
automation, 
increased trust 
and the credibility 
of stakeholders, 
improved data 
management and 
protected brand 
reputation. 
Negatives: Breach 
of privacy and data
