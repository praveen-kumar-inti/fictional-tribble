1
Energy & 
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Trident is dependent on 
fossil fuels as a source of energy 
for boilers. The Company is also 
dependent on heavy amount of 
water intake for paper and pulp 
manufacturing. Any disruption in the 
supply chain of traditional fuel will 
have direct and significant increase 
in the price and could adversely 
affect the Company’s operations and 
profitability. Secondly, as climate 
change is leading to more intense 
weather events such as- heat 
waves, droughts, extreme floods 
and cyclones, it can impact the 
water availability at extreme high 
temperatures, forest degradation, 
and impact the supply chain during 
extreme weather events. These 
events can have direct impact on the 
Company’s value chain operations 
and could lead to a declining 
revenue.
Opportunity: The Company can 
adapt to innovate processes to 
achieve energy efficiency and 
reduce carbon footprint throughout 
the value chain. The Company 
can explore decarbonisation 
opportunities throughout the 
value chain and develop products 
which has low/zero emissions. 
Climate change adaptation and 
decarbonisation solutions will also 
provide the company an opportunity 
to gain competitive edge and 
enhance market position
The Company has 
implemented ESG principles 
across the business functions 
and operations and have 
undertaken some key targets 
under the pillars of Emissions, 
Water, Waste and RE. Trident 
has undertaken Science Based 
Targets to reduce Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions by 
2031 and become a Net-Zero 
Company 2050. Some of the 
best practices implemented 
includes- increasing biofuel 
consumption, transitioning 
from coal based grid supply 
to renewable purchases like 
IREC’s, water conservation 
and recycling and CAPEX 
investment in Solar and energy 
efficient technologies.
Positive Implication: 
Implementation of 
measures to switch 
from Coal will reduce 
carbon emissions and 
enhance the Company’s 
reputation in the long 
run resulting in  better 
brand value. Costly 
Investments: Adapting 
to changing climate 
conditions may require 
significant investments 
in new infrastructure or 
equipment.

safety within its operations, 
corporate spaces and supply 
chain. Various measures are 
implemented to promote a 
safe and healthy working 
environment, such as- Strict 
adherence to Regulations, 
Periodic Risk Assessment 
through HIRA, Employee 
and Worker Training on 
occupational health and safety 
practices and procedures, 
including the proper use of 
personal protective equipment 
(PPE) and emergency 
response protocols, Safety 
Equipment and Infrastructure, 
Ongoing Safety Audits and 
continuous employee and 
worker engagements. 
All manufacturing locations 
are certified to Occupational 
Health and Safety

without compromising career progression. Sensitisation through 
communication, training, strengthening of Internal policies and 
processes is being done to foster an inclusive and respectful

Plastics
We engage with authorised recyclers to facilitate the collection and reprocessing of plastic 
waste generated as per the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, thereby, assuming 
accountability for the end-of-life management of the plastic packaging materials we utilise.
2
E-waste
Trident has installed E-waste collection centres within office and operation premises to collect, 
segregate and recycle the E-waste through authorised recyclers with valid certifications.
3
Hazardous waste
Hazardous waste is disposed through CPCB, SPCB authorised vendors in both Punjab and 
MP. The Company has also integrated zero liquid discharge systems which removes release of 
hazardous liquid waste into the environment. The manufacturing facilities use biological plant 
for biodegradation of wastewater and recover the wastewater.
4
Other waste
All Non-hazardous wastes are sold to recyclers for further upcycling, recycling and relevant 
use. Trident has also incorporated food waste and other biomass waste to generate electricity 
at one of the manufacturing locations, through biogas plant.
Trident is committed to sustainability through our 5Rs Practice: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer, and Redesign. We 
actively seek alternatives to plastic waste, partnering with recyclers for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives. 
hazardous waste like ETP Sludge is disposed of at authorised Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) Facilities.
Our innovations include converting food and biomass waste into electricity via biogas plants and promoting sustainable 
paper packaging through our “Good Paper” campaign. We prioritise Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified papers, 
reducing carbon and water footprints compared to plastics. Trident remains dedicated to minimising our environmental 
impact and promoting responsible resource management, showcasing our commitment to sustainability and 
environmental stewardship.

Yes, the Company has identified the environmental emergency and has identified its role in engaging with Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) under the plastic waste management rules, 2016, with registration under brand owner. 
The Company has also submitted targets to the local state pollution control board with approval of collecting back 324 MT 
post-consumer plastic waste in MP and 1814 MT in Punjab  for the FY 2024-25.

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (Contd.)
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has established dedicated processes and facilities for handling hazardous waste, battery waste, e-waste, 
and scrap ensuring compliance with all legal requirements associated with different types of waste. Having adopted 5Rs 
framework to address waste generation, viz. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Re-engineer, Redesign, our primary focus is on 
waste reduction and reuse,and we responsibly dispose of whatever remains.
	
1.	
Waste identification, segregation and storage- We have identified the different types and categories of waste and 
the operations, processes, and activities where they are generated. Areas are earmarked within each department/ 
process where the waste generated daily is segregated and stored. Vendors for recycling different types of waste are 
identified and based on their compliance with legal requirements and the company’s SOP, authorisation is granted. 
The transportation of waste follows specific procedures and adherence to the requirements for suitable vehicles and 
transport methods
	
2.	
Waste reduction, recycle and reuse- While we follow the standard SOP for waste disposal, we give precedence 
to identifying areas within our operations where waste can be reduced. This involves kaizens around optimising 
processes, finding alternatives to wasteful methods and practices, e.g. we have implemented optimisation systems to 
reduce steam and power consumption .We also actively explore opportunities to reuse materials within our operations, 
e.g. Comber Noil and rich flat cotton waste from spinning units are reused in open end spinning with in our operations. 
Furthermore, to reduce dependency on traditional fuels, we are exploring various forms of waste to energy viz. 
micro dust from spinning is used in boiler, wastewater from washing straw which is rich in organic content is used 
to generate Biogas.
	
3.	
Responsible Disposal-Disposal of Hazardous waste, Biomedical waste, e-waste, and battery waste is done following all 
necessary compliances and guidelines. Hazardous waste and biomedical waste are handed over to TSDFs (Treatment, 
Storage, and Disposal Facilities) authorised by the State Pollution Control Board, and e-waste and battery waste are 
given to vendors authorised by the State Pollution Control Board.
	
4.	
Chemical Management- The company has a well-documented chemical management policy accessible to all 
stakeholders and supporting procedures on identification, procurement, storage and handling, transportation and 
traceability of chemicals which includes the following procedures:
	
	
a. 	
Chemical Evaluation against requirements of RSL/MRSL prescribed in ZDHC and Oeko Tex STeP and furnishing 
documents viz. TDS, SDS, Certificate of Analysis, GOTS, REACH
	
	
b. 	
The Chemical management system holds chemical manager responsible for performing chemical risk 
assessment when incorporating any new chemical
	
	
c. 	
Wastewater standard- Ensuring effluent quality meet applicable standards for key parameters such as pH, 
suspended solids, BOD, COD, TDS, Heavy metals and toxic substances.
	
	
Daily testing of the ETP in-let water, ETP out-let water is conducted by in-house laboratory. A government-approved 
third-party agency performs monthly testing, and globally recognised laboratories like Hohenstein conduct annual 
tests based on the ZDHC wastewater guidelines.
11. 	 If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks,
