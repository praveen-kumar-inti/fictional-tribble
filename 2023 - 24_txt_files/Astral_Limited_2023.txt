Astral Ltd. prioritises innovation and sustainable 
business practices, investing heavily in research 
and development (R&D) and capital expenditures 
(Capex). However, expenses aimed at enhancing the 
environmental and social impacts of products and 
processes have not been separately documented until 
FY 2023-24. However, Astral Ltd. has implemented 
various initiatives within its R&D and Capex domains 
to address environmental and social concerns. These 
initiatives include:
-	
Acquiring specialised testing equipment to 
analyse small quantities of chemicals during the 
initial stages of production, thereby reducing 
trial materials usage and minimising waste.
-	
Designing 
faucets 
specifically 
aimed 
at 
conserving water consumption.
-	
Procuring laboratory testing equipment to 
monitor in-process parameters, thus reducing 
material wastage by preventing post-production 
rejections.
-	
Developing low Volatile Organic Compound 
(VOC) 
solvents 
to 
meet 
demand 
for 
environmentally friendly and safe solutions.

3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for 
(a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
Considering the nature of our products, their extensive lifespan often spanning decades, and their widespread global 
utilisation, it is not practical  to reclaim our products for reuse, recycling, or disposal at the end of their life cycle. However, 
wherever feasible, we have implemented measures to responsibly recycle and manage waste generated during our 
production processes. We have conducted Gate to Gate Analysis for LCA Silencio, ensured e-waste recycling through 
approved channels, and disposed of hazardous waste in accordance with the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling, 
and Transboundary Movement) Rules of 2016. Additionally, we have registered under the Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) on the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) portal for plastic packaging recycling.

waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its stakeholders. 
Essential Indicators
1. Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity: 
The Company adopts an approach that considers historical concerns and relationships when engaging with interested 
parties and its diverse stakeholder ecosystem. This approach encompasses not only those individuals or entities with whom 
the company has direct interactions but also extends to those whose activities, whether directly or indirectly, influence the 
company's operations and performance. The company has identified key internal stakeholders and external stakeholders 
who contribute directly or indirectly to its long-term success and impact their lives. Internal stakeholders include employees, 
while external stakeholders encompass investors, shareholders, suppliers, customers, contractors, regulators, media, and 
the community. These stakeholders play a vital role in supporting the business in various ways, such as providing financial 
support, collaborating on business assignments, facilitating external communication on major developments, influencing 
business plans and decision-making processes, and more. By cultivating a deep understanding and appreciation of this 
intricate stakeholder ecosystem, the organization reinforces its commitment to maintaining transparent and mutually 
beneficial relationships, ultimately contributing to sustainable growth and the creation of shared value for all parties involved.

Customers have the option to contact our customer service by dialling the toll-free number 18002337957, visiting our 
website to submit their issues, or informing their Distributor, who will then create a Ticket in the Distributor portal. Once a 
complaint is filed, it is received by the Customer Care Department, which then delegates the issue to the appropriate field 
staff. The field staff will reach out to the customer to gain a thorough understanding of the issue. They will then proceed to 
address the complaint on-site. If necessary, they will collect a sample for quality control laboratory testing of the materials 
and share the test results with the customer. The outcome of this process will determine any corrective measures to be taken 
and put into action.
Additionally, the Adhesive division has a dedicated customer care number, 7311103331, and a portal for complaints, 
inquiries, suggestions, and feedback at wecare.astraladhesives.com. Anyone can post their comments on this portal, 
which then generates a ticket and sends the request directly to the concerned department for resolution. Each ticket 
number is associated with an escalation matrix, and if there is a delay in the response, a direct notification is sent to the 
Department Head.

Identified Sustainability Information 
The Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended March 31, 2024 is summarised in Annexure-1.
Our reasonable assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended March 31, 2024 information only unless 
otherwise stated and we have not performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods or any other elements included 
in the BRSR and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon. 
Criteria 
The criteria used by the company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is summarized below: 
Identified Sustainability 
Information (ISI) subject to 
assurance

issued by ICAI
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or 
establishing suitable criteria for preparing the sustainability 
Information, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability 
Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. 
Our Independence and Quality Control 
We have maintained our independence and confirm that 
we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and have 
the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance engagement.
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, 
“Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews

a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information 
based on the procedures we have performed and evidence 
we have obtained.

Standard 
on 
Sustainability 
Assurance 
Engagements 
(SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability

of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform our

A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the 
risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
35

the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances. 
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing 
or reconciling with underlying records. 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we visited plant locations 
and head office to understand the processes involved in 
data gathering and verifying documentation ensuring the 
reported details are in line with the requirements.

we do not express a conclusion on the same:
