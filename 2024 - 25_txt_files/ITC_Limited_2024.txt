Grievance Redressal Mechanism In Place
Communities
The major stakeholders of ITC’s Social Investments Programme (SIP) are communities for 
whom the programmes are implemented. ITC therefore, adopts a bottom-up approach by 
keeping community needs and priorities as the key driver for all its interventions. Detailed 
and structured community engagements are planned every 5 years to revisit the changing 
needs of the community and the emerging priorities, which then feed into designing of new 
interventions or re-designing of ongoing programmes.  Additionally, annual household surveys 
are also undertaken to fine-tune the strategies formulated and ascertain any new needs that 
may come up. 
ITC’s SIP team takes up Annual Community Engagement to capture the views, suggestions 
and grievances of community members pertaining to the programmes implemented by SIP 
team. This annual engagement is conducted typically during February/March every year, and 
the resolution of issues (if any) happens in the subsequent financial year. During 2024-25, 48 
such community engagements were held across major States where SIP programmes are 
implemented. These were conducted by ITC SIP team’s State level managers. Meetings were 
organised with community members in villages and urban catchments, wherein the NGOs

implementing the programme were also present. All meetings were planned and reviewed by 
the SIP team at Head Office. From the 48 engagements, 7 cases of grievances (mainly related 
to requests for further interventions and scope of improvement) were reported.  The SIP State 
teams have taken cognisance of these and appropriate actions have been incorporated in the 
plans for the upcoming year.
In addition to the grievance redressal mechanism for communities, there are other mechanisms 
also by internal SIP teams and implementation partners to ensure regular engagement with 
community. These are done through structured monitoring field visits done by ITC Managers 
from Head Office, Regional levels and State levels. Also, multiple meetings are conducted by 
implementation partners to gather feedback and suggestions. In addition to these, impact 
assessments are conducted annually, with third party evaluating agencies which helps in 
assessing the programmes and also gathering feedback from communities.

Climate 
Change & 
Sustainability 
Risk
Climate and nature 
related physical and 
transition risks may 
impact business 
operations, 
sourcing, supply 
chain and increase 
compliance costs.
Risk Mitigation Strategy 
Physical Risk Management:
•	Use contemporary climate 
risk modelling tools for 
identifying high-risk/
vulnerable sites and 
agri value chains, and 
undertaking detailed 
assessments for developing 
locally contextual 
adaptation plans and 
undertaking measures for 
improving climate resilience 
of ITC’s operations, people 
and value chains;
•	Promote climate smart 
agriculture, and development 
of heat/drought tolerant 
and high yielding varieties 
to improve productivity by 
adopting micro region-
specific agronomic practices:
-	Developing region-specific 
package of practices and 
promoting climate smart 
farming techniques to 
mitigate impact of weather;
-	Enhancing climate resilience 
of farmers through capacity 
building programmes by 
leveraging ITCMAARS and 
the Farmers’ Producer 
Organisation (FPO) 
ecosystem, supported by 
field demonstrations under 
Choupal Pradarshan Khets;
-	Comprehensive programmes 
on social forestry, soil and 
moisture conservation and 
biodiversity conservation;
-	Adoption of water 
stewardship approach to 
achieve water security for 
all stakeholders within the 
defined catchment areas of 
units located in high water 
stress areas.
•	Supply chain diversification 
and contingency planning;
•	Map risks arising out 
of climate crisis, build 
adaptive capacity and invest
Potential impact
• As average temperatures 
rise, extreme weather 
events are expected to 
grow in terms of severity 
and frequency. These 
could have significant 
impact on the Company’s 
operations including 
the health and safety 
of its workforce, its 
physical assets and agri 
value chains leading 
to complete or partial 
outage of operations. 
Further, these events may 
also adversely impact the 
availability and quality 
of agri raw materials 
and consequently, the 
production and sales of 
the Company’s products;
•	Vagaries of weather 
caused by climate change 
may impact crop cycles, 
output and productivity 
resulting in disruption of 
operations/supply chain;
•	Availability of water for 
own operations as well 
as agri value chains may 
be adversely impacted 
by erratic precipitation 
patterns;
•	Changes in nature, 
biodiversity and / or 
ecosystem intactness 
(e.g., soil erosion and 
depletion, species 
diversity and composition) 
may adversely disrupt 
supply chains and 
operations;
•	Besides physical risks, 
transition risks associated 
with climate change, may 
impact the Company’s 
operations:
-	Additional levies may be 
imposed by regulatory 
authorities for emission/
water intensive industries 
to address climate

•	Non-compliance 
with plastic waste 
management regulations 
could lead to imposition 
of environmental 
compensation, that 
may negatively impact 
Company’s reputation. 
Additionally, stricter 
government laws around 
usage of plastics including 
bans may give rise to 
multiple challenges such 
as redesign of product

time, and introducing 
Post-Consumer Recycled 
(PCR) content in plastic 
packaging, wherever 
permitted by regulations;
o	 Better Plastics: Ensuring 
100% of packaging is 
reusable, recyclable or 
compostable/ biodegradable 
by improving recyclability 
of multi-layer laminate 
packaging, phasing out 
hard to recycle plastics, 
and exploring alternative

lower environmental 
impact including bio-based 
compostable plastics.
•	Partner with upstream 
players and suppliers 
for ensuring supply of 
Post-Consumer Recycled 
(PCR) plastic for meeting 
regulatory/market demand 
for increasing recycled 
content in plastic packaging;

replicable, scalable and 
sustainable models of plastic 
waste management; work 
with recycling partners for 
developing viable recycling 
options for Multi-Layered 
Plastic (MLP) packaging;
•	Ensure a robust compliance 
management system 
supported by internal and 
external process review; 
additionally, undertake third 
party assurance of underlying 
data related to plastic waste 
generation and collection.
•	Disruptions in the supply

2.	 Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? 
(Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
Yes, the ITC Code of Conduct requires the Directors, Senior Management and employees to avoid situations in which 
their personal interests could conflict with the interests of the Company. The Code, inter alia, clarifies that conflict of 
interest may arise when (a) an employee or a family member (family member includes spouse, children, siblings and 
parents) has a material interest in an entity that has a business relationship with the Company or is being evaluated 
for a commercial transaction, or (b) an employee is in a position to benefit someone with whom he / she has a close 
relationship, in relation to the Company’s business. However, this is an area in which it is impossible to provide 
comprehensive guidance but the guiding principle is that conflict, if any, or any potential conflict must be disclosed to 
higher management for guidance and action as appropriate.
Further, the Directors of the Company are required to disclose to the Board whether they, directly or indirectly or on 
behalf of third parties, have material interest in any transaction or matter directly affecting the Company. In addition, 
an annual confirmation is sought from the Directors in this connection. For the financial year 2024-25, all Directors of 
the Company have confirmed that they did not, either directly or indirectly or on behalf of third parties, have material 
interest in any transaction or matter, directly affecting the Company.

ITC’s Report and Accounts 2025. 
2.a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing?
Yes, there are procedures in place for sustainable sourcing. ITC has a Board approved Policy on ‘Sustainable Supply 
Chain and Responsible Sourcing’ and a ‘Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Service Providers’. The Code reflects ITC’s 
commitment to environmental conservation, business integrity and human rights. All suppliers are encouraged to fully 
comply with the Code. Additionally, ITC businesses, including Agri, FMCG and Paper Businesses, depend on farm and 
forestry-based supply chains for key raw materials. Accordingly, focus of ITC’s interventions in agri value chains has 
been largely around improving farmer livelihoods, increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening regional water 
security, and addressing the challenge of climate change and enhancing resilience. ITC’s key agri value chains are also 
certified as per global standards like Rainforest Alliance (RFA), Forest Stewardship Council®, Fairtrade, India Organic 
and USDA Organic. These certifications specify environmental and social standards for agricultural practices, and help 
ensure sustainability, traceability and transparency. 
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing practices pertaining to key agri value chains and key value chain partners 
like third-party manufacturers, refer to ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Agriculture’ and ‘Sustainable Supply Chain and 
Responsible Sourcing’ sections of ITC Sustainability Report 2025.
Healthy & Sustainable Food Products
•	 Innovative science-based platforms and superior sensory attributes continue to drive creation of healthier and 
superior foods. In addition, research efforts continue towards reduction in salt, sugar and fat without compromising 
on sensory attributes. Efforts are also underway to increase nutrients that are beneficial for health/nutrition like 
fibre, vitamins and minerals. 
•	 LSTC, in collaboration with Agri and Branded Packaged Foods Businesses, endeavours to ensure that contemporary 
science-based outcomes are fully integrated across key agri value chains from farm to fork, including wheat, 
potato and spices.
•	 State of art analytical testing facilities at LSTC are deployed to ensure safety and superior quality of the products.
Sustainable Products in the Personal & Home Care Segments
•	 R&D-Product Development team of Personal Care Products Business (PCPB) at LSTC continues to leverage 
science and technology led capabilities to build future product pipeline readiness in Health & Hygiene, Personal 
Wash, Fragrances, Home Care and Skin Care categories.  
•	 Further, the team has been developing products with sustainable formulation, efficient processing and sustainable 
packaging, which include high recycled content, lower packaging weight and recyclable packaging across personal 
care and home care categories.
Sustainable Materials & Packaging
•	 ITC LSTC has developed proprietary patented innovative barrier solutions that serve as a sustainable alternative 
to conventional synthetic polymers. These advanced materials offer excellent barrier to oil, grease and water, 
making them an ideal choice for FMCG packaging.
•	 For Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) segment, these tailored-solutions not only enhance product performance but 
also align with global sustainability goals by reducing dependency on conventional fossil fuel derived materials. 
Agro-Forestry and Crop Sciences 
•	 LSTC has established different cutting-edge tools and platforms with an ambitious R&D program for improving 
tree and crop species of interest to ITC for desired traits like yield, quality, abiotic and biotic stress. This supports 
securing raw materials given the rising challenges of climate change and depleting resources. 
•	 Ongoing research has major emphasis on developing climate resilient crops and pulp wood species in order to 
address the security of raw material supplies across the Company’s value chains while ensuring enhanced farmer 
profitability.  As an example, in the past 5 years more than 10 million saplings of new hybrids with >20% higher 
wood yields have been deployed in farmers’ fields. This enables secured raw material supply while ensuring 
better farm income and enhanced carbon sequestration.

b.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
ITC businesses, including Agri, FMCG and Paper Businesses, depend on farm and forestry-based supply chains for key 
raw materials. Accordingly, farmers constitute a vital part of ITC’s supply chain, and the Company engages with farmers 
to ensure adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. ITC’s key agri value chains are also certified as per global 
standards like Rainforest Alliance (RFA), Forest Stewardship Council®, Fairtrade, India Organic and USDA Organic.
Note: For more details on ITC’s sustainable sourcing practices pertaining to key agri value chains and key value chain partners 
like third-party manufacturers, refer to ‘Sustainable and Climate Resilient Agriculture’ and ‘Sustainable Supply Chain and

Description Of Processes 
Plastics 
(including 
packaging)  
ITC first achieved Plastic Neutrality in FY 2021-22 by implementing an integrated solid waste 
management programme that incorporates unique and multi-dimensional initiatives including 
the Company’s flagship waste management initiative ‘ITC WOW – Well-Being Out of Waste’. In 
FY 2024-25, the Company collected and sustainably managed 76,000 tonnes of plastic waste 
across the Country. The amount of plastic waste managed exceeded the amount of plastic 
packaging utilised by ITC during the year, enabling the Company to maintain the milestone of 
Plastic Neutrality. 
More than 99% of the solid waste generated in ITC's operations including plastic waste is sent 
for recycling.
E-waste

the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Yes, ITC is in compliance with the requirements of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) under the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016 (as amended).
Leadership Indicators
1.	 Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing 
industry) or for its services (for service industry)?
In line with the overall strategy to embed principles of sustainability into various stages of product or service life cycle, ITC 
has been conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) of its products and services with an objective of evaluating the impacts 
and identifying areas for improvement. Over the years, LCA studies have been carried out for some of the Company’s key 
products from Paperboards and Specialty Papers Business, Personal Care Products Business, Educational & Stationery, 
Matches & Agarbatti and Branded Packaged Foods Businesses for identifying additional opportunities to reduce 
environmental impact across the value chain under various scenarios as well as quantifying the footprint improvement 
of planned product/packaging design interventions. These assessments have enabled identification of levers that have 
led to improvements like more efficient packaging designs and enhanced loading efficiencies in transportation. Further, 
packaging design teams across ITC businesses use a packaging-focussed Life Cycle Assessment-based tool to assess 
the environmental impact of different packaging formats/designs for various FMCG products and sustainable packaging 
solutions offered by Paperboards and Packaging Businesses. The insights from such assessments are considered during 
new product development and design stages.

6.	 Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and 
worker? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief.
Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent 
Workers
Yes, ITC’s Grievance Redressal Procedure is available to employees and workers. The objective of the 
policy is to facilitate open and structured discussion on employees’ work-related grievances with the 
intent of ensuring that the grievance is dealt with in a fair and just manner whilst being in compliance 
with the Company’s policies. ITC’s open-door practices encourage amicable and fair resolution of 
grievances. Employees are encouraged to first discuss the grievance with their immediate reporting 
authority, and attempt to arrive at a resolution before invoking a formal grievance redressal mechanism. 
In Unionised Units, grievances of workmen are also taken up for discussion by Union Office Bearers 
and resolved through dialogue with human resources managers and other designated managers. Units 
also have Committees with joint representation of workers and managers, which address grievances 
raised by one or more workers. In addition, many Units have forums where workers interact with 
the unit leadership team in small groups and share any suggestions or grievances they may have, 
for resolution.
The Company’s Whistleblower Policy is also available for the permanent employees.
Other than 
Permanent 
Workers
The Whistleblower Policy of the Company encourages all employees to bring to the Company’s attention, 
instances of illegal or unethical conduct, actual or suspected incidents of fraud, actions that affect 
the financial integrity of the Company, or actual or suspected instances of leak of unpublished price 
sensitive information that could adversely impact the Company’s operations, business performance 
and/or reputation. In terms of the said Policy, the Company investigates such incidents, when 
reported, in an impartial manner and takes appropriate action to ensure that the requisite standards 
of professional and ethical conduct are always upheld. This Policy can be accessed on the Company’s 
corporate website at https://www.itcportal.com/whistleblower-policy

The Policy on Freedom of Association is available on ITC Portal:
https://www.itcportal.com/about-itc/policies/sustainability-policy.aspx#FreedomofAssociation
*A vast majority of women workers are based in manufacturing units which currently do not have union representation. 
These are units that were commissioned in the recent past. ITC believes that all employees are important stakeholders in the 
enterprise, and it is imperative to build a culture of mutual trust and respect, interdependence, and meaningful engagement. 
This approach helps in building, strengthening and sustaining harmonious employee relations across the organisation.

10. Health and safety management system:
a.	 Whether 
an 
occupational 
health 
and 
safety 
management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes, ITC has implemented occupational health and safety 
management system in all its Factories, Offices and 
Warehouses. ITC endeavours that Environment, Health 
& Safety (EHS) standards at all its units are ahead of 
applicable legislation and regulations, Standards and 
Codes, and are benchmarked against international 
best practices across sectors in which it operates. ITC’s 
approach to occupational health & safety standards is 
articulated in the Board approved Environment, Health 
and Safety Policy. It is based on an EHS management 
system that emphasises on enhancing EHS performance 
by setting objectives and targets and continually 
monitoring key performance indicators.
Further, the Company promotes a culture of safety 
through behavioural change programmes and by 
providing appropriate training to employees as well as 
service providers’ employees, while continually investing 
in state-of-the-art technology and in developing human 
capital.
EHS requirements are integrated at the design stage for 
all new investments. Compliance with EHS standards 
during the construction phase as well as in operational 
phase of ITC units, Warehouses and Offices is ensured 
by implementing project EHS management systems and 
through established EHS management systems with 
designated roles and responsibilities for competent 
resources, respectively.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-
related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
ITC has identified EHS Risk Management framework 
as one of the integral steps towards building a robust 
safety management system in all its factories, offices 
and warehouses. This framework entails a set of 
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2025

processes for continual risk identification, assessment 
and mitigation, with active participation of the workforce 
in each of its facilities. Shop floor processes in this regard 
include hazard spotting tours, suggestion schemes, daily 
briefings and periodic EHS Committee meetings in which 
employees participate. In addition, all ITC Units undergo 
periodic Environment, Health & Safety audits at the 
Business as well as Corporate level which endeavours 
to identify additional latent risks besides verifying 
compliance with standards. Several national awards and 
certifications acknowledge ITC’s commitment and efforts 
towards providing a safe and healthy workplace to all.
c.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report 
the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes. A system is in place across ITC factories and offices for 
workers to spot and report work-related hazards, and offer 
suggestions for improvements. This is further enabled 
through digitisation, enhancing worker participation.
Necessary training is given to all employees in recognising 
hazards and issues. Joint inspections by management 
representatives and employees on the shop floor are also 
carried out at regular intervals, and respective corrective 
and preventive measures are undertaken to mitigate the 
identified risks. In order to create an open and transparent 
safety culture across ITC Units, employees are encouraged 
to participate and discuss safety related issues in forums 
like periodic EHS Committee meetings and Departmental 
Open Forums.
d.	 Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access 
to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/No)
Yes, permanent employees and their family members have 
access to the Company provided or Company supported

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
In line with the Company’s Environment, Health and Safety Policy, safety as a value-led concept has been institutionalised 
by inculcating a sense of ownership at all levels and driving behavioural change, leading to the creation of a cohesive 
safety culture. ITC has put in place comprehensive health and safety protocols for the safety and well-being of its 
stakeholders. ITC endeavours that EHS standards at all its units are ahead of applicable legislations, regulations, and 
Standards and Codes, and are benchmarked against international best practices across the diverse sectors in which 
it operates.
ITC continues to strengthen its safety processes, adopting globally recognised best practices, and ensuring that facilities 
are designed, constructed, operated and maintained in an inherently safe manner. ITC will continue to undertake efforts 
for creating a safe working environment and a strong safety culture by:
•	 Integrating safety at the design stage itself and ensuring it through design reviews, stage inspections and pre-
commissioning audits, thereby strengthening the engineering control measures through ‘design for safety’ principles.
•	 Conducting pre-commissioning and periodic operational audits during construction and operational stages respectively.
•	 Implementing behaviour-based safety initiatives to facilitate engagement for collaborative work on improving 
safety performances.
•	 Adoption of keystone behaviours by individual units to demonstrate collective commitment and create a shared 
vision of safety and discipline.
•	 Embracing and leveraging the digital landscape for safety management system.
•	 Identifying solutions for strengthening the safety culture aligned with the goal of ‘Zero Accidents’.

Leadership Indicators
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between 
stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is 
feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
ITC believes that an effective stakeholder engagement 
process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal 
of inclusive growth. In this context, the Company has laid 
down a four layered mechanism to deal with the aspect of 
stakeholder engagement. 
The Board, through the CSR and Sustainability Committee, 
inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides strategic 
direction to the Company’s CSR and sustainability 
practices towards fulfilling its Triple Bottom Line 
objectives. Half-yearly reports on the progress made 
by the Company in this regard are placed by the CMC 
before the CSR and Sustainability Committee. The CMC 
in turn has constituted the Sustainability Compliance 
Review Committee (SCRC), comprising senior and other 
members of management, which evaluates and monitors 
compliance with the Policy formulated in this connection. 
The SCRC places a quarterly report on the subject before 
the CMC.
The Company has a practice of periodically assessing 
employee engagement through a Company-wide survey. 
Since 2016, the Company has made concerted efforts to 
assess and improve engagement. The impact is visible 
in the consistent improvement of engagement over the 
years.
2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support 
the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances 
as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of 
the entity.
Yes, the Company believes that an effective stakeholder 
engagement process is necessary for achieving its 
sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, 
the Company anchors stakeholder engagement on the 
following principles:
a)	Materiality – Prioritised consideration of the economic, 
environmental and social impacts identified to be 
important to the stakeholders as well as the organisation.
b)	Completeness – Understanding key concerns of 
stakeholders and their expectations.
c)	 Responsiveness 
– 
Responding 
coherently 
and 
transparently to such issues and concerns. The 
Company has put in place systems and procedures to 
identify, prioritise and address the needs and concerns 
of its stakeholders across Businesses and Units in a 
continuous, consistent and systematic manner. It has 
REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2025
Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
XXX
implemented mechanisms to facilitate effective dialogues 
with all stakeholders across Businesses, identify material 
concerns and their resolution in an equitable and 
transparent manner. These measures have helped the 
Company develop strong relationships, which have stood 
the test of time. Select examples of how stakeholder 
inputs have been incorporated into ITC’s policies and 
activities are presented below:
1.	Investors: The Company engages extensively with 
the investor ecosystem i.e., analysts representing 
institutional equity investors, fund/portfolio managers in 
top FIIs, Domestic Mutual Funds (MFs), Foreign Portfolio 
Investors (FPIs), Private Insurance Companies etc. A 
comprehensive Investor Presentation was made to the 
Investor community highlighting the broad contours 
of demerger of the Company’s Hotels Business into 
ITC Hotels Limited, covering inter-alia overview of the 
Hotels Business, key growth strategies and financial 
performance.  The Company sustained the intensity 
of interaction with analysts/fund managers of FPIs, 
domestic MFs, Insurance cos. etc. during the year 
leveraging both physical and virtual meeting platforms. 
The Company also engaged with investors with specific 
focus on ESG and investor presentations on other major 
events such as acquisitions by the Company were made 
available in the public domain, through the websites of 
the Company and the Stock Exchanges. The Company 
continues to communicate quarterly performance 
takeaways through press releases and detailed Investor 
presentations along with providing clarifications to 
analysts and others on such financial results. Key 
highlights of quarterly performance are also being 
shared with the shareholders by e-mail. The ‘Investor 
Relations’ section of the Company’s website is also being 
updated on an ongoing basis. The Company is well-
recognised for its ESG credentials, and is acknowledged 
as one of the pioneers of adopting the Triple Bottom Line 
philosophy in India.
2.	Customers & Value Chain Partners: Customers, 
Consumers and Value Chain Partners are some of ITC’s 
core stakeholders. Various tech-enabled avenues have 
been deployed to constantly receive feedback and ideas 
from these stakeholders.
A specialised team, ‘Team Synthesis’, has progressively 
evolved from being a ‘Customer Interactions’ team to a 
‘Customer Experience’ team to ‘Stakeholder Experience 
Team’, and now into a ‘Stakeholder Experience 
Management Team’. In its current avatar, in addition 
to keeping customer centricity as the base, SOPs 
and policies are designed and implemented in such a 
manner that the experience of all stakeholders is taken 
into equitable consideration. This has not just helped in 
achieving better experience for customers as well as 
the employees, but has also made every stakeholder 
accountable for the team’s and the organisation’s growth. 
Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly being 
monitored through social listening, in-depth immersions 
and are being carefully synthesised to transform into 
relevant solutions. A few key initiatives that demonstrate 
the above are:
•	 The entire customer experience process has been 
incentivised for the associates, team leaders as well as 
for the Quality Analysts (QAs) in such a manner that each 
month they accumulate certain points for their monthly 
performance based on objective and quantitative 
parameters. This has given the primary stakeholders 
(the associates) an opportunity to perform better. The 
parameters include factors like ideation (KAIZEN) and 
initiatives taken beyond tasks to improve the process 
continuously.
•	 The scenarios related to matters like environment, 
product, packaging, ergonomics, quality engineering, etc. 
highlighted by the customers are answered as per the 
respective brand teams, and any new or unique scenario 
highlighted by the customers is shared with the respective 
stakeholders as a VOC (Voice of Customer).
3.	 Community: Presented ahead are some of the 
instances where inputs received from stakeholders were 
incorporated into interventions. 
Social Investments team conducts a comprehensive Core 
Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) in ITC’s catchments every 
5 years to understand the need of the communities and 
design the interventions basis that. Participatory Rural 
Appraisal, Focused Group Discussions (separately with 
men, women and vulnerable groups), key informant 
interviews and household surveys are done to ascertain 
the needs of the community and prioritise the intervention 
areas under CAPP. CAPP 1.0 was developed and first done 
in 2015-16 and subsequently, CAPP 2.0 in 2021-22 which 
was across 21 factories and 7 agri locations. 
In addition to CAPP every five years, sample household 
surveys are conducted annually to re-assess and reaffirm 
the continued relevance of the needs identified and also 
cognise for any operational changes that may be needed 
in the future plans. In FY 2024-25, over 3,000 households 
were surveyed. The survey was done engaging a mixed-
method approach to collect both quantitative and 
qualitative data through structured questionnaires 
administered to households. Qualitative data was 
gathered through Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRA), 
Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) with Gram Panchayat 
members, and community members with representation 
also of marginalised groups and women members.
Forming large-scale long-term partnerships with 
Government to amplify reach & scale is one of the 
core tenets of SIP’s implementation approach. These 
partnerships not only ensure that the Government 
programmes reach the community, but also enable 
cognisance 
and

and basis appreciation of changing context, both of which 
were identified through extensive consultations and 
discussions with all concerned stakeholders. Few such 
examples are shared below:
•	 ITC had a partnership with Water Resource Department 
(WRD), Government of Maharashtra to implement water 
use efficiency and productivity improvement through 
capacity building of Water User Associations (WUA) 
across 5 Districts in Maharashtra. Based on the success 
of the partnership, Water Resource Department showed 
keen interest for amplification of partnership to cover 
other Irrigation Projects of Maharashtra, which also 
aligned with ITC’s amplification strategy. Subsequently, 
ITC and WRD signed the second phase of the partnership 
for strengthening Water User Associations across 20 
Districts of Maharashtra encompassing Godavari, Krishna 
and Tapi river basins. For designing the second phase of 
the partnership, wider consultations with WUAs, District 
level officials as well as WRD officials were conducted 
and feedbacks incorporated in the design. For example, 
WRD field teams suggested building Department staff’s 
capability in training the Water User Groups and Water 
User Associations on water use efficiency in additional 
crops like Banana, Grapes and Pomegranate, which has 
been incorporated.
•	 A study was conducted by Indian Institute of Science 
(IISc) in South Pennar river basin which included survey 
and assessment of area. Recommendations of the study 
were discussed with Government stakeholders like Rural 
Development Department, Municipal and Panchayat bodies, 
etc. Thereafter, ITC has partnered with Department of 
Rural Development & Panchayat Raj (RDPR), Government 
of Karnataka and Vyakti Vikas Kendra India, for Water 
Resources Development in South Pennar river basin 
covering 12 Taluks and 238 Gram Panchayats in Bengaluru 
Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Kolar & Chikkaballapur Districts 
of Karnataka.
•	 In partnership with India Sanitation Coalition (ISC), ITC 
participated in the Light House Initiative (LHI), a priority of 
Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) to 
develop Open Defecation Free Plus (ODF+) “Model Villages” 
in sanitation and waste management. Of the 75 villages in 
LHI, ITC undertook responsibility for 36 villages across 
10 States. After successfully completing Phase I of LHI, 
DDWS has now initiated Phase II of LHI with the objective of 
creating “Model Blocks”. ITC had discussions with Swachh 
Bharat Mission (SBM) District teams, took views of State 
Mission Directors and then with feedback of DDWS and ISC, 
identified 18 Blocks in 16 Districts across nine States where 
it will participate as part of Phase II of LHI.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
ITC’s SIP adopts a bottoms-up approach to identify and 
address the emerging needs of the community, scaling 
up and strengthening existing programmes, initiating 
prototypes for testing newer solutions, expanding pilots 
to test implementation challenges, and leveraging 
partnerships and collaboratives for amplifying successful 
at scale interventions. Presented hereunder are a few 
instances wherein changing community needs were 
addressed either through modifications in the ongoing 
programme or by introducing entirely new interventions.
•	 In India, only upto 55% of agricultural area has assured 
irrigation and even in that, only around 19% is under micro 
irrigation (drip and sprinklers). This results in close to half 
of Indian agriculture, mostly involving small & marginal 
farmers, to be at the mercy of rainfall and also spend 
more on purchase of water for surface irrigation. This also 
leads to wastage of purchased water. In this backdrop, 
ITC worked on designing a prototype of a solution that 
would provide both access and efficient irrigation to the 
small & marginal rainfed farmers. ITC along with its 
partner organisations and local plumbers and mechanics 
developed a prototype of Mobile Drip Irrigation System. 
Mobile Drip Irrigation System is a combination of water 
tanker along with solar panel and a foldable drip irrigation 
system attached to the tanker which can be moved from 
one field to another field along with the tanker. This system 
is designed to enable sharing of total drip Irrigation 
system by farmers and thus enabling procurement as a 
group rather than an individual farmer investing. Initial 
estimates suggested savings of upto Rs.2,500/- per acre 
and 45% lesser water consumption as compared to the 
conventional system of water purchase. Post prototype 
testing, it is now being replicated with 50 such mobile 
drip units benefitting around 3,000 acres. Basis the pilot 
experiences, ITC has plans to scale-up the system.
•	 ITC has been implementing Financial Literacy (FL) 
programme for SHG women to create financial literacy, 
help them in financial planning, and facilitate access 
to financial products as well as leverage Government 
schemes. After training, SHG women in Madhya Pradesh 
and Uttar Pradesh expressed need for support required 
by them to start livelihood intervention. Based on deeper 
assessments of these requirements, ITC consulted 
expert partners to initiate the livelihood intervention. 
ITC thereafter initiated a structured programme during 
the year, wherein women from low and middle-income 
backgrounds were provided with entrepreneurship 
development training along with mentoring to start, scale 
& successfully manage their enterprises. In West Bengal, 
basis feedback received during stakeholder engagements, 
WINGS (Women’s Initiative for Nurturing Growth and 
Sustainability) initiative was started to address livelihood 
issue of urban poor women with financial inclusion, 
mentoring, enterprise development and capacity building 
for market access as the major components. 
•	 Liquid waste management is a growing problem in 
rural areas in India. To address this, ITC has initiated work 
with Panchayats, helping them to plan for appropriate 
and cost-effective Liquid Waste Management structures 
and also supported them in the implementation. These 
solutions were contextualised based on inputs from expert 
knowledge agencies before implementation. As a result 
of this, construction of 16,000 soak pits and 300 other 
structures like vertical chambers, waste stabilisation 
ponds and horizontal filters was undertaken, both in LHI 
and other ITC project villages, facilitated by leveraging 
Swachh Bharat and Panchayat Funds.

5.	Describe the internal mechanisms in place to 
redress grievances related to human rights issues.
ITC’s open-door practices encourage amicable resolution 
of grievances. Employees are encouraged to first discuss 
the grievance with their immediate reporting authority 
and attempt to arrive at a resolution. If grievances persist, 
employees can fill up the Grievance Redressal Form and 
submit to the concerned HR Manager. The process of 
registering a grievance is by filling up a grievance form 
and submitting it to the concerned HR Manager which is 
then evaluated and analysed and a resolution is arrived 
and communicated to the employee. The grievance 
redressal guidelines and necessary forms are available 
on the Company intranet where employees can access the 
same directly. The ITC Whistleblower Policy (the Policy) 
encourages Directors and employees of the Company to 
promptly bring to the Company’s attention, instances of 
illegal or unethical conduct, actual or suspected incidents 
of fraud, actions that affect the financial integrity of 
the Company, or actual or suspected instances of leak 
of unpublished price sensitive information, that could 
adversely impact the Company’s operations, business 
performance and/or reputation. The Company investigates 
such reported incidents in an impartial manner and takes 
appropriate action to ensure that the requisite standards 
of professional and ethical conduct are always upheld. The 
Policy is available at https://www.itcportal.com/about-

ITC’s PSPD has large-scale Farm Forestry programmes promoting sustainable forest management with primary aim of 
securing pulpwood requirement for Business continuity. ITC also has a large-scale Social Forestry programme, which, 
in addition to sequestering carbon, also benefits the stakeholders by improving productivity of wasteland, and de-risking 
poor rural households by diversifying farm portfolios through promotion of tree-based farming.  During FY 2024-25, the 
Farm and Social forestry programmes have together sequestered over 6.4 million tonnes of CO2.
*Since ITC is a conglomerate with multiple businesses wherein physical output is reported in different units of measurement, 
hence the data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission intensity in terms of physical output (tonnes of production) is reported only 
for PSPD which accounts for more than 80% of ITC’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. For data of other Divisions, refer to

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
As part of its Sustainability 2.0 ambitions, ITC is targeting a 50% reduction in Specific GHG Emissions (% Reduction in 
Scope 1 & 2 emission per Unit of Production) by 2030.  Accordingly, actions are being undertaken to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by investing in energy efficiency and increasing share of renewable energy.
Energy efficiency:
All ITC Units focus on energy efficiency through process improvements and investment in new technologies. Over the 
years, ITC has implemented measures like installation of Vapour Absorption Machines (VAM), Automation in tube cleaning 
system of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), installation of variable frequency drive for pumps, blowers etc. 
and installation of energy efficient equipment such as chillers, AHUs, motors, fans, pumps, and agitators. In FY 2024-25, 
the investments in energy conservation equipment have resulted in energy savings of about 40 TJ, which is equivalent to 
over 5,000 tonnes of GHG emissions in the year.
In line with ITC’s focus on accelerating digitalisation across Businesses, ITC’s PSPD is implementing several transformative 
projects leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies across key business areas, to enhance productivity, reduce carbon footprint, 
achieve strategic cost efficiencies and superior product performance.
Some of the major projects undertaken by ITC’s PSPD as part of its Digital Transformation Programme include process 
debottlenecking and throughput improvement for productivity and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), process 
capability improvement leading to reduction in defects and resource optimisation.

Renewable energy:
ITC has invested in renewable energy projects, for both renewable electricity and renewable thermal requirements. In line 
with ITC’s continuous thrust on expanding renewable footprint across both thermal and electrical energy, this achievement 
was driven by the commissioning of state-of-the-art and future-ready High Pressure Recovery Boiler at the Bhadrachalam 
mill of the Company’s Paperboards & Specialty Papers Business which replaced conventional soda recovery boilers 
thereby reducing carbon footprint through lower coal consumption. Similar investments of biomass boilers were also 
undertaken in Foods, Cigarette and Personal Care Businesses. In addition to this, ITC has installed and commissioned 
174 MW2 of solar and wind power capacity across the country to meet its electrical energy requirements. Based on the 
investments in renewable electricity and renewable thermal projects, ITC has been able to increase its renewable energy 
share to 52% despite significant increase in its output.

In FY 2024-25, ITC continued to recycle over 99% of waste from its operations. In addition to this, the Company’s PSPD recycled 
nearly 85,000 tonnes of externally sourced post-consumer waste paper, thereby creating a positive environmental footprint. The 
Company also collected and sustainably managed more than 100% of its post-consumer plastic packaging waste.
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such waste
The Company has initiated measures across Units to ensure waste minimisation, segregation of waste at source and 
recycling. During the year, the recycling level reached 99%. In addition, nearly 85,000 tonnes of externally sourced post-
consumer waste paper was used as raw material during the year. 
ITC follows a proactive approach to manage hazardous chemicals by actively looking for alternatives, which not only 
helps keep its operations safe, but also ensures safest products for customers. This approach is demonstrated in 
pioneering practices implemented by ITC like Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching, and ozone bleaching technology 
in India in its Paper Business, and switching from solvent-based inks to water-based ones in its Packaging and 
Printing Business.

3.	With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas 
reported at Question 10 of Essential Indicators above, 
provide details of significant direct & indirect impact 
of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with 
prevention and remediation activities.
ITC’s Bhadrachalam Unit has necessary systems and 
processes to manage and mitigate any, environmental 
impact related to air, water, waste, noise, soil and 
dust pollution. For sustainable sourcing of wood, the 
social and farm forestry programme was started for 
promoting sustainable forests management practices 
in the value chain. Apart from sequestering carbon, this 
programme provides significant environmental benefits 
such as improving productivity of wasteland and has 
greened more than 1.3 million acres till date. For 
conserving biodiversity, the business in collaboration 
with Telangana Forest Department has created a 
“Sarapaka Biodiversity Conservation and Development” 
plot in ~440 hectares of Kistasagar Reserve Forest for 
regreening and regenerating the natural ecosystem 
including flora and fauna. 
ITC’s Bhadrachalam Unit is the first pulp & paper 
plant in the country to be rated ’GreenCo Platinum+’ 
by CII. The Unit has also achieved platinum-level 
certification as per Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) 
Standard. These recognitions highlight the facility’s 
commitment to environmental conservation and its 
strong performance on various green parameters, 
including energy efficiency, renewable energy, water 
and waste management. 
4.	If the entity has undertaken any specific initiatives 
or used innovative technology or solutions to improve 
resource efficiency, or reduce impact due to emissions 
/ effluent discharge / waste generated, please provide 
details of the same as well as outcome of such 
initiatives.
The Company has undertaken a number of initiatives, 
and also deployed innovative technologies across 
its operations for improving resource efficiency and 
minimising environmental impact. For details, refer to 
‘Disclosure on Conservation of Energy and Technology 
Absorption’ forming part of the Report of the Board of 
Directors & Management Discussion and Analysis in 
ITC Report and Accounts 2025, and ‘Climate Change’, 
‘Water Security’, ‘Towards Circularity’, ‘Chemical 
Safety Management’, and ‘Air Emissions Management’ 
sections of ITC’s Sustainability Report 2025.
5.	Does the entity have a business continuity and 
disaster management plan?
Yes, all Business Divisions within ITC have Business 
Continuity Plans (BCPs) that are duly approved by the 
Management Committee of their respective Businesses. 
The BCPs have been drawn up to encompass all 
operational aspects and undergo testing at scheduled 
intervals.
6.	Disclose any significant adverse impact to the 
environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. 
What mitigation or adaptation measures have been 
taken by the entity in this regard?
ITC has a Board approved Policy on ‘Sustainable 
Supply Chain and Responsible Sourcing’ and a ‘Code of 
Conduct for Suppliers and Service Providers’. The Code 
is shared and accepted by supply chain partners and 
service providers. ITC has a robust process of evaluating 
its Suppliers and Service Providers before engaging 
with them, proactively making them aware of its 
expectations/ requirements, and seeking commitment 
for 
compliance 
through 
contractual 
agreements. 
Additionally, ITC facilitates its value chain partners in 
handling any adverse impacts. For example, managing 
hazardous chemicals is not only important within ITC 
factories, but also in the supply chain. Within the supply 
chain, farmers working with hazardous pesticides is an 
area of special attention. ITC’s approach is to eliminate 
or reduce the use of hazardous pesticides. Intensive 
training is conducted on Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM), which helps adopt a holistic approach in reducing 
pesticide usage as well as substituting such pesticides 
with nature-based solutions. The training programmes 
also cover the safe handling of pesticides used and the 
responsible management of waste generated.
7.	Percentage of value chain partners (by value of 
business done with such partners) that were assessed 
for environmental impacts.
Key value chain partners like third-party manufacturers 
are encouraged to adopt management practices detailed 
under International Standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 
14001, OHSAS 18001 and ITC’s Environment, Health 
and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. Contract manufacturing 
agreements also include aspects of EHS. Systems are 
in place for monitoring and reporting on key Third-Party 
Manufacturers’ (TPMs) environmental performance, 
including energy, water and waste management. ITC’s 
leading Agri value chains are assessed for certification 
standards such as Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC)®, 
Rainforest Alliance, Sustainable Tobacco Programme 
(STP 2.0), G.A.P., etc. These standards, among others, 
also 
include 
environmental 
criteria. 
Additionally, 
ITC conducts third-party assessment of its Critical 
Tier-1* suppliers on an ongoing basis, and this 
assessment covers key aspects on environmental 
compliance and management practices. As on 31st 
March, 2025, ~70% of ITC’s critical tier 1 suppliers have 
been assessed.
*All ITC Businesses have identified Critical Tier-1 suppliers 
based on buy value, ESG risk exposure and importance to 
business continuity, among others. ITC’s Sustainable Supply 
Chain Programme is focussed on working closely with the set 
of identified Critical suppliers.

Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of this report. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). 
KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (the Firm) applies International Standard on Quality 
Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial 
Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard 
requires the Firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or 
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
Other information 
Management and the Board of Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the Company’s Report and Accounts 2025 (but 
does not include the BRSR Core attributes including the Exhibit-A to BRSR and assurance report thereon). 
The Company’s Report and Accounts 2025 is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
assurance report. 
Our reasonable assurance on the BRSR Core attributes including the Exhibit-A to BRSR, does not cover the 
other information and we are not expressing any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our assurance on the BRSR Core attributes including the Exhibit-A to BRSR, our 
responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available, and in doing so, 
consider whether other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core including the Exhibit-A 
to BRSR, or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Report and Accounts 2025, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, 
we are required to communicate the matter to Those Charged With Governance and describe actions 
applicable under the applicable laws and regulations. 
Intended use or purpose 
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the 
BRSR Core attributes including the Exhibit-A to BRSR, the reporting criteria and who have read the 
information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at 
appropriate levels of materiality.

• 
preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria;  
• 
ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanations; 
• 
establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such 
targets, goals and performance measures; 
• 
providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the 
report; 
• 
ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts; 
•

informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI; and 
• 
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI. 
Those Charged With Governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s

Inherent limitations  
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevance of information to be included, and make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core attributes including the Exhibit-A to BRSR metrics, some 
of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG 
Footprint, Water Footprint, Energy Footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our 
opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information covered by reasonable assurance, 
whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through 
understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also 
obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by reasonable assurance in 
order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we: 
 
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable 
assurance;  
 
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the 
preparation of the information covered by reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates 
made by the Company;  
 
performed substantive testing of data related to ISI, limited to 20 operational locations of the Company 
(namely, Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICML) Mysore; ICML 
Kapurthala; ICML Panchla; ICML Haridwar; ICML Pune; Branded Packaged Foods business (FBD) 
Munger, ITC Maurya; Sheraton, New Delhi, Paperboards and Specialty Papers Division (PSPD) 
Tribeni; PSPD Kovai; PSPD Bhadrachalam; Personal Care Products Business Division (PCPBD) 
Manpura; PCPB Haridwar; India Tobacco Division (ITD) Bangalore; ITD Pune; ITD Munger; KGLT 
Mysore; Packaging and Printing Business (PPB)Munger; PPB Nadiad; PPB Haridwar); 
 
relied on the audited standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025, audited by 
Company’s statutory auditors, for financial data included in the BRSR Core format as per Annexure-1 
namely- Principle 1- E8, Principle 1 - E9, Principle 3 - E1c, Principle 8 - E4 and Principle 8 - E5; and
