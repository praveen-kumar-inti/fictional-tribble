Key initiatives include the installation of a rainwater harvesting system, which captures and utilizes rainwater effectively. The 
Company also recycles wastewater, repurposing it for non-potable uses such as flushing and irrigation of plants. Additionally, 
sensor-based water taps have been installed to minimize water wastage, reflecting our commitment to reducing our 
environmental footprint.
 
These efforts underscore the Company’s proactive approach to water conservation, even in the absence of industrial-scale

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Waste Management Practices:
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Our company has implemented comprehensive waste management practices focused on minimizing environmental impact 
and promoting sustainability. We emphasize the segregation of waste at the source, with distinct processes for managing dry, 
wet, and e-waste. Dry waste, including paper and packaging materials, is primarily recycled through certified vendors, while 
wet waste is composted or treated for safe disposal. E-waste is handled by authorized recyclers to ensure proper disposal 
and recovery of valuable materials. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have also taken significant steps to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics by transitioning to biodegradable 
alternatives across all our facilities. Furthermore, through employee awareness programs, we promote waste reduction and 
encourage sustainable practices within the workplace.
 
Strategy to Reduce Hazardous and Toxic Chemicals:
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
As a service-oriented business, our operations involve minimal use of hazardous or toxic chemicals. However, in instances 
where such substances are necessary—such as in cleaning and maintenance—we prioritize the use of eco-friendly, non-
toxic alternatives. Our procurement policies favor suppliers who offer environmentally safe products, and we regularly review 
and update our practices to align with the latest industry standards for safety and sustainability. 
 
 
To manage any hazardous waste that may arise, we have established strict protocols for safe handling, storage, and 
disposal, in compliance with regulatory requirements. We engage certified waste management partners to ensure that
