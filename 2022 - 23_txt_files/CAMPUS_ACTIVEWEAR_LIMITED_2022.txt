whether risk or

In case of risk,

Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Human capital
Opportunity
Opportunity: 
Contended human 
capital would lead to 
increased productivity 
and in-turn profitability 
for business.
To retain high potential 
skilled manpower, 
Campus has launched 
ESOP Plans, Special 
Grant 2021 and Vision 
Pool 2021. Families 
were also supported 
during the COVID 19 
pandemic.
Positive: With optimum 
investment in human 
capital, the company 
increases its chances of 
success and sustainable 
growth year-on-year. It 
also improves efficiency 
because the system 
places employees in 
roles where they can 
perform at their best.
2
CSR activities
Opportunity
Opportunity: Investing 
in CSR activities, and 
diligently conducting 
the same on periodic 
basis have a number of 
advantages including 
increased brand 
recognition, positive 
company reputation, 
accelerated growth, 
competitive advantage 
over peers etc.
CSR activities 
were aimed 
towards benefiting 
underprivileged 
communities. Mobile 
medical units, medical 
camps, contributions 
towards education, 
contributions towards 
Paralympic sports 
were some of the CSR 
activities undertaken.
Positive: Funding and 
implementing CSR 
activities creates a 
positive brand value 
for the company. 
Upliftment of the 
community through 
various initiatives 
in underprivileged 
areas towards their 
health, education etc 
helps in positive social 
development.
3
ESG oversight
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Ignoring 
or avoiding ESG 
parameters in a 
business can lead to 
discontent among 
shareholders, potential 
litigation, damage to 
their reputation, or 
regulatory investigation
Opportunity: 
Considering ESG 
strategy in business 
operations paves the 
way for a company 
to gain investor 
confidence, earn 
customer loyalty, 
reduce operating costs 
and improve both 
asset management and 
financial performance.
Risk: Although we had 
already incorporated 
various aspects of 
Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) 
principles into our day-
to-day operations, we 
commenced the practice 
of formal ESG reporting 
in the previous fiscal 
year. 
Opportunity: Our 
primary emphasis is 
placed on highlighting  
ESG matters that hold 
significance for us. Some 
of these include CSR 
activities, energy water 
waste management, 
policy development and 
implementation.  We 
would be publishing 
our first BRSR report 
which would reflect our 
commitment towards 
ESG issues and as 
such our commitment 
towards society at large.
Positive: Leadership 
oversight on the ESG 
strategy, action plan, 
and performance 
facilitates the 
amplification of the 
Company’s positive 
impact on the 
environment and 
community. It also 
enables the company to 
further embed robust 
monitoring mechanisms 
across ESG initiatives 
and business practices.

4
Supply chain 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Some of the risks 
related to supply chain 
that can be mitigated 
by proper management 
can be:
1. natural disasters- 
vulnerable to property 
damage due to natural 
disasters
2. keeping up with local/ 
regional sanctions and 
regulations 
3. Sub-par performance 
by suppliers where the 
supplier fails to meet 
agreed performance 
criteria
Opportunity: 
Strong supply chain 
management creates 
opportunities for 
creating a strong 
economy, flawless 
manufacturing, better 
quality management, 
improved collaboration 
with stakeholders
Ongoing and 
continuous 
collaboration 
with our trusted 
vendors, regulators, 
manufacturers, 
financiers and logistics 
teams has helped 
create an efficient 
supply chain for our 
company. We have 
created an efficient due 
diligence process before 
getting any vendor or 
supplier on-board.
Positive: Maximum 
business of the 
company can be 
ensured by an 
efficient supply chain 
management.  This also 
results from reduced 
environmental impact 
and long-term value 
to the company's 
sustainability-led 
endeavours.
Negative: Inefficient 
supply chains have 
faced headwinds from 
unforeseen demand 
and limited logistics 
capacity. A mismanaged 
supply chain leads to 
ineffective utilization 
of resources, hampers 
natural procurement 
of materials and 
elimination of waste 
throughout the product 
lifecycle.
5
Regulatory 
and legal 
compliances
Risk 
Risk: Compliance with 
statutory and regulatory 
requirements requires 
awareness and 
training at all levels 
of the organization. 
The lack of awareness 
and training can lead 
to non-compliance, 
resulting in penalties 
and legal action
We have our policies 
in place related to 
code of conduct, and 
whistle blower. We 
have also provided an 
online platform for 
consumers to register 
their complaints, so 
as to have better 
customer relations and 
avoid any unnecessary 
legal consumer 
hassles (https://www.
campusshoes.com/
pages/contact)
Negative: Non-
compliance would lead 
to loss of reputation 
and consequently affect 
the business activities. 
Companies who are 
compliant with the 
regulatory laws have a 
better ability to manage 
risks and builds a 
better sense of fairness 
and loyalty among 
stakeholders.
6
Health & 
safety
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Work place 
hazard can have 
significant impact on 
a business, including 
loss of productivity, 
reduction of sales, low 
staff morale, and loss of 
reputation.
We have conducted 
multiple trainings on 
POSH, Health & Safety, 
Kaizen, 5S, Quality 
Management, Worker's 
right & responsibilities 
for workers, to inculcate 
a culture and mindset 
of safety.
Positive: Greater 
work participation 
and increased 
social inclusion, less 
workplace injury and 
workers’ compensation 
claims, higher 
performance, greater 
work participation 
and increased social 
inclusion, increased

brand value and good

some of the positives 
of incorporating

manufacturing.
Negative: The most 
significant consequence 
of a poor safety culture 
is increased injury 
and death among 
employees. Increased 
cost, increased 
employee absence, 
higher healthcare costs, 
workers’ compensation 
payments, lost 
productivity and 
business disruption are 
other ill effects of poor 
health and safety at 
workplace.
7
Human rights
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Forced labour 
can cause employees 
to suffer physical and 
mental abuse, resulting 
in serious physical 
and mental health 
problems. Forced 
labour can lead to a 
loss of talent, requiring 
the company to invest 
more in rehiring and 
training employees, 
thus negatively affecting 
business.
Opportunity: 
Parameters on human 
rights such as fair 
working environment, 
equal opportunities, 
remuneration, freedom 
of association without 
ethnic discrimination 
will positively impact 
the performance of 
the company on the 
social front from the 
employee's perspective.
Training and awareness 
of all the employees 
and workers are 
periodically conducted. 
Clause related to 
Human rights in value 
chain agreements and 
contracts are provided. 
The Company does not 
itself indulge in any kind 
of child labour in any 
of its operation. It also 
does not collaborate 
with any vendors 
violating the human 
rights of its employers.
Negative: Loss of 
knowledge and highly 
experienced and 
skilled staff, high 
costs of recruitment 
and training, loss 
of productivity in 
workplaces are some of 
the ill effects of ignored 
human rights in a 
company.
Positives: Committed 
to providing equal 
opportunities which is 
free from harassment 
and discrimination 
benefit from increased 
morale among its 
employees and avoid 
unnecessary industrial 
relations problems. 
It also improves 
productivity.
