1
Product 
Design and 
Innovation
O
In the dynamic textile market, 
staying competitive and current 
can 
be 
achieved 
through 
product design and innovation. 
By 
embracing 
emerging 
technologies and materials, textile 
manufacturers can seize new 
market prospects and enhance 
their 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
productivity. 
Furthermore, 
innovation in textile materials 
and 
manufacturing 
processes 
holds the potential to reduce the 
industry’s environmental footprint.
The 
Company 
is 
continuously 
investing 
in 
new 
innovative 
technologies 
across 
spinning, 
weaving 
and 
processing 
to 
bring 
differentiated 
products 
to its customers. One 
very large opportunity to 
leverage is ‘Recycling’. It 
ties into 12th goal of SDG 
of UN hence it is very 
relevant for customers.
Positive
In 
this 
increasingly 
competitive environment, 
customers value product 
design 
and 
innovation 
- they prefer to work 
with suppliers who offer 
them innovation across 
process, products and 
costs
2
Carbon 
Emissions 
and Energy 
Management
R
The process of production in a 
textile company can contribute 
notably to its carbon footprint. 
Besides greenhouse gases (GHGs), 
the manufacturing process might 
also release other air pollutants 
such as sulphur dioxides (SOx), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other 
harmful airborne substances.
The 
Company 
has 
successfully 
initiated 
usage 
of 
sustainable 
fuels like biomass for 
generating steam. This 
is replacing coal thereby 
reducing GHG emissions. 
Company is increasing 
the usage of energy from 
renewable 
resources 
(solar 
panels) 
to 
address scope 1 energy 
consumption
Positive
Brands globally have high 
traction for reduction of 
GHG emissions. This is 
viewed as an opportunity 
in 
terms 
of 
increase 
in business as brands 
have favourable outlook 
towards 
Company’s 
environmental initiatives.
3
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
R
Water plays a pivotal role in 
production processes. Businesses 
with operations that consume large 
amounts of water may encounter 
increased risks of operational 
interruptions due to water scarcity. 
This can also cause a surge in 
water procurement costs and 
capital investments. Concurrently, 
manufacturing activities produce 
process wastewater that needs 
to be treated prior to discharge. 
Failure to adhere to water quality 
standards could lead to expenses 
associated 
with 
regulatory 
compliance and mitigation.
The 
Company 
has 
installed a waste water 
recovery facility.
Positive
As the Company is into 
B2B 
business, 
water 
conservation is viewed 
positively by customers. 
Therefore, the Company 
will be a preferred supplier 
to these customers.

Waste 
Management
R
Waste is generally produced as 
a by-product of a company’s 
operational activities, machinery 
maintenance, and administrative 
tasks. 
Inadequate 
waste 
management could lead to air 
pollution, climate change, and 
a range of direct and indirect 
consequences on the ecosystem. 
It may also pose health and safety 
risks.
At Company we recycle 
and re-use process waste 
as well as post industrial 
waste
Positive
In 
order 
to 
meet 
sustainable 
goals 
companies around the 
globe is preferring to 
work with suppliers who 
can offer fabrics with re-
cycled components. The 
Company meet with these 
categories and will meet 
in future and gain more 
business opportunities.
5
Responsible 
Chemical 
Management
R
Hazardous chemicals can pose 
threats to the health and safety of 
both employees and consumers 
who interact with the products. 
Various nations enforce limitations 
or prohibitions on the usage of 
certain substances, and non-
compliance with these regulations 
can lead to legal sanctions and 
fines. Additionally, the Company 
holds 
the 
responsibility 
for 
controlling any risks associated 
with the storage and manipulation 
of 
hazardous 
chemicals. 
Inappropriate handling of these 
substances, including spills, can 
inflict damage on the environment 
and human health, while also 
exposing the Company to hefty 
fines and potential damage to its 
reputation.
There 
is 
a 
robust 
Chemical 
Management 
System (CMS) in place 
at Company. This has 
resulted in our facilities 
getting 
certified 
for 
credible certifications like 
ZDHC, OEKOTEX, GOTS. 
This CMS is continuously 
monitored by 3rd party 
auditors.
Negative
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms 
of loss of business if the 
CMS is not complied with.
6
Employee 
wellbeing
R
Greater employee retention often 
signifies 
effective 
company 
policies and practices. Conversely, 
a high rate of employee turnover 
could 
signal 
low 
employee 
satisfaction to potential investors. 
Prioritizing employee welfare can 
enhance team morale and lower 
costs associated with recruitment 
and new employee integration.
During the year under 
review, safety & skill up-
gradation training was 
given to all the employees 
of the Company.

Human Rights
R
Companies 
that 
prioritize 
the respect of human rights 
showcase 
their 
dedication 
to 
fostering sustainable and mutually 
advantageous connections with 
individuals who are influenced 
or affected by their activities, 
including customers, communities, 
employees, and investors. By doing 
so, they exhibit a genuine concern 
for the well-being of the people 
whose lives they engage with.
The Company ensures 
respect, dignity, fairness, 
and human rights of all 
our members. Our anti-
discrimination 
Policy 
covers this. The Company 
has procedures in place 
including internal code of 
conduct
Negative
8
Product 
Quality & 
Safety
R
In the textile industry, ensuring 
safety and product quality is 
of utmost importance for any 
business. Emphasizing product 
quality and safety not only helps 
the sector enhance its reputation, 
but also builds customer loyalty, 
gains a competitive advantage, 
reduces liability risks, and ensures 
compliance 
with 
regulations. 
By investing in the quality and 
safety of their products, textile 
manufacturers 
can 
secure 
their 
long-term 
success 
and 
sustainability.
There is a robust Process 
Control 
and 
Quality 
Assurance 
System 
in 
place. This is backed 
by a 100% inspection of 
goods before dispatch. 
Thanks to this, there have 
been ‘Zero’ incidents of 
product recall on account 
of safety
Negative
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms 
of loss of business if 
the safety and quality 
standards are not met
9
Workplace 
Health & 
Safety
R
Failure 
to 
ensure 
the 
health 
and safety of workers can lead 
to financial penalties and legal 
consequences. Serious incidents 
can result in severe injuries and 
potential liabilities due to legal 
or regulatory actions. Health and 
safety risks can also lead to project 
delays and downtime, which in 
turn increase project costs and 
reduce profitability.
There is a skilled and 
empowered 
safety 
team 
at 
locations 
of 
the 
Company. 
It 
has 
implemented 
the 
right 
processes and takes up 
regular training sessions 
backed up by safety drills. 
Safety monitoring metrics 
like
1.	 Accident Frequency
2.	 Accident Severity Rate 
and
3.	 Accident 
Incident 
Rate 
are 
regularly 
monitored 
and 
recorded by the Head 
of Safety
Negative
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms 
of loss of business if the 
workplace 
health 
and 
safety standards are not 
met.

Corporate 
Governance
R
Businesses undergo evaluation 
based 
on 
their 
performance 
across various critical governance 
matters, encompassing aspects 
such as ownership and control, 
board compensation, accounting 
practices, business ethics, and tax 
transparency. This assessment 
explores 
the 
impact 
of 
a 
company’s corporate governance 
and 
business 
ethics 
on

robust system of internal 
controls, which ensures 
precise 
reporting 
and 
adherence to all pertinent 
regulatory 
laws 
and 
organizational 
policies. 
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
code 
of 
conduct, 
along 
with 
whistleblower and insider 
trading 
policies, 
which 
serve 
to 
protect 
the 
interests of investors and 
other stakeholders.
Negative
The Non-compliance of 
corporate 
governance 
provisions 
can 
lead 
to various penalties & 
strictures from Regulatory 
authorities 
which 
can 
lead 
to 
financial 
and 
regulational 
losses 
to 
Company.

It gives me immense pleasure to present to you our inaugural Sustainability Report. This report is a testament to our unswerving 
commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles as we endeavour to make Jindal a beacon of sustainability 
within the textile manufacturing industry.
Our sustainability journey is underscored by various challenges including the pressing need to combat climate change, the 
necessity for responsible consumption and production and the goal to ensure clean water and sanitation. We have recognized these 
challenges, turned them into opportunities, and are actively strategizing and implementing measures to tackle them effectively.
One of our notable achievements in combating climate change has been our successful initiation of sustainable fuels for steam 
generation, replacing coal and thereby substantially reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, to address our scope 1 
energy consumption, we have embraced renewable energy, significantly increasing our use of solar panels.
Our commitment to water stewardship is evidenced by the installation of a waste water recovery and Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) water treatment facility. This innovation allows us to treat and reuse our process water, demonstrating our commitment to 
minimizing water wastage and ensuring clean water and sanitation.
The Company has a robust waste management system and we are proud to recycle and reuse our process waste as well as post-
industrial waste. We have also integrated a rigorous Chemical Management System (CMS), resulting in our facilities receiving 
certifications like ZDHC, OEKO-TEX, and GOTS. This CMS is continuously monitored by third-party auditors, ensuring we comply 
with global standards.
Our focus on quality assurance is unwavering. We have a robust process control and Quality Assurance System in place, backed 
by 100% inspection of goods before dispatch. As a result, we are proud to report zero incidents of product recall due to safety 
concerns.
The Company  continues to invest in innovative technologies across spinning, weaving and processing to deliver differentiated, 
high-quality products to our customers. Our skilled and empowered safety team implements rigorous safety protocols at all our 
locations and conducts regular training sessions complemented by safety drills. Safety monitoring metrics such as Accident 
Frequency, Accident Severity Rate and Accident Incident Rate are regularly monitored and recorded by the Head of Safety, ensuring 
a safe and healthy working environment.
We recently conducted a materiality assessment to identify potential risks and opportunities. This strategic exercise helps us to 
foresee and navigate challenges, enhancing our resilience in this volatile business environment. Additionally, we have initiated 
emission calculations and are now more strategically equipped to reduce our energy consumption.
Our sustainability journey, while making significant strides, is far from complete. We are aware of the road that lies ahead and the 
need for continuous improvement. Our resolve remains firm, to create a sustainable future through our actions and innovations, 
and we are confident that with your continued support, we will accomplish our ambitious sustainability goals.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress 
grievances of the community.
The Company's operations are designed to ensure that we have 
no direct or indirect negative impact on the environment or 
society. We strive to maintain positive Industrial Relations (IR) and 
minimize any related grievances. Additionally, we regularly engage 
in meetings with community stakeholders to gain insights into their 
needs and aspirations.
If any grievances arise within the community, they are initially 
communicated to our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) team. 
Depending on the nature of the grievance, it is then discussed with 
the relevant department. We make an effort to provide suggestions 
or solutions to address the issue, which are subsequently 
communicated to the community. Following mutual agreement, an 
action plan is executed to resolve the matter.
To facilitate communication, the community has the option to 
submit grievances or general inquiries via email.
