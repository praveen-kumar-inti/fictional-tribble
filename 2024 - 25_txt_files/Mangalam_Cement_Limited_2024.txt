Occupational
Health and
Safety
Risk and
Opportunity
Risk- Failure to protect
workers from occupational
hazards can result in
legal action, fines, and
compensation claims
against the company. These
risks can lead to significant
financial liabilities and
damage the company's
reputation.
Also, potential employees
may hesitate from joining
the company, and current
employees may leave if they
perceive their health and
safety are not adequately
protected, leading to
challenges in attracting and
retaining a skilled workforce.
Opportunity- By prioritising
the well-being of all
employees and workers, the
company can enhance its
employer brand, making it
a more attractive place to
work. Employees are more
likely to join and stay with a
company that prioritises their
well-being, leading to lower
turnover rates and higher
employee satisfaction.
We have developed safety
initiatives including
competency development,
training, audits, inspections,
surveys, We Care initiatives,
C r i t i c a l  
C o n t r o l
Management to prevent
unwanted events, and
especial cross functional
teams to drive process
safety. Also, we conduct
safety audits across our
manufacturing sites to
ensure that the actions are
t i m e l y  c l o s e d  a n d
implemented.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and
achievements (listed entity had flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure).
At Mangalam Cement, we believe any business enterprise cannot sustain in an environment of complete insularity and
isolation. It needs to continually draw resources from the community, while giving back something in return. This symbiotic
relationship with the community represents the bedrock of sustainable and holistic development, both for the community
and the corporate.
At Mangalam Cement, green initiatives are integral to our corporate philosophy. We adopt eco-friendly processes to
minimise our environmental footprint and promote green awareness to help shape a cleaner and greener tomorrow. We
are implementing measures to minimise our carbon footprint and help protect the environment. This is part of our
sustainable business blueprint requirements.
Pollution-free Plant Vicinity
We monitor the performance of our pollution-control equipment regularly. We have enhanced focus on ensuring dust-
free surroundings, so all the transfer points of raw materials are provided with water mist dust suppression system.
Besides, consistent water sprinkling (from harvested water) in the vicinity of the dust emission area is conducted to
reduce dust levels. The effluent treatment plant ensures zero discharge.
Wind Energy
We have an aggregate wind turbine capacity of 13.65 MW at Jaisalmer, India. It helps reduce CO2 emissions.
Safety
To cultivate and promote safety amongst the employees at the plant, the Company celebrated National Safety Week.
The mission of the National Safety Week Celebration was to collectively raise awareness about the importance of safety
measures and how to implement them in day-to-day activities. A series of competitions and activities related to safety
were organised throughout the week for employees and their family members. During the National Safety Day function,
employees and workers gathered and undertook a "Safety Pledge" to reaffirm their commitment to ensuring health and
safety. Safety banners and posters were also displayed at various locations along with the distribution of tokens and
articles promoting safety awareness and alertness among all the employees.

Hazardous waste generated viz. lube oil, grease and oily cotton, is managed through authorized recyclers in terms of the Provisions
of Hazardous waste rules, 2016.

Mangalam Cement Ltd. made Cemented Roads to control fugitive emission by automobiles. Dust cleaning system like mechanized
sweeping machines for removing dust from Roads inside the units to avoid dispersion of dust and good housekeeping practices

wastes.
No process waste is generated from cement plant operation; however, some solid waste gets generated from utilities and offices

-
Mangalam Cement Ltd. Installed Bio-methanation / Composting System for disposal of biodegradable waste.
-
Hazardous waste generated viz. lube oil, grease and oily cotton, is managed through authorized recyclers in terms of the
Provisions of Hazardous waste rules, 2016.
-
The company re-uses the fly ash and bottom ash generated from its captive power plants.
-
Mangalam Cement Ltd. made Cemented Roads to control fugitive emission by automobiles. Dust cleaning system like mechanized
sweeping machines for removing dust from Roads inside the units to avoid dispersion of dust and good housekeeping practices
have been adopted to control Fugitive emissions.
-
The solid waste generation from the Cement plant is mainly dust, which is collected from various control equipment & recycled
back to the system, results there is no solid waste generation from the plant.
-
The fly ash and bottom ash generated from power plant are basically mineral admixture and possess Pozzolanic properties.
Hence, the entire ash received from the boiler utilised for cement blending.
-
Sewage Treatment Plant sludge used as manure in green belt development.
