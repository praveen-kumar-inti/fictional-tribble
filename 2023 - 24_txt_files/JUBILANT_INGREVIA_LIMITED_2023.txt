Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements 
(listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
It is with great pleasure that we present to you the BRSR report of Jubilant Ingrevia Limited for the fiscal year 2023-24. In the face of 
complex global challenges, we remain steadfast in our commitment to a sustainable future and are proud of the progress we have 
made as a company.
	
The past year has been eventful for Jubilant Ingrevia Limited, marking the third year since our demerger from Jubilant Pharmova 
Limited. Despite the global turmoil caused by ongoing conflicts, climate change, and the post-pandemic scenario affecting individuals 
worldwide, we have achieved several significant milestones.
	
Our success is rooted in the dedication and values of our people. With more than 2,300 employees across the Company, we emphasise 
respect, integrity, and agility in all that we do. We continue to foster an inclusive culture and strive to improve our representation goals, 
knowing that a diverse and balanced workforce allows us to better engage with our customers.
	
Sustainability is deeply ingrained in our culture and actions. We are committed to delivering on our promise of caring, sharing, and 
growing. Before the demerger, our sustainability reporting journey began in 2013, following the guidelines of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI). In parallel, we have implemented various policies and international standards to enhance the maturity and resilience of 
our management and governance systems, addressing ever-changing business risks, including environmental, social, climate change, 
and conflict-related risks.
	
We attained an outstanding 93 percentile globally (CHM Chemicals) with a 57/100 score in the S&P Global ESG Indices CSA 2023 (DJSI). 
We take pride in attaining a GOLD Sustainability rating (score 73) in EcoVadis, placing us among the top 5% of global pharmaceutical 
companies. This achievement underscores our dedication to environmental, social, and governance factors. Additionally, we have 
received an impressive ‘B’ score band from CDP for ‘Climate Change’ and a ‘C’ score band for ‘Water Security.’ Additionally, we are fulfilling 
the reporting requirements of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) mandated by SEBI. 
	
In line with our commitment to climate mitigation and stakeholder demands, we have conducted a detailed Product Carbon Footprint 
(PCF) study of 28 products based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) following the ISO 14067:2018 standard. We have also engaged a third 
party assurance the Cradle to Gate LCA-based PCF of these 28 products. We are committed to further greening our power across all 
our facilities and have engaged a third-party consultant to help us achieve this goal. Through various energy-saving measures, we have 
successfully reduced our overall energy consumption by 20% and our specific energy consumption decreased by 10% during this 
reporting period.

We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. In FY 2024, we achieved our target of increasing the percentage of 
women in our workforce to 5.8%. We will continue to work towards creating a more inclusive workplace for all employees. 
	
Overall, we maintain an optimistic outlook for the years ahead as we continue to invest in long-term projects that drive growth and 
sustainability. We have put considerable effort into this sustainability disclosure and value your feedback on how we can further 
improve.

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
At Jubilant Ingrevia Limited, the non-hazardous waste is either recycled or reused by the third parties. Fly ash, metal scrap, plastic scrap, 
paper and wooden material scraps are a few major contributors of non-hazardous waste. Further, the Company is highly committed 
about minimising plastic waste and avoiding littering. Hence, the products are packaged in bulk quantity and in tankers, which 
considerably reduces the Company’s consumption of packaging materials. The Company believes in supporting circular consumption 
patterns of re-using, restoring and re-pairing rather than buying new products. Some products are sent in drums and carboys, which

are reused wherever feasible. The Company follows the following methods for proper disposal of the hazardous waste generated at its 
facilities, depending on their nature and local regulation: 
	
• 	
Recycle and Reuse through authorised third party 
	
• 	
Co-processing at cement kiln 
	
• 	
Secured land fill 
	
• 	
Incineration (both solid and liquid)
