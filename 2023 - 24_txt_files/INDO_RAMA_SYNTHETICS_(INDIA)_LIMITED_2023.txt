1
Climate Change 
Adaptation
R
Global warming and the subsequent 
need for adaptive measures can 
profoundly affect Indo Rama Synthetics 
(India) Limited operational activities. 
Severe weather phenomena like 
storms can disrupt supply chains, 
damage infrastructure and machinery, 
and increase costs. Alongside these 
effects, future regulatory stipulations 
could further amplify regulatory risks, 
impacting the company’s functions.
Indo Rama Synthetics India Limited 
understands the potential risks of 
climate change and has strategically 
taken steps to mitigate them 
and enhance the resilience of its 
business model.
Negative
2
Waste Risk 
Management
R
The issue of waste management poses 
a risk for the Company, primarily due 
to its potential environmental and 
regulatory consequences. If waste 
management practices are inadequate, 
it can result in environmental 
contamination, statutory non-
compliance, and damage to the 
company’s reputation. Indo Rama 
Synthetics (india) Limited can mitigate 
these risks by effectively addressing 
waste management to minimise 
its environmental footprint, ensure 
regulatory compliance, and explore 
potential avenues for resource 
recovery through circular economic

3
Resource 
Opportunity 
efficiency
O
Resource efficiency offers a significant 
opportunity for the Company 
to optimise resource usage and 
substantially reduce waste generation 
due to the scale of its operations. 
By using energy, water, and raw 
materials optimally, the Company can 
enhance operational efficiency, reduce 
costs and minimise environmental 
impact. This approach aligns with the 
company’s sustainability objectives and 
strengthens its competitive edge.
Through the use of efficient 
technologies, process 
improvements, and responsible 
consumption practices, Company 
aims to optimise resource use and 
reduce inefficiencies.
Positive
4
Health & safety
R
Occupational Health and Safety 
represent significant risks for 
Company due to its labour-intensive 
manufacturing processes. The 
company’s operations are susceptible 
to the risk of injuries resulting from 
equipment failures and human errors.
The  Company provides training 
programmes to workers and 
employees and is committed for zero 
harm to its employees and workers.
Negative
5
Human Rights and 
Labour Conditions
R
Human rights violations represent a 
potential risk for Company due to its 
extensive supply chain and labour-
intensive operations.
Indo Rama has always been 
committed to foster a culture of 
caring and trust. This is embedded 
in its various corporate policies like 
Environment, Health and safety 
(EHS) Policy, Whistle blower policy, 
protection of Women’s Rights at 
Workplace Policy and the code of 
conduct.
Negative
6
Waste & Water 
Affluents
Risk
Access to a seamless supply of quality 
water is pivotal to our business 
functions. Water scarcity can impact 
our operations and result in supply 
chain disruptions. 
Company has initiated numerous 
actions to strengthen water 
stewardship. The company 
focuses on water conservation, 
treatment, and reuse. It aspires 
to lower its water consumption 
through continuous investments in 
advanced technologies and process 
improvements.

Date Security, 
Privacy and Cyber 
Security
R
Most companies today are conducting 
business using public Internet. Even 
though B2B may be relatively secure 
considering limited exposure, yet it still 
requires opening up of doors to enable 
such transactions. While all attempts 
are made to secure systems, yet with 
the advent of new technologies, the 
adversaries are seeking new means 
to bypass the security measures and 
enter the system. It is no more related 
to technical controls and with people 
being the weakest link, attempts to 
break the barriers through social 
engineering is on the rise.
The organization has onboarded 
one of the Big-4 consulting firms 
to manage the infrastructure and 
business applications. While several 
technical controls were in place that 
worked in isolation, a SIEM tool is 
being implemented to integrate 
the alerts from various systems 
and enable better insights to the 
operating environment. End user 
cyber security training program is 
conducted to ensure staff are well 
informed of the risks and means to 
curb or directions for subsequent 
actions in case of a security incident.
Negative
8
Ethics and 
compliance
O
An organization like ours, focusing on 
ethics and compliance creates a cordial 
business environment that helps in 
employee loyalty, thereby reducing 
attrition and assisting in attracting 
talent.
