Does the entity have any project related to reducing Greenhouse Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
Yes, LIC HFL is actively engaged in several projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here's an overview of some
of the key initiatives:
Installation of LEDs at Offices: LIC HFL has replaced conventional lighting with energy-efficient LED fixtures across the office
locations. This initiative has led to improved energy efficiency and a significant reduction in carbon emissions.
Green Tariff Procurement: Starting January 2025, LIC HFL has procured renewable (green) energy from utility providers for
five office locations. By FY 2024-25, this measure has resulted in a reduction of approximately 111.83 tonnes of C02e emissions.
On-site Solar Installation: In March 2025, LIC HFL commissioned a 10 kWp rooftop solar power plant at one of the offices.
This was the company's first in-house solar installation, which contributes to reduced dependency on the grid and a lowered
carbon footprint.
Al-based Energy Optimization: LIC HFL has implemented an Al-powered module to monitor and optimize energy consumption
across selected offices. This system utilizes intelligent analytics to identify inefficiencies and suggest corrective actions,
enhancing energy efficiency through data-driven decisions.
Sensor-based and Timer-controlled Lighting Systems: Sensor-based lighting systems and timer-controlled lighting have
been deployed across the facilities. These systems automate lighting control, which improves energy efficiency by reducing
electricity consumption and operational costs.

reduce unnecessary energy usage. 
Installed Power Factor (PF) correction 
devices at selected facilities to improve 
electrical efficiency and reduce energy losses 
caused by reactive power. 
Promoted use of recycled paper products 
across offices, thereby reducing dependence 
on virgin resources. 
As of FY 2024-25, green energy usage at five offices 
has resulted in a reduction of approximately 111.83 
tonnes of C02e emissions. 
First in-house solar installation to generate renewable 
energy, contributing to reduced grid dependency and 
carbon footprint. 
Enhanced energy efficiency by enabling data­
driven decisions and proactive measures to reduce 
unnecessary energy usage. 
Improved energy efficiency through automated 
lighting control, leading to reduced electricity 
consumption and operational costs. 
Improved power quality, reduced electricity wastage, 
and optimized energy consumption, contributing 
to cost savings and system stability. Power factor 
correction reduces reactive power demand, ensuring 
more efficient operation of electrical systems. By 
minimizing energy waste, companies can reduce 
electricity bills and avoid penalties imposed by utilities 
for low power factor. 
Helped conserve 20 trees, save 21,760 litres of water, 
and avoid 640 kg of CO2 emissions in FY 2024-25.

express any conclusion thereon. 
Management’s Responsibility 
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for 
preparing the Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if 
any, related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, Identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR 
and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and

observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness 
of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or 
reconciling with underlying records. 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we 
have:
