4.	 Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in 
brief and if available, provide a web-link to the policy.
Yes, anti-corruption and anti-bribery clauses are incorporated in Balmer Lawrie’s Fraud Prevention 
Policy.
The Company has a Fraud Prevention Policy which covers all aspects of anti-bribery. The policy is in 
place for detection, reporting and prevention of fraud. This policy covers all types of frauds irrespective 
of their nature. The Fraud Prevention Policy applies to all frauds committed or suspected, linked to 
the business of the Company, involving any employee, including the whole- time Directors (employed 
in any capacity including those deputed by other agencies to carry out any work for and on behalf 
of the Company) and other stakeholders such as vendors, suppliers, contractors, service providers, 
consultants or any other external agency / person having business relationship and / or associated 
with the Company in any manner, as well as their representatives.
The clause “Actions constituting fraud” under the sub-clause (x) of Fraud Prevention Policy talks 
about what constitutes bribery and corruption:
“Bribery or corruption, including inappropriate relationship with third parties causing conflict of interest 
and accepting or seeking anything of material value from contractors, vendors or any other person 
supplying material or providing services to the Company”
The objective of the “Fraud Prevention Policy” is to provide a system for detection, reporting and 
prevention of fraud, whether committed or suspected. The policy strives to:
• 
Promote a culture of zero tolerance to fraud or fraudulent conduct
• 
Communicate to employees and other stakeholders the Company’s approach to dealing with fraud 
and fraudulent action
• 
Provide a framework and lay down a procedure for detection, reporting and prevention of fraud or 
suspected fraud
Balmer Lawrie also has the Whistle Blower Policy in place. The Whistle Blower Policy provides 
employees a framework to report to the Management, instances of unethical behaviour, and actual or 
suspected fraud.
In the course of contracting, one has to deal with various vendors / suppliers / contractors / consultants 
who are expected to adopt and maintain highest standards and a high degree of ethics and integrity, 
commitments and sincerity towards the work undertaken by them. Any aberration, deviation and 
Balmer Lawrie&Co. Ltd. 
69
violation from the expected standards of supplies / services / behaviour of the contracting agencies is 
dealt in line with the policy framed on Blacklisting so that it becomes a deterrent for all. This policy is 
aimed at blacklisting the errant vendors and service providers by following the laid down procedure.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the Board.
	
Balmer Lawrie (BL) recognises the importance of proactive interaction with its stakeholders as it 
helps the Company in meeting their expectations and building stakeholder trust and confidence. 
In addition, the Company consults with its stakeholders on sustainability issues. BL conducts 
materiality  assessment process where it involves its stakeholders, and they are encouraged to 
give their perspectives on the Company’s sustainability goals. The Company engages with the 
stakeholders through materiality survey. The outcomes of stakeholder consultations are reviewed 
by Board Committee. 
	
The Board of Directors place their outlook on business of the Company  vis a vis the industry / the 
national and the world economy through the Annual Report, which is circulated to the shareholders.
	
The Annual General Meeting of the Company is called and conducted every year and the same 
essentially involves an interactive session between the shareholders and the Chairman.
2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the 
entity.
	
Stakeholder consultation significantly influences the shaping of our policies and activities 
towards social and environmental issues, allowing us to balance our business objectives with 
our commitment to our stakeholders, society and the environment.
	
For example, there was a policy to buy products from the marginalized section of the Society 
and Silvassa unit operates in the area where tribal population dominates. Therefore, with proper 
intervention SHG Group formation was enabled in that area, so that an enterprise would come up 
and the Company can procure from the SHG Groups. 
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Although none of the stakeholder group is identified as vulnerable / marginalized, the Company 
does engage with some stakeholder groups to understand their needs and provide the support to 
the extent possible. For instance, there is a policy to buy products from the marginalized sections 
of the Society and the Silvassa unit operates in the area where tribal population dominates. 
Therefore, stakeholder group formation was enabled in that area, so that an enterprise would 
come up and Company can procure from the stakeholder groups.

5.	 Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 
100 words/ web link.
Yes, our Emergency Response and Disaster Management Plan (ERDMP), Incident reporting System 
(IRS) and Evacuation Standard Operating Procedure ensure effective management of any disaster. 
Also, onsite and offsite mock drills are conducted to generate awareness and ensure preparation for 
actions that need to be taken during any accident.
At Balmer Lawrie, all our plants and units have a dedicated Emergency Response Team (ERT) 
which consists of incident handling team capable of managing any disaster.
Training and awareness sessions are conducted for the employees and emergency handling teams 
to prepare them for actual emergency situations.
6.	 Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain 
of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this

I.	 Drum manufacturing industries involve MS sheet cleaning / degreasing which is a chemical 
process and require huge amount of water on daily basis based on the plant size, but for IP we are 
using Dry MS coil which eliminates the degreasing process totally.
II.	 In IP - Taloja, the technology of barrel manufacturing is totally imported and not a single drop of 
water is required for the manufacturing processes.
III.	 This way we have mitigated the impact of value chain on environment totally.
