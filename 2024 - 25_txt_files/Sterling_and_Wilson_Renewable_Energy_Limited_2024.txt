Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.   Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
 
 I would like to reaffirm our steadfast dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. We recognize 
that while the renewable energy sector plays a pivotal role in addressing climate change, it also encounters its own unique 
ESG-related challenges. These include environmental issues such as land-use efficiency and sustainable waste management; 
social responsibilities like upholding fair labour standards across the supply chain and fostering meaningful community 
engagement; and the need for robust corporate governance focused on transparency and anti-corruption practices. At SWREL, 
we have set ambitious ESG goals and are actively advancing towards them. Our target is to enhance land-use efficiency by 15% 
by 2027 through innovative project designs and collaboration with environmental conservation organizations.
 
 On the social front, we have implemented a comprehensive supplier code of conduct, backed by regular audits, to ensure ethical 
labour practices. Our community development initiatives have significantly improved the quality of life around our project 
areas, surpassing our initial stakeholder engagement benchmarks.
 
 We hold a strong sense of accountability toward all our stakeholders. We actively engage with our workforce and have effectively 
delivered training sessions on diverse topics such as sustainability and inclusivity, mental health and well-being, ethics, and 
more. Building on these efforts, we have reinforced our commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contract 
workers, with continuous efforts to improve our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR).
 
 In addition, we have launched various development initiatives aimed at the upliftment and empowerment of communities 
located near our operational sites. In the financial year 2024-25, our community outreach programs have positively impacted 
2,37,162.51 Man hrs trainings.
 
 In terms of governance, we have strengthened our anti-corruption policies through mandatory employee training and the 
implementation of a secure whistleblower policy. We fully understand that the path to ESG excellence is a continuous journey. 
We remain committed to setting bold targets, engaging transparently with stakeholders, and constantly enhancing our ESG 
practices. By working in close partnership with all stakeholders, we believe we can create a sustainable, clean energy future.

hazards as they arise.
 
 
 Real-time hazard reporting is enabled through the Process Map software platform, which streamlines the submission, 
tracking, and resolution of safety observations. The entire process from hazard identification to the implementation of 
corrective actions is closely monitored to ensure timely and effective response.
 
 
 Our commitment to safety is reinforced by the active involvement of top management, who oversee and support the 
hazard reporting process to ensure that appropriate measures are planned and executed without delay.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
 
 Our organization operates with a robust Integrated Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) management system on a global 
scale. We proudly hold certification under the ISO 45001:2018 standard, affirming the effectiveness of our safety management 
protocols in addressing workplace health and safety concerns. Our dedication to safe work execution is further reinforced by 
comprehensive protocols for Contractors’ HSE management, a rigorous risk assessment process, a Permit-to-Work system, 
and robust Audit and Inspection protocols. As an integral component of our HSE management framework, we develop 
project-specific EHS plans at the outset of each new project. These plans delineate the key parameters of EHS management,

strengthen our safety practices.
 
 All incidents and accidents are thoroughly investigated to determine root causes, with preventive measures developed and 
applied accordingly. Lessons learned from these investigations are regularly shared across the organization to promote 
awareness and ensure formal compliance.
 
 Additionally, risk-based evaluations guide our focus on critical activities such as excavation, electrical work, working at height, 
permit-to-work systems, material handling, and road safety. These high-risk areas are continuously reviewed to drive targeted 
improvements and enhance overall workplace safety.

 We have integrated the Cross-Functional Audit Management System (CFMS) into our operations and enhanced the Permit to 
Work procedures to ensure a more robust safety management framework. These measures are aimed at significantly reducing 
safety-related incidents, with the goal of achieving zero incidents across our operations.
 
Some of the corrective actions undertaken are as follows:
 
a.  
 Implemented a safety audit system for value chain partners to address critical safety issues and ensure effective follow-up 
through the Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) mechanism. Additionally, SWREL conducts monthly review meetings 
with all value chain partners to understand their evolving requirements and align the systems accordingly.
 
b.  
 Established digitized controls in the CMMS Permit System by introducing a specific category for “Electrical Works with 
Isolation”. The system now ensures that only insulated tools are used by automatically selecting them during permit 
issuance, thereby enhancing operational safety.
 
c.  
 Conducted seven HSE awareness workshops for both senior and junior management teams, focusing on the dissemination 
of key safety messages and sharing of “Lessons Learnt” from past incidents to promote a culture of continual improvement.

plant lighting designs rely on LED technology, significantly reducing energy consumption. Additionally, we treat on-site sewage 
water for dust control purposes.
 
 To utilize alternate energy sources, we electrify our site offices with solar-powered inverters, reducing our dependence on 
DGs. We employ semi/fully automatic robots for PV module cleaning, which substantially cuts water and electricity usage. 
Solar lighting is also used for auxiliary consumption during the night.
 
 We have made significant capital investments in energy conservation equipment, including a mobile testing lab for PV modules. 
This facility allows us to test module performance on-site, improving testing efficiency and conserving energy that would 
otherwise be spent on logistics and transportation.
