Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
	
The Company has been a strong proponent of sustainable 
business and firmly believes that sustainability practices 
and business growth can progress together. Our 
consistently strong consumer-centric approach has earned 
us the dominant market space in this food category. 
Moreover, our capacity to adapt swiftly to changes in 
market demand and consumer behaviour retained us as 
our customer’s first choice. 
	
As we align our sustainable business practices with the 
global cause, we are introducing environmentally conscious 
and socially responsible initiatives at a faster rate than ever 
before. Though, we have always put sustainability at heart 
of every business decision we make, this year marks the 
beginning of our Report capturing our ESG initiatives that 
attune with six capitals of our business growth.
	
As an organization, we recognise the importance of 
sustainability at every level, set high targets for ourselves, 
and design strategic roadmaps to achieve those targets.
	
I am proud to announce that we have made considerable 
progress in transitioning our delivery fleet from internal 
combustion engines to electric mobility. Additionally, we 
were able to do our bit in mitigating carbon emissions 
by adopting energy conservation measures and using 
renewable energy to meet our energy needs. As we are 
extremely conscious of waste energy, we have set up 
Energy Management Systems (EMS) at all locations to 
monitor and control our energy demands.
	
We recognise our societal responsibilities and understand 
that we must play a role in society’s elevation. We executed 
various initiatives related to livelihood training, providing 
medical access, road and food safety trainings and our 
conscious steps for the inclusion of women diversity in our 
workforce. I am elated to inform that 300 women learnt 
driving from our society-led initiatives.

•	
Optimising energy through Energy Management 
Systems (EMS)
	
	
EMS are installed across stores and commissaries to 
reduce energy consumption. This year, the Company 
upgraded EMS for approximately 747 stores, which 
accounts for around 40% of the stores. Due to this the 
Company has been able to achieve energy savings of 
around 5%. 
	
•	
Switching to E-Bikes
	
	
The Company has made significant progress this year, 
increasing the number of e-bikes and e-cycle to 7,594, 
bringing the percentage of e-bikes to 33%. This is 
an important initiative to reduce carbon footprint and 
transition to a more sustainable future. The Company 
is focused on implementing e-bikes in all of the new 
stores, taking into account the local terrain. All of the 
bikes used in Popeyes and Hong's Kitchen are already 
electric.
	
•	
Other energy efficiency initiatives: Some of the  
initiatives at stores include retrofitting energy efficient 
air conditioners, deploying energy efficient ovens at 
new stores, and installing IoT devices at delivery bikes 
to monitor speed, time, and delivery efficiency. In 
addition, converting LPG to PNG at stores wherever 
available can lead to significant savings in emissions, 
reduced residual gas, and smoother operations. 
	
•	
Energy efficient ovens: Company’s efforts to absorb 
this technology have resulted in a 10% reduction in 
fuel consumption, which helped to save operational 
cost and also reduced the environmental impact. 
	
•	
Retrofitting old chiller: The project involved a detailed 
audit to identify areas of improvement and to assess 
the design versus actual conditions. This enabled a 
better understanding of the energy usage patterns and 
the identification of areas where energy could be saved. 
The project with energy-efficient chiller has resulted in 
significant cost savings of approximately 10 lakh Kwh 
and avoided, around 790 tCO2e.
	
•	
Replacing electric heating with heat pumps: 
	
	
This project involved replacing electric heaters with 
energy-efficient heat pumps, which are known for their 
high energy efficiency and low operating costs. By 
using heat pumps, the tray washer areas were able to 
maintain the required temperature for cleaning while 
consuming significantly less energy. 
	
	
The implementation of heat pumps at tray washer 
areas by replacing electric heaters has resulted in 
significant cost savings of around 3 lakh kwh and 
avoided around 237 tCO2e.
	
•	
Converting belt drives to direct drives with VFD’s: 
	
	
The belt and pulley system has been a common method 
for transmitting power for a long time, but it is not the 
most efficient method. The direct drive and variable 
frequency drive motors are much more efficient because 
they eliminate the energy loss that occurs when power 
is transmitted through belts and pulleys. The direct drive 
motor is directly connected to the load, while the variable 
frequency drive motor allows for variable speed control 
based on the actual load requirements, resulting in 
significant energy savings.
	
•	
Renewable energy: Solar Power Plants are already 
installed at commissaries in Greater Noida, Nagpur, 
Mumbai, and Kolkata, accounting for approximately 
11% of electricity demand of the Commissaries. This 
has also replaced 1,424 MWh of electricity generated 
by fossil fuels and hence avoided 1,125 tCO2e of 
emissions.

The materiality assessment process has been car-

quirements of the Sustainability Standards. 
 
Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engage-
ment, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the 
sustainability reporting, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information. 
It was not part of our engagement to review product- or service-related information, refer-
ences to external information sources, expert opinions and future-related statements in the 
Report. 
Responsibility of the Company 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the sustaina-
bility information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility includes in par-
ticular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability reporting, the collection 
and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, where appropri-
ate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsi-
ble for necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is 
free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information.

Assurance Statement
 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the verifi-
cation methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 17029 
and ISAE 3000.  
The applied level of assurance was “limited assurance”. Because the level of assurance ob-
tained in a limited assurance, the engagement is lower than in a reasonable assurance en-
gagement, the procedures the verification team performs in a limited assurance engagement 
vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance en-
gagement.  
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited 
as stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judg-
ment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement und materi-
ality analysis to understand the reporting boundaries 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for compil-
ing, analysing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal controls 
- 
Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, preparing and consoli-
dating sustainability information and performing internal controls 
- 
Analytical procedures and inspection of sustainability information as reported at group 
level by all locations 
- 
Assessment of local data collection and management procedures and control mecha-
nisms through a sample survey at Greater Noida, Kolkata & Bengaluru. 
Conclusion 
On the basis of the assessment procedures carried out from 01.05.2023 to 25.06.2023, Noth-
ing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the completeness with 
respect the Reporting Criteria. 
Limitations 
The assurance process was subject to the following limitations: 
- 
The subject matter information covered by the engagement are described in the “scope of 
the engagement”. Assurance of further information included in the sustainability reporting 
was not performed. Accordingly, TÜV SÜD do not express a conclusion on this information. 
- 
Financial data were only considered to the extent to check the compliance with the eco-
nomic indicators provided by the GRI Standards and were drawn directly from inde-
pendently audited financial accounts. TÜV SÜD did not perform any further assurance pro-
cedures on data, which were subject of the annual financial audit. 
- 
The assurance scope excluded forward-looking statements, product- or service-related in-
formation, external information sources and expert opinions. 
Use of this Statement

other party in the selected sustainability information, this assurance report or the conclusions 
TÜV SÜD has reached. Therefore, nothing in the engagement or this statement provides third 
parties with any rights or claims whatsoever.
