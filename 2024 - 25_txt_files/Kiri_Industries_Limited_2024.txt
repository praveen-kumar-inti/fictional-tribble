Water
Management
Risk
Increased water consumption 
and constrained water supply 
are among the most critical 
global risks. Considering our 
dependency on water for the 
viability of our operations, we 
have identified it as a material 
risk for us.
The Company has successfully 
implemented a total Zero 
Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system 
at its dyes intermediates 
manufacturing facilities. 
Additionally, ZLD has been 
adopted for select processes 
within the dyes manufacturing 
unit, with the objective 
of minimizing fresh water 
consumption and maximizing 
water recycling and reuse.
To further strengthen our 
commitment to sustainable 
water management, we 
have undertaken several key 
initiatives:
•	
Optimized reuse and 
recycling of treated 
wastewater within plant 
operations, significantly 
reducing dependency on 
fresh water sources.
•	
Enhanced process 
efficiency by increasing 
reaction concentrations, 
thereby reducing the 
volume of wastewater 
generated.
These efforts reflect our ongoing 
commitment to environmental 
stewardship. In recognition 
of our proactive approach, 
the Company was honored 
with the “Best Effort for Water 
Conservation” award in 2023.

2.
Community
Development
Opportunity
Community development 
activities help the Company 
to create a positive impact 
on society by undertaking 
meaningful interventions to 
bring significant benefits to 
large sections of society.
The Company is committed 
to creating sustainable 
opportunities for 
underprivileged communities 
through a range of impactful 
initiatives. These include 
enhancing access to quality 
education, promoting 
sustainable livelihood programs, 
fostering a healthier society, and 
supporting the development of 
rural infrastructure.

3.
Health and 
Safety
Risk
In chemical industry, failure 
to ensure Health & Safety can 
directly impact people and 
community and disrupt the 
operations
The Company places the highest 
priority on the safety, health, 
and well-being of its employees 
and all relevant stakeholders. As 
a testament to this commitment, 
the Company’s dyes 
manufacturing unit is certified 
under the ISO 45001:2018 
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) Management System, 
achieving 100% coverage as of 
31st March 2025.
We have implemented a 
comprehensive safety and 
health management system that 
encompasses all manufacturing 
facilities, offices, laboratories, 
and supply chain partners. This 
system ensures the protection 
and well-being of employees, 
visitors, contractors, and 
other stakeholders through 
proactive risk management 
and continuous improvement 
practices.
Negative
4.
Diversity, 
Equity and 
Inclusion (DEI)
Opportunity
To be on top of our innovation 
culture, we need diversity 
of thought, ideas, and 
perspectives. Focus on DEI 
helps to create better trust with 
employees which helps them in 
turn to perform better.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
allows us to be more reflective 
of the society that we live in, 
provide opportunities to include 
people from all walks of life, 
respect our differences, foster 
socio-economic inclusion and 
help marginalized communities.

Risk – Employee development

Opportunities- Structured

engagement programmes 
accelerate the work satisfaction 
of the Company.
Thereby enhancing the 
performance and Company’s

collaboration amongst the 
team members lead to better 
communication, trust, talent 
pipeline, understanding of 
Company’s long term corporate 
goals and priorities and 
improved employee retention.
The Company is committed to 
the continuous development 
of its employees by fostering 
a culture of learning and 
growth. Through on-the-
job learning experiences, 
workshops, seminars, and 
structured training programs, 
we aim to enhance individual 
performance, thereby 
contributing to the overall 
growth and effectiveness of the 
organization.

6.
Responsible 
Supply Chain
Risk
Organizations are under 
increased pressure from 
shareholders, customers, 
and regulators to mitigate 
Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) risk exposures 
within their supply chain. Not 
having sustainable supply 
chain management practices, 
a Company may be exposed 
to more risks including labour 
disruptions, workforce health 
and safety incidents, human 
rights issues, and shortages of 
raw materials.
The Company has established 
an integrated and agile supply 
network designed to effectively 
meet evolving business 
needs. We actively engage 
with suppliers to evaluate 
their performance against 
industry-leading social and 
environmental certification 
standards, ensuring alignment 
with our sustainability goals.
In addition, the Company 
maintains a strong focus 
on the adoption of new-
age technologies to drive 
productivity, efficiency, and 
continuous improvement across 
operations.

escalate the issue to the Head of Department (HoD) or the HR department.

Details of the initiative
Outcome of the initiative
1.
Reduction of fresh 
water consumption 
and waste water 
generation
	
Optimize recycle and reuse of treated industrial waste 
water in the plant operations to reduce overall fresh 
water consumption.
	
Increased reaction concentration in process to reduce 
waste water generation.
	
Segregation of waste water streams according to its 
characteristics to further improve efficiency of effluent 
treatment plant.
We have optimized reuse, 
recycle of treated water which 
in turn saves natural resource 
water.
2.
Energy efficiency 
improvement steps 
taken to reduce 
fuel and electricity 
consumption
	
Increased batch size.
	
Increased total solids in our products before spray 
drying.
	
Some modifications done in ice plants such as increased 
cooling coil, harvesting & freezing time settling done.
	
Increased spray drying capacity through airflow and 
pressure increase, spray nozzle and swirl chamber size 
increase, changed pulse timing etc.
Reduction 
in 
fuel 
and 
electricity leads to reduction 
in greenhouse gas emissions.
3.
Segregation of 
hazardous waste
Segregation of ETP waste done at dyes unit. Segregated 
Gypsum and iron sludge units sent to cement industries for 
co-processing instead of land filling at authorised landfill sites.
Reduces the non-renewable 
resource lime stone powder 
and land required for land 
filling.
