Climate 
Change
Opportunity
Climate change opens avenues for 
financial inclusion through green 
financing and sustainability-focused 
products. 
As 
rural 
and 
semi-
urban India seeks climate-resilient 
solutions, Paisalo Digital can lead by 
funding eco-friendly initiatives and 
micro-entrepreneurship.
-
Positive 
- 
Pursuing 
sustainable 
finance 
solutions, 
particularly 
for 
Electric 
Vehicles, 
presents 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
Paisalo 
to strengthen its market 
position and brand as a 
leader in environmentally 
responsible 
finance. 
These 
efforts 
are 
anticipated 
to 
expand 
the customer base by 
attracting eco-conscious 
customers and enhancing 
revenue 
streams. 
This 
also enhances Paisalo’s 
reputation as a proactive 
contributor 
to 
India’s 
environmental objectives, 
thereby ensuring long-term 
business sustainability and 
stakeholder value creation.
Risk
Climate change poses operational 
risks for Paisalo through increased 
vulnerability of its borrower base, 
especially in rural and semi-urban 
areas reliant on informal sectors. 
Extreme weather events may impact 
loan repayment capacity and asset 
quality. Additionally, regulatory shifts 
toward climate-aligned lending may 
require business model adjustments 
and proactive ESG integration. In 
line with this evolving landscape, 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has 
issued draft guidelines mandating 
climate-related 
disclosures 
for 
NBFCs, signaling increased scrutiny 
and the need for enhanced climate 
risk preparedness.
Paisalo 
is 
strengthening 
its climate resilience by 
initiating 
a 
climate 
risk 
assessment 
aligned 
with 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD). This strategic move 
enables 
the 
Company 
to identify, evaluate, and 
integrate material climate-
related risks into its broader 
risk 
management 
and 
lending frameworks.
Negative 
- 
As 
climate 
change 
impacts 
the 
financial 
stability 
of 
borrowers, it can lead to 
increased credit defaults, 
reduced cash flows, and 
heightened 
provisioning 
requirements, 
thereby 
exerting financial pressure 
on 
the 
Company's 
profitability 
and 
asset 
quality.
2
Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Financial 
inclusion 
is 
deeply 
ingrained in Paisalo's DNA, shaping 
its mission to bridge credit gaps and 
foster economic empowerment. By 
serving the underserved, Paisalo 
unlocks vast potential in rural 
and semi-urban markets through 
accessible 
credit 
and 
digital 
financial solutions The Company 
empowers 
micro-entrepreneurs, 
fuels grassroots economic growth, 
and aligns seamlessly with national 
development goals and evolving 
regulatory 
priorities-enhancing 
both strategic relevance and long-
term viability.
-
Positive 
- 
Expanding 
access 
to 
credit 
in 
underserved areas creates 
a 
scalable 
customer 
base, driving consistent 
revenue 
growth. 
Digital 
financial inclusion reduces 
operational costs through 
tech-driven 
efficiencies 
and 
lowers 
customer 
acquisition expenses.

Innovation & 
Digitization
Opportunity
Innovation and technology 
are 
central 
to 
Paisalo’s 
strategy, 
fueling 
differentiation and enabling 
the Company to stand out in 
the competitive landscape. 
By developing cutting-edge 
financial solutions tailored 
to 
emerging 
customer 
needs, Paisalo can enhance 
customer satisfaction and 
loyalty, 
driving 
revenue 
growth. 
Leveraging 
technology 
allows 
the 
Company 
to 
offer 
more 
efficient 
and 
accessible 
financial services, reaching 
underserved markets and 
expanding 
its 
customer 
base. 
This 
dual 
focus 
not 
only 
attracts 
newer 
demographics 
but 
also 
reinforces Paisalo's position 
as a forward-thinking and 
agile player in the financial 
services sector.
Positive 
- 
By 
offering 
cutting-edge 
financial 
solutions, the Company 
enhances 
customer 
satisfaction 
and 
drives 
revenue 
growth. 
Leveraging 
technology 
facilitates 
efficient, 
accessible 
services, 
expanding 
reach 
to 
underserved 
markets. 
Digital 
onboarding 
accelerates processes and 
reduces acquisition costs, 
boosting 
operational 
efficiency. This approach 
reinforces 
Paisalo's 
position as a forward-
thinking leader in financial 
services.

Local 
Employment 
Generation
Opportunity
Paisalo prioritizes financial inclusion 
by 
providing 
accessible 
credit 
and digital finance solutions to 
underserved rural and semi-urban 
markets. 
The 
Company 
serves 
unbanked 
and 
underbanked 
communities through strategic co-
lending partnerships with leading 
banks and an expansive Business 
Correspondents (BC) network. This 
model facilitates access to credit in 
remote areas, unlocking economic 
potential for micro-entrepreneurs 
and small businesses. By generating 
employment closer to where people 
live-especially in rural and semi-
urban 
regions-Paisalo 
promotes 
balanced 
regional 
development 
and builds long-term community 
resilience.
-
Positive - Facilitating local 
job creation strengthens 
borrower income stability, 
enhancing 
repayment 
capacity and loan book 
quality. Hiring locally can 
reduce recruitment and 
relocation expenses, as 
well as minimize training 
costs due to the familiarity 
of local employees with 
the cultural and economic 
landscape. 
This 
cost 
efficiency 
can 
improve 
the Company's margins. 
Supporting 
grassroots 
livelihoods 
reinforces 
community trust, driving 
higher customer retention 
and repeat business.
5
Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
As a financial services provider, 
Paisalo handles sensitive customer 
data, making it a potential target 
for cyber threats and breaches. 
Inadequate safeguards or lapses 
in data handling could lead to 
reputational 
damage, 
regulatory 
penalties, and customer attrition. 
Rapid digitization without robust 
security 
frameworks 
heightens 
exposure to phishing, fraud, and 
system vulnerabilities.
To mitigate data security 
and 
privacy 
risks, 
the 
Company 
has 
instituted 
robust safeguards, including 
strict 
access 
controls, 
data 
encryption, 
and 
regular security audits. In 
addition, it has established a 
comprehensive Information 
Security and Data Privacy 
Policy and conducts periodic 
training to ensure employees 
follow best practices in data 
handling.
Negative – Data breaches 
or cyber incidents may 
lead to financial losses due 
to regulatory fines, legal 
expenses, and customer 
attrition

Annexure C: Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
6
Business 
Ethics
Risk
As a financial services provider 
catering to vulnerable segments, 
any deviation from ethical conduct 
could 
erode 
stakeholder 
trust 
and 
credibility. 
Lapses 
in 
fair 
lending 
practices, 
transparency, 
or customer treatment may invite 
regulatory scrutiny and reputational 
damage.
The 
Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
formal 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and 
Ethics to guide employee 
behavior, 
decision-
making, 
and 
stakeholder 
interactions. This framework 
is 
supported 
by 
regular 
training programs, internal 
audits, and whistleblower 
mechanisms, 
which 
promote accountability and 
transparency throughout the 
organization.
Negative - Ethical lapses 
can result in regulatory 
action, 
reputational 
damage, 
and 
financial 
penalties. 
Moreover, 
erosion 
of 
stakeholder 
trust can impact business 
continuity 
and 
investor 
confidence.
7
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
The 
financial 
services 
sector 
operates under a complex and 
evolving regulatory environment. 
Adherence 
to 
applicable 
laws, 
guidelines, 
and 
supervisory 
frameworks is critical to maintain 
business continuity, ensure market 
integrity, and protect customer 
interests
The Company has instituted 
a strong compliance culture 
supported by clearly defined 
policies, standard operating 
procedures, 
and 
internal 
control 
mechanisms. 
Regular compliance audits, 
regulatory 
reporting, 
and 
monitoring systems are in 
place to ensure adherence 
to all applicable legal and 
regulatory standards. The 
organization also undertakes 
periodic reviews to remain 
updated with new regulatory 
developments and provides 
training to relevant staff 
to 
reinforce 
compliance 
awareness.
Negative -  Regulatory 
breaches 
may 
lead 
to 
financial penalties, legal 
costs, increased scrutiny, 
and reputational harm.

7.    Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlight ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
I’m pleased to present Paisalo’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for FY2025, a reflection of our commitment to 
responsible growth and inclusive finance. At Paisalo, our mission has always been clear: to empower underserved segments across India 
through low-ticket income generation loans. With technology as our ally and the grassroots as our guide, we’ve continued to scale with 
purpose, empathy, and impact.
This year marked a pivotal chapter as we deepened our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) integration. We introduced our 
Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) Manual, which now anchors our operational ethos in responsible lending practices. 
Further strengthening our ESG governance, we established an Impact Framework based on a Theory of Change, enabling us to clearly 
define our social intent, link it to measurable outcomes, and monitor progress toward last-mile empowerment. This approach reinforces 
accountability, transparency, and data-driven decision-making at the leadership level.
To advance our environmental responsibility, we have begun systematic monitoring of Scope 3 emissions for understanding and managing 
our indirect environmental impact while we continue to measure and monitor energy & water consumption and waste generation.
Furthering our social commitments, we allocated ₹32.08 million towards CSR efforts covering areas such as food distribution, medical aid, 
and access to free education-reaffirming our belief in equitable development.
Looking ahead, we are expanding our ESG focus by integrating climate-related disclosures, conducting customer and employee satisfaction 
surveys, and undertaking materiality assessments to understand and prioritize what truly matters to our stakeholders. These steps mark 
our journey toward becoming an even more responsive, responsible, and resilient organization.
Paisalo remains committed to doing business responsibly-anchored in ethics, sustainability, and community impact-as we build a future 
that serves both people and progress.
 We look forward to continuing this journey together-creating meaningful change, one step at a time.
 Sincerely,
 Sunil Agarwal
