Dear 
Shareholders,
Welcome to the first full fiscal year annual report  
of Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL) 
following its listing on March 28th, 2022, at the 
BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India 
Limited (NSE). It has been a remarkable year for us, 
with MSWIL delivering strong results in FY 2022-23. 
Despite the market environment becoming more 
favourable for business, semiconductor shortages 
and supply chain disruptions continue to exist both 
in India and globally. However, through a strong 
focus on product innovation and customer 
satisfaction, we have grown our revenues, expanded 
our footprint, and diversified our customer base.
Financial highlights
The revenues of your company grew to INR 7,057 crores, 
which is 25% higher than FY 2021-22. Operating EBITDA 
ended at INR 798 crores and PAT reached INR 487 crores. 
The company achieved a ROCE of 44%, exceeding our 
targets. The dividend payout for FY 2022-23 has been 
declared at 59% of profits after taxes, in line with         
Motherson Vision 2025 targets, coming to INR 0.65 per 
share. Our operating cash flows are healthy and as of 
March 31st, 2023, we continue to be a debt-free company.
We are very grateful for these results and thank our 
customers across India for their unwavering trust in us. 
Likewise, we acknowledge the fantastic efforts of our 
teams in all our units and facilities, who work tirelessly 
to serve the OEMs. This performance strengthens our 
position to contribute to Vision 2025 for Motherson.

inputs to our company. We will 
continue to harness the strengths 
of both SWS and SAMIL to better 
serve our customers and grow  
with them. We believe our heritage

annual report  2022-2023
We closely monitor various industry 
developments, including the 
growing adoption of alternative 
drivetrains and changing customer 
preferences. 
As the demand for electrification 
increases, there is a higher 
requirement for specialised wiring 
harnesses that can handle 
high-voltage applications, including 
charging infrastructure and battery 
systems. Drawing on our decades 
of industry experience and our ability 
to quickly adapt to market needs, 
we are able to provide integrated 
high-voltage wiring harness 
solutions to both hybrid and fully 
electric vehicles (EVs). Over the 
past year, we have expanded our 
manufacturing capabilities and 
invested in state-of-the-art 
facilities to meet growing customer 
demands in this area. For instance, 
we have set up a dedicated line for 
manu­facturing EV and high-voltage 
wiring harnesses in Chennai to 
cater to a diverse set of customers 
in this region. 
Another key trend in the Indian 
market is the increasing premium­
isation in cars. Premium vehicles 
often have advanced features 
and technologies requiring more 
complex and sophisticated wiring 
harness systems. These vehicles 
may have advanced infotainment 
systems, luxury amenities, advanced 
safety features, and autonomous

driving capabilities. As a result, the wiring harnesses 
needed for such vehicles are more intricate and 
technologically advanced, giving us the opportunity 
to increase both content and value per OEM. Having 
access to advanced manufacturing and technological 
capabilities, MSWIL is in a great position to serve 
customers’ growing demands. 
Strong growth in India
The Indian automotive market is growing fast. It recorded 
the highest passenger vehicle sales in 2022, with close 
to 3.8 million units sold. This development paves the 
way for numerous growth opportunities for MSWIL as 
a leading, full-system wiring harness solutions provider 
in India.
Over the past fiscal year, MSWIL has strengthened its 
position as a major solutions provider in the Indian wiring 
harness segment. We added three new facilities, one 
in Chennai and two in Noida, to address the growing 
demand of our customers as well as to support our 
future growth plans. We now have 26 facilities across 
India strategically located near our customer locations, 
providing us with a distinct advantage. I am very proud 
of the teams who have worked so hard to build these

new plants and get ready in a very 
short time, to meet the needs of 
our customers. 
In FY 2022-23, we were part of 23 
new launches and 17 facelift models. 
Much of our growth is coming from 
the new launches, which shows 
that customers trust us to support 
their new programmes. We are very 
grateful for this. Additionally, we are 
supplying to 10 out of 12 top-selling 
passenger vehicle models in India, 
including several premium vehicles. 
In the EV space, we are supplying 
to 2 out of the top 3 EV models in 
the passenger car segment and 
2 out of the top 5 EV models in the 
two-wheeler segment, showing that 
we are fully prepared to serve the 
growing demand for electrification. 
Our consistent focus on innovation, 
efficiency, quality, and sustainability 
brings us closer to our goal of being 
a preferred, sustainable solutions 
provider in the Indian wiring 
harness segment. 
Gratitude
I want to extend my deepest 
gratitude to our customers for 
their unwavering trust in us and the 
opportunity they give us to serve 
them. I also thank our partners for 
their dedication and commitment 
to consistently delivering the best 
solutions to our customers. 
To our employees and teams, your 
hard work and resilience ensure 
that Motherson continues to delight 
its customers regardless of what’s 
happening in the market. And finally, 
we want to thank the central, state, 
and local government bodies, banks, 
and financial institutions for their 
collaboration. 
May God bless us and allow us 
to continue to create value for all 
the stakeholders we work with;
our customers, our investors, our 
people, and the communities in 
which we operate. 
On behalf of MSWIL, thank you all.

chapter 3 Q&A with Laksh Vaaman Sehgal
An interview with 
Laksh Vaaman Sehgal.
To get a deeper insight into the first full year of MSWIL’s operations as a separate 
listed company, we had a conversation with Laksh Vaaman Sehgal, Director of 
MSWIL, about how the journey has been and what is around the corner.
Q1 
This was the first full year 
in the existence of MSWIL. 
How has it been?
It was an eventful year. MSWIL has 
done really well. The company has 
posted its highest-ever quarterly 
revenues and crossed INR 7,000 
crores in yearly revenues. We are 
all proud to be part of the 23 new 
launches and 17 facelifts in India 
during FY23 across PV, CV and 2W 
segments. It’s remarkable what 
our colleagues have done.
Q2
The current economic 
environment has caused 
rising prices of raw materials, 
especially copper. What steps 
is MSWIL taking to address 
this?
We have a pass-through arrange­ment 
with the customers to address the 
impact of rising raw material prices, 
including copper. Although the 
specifics of this arrangement may 
vary for different customers, the 
overall objective is to neutralise 
the impact of price fluctuations. 
We do not hold much stock of 
copper. We procure the wires from 
our parent company, SAMIL, usually 
for the next two to three days. So, 
the inventories of wires are limited. 
This practice helps us manage our 
stock levels efficiently. We rely on 
pass-through arrangements and 
effective inventory management to 
address the price fluctuations and 
we do not engage in hedging.
Q3. 
How do you see the Indian 
automotive industry growing 
in the future? 
The country as a whole is growing 
fast, both economically and in 
terms of automotive market size. 
In fact, India is now the third-largest 
automotive market in the world. 
With the world’s second most 
extensive road network already in 
place, the new expressway and 
road infrastructure are coming up 
at an astonishing speed. 
This is leading to increased demand 
for the transport industry. At the 
same time, car penetration in the 
country is still relatively low if you 
compare it with some of the other developed countries. 
So, the potential for the Indian automotive industry is 
fantastic, and we are ready to be part of it.
Furthermore, the Indian government has implemented 
various initiatives and policies to encourage the 
development and adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). 
This aligns with the global trend of transitioning 
towards sustainable mobility. The EV segment in India 
has witnessed significant growth in recent years, and 
with supportive policies, it is expected to thrive further 
in the future.
India is also becoming a global manufacturing hub for 
automobiles. Many international automotive companies 
have set up production facilities in the country to 
cater to the domestic market as well as for exports. 
This boosts growth in the Indian automotive industry.
Q4
What are some key business strengths of 
MSWIL?
MSWIL has several key business strengths contributing 
to its success and competitive advantage. The company 
benefits from strong parentage, with Sumitomo and 
SAMIL providing a solid foundation and a history of 
over 30 years of success through Motherson Sumi 
Systems Limited (MSSL), now known as SAMIL.
Our partnership with Sumitomo and SAMIL gives MSWIL 
early access to new technologies and enables it to 
annual report  2022-2023

chapter 3 Q&A with Laksh Vaaman Sehgal
leverage synergies within the group. Another strength 
is our ability to localise the production of certain 
components, such as cables and connectors, 
showcasing our expertise in vertical integration. Also, 
we have to understand that the wiring harness business 
is a people’s job. This means we build our capacity not 
just by creating a plant but also by training our teams. 
We are very good at that, and our training programmes 
allow our associates to quickly learn and gain experience 
so that they can contribute and help serve our customers 
better and faster.
Q5
How will the shift towards electric, hybrid 
and alternative engine technologies impact 
revenues for MSWIL? 
We are already supplying to leading electric passenger 
vehicles and two-wheeler OEMs in India. We engineer 
and develop these solutions for our customers and 
they are awarding us with new orders, so our revenues 
from EVs are growing. As the industry shifts towards 
electric, hybrid, and alternative engine technologies, 
we anticipate a positive impact on our revenues. So, we 
are setting up the lines for that and training the teams, 
to ensure a successful launch for the OEMs. 
Our primary focus is on excelling in 
what we do best – providing wiring 
harness solutions to our customers 
across segments. The revenues 
then naturally follow. Keep in mind, 
we are an engine-agnostic company.
Q6 
How does the content in the 
wiring harness change in ICE 
vs EVs, and what implications 
do the increasing EV sales in 
India have for the R&D 
investments of MSWIL?
Generally, the wiring harness in 
electric cars is more complex 
than in conventional vehicles. This 
creates opportunities for us, for 
example, to create specific wiring 
harness components tailored 
for electric vehicles. On the high-
voltage side, which is related to 
charging and motor operations, 
which is specific to EVs, MSWIL can 
provide unique solutions to meet 
the demands of these systems. As 
the demand for advanced features 
and functionalities increases, 
MSWIL can provide wiring harness 
solutions that support these 
enhanced capabilities. This opens 
avenues for innovation and growth 
in our product offerings.
On the low-voltage side, we see 
that the OEMs are adding more 
features to their cars. This creates 
opportunities for us as well. So, 
there is potential for us both on 
the high-voltage and the low-
voltage side. 
What is also interesting is that some 
carmakers are working to improve 
the efficiency and speed of the 
assembly process of electric 
vehicles. As a supplier, MSWIL can 
support these efforts, for example, 
by designing components differently 
to facilitate the assembly process. 
All these elements can have a 
positive impact on the wiring 
harness content.
By leveraging our expertise in wiring 
harness design and production, 
MSWIL is well-positioned to adapt 
to the evolving needs of the 
EV market. We are excited about 
the potential for increased 
wiring harness content in both 
high-voltage and low-voltage 
applications, which can have a 
positive impact on our business. 
When it comes to R&D, we are 
constantly working on new solutions 
that our customers find valuable. 
Lightweighting is an important 
topic; we are working on smart 
junction boxes and always look 
for alternative materials together 
with our customers. These are 
some of the areas we focus on 
in the R&D space.
Q7
How well-positioned is 
MSWIL to supply to the new 
customers and vehicle models 
that are being launched in 
the Indian market?
I think we are strategically 
positioned to cater to the demands 
of new customers and vehicle 
models. Our teams have worked 
hard on our significant expansion in 
Chennai and Bengaluru, where we 
will make wiring harness solutions 
for passenger cars, two-wheelers, 
commercial vehicles and buses. 
Our decision to expand in these 
locations is a direct response to the 
stable demand from the OEMs and 
we have seen a smooth ramp-up. 
We expect to have optimum

utilisation early next year, so we 
are optimistic and we will see 
the impact of that quite soon.
We remain committed to serving 
our customers’ needs and 
contributing to their success.
Q8 
How will MSWIL sustain its 
leadership position in the 
Indian automotive wiring 
harness market?
At MSWIL, our approach is 
centred on focussing on ourselves, 
capitalising on our strengths, and 
continuously striving for improve­
ment. We have recently expanded 
our operations by adding three 
new facilities to meet the increasing 
demands of our customers, who 
are launching new models and 
updates to existing ones. As a 
result, our volumes are growing, 
reflecting the potential in the 
Indian automotive market.
I think what we do is focus on 
ourselves and our strengths. We 
have added three new facilities to 
meet the demand of our customers as they continue 
to launch new models and updates to existing models. 
Of course, this is in response to the potential in the 
Indian automotive market. There is room for everyone 
to grow. We embrace our mantra of “BYBY,” which 
stands for “By yourself. Better yourself.” This approach 
entails a relentless focus on surpassing our own 
performance and achieving continuous improvement 
across all parameters that matter to our customers. 
We believe that by consistently striving to do better 
tomorrow than we did today, we can ensure our 
sustained growth in the future.
We remain focussed on enhancing our products, 
processes and services. We aim to exceed customer 
expectations and solidify our position as a preferred 
sustainable solutions provider to our customers.
Q9 
Given the pressure on your operating margins, 
what steps are being taken to address it? 
At MSWIL, we recognise the challenges posed by rising 
costs of materials which have impacted our operating 
margins. To address this, we engage in continuous 
discussions with our customers to identify opportunities 
for mitigating cost escalations. By collaborating closely 
with our customers, we aim to find mutually beneficial 
solutions that help alleviate some of the cost pressures.

chapter 3 Q&A with Laksh Vaaman Sehgal
We constantly strive to enhance our internal efficiency 
and optimise our operations. This includes identifying 
areas for improvement within our processes, streamlining 
workflows, and implementing cost-saving measures. 
By driving internal efficiencies, we aim to enhance 
our overall profitability and address the pressure on 
operating margins.
However, we do not look at operating margins but the 
return on capital employed (ROCE). We believe that is a 
much more robust and holistic indicator emphasising 
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our capital 
utilisation. That is why we have been guiding our 
investors on ROCE rather than margins, for many years. 
Q10 
Is MSWIL open to diversifying to other wiring 
harness applications such as railways, electric 
two-wheelers, white goods, and perhaps even 
moving beyond wiring harness? 
MSWIL was created to meet the strategic requirements 
of our long-standing partner Sumitomo Wiring Systems, 
Ltd., with a primary focus on the automotive wiring 
harness sector in India. This is our main goal for MSWIL 
at present. However, we remain open to expanding 
beyond this scope in the future, should our customers 
express such a need. Naturally, this would be done in 
collaboration with Sumitomo Wiring Systems.
Q11 
Given that wiring harness is a manpower-
intensive process, what steps are being taken 
to automate and optimise manufacturing? 
It is true that wiring harness manufacturing is a people-
intensive process, however, we are actively implementing 
measures to automate and optimise our manufacturing 
processes. While complete automation may not be 
feasible due to the intricate nature of the work, we 
are leveraging technology to streamline and enhance 
various aspects of our operations. For example, we are 
using digital boards for the wiring harness assembly. 
This facilitates the training process and makes the 
transitions from one model to the next much simpler. 
We are using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), 
Collaborative Robots (Cobots), and Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA) to make our manufacturing more 
efficient. Other than that, we are also increasingly 
using technology for certain quality 
checks. The work remains human-
intensive. This approach allows our 
workforce to contribute additional 
value in areas where human 
expertise is most beneficial.
We have made 
progress in all three 
sustainability areas – 
Planet, 
People and 
Governance.

chapter 3 Q&A with Laksh Vaaman Sehgal
Q12
Given your current order 
book and the OEMs launching 
more and more models, what 
CAPEX investments are you 
expecting for the coming 
times?
We are committed to meeting 
the growing demand from our 
customers and ensuring that we 
have sufficient capacity to support 
their requirements. Adhering to 
a golden rule, we commence 
expansion plans as soon as we 
reach 80% utilisation of our current 
capabilities. The largest part of our 
capital expenditures is going into 
land and buildings. Our CAPEX 
investments are aligned with our 
long-term strategy and growth 
projections. We proactively plan and 
invest in expanding our facilities well 
in advance to accommodate the 
anticipated volume requirements. 
For instance, when preparing 
for the launch of models in the 
'2024-25' timeframe, we initiate 
the CAPEX planning process in 
'2022-23' or '2023-24'. This 
approach allows us to be 
adequately prepared and ensure 
seamless operations.
On the people side, it is a continuous 
process of attracting new people 
and training them and making them 
part of the Motherson DNA and way 
of working.
And since we are continuously 
winning orders, this is an ongoing 
process. So usually, we start looking 
at new capacity enhancement 
almost a year, year and a half before 
the predicted date of supply. So, it’s 
a very difficult question to answer. 
But I think for the orders in hand; 
we have the capacity. And as we 
win more orders, and I’m sure with 
your good wishes we are going to 
win even more orders, then we will 
definitely add more plants. 
Q13 
How do you feel about the 
progress you have made in 
embedding sustainability into 
all aspects of your operations?
Sustainability is vital to us and 
MSWIL is aligned with the overall 
Motherson sustainability targets 
we formulated for SAMIL. 
We have made further progress 
in all the aspects of our main 
focal areas of Planet, People, and 
Governance. On the Planet side, 
all MSWIL facilities are ISO 14001 
certified, which shows our commit­
ment towards global environment 
management standards. Our 
products are compliant to clean 
regulations like RoHS (Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances), and 
REACH (Regi­stration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of 
Chemicals), etc. The company is 
optimising water consumption 
through conservation, sewage

chapter 8 industry trends
Let’s look at these key trends and 
understand how MSWIL prepares 
for the future.
Growing demand for SUVs
One of the key developments in 
India is the growing demand for 
SUVs. Customers are increasingly 
attracted to vehicles that offer 
versatility, comfort, and style, 
leading to growing interest in 
SUVs across all segments, ranging 
from compact to full-sized luxury 
variants. According to reports, the 
sales of these vehicles accounted 
for over 40% of India’s overall 
passenger vehicle market in 2022.
Given the size and feature 
complexity, SUVs typically require 
more wiring harnesses than smaller 
vehicles. This is due to the extra 
wiring needed to support the 
advanced infotainment systems, 
navigation systems, and safety 
features in these vehicles. As India’s 
leading supplier of wiring harness 
solutions, MSWIL is well-positioned 
to capitalise on this trend, which 
is projected to continue in the 
coming years. We are continuously 
investing in our capabilities and 
capacities to meet the growing 
demands of the market. 
More connectivity
The Indian automotive market is 
experiencing a significant shift 
with the increasing demand for 
connected cars. Consumers now 
seek vehicles that offer seamless 
integration with their smartphones 
and other devices, fostering interest in advanced 
features like remote start and stop, geo-fencing, 
and over-the-air updates. 
As connected vehicles require more complex wiring 
harnesses and advanced electrical components to 
transmit and manage large amounts of data, the 
demand for advanced electrical distribution systems 
also increases. Leveraging our extensive experience 
and access to advanced manufacturing capabilities, 
we offer both wiring harnesses and components to 
Aligned with the

support vehicle connectivity to support OEMs in this 
transformative trend. Our team of experts constantly 
collaborates with automakers to develop innovative 
technologies and systems that enable seamless 
connectivity between vehicles and smart devices. 
Rising demand for electrification
The ongoing shift toward vehicle electrification 
continues to shape the auto industry. With the Indian 
government promoting electric vehicles (EVs) 
and increasing consumer awareness regarding the 
environmental impact of fossil fuels, there has been 
a surge in demand for EVs across all segments. The 
Economic Survey 2023 predicts that India’s domestic 
electric vehicle market will see a 49% compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2022 and 2030, 
with an expected annual sales volume of 10 million 
units by 2030.
The development of the electric drivetrain necessitates 
the need for advanced technology, particularly in 
handling the high-voltage power required by EVs. 
Drawing on our decades of industry experience and 
in-house manufacturing capabilities, we can offer 
our customers a wide range of solutions in this area. 
For instance, we have set up a dedicated line for 
manufacturing EV and high-voltage wiring harnesses 
in Chennai to cater to a diverse set of customers in 
this region. 
 
Hybrid vehicles
The year 2022 saw the highest-ever sales of hybrid 
vehicles, with over 19,000 units sold, presenting 
potential growth opportunities for MSWIL in the future. 
Hybrid vehicles require complex wiring systems to 
ensure the smooth integration and operation of the 
internal combustion (IC) engine and electric motor. 
As such, these vehicles require more intricate and 
extensive wiring harnesses than traditional vehicles. 
As the demand for hybrid vehicles grows, so does 
the need for high-quality, innovative wiring solutions. 
MSWIL, through its strong parentage and advanced 
technological capabilities, is in a solid position to meet 
these specific requirements.
Prepared for alternative fuels
The Indian government’s endorsement of biofuels like 
CNG and Ethanol to support lower vehicle emissions, 
combined with cost savings for 
consumers, has spurred rapid 
growth in the alternative fuels 
market. In response to this push, 
automakers in India are introducing 
a wide range of CNG vehicles, 
including passenger cars, 
commercial vehicles, and three-
wheelers. According to a report, 
CNG is expected to become 
India’s second most popular fuel 
for passenger vehicles by 2027. 
Automakers are also introducing 
flex-fuel vehicles capable of 
running on both gas­oline and 
Ethanol, which can help reduce 
emissions and improve fuel 
efficiency.
This adoption of alternative fuels 
presents numerous opportunities 
for MSWIL. As a powertrain-
agnostic supplier, we are well-
positioned to serve our OEMs 
as they introduce new models 
in response to this trend.

Sustainability.
Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL) 
places great importance on sustainability and strives 
to be a responsible corporate citizen. While our 
sustainability objectives are tailored to address the 
needs of India, they are also aligned with the key 
focus areas of the Motherson group — Planet, 
People, and Governance. 
Over the last year, we have progressed in all three areas 
mentioned above: we became more aligned with the 
global environmental conservation, formalised our 
policies toward diversity and inclusion, and strengthened 
our governance framework. Let us look at these 
developments in more detail. 
Planet 
MSWIL has undertaken several initiatives to reduce our 
environmental impact, including lowering our emissions, 
reducing our energy consumption, using more 
renewable energy, implementing water-conservation 
practices, and managing our use of materials in an 
environmentally friendly manner. Additionally, we are 
creating sustainability roadmaps for each unit to ensure 
that our principles are consistently implemented at 
every level.
All MSWIL manufacturing facilities are ISO 14001-
­certified, showing our commitment to meeting 
global environmental-management standards. 
Use of renewable energy
As part of our effort to incorporate more renewable 
energy into our operations, eight units already use solar 
power, and seven more units will be equipped with 
solar panels in the next few months. Additionally, three 
of our Chennai plants use wind power as a primary 
energy source. We are also exploring additional options 
for augmenting our renewable-energy capabilities, 
including the potential installation of rooftop windmills.
Water conservation and management
We are currently optimising water consumption through 
conservation, the treatment and reuse of wastewater, 
and rainwater harvesting. All MSWIL units have been 
ISO 14001

equipped with sewage treatment plants (STPs) to handle 
wastewater effectively. 
Our organisation has made significant strides in water 
conservation and management, aligning itself with 
sustainable practices. We are actively reducing water 
consumption and minimising our environmental impact 
by implementing various initiatives, such as push button 
taps and float switches/float valves. We emphasise that 
water is not utilised in our production process, reflecting 
our dedication to responsibly managing resources. This 
helps us to reduce the environmental footprint associated 
with water usage, furthering our commitment to 
sustainability.
We have incorporated STP (Sewage Treatment Plants) 
within our premises, recognising the importance of 
utilising natural resources. These systems allow us 
to collect water, which can be used for non-potable 
purposes such as landscaping, irrigation, and toilet 
flushing. We have also implemented rainwater 
harvesting facilities in our plants. The upcoming 
stormwater collection project at our Kattavakkam 
plant indicates a continued focus on improving water 
management practices. Collecting and utilising 
stormwater can help mitigate flooding and reduce the 
strain on existing water sources during heavy rainfall 
events. By harnessing rainwater, we reduce our 
dependence on freshwater sources, promoting 
sustainable water management and conservation.
Reducing energy consumption
As part of our commitment to 
sustainability, we have implemented 
various measures to conserve and 
manage energy effectively.
We have established a 
comprehen­sive energy committee 
at our sites to monitor and optimise 
our energy usage. Regular data 
analysis helps us identify areas for 
improvement and implement 
energy-saving measures across 
our organisation. 
We have significantly reduced 
energy consumption by adopting 
innovative technologies such as 
cyclic timers, motion sensors, and 
electrically motorised valves. The 
conversion from T5 lighting to LED 
across our facilities was a major 
step towards energy conservation. 
This move reduces our energy use 
and decreases our carbon footprint, 
making our operations more 
environmentally friendly. 
Materials management
We continue to explore innovative 
approaches in materials 
manage­ment, striving to optimise 
our use of materials and reduce 
waste. We put great emphasis on 
using recycled and recyclable 
materials wherever possible, aiming 
to create a circular economy. 
Furthermore, we are sourcing 
materials responsibly, prioritising 
suppliers that comply with 
environmental regulations 
and employ sustainable practices.
Waste reduction to landfill
In the pursuit of sustainable practices 
and environmental responsibility, 
this year, we made significant 
strides by implementing PadCare, 
a ground-breaking initiative aimed 
at recycling used sanitary pads 
and diverting waste from landfills. 
By implementing this program, 
we have taken a significant step 
towards reducing our ecological 
footprint and reducing waste 
going into landfills.
 
Looking ahead, we are committed 
to expanding PadCare and further 
enhancing our circularity efforts. We 
will continue to invest in research 
and development, exploring 
innovative recycling technologies 
and partnerships. Our aim is to 
create a more comprehensive 
and efficient system that can be 
replicated in other organisations, 
maximising the positive impact on 
the environment.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSIONS AND ANALYSIS
BUSINESS BACKGROUND AND UPDATE
Motherson Sumi Wiring India Limited (MSWIL or the 
Company) was incorporated on July 02, 2020. FY 2022- 
23 is the first complete year of operation for MSWIL 
after scheme of Demerger  of Domestic Wiring Harness 
business by Samvardhana Motherson International 
Limited (then known as Motherson Sumi Systems Limited) 
to MSWIL  was given effect. MSWIL was listed on BSE and 
National Stock Exchange on March 28, 2022. As on March 
31, 2023, the Company had 685,401 shareholders (March 
31, 2022: 678,238 shareholders).
MSWIL is focused on the wiring harness business in the 
Indian market, offering a wide variety of harnesses for 
different vehicles including passenger and commercial 
vehicles, two and three-wheelers, farm equipment and 
off-road vehicles. The Company portfolio consists of 
products manufactured using state-of-the-art technology 
and forward-thinking approaches. We have the capability 
to accompany our customers throughout their entire 
product journey. We support our customers right from 
design to finished products. Our services encompass 
3D computer-aided design (CAD), printed circuit board 
(PCB) design and routing, 3D printing, prototyping, virtual 
and physical validation and technology implementation 
support. This enables us to delight our customers every 
step of the way.
MSWIL has a strong parentage provided by both 
Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd. (SWS) and Samvardhana 
Motherson International Limited (SAMIL). Samvardhana 
Motherson International Ltd. (SAMIL) holds 33.4% and 
Sumitomo Wiring Systems (SWS), Ltd., Japan holds 25.3% 
of shares of MSWIL.
As one of the fastest-growing global automotive suppliers, 
Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SAMIL) 
offers a wide range of solutions for OEMs globally. This 
gives MSWIL access to global solutions from any of 
SAMIL’s units and subsidiaries relevant to MSWIL’s Indian 
wiring harness customers. In addition, through SAMIL, 
MSWIL benefits from a seasoned and strong professional 
management team with years of entrepreneurial 
experience, operational expertise and deep industry 
knowledge.
Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Ltd. (SWS), a 100% subsidiary 
of Sumitomo Electric Industries Japan, is a world leader 
in producing wiring harnesses, harness components and 
other electric wires. MSWIL benefits from the vast wiring 
harness expertise of SWS, especially in the area of R&D 
capabilities and technical knowledge. 
The collective backing of SAMIL and SWS establishes a 
robust framework for MSWIL’s sustained growth within 
the Indian wiring harness segment. MSWIL excels in 
meeting 
customer 
requirements, 
accommodating 
industry dynamics, and maintaining a competitive 
advantage by leveraging the expertise, resources, and 
collaborative endeavours of these parent companies. 
With their unwavering support, MSWIL is strategically 
positioned to forge ahead, capitalising on opportunities 
and upholding its prominence in the Indian automotive 
sector.
Our proximity to our customers also aligns us with 
sustainability goals. OEMs are seeking further localization 
as an environment friendly & more secure option 
compared to imports which strengthens supply chain 
synergies, cut costs & reduce lead times for components. 
The automotive sector was moving towards a global 
supply chain model, but the Covid-19 pandemic has 
resulted in OEMs looking to mitigate supply chain risks & 
move towards a more localized ‘production ecosystem’ 
as a part of contingency planning.
MSWIL is in a favourable position to capitalise on the 
rapidly evolving trends in the automotive market. The 
increasing demand for customisation leads to more 
wiring harnesses per vehicle, increasing content per 
vehicle. More connectivity features in a vehicle lead to 
the demand for high-value SMART harness components. 
As the demand for sustainable technologies and 
advanced safety and emission norms rises, the value 
per harness escalates, and so do the electronics and EV 
solutions offered by the company. For electric vehicles/
alternative powertrains, the company is fully equipped 
to provide high-voltage solutions, wiring harnesses and 
components. 
Through continuous advancement, MSWIL has cemented 
its reputation as a trusted provider of comprehensive 
system solutions. The company remains dedicated to 
staying at the forefront of technological developments, 
ensuring its continued commitment to excellence.
Indian Economy outlook
According to the latest India Development Update, 
a biannual flagship publication by the World Bank, 
India’s growth continues to be resilient despite signs of 
moderation. The report highlights that India continues 
to be one of the fastest-growing economies globally, 
although significant challenges persist in the global 
landscape. The overall growth remains robust, with an 
estimated full-year growth rate of 6.9%. The real GDP 
motherson sumi wiring india limited
44
grew by 7.7% year-on-year during the first three quarters 
of the fiscal year 2022-23.
However, there were some signs of moderation 
in the second half of FY 2022-23. The growth was 
underpinned by strong investment activity bolstered 
by the government’s capex push and buoyant private 
consumption, particularly among higher-income groups. 
Inflation remained high, averaging around 6.7% in FY 
2022-23. Nevertheless, the current-account deficit 
narrowed in Q3, thanks to the strong growth in service 
exports and easing global commodity prices.
Despite elevated headline inflation, projections suggest it 
will decline to an average of 5.2% in FY 2023-24, aided by 
easing global commodity prices and some moderation in 
domestic demand. To combat inflation, the Reserve Bank 
of India has withdrawn accommodative measures and 
raised the policy interest rate. India’s financial sector also 
remains strong, with improvements in asset quality and 
robust private-sector credit growth.
S&P Global Ratings recently maintained its forecast for 
India’s economic growth, unchanged at 6 per cent for 
FY 2023-24 before rising to 6.9 per cent in the following 
year. In its quarterly economic update for the Asia-Pacific 
region, S&P projects a decrease in inflation rate to 5 per 
cent in the fiscal year 2023-24, compared to 6.8 per cent 
in the current financial year. It also anticipates India’s 
gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 6.9 per cent 
in the current financial year 2022-23 before slowing to 6 
per cent in the following 2023-24 fiscal. “India leads, with 
average growth of 7 per cent in 2024-2026,” the update 
said.

(13/04/2023)
On a full-year basis, the highlights of the Indian automotive 
industry together with future trends are as follows:
•	
Since the last year, staggered growth has been 
observed across segments/subsegments in the 
Indian automotive industry. The market is gradually 
returning to pre-pandemic levels of functioning.
•	
Commercial vehicles registered the highest growth, 
with a 29% year-on-year increase in production 
compared to the previous fiscal year, followed by 
Passenger Vehicles at 25% and Three Wheelers at 
13% vis-a-vis numbers from the last fiscal year.
•	
Passenger car sales had been growing significantly 
before the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. After 
a brief period of uncertainty, the market is now 
functioning well above pre-pandemic levels & the 
forecast for the upcoming years look promising for 
India, which is defined as a key emerging market till 
2026 by S&P Global Mobility. 
•	
An increase in the electrification of vehicles and the 
banning of fossil fuel vehicles by 2035 is expected 
to boost the Indian passenger cars market in the 
future. The governmental subsidies for BEV along 
with norms, continued encouragement of BEV 
adoption among private auto owners is making BEV 
the fastest growing segment in passenger car sales 
in India.
•	
Various 
international 
auto 
manufacturers 
are 
developing new models to capture customer 
attention in the Indian automobile market. Such new 
launches are expected to attract customers, further 
enhancing the passenger cars market across India 
during the forecast period.
•	
The India commercial vehicle market is anticipated 
to grow at an estimated CAGR of 8.6% in the forecast 
years 2024-2028, on the grounds of surging freight 
movements and growing production of commercial 
vehicles. Higher demands from end use industries 
for transportation and higher prevalence of public 
transportation for transits are driving the growth of 
the India commercial vehicle market in the upcoming 
five years. Growing investments in the commercial 
automobile technological advancements also aid 
the market growth.

Discussion and Analysis
Reasons for change of 25% or more as compared to 
the immediately previous financial year:
NET Debt to EBITDA (in times)
Net debt as on March 31, 2022 was negative INR 105 
million, hence the ratio is not comparable.
DIVIDEND PAYOUTS
The Company has paid final cash dividend of INR 
2,684 million during the year. The Company proposed 
a dividend of INR 0.65 per share for FY 2022-23 which 
will be paid after approval at the ensuing annual general 
meeting. The dividend payout ratio for FY 2022-23 is 59% 
of profits (65% of profits in FY 2021-22). 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risks are an integral part of business growth and mitigating 
risks from all the directions is one of the challenges that 
the company targets. It is very important to have a Risk 
Management process in place with an objective to create 
an operational environment with a systematic, enterprise 
risk management at all levels of organization. Risk 
management and mitigation efforts must be calibrated 
according to the likelihood of exposure and the potential 
downside of an incident. The Company has set up a 
Risk Management Committee (RMC) at the board level 
to periodically review operating, financial, regulatory, IT 
and strategic risks in the business and their mitigating 
factors.
Risk Management Policy, which was approved by the 
Board, considers a holistic understanding of the risks 
that can potentially impact the operations, as well as 
taking action on how to effectively mitigate those risks 
to protect their assets and to keep operations running 
smoothly. The policy formulated outlines for the risk 
management framework to help minimise the impact 
of uncertainty on the company’s strategic goals. The 
framework enables a structured and disciplined approach 
to risk management. The guidelines developed cover 
risk control and the use of financial instruments. These 
guidelines contain a clear allocation of duties. Risks are 
controlled and monitored by means of operational and 
financial measures. 
The Company follows a robust process of risk 
management by following 3 step approach 
1.	
Step 1: Risk Identification (which includes education 
on the identification of risk, probability evaluation as 
to likelihood and finally consequence evaluation as 
to the impact/ financial losses to determine the size 
of risk)
2.	
Step 2: Risk Evaluation
3.	
Step 3: Action to mitigate or eliminate the risk with a 
monitoring mechanism in place
annual report  2022-2023
49
During the regular management meetings at all 
management levels, opportunities, risks and optimisation 
measures are reviewed in detail. Any exceptional 
situations having potential risks are identified and treated 
at the early stage to minimise their impact on business 
and financial positions.
Based on analysis and evaluation, Risk Committee 
assesses various risks in the following categories:
1.	
Operating Risks which cover risks arising out of 
external factors which are outside the sphere of 
influence of the company as well as internal factors 
which are generated by the company and by 
processes/ operations. Some of the external factors 
include future industry trends, social, political, 
economic risks, environmental risks and Act of God 
etc.
2.	
Financial & Accounting risk in terms of forex risks 
as well as for financial reporting due to changes in 
various regulations.
3.	
Regulatory risks cover risks with respect to local laws 
and regulations, intellectual property, patents etc. 
4.	
Strategic risks with respect to sourcing of various 
components as well as technical and other services 
from JV partners.
5.	
IT and Information security risks: These could relate 
to Unauthorized access and breach of Company’s IT 
system and resources, theft of critical data etc. 
The commitment to the company’s code of conduct 
covering ethics, anti- bribery policies and newly added 
climate change impact analysis is core to risk evaluation 
and mitigation process.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
The Company has an adequate system of internal 
control commensurate with its size and the nature of its 
operations. The internal control system & process are 
designed to ensure:
a)	
Transactions recorded are accurate, complete, 
authorised and in adherence to Accounting 
Standards. 
b)	
Compliance with applicable statutes, corporate 
policies and procedures. 
c)	
Effective usage of resources and safeguarding of 
assets and ensuring their authorized use.
d)	
With the support of technology using Data Analytics 
tools, the coverage and scope of internal audit has 
been further enhanced. 
The Internal Audit function collaborates with independent 
internal auditors to periodically review compliance with 
respect to the established design of internal control 
and also assess the effectiveness as well as the efficiency 
of operations. The Company has a well-established 
internal audit system built on the annual risk-based 
Internal Audit plan as approved by the Audit Committee 
of the Board. The significant audit findings are reviewed 
at regular intervals by the Audit Committee of the 
Board of Directors, comprising independent directors. 
Further, the Audit Committee also monitors the status of 
management actions emanating from the internal audit 
reviews. 
The Company is using the latest IT tools such as data 
analytics to enhance the scope and effect of the internal 
audit function. Adherence to the statutory compliances 
at each of the locations is also ensured by the committee 
through a continuous monitoring mechanism. The 
Company has also identified various business risks and 
laid down necessary procedures for mitigation of the 
same. Processes in the Internal Audit function have been 
continuously strengthened for enhanced effectiveness 
and productivity including the deployment of best in 
class tools for analytics in the Audit domain which has 
further enhanced the depth, coverage and sharpness of 
the internal audits.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of the 
company’s internal control over financial reporting (as 
defined in Clause 17 of SEBI Regulations 2015 applicable 
to Indian entities) as on March 31, 2023

MSWIL has established a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism that encompasses various channels for 
receiving and addressing grievances. These mechanisms are designed to provide employees with multiple avenues 
to express their concerns and suggestions. Various working groups, such as employee consultative committees,, 
health and safety committees, canteen committees, and welfare committees, have been established to address 
specific employee matters. These committees facilitate discussions and provide platforms for employee input. 
The human resources function within MSWIL plays a crucial role in impartially investigating and fact-finding 
with regard to any employee grievances, acting as an internal due diligence mechanism. Additionally, there are 
mechanisms in place to facilitate anonymous or private submissions through designated email addresses and/or 
telephone numbers. Furthermore, MSWIL has a dedicated Whistle-Blower Policy that serves as a formal platform 
for confidentially reporting and investigating grievances. This policy ensures that employees have a secure 
channel to raise concerns without fear of reprisal.
Lastly, MSWIL has a comprehensive policy on the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment 
in the workplace. In compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, 
and Redressal) Act, 2013, units have Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) responsible for conducting inquiries 
related to such complaints. These committees play a crucial role in ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment.
Overall, grievance redressal mechanisms provide employees with various avenues to raise concerns, seek 
resolution, and contribute to a positive and respectful work culture.

15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) 
and on significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working 
conditions.
We have implemented various corrective measures to address safety-related incidents and mitigate risks in our 
workplace. One significant action we have taken is the installation of safety covers and safety sensors on all 
machines, ensuring that potential risks associated with machine operations are eliminated or minimized.
Additionally, we have modified the safety covers of our C&C machines to further enhance their protective 
capabilities and reduce any potential risks they may pose. By enhancing the design and functionality of these 
covers, we have taken proactive steps to prevent accidents and maintain a safe working environment.
To ensure the safety of our employees during maintenance or repair work, we have implemented the LOTO 
(Lockout-Tagout) system. This system allows us to de-energize all machines and electrical panels before any 
maintenance or repair activities take place. By following this procedure, we significantly reduce the risk of 
electrical accidents and provide a safe working environment for our staff.
To address the potential threat of fire, we conduct thermal imaging of 100% of our machines and electrical panels. 
This proactive measure helps us identify any abnormal heat signatures that may indicate potential fire hazards. 
motherson sumi wiring india limited
74
By promptly detecting and addressing such issues, we can effectively control and mitigate the risk of fires in our 
workplace.
In order to maintain a culture of safety awareness, we regularly organize safety promotional activities. These 
initiatives aim to educate and raise awareness among our employees about various safety practices, procedures, 
and potential risks. By actively promoting safety consciousness, we create a work environment where employees 
are vigilant and actively contribute to maintaining a safe workplace.
Furthermore, we have implemented the use of RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) 30 mA devices in our 
electrical installations. RCCBs are safety devices specifically designed to protect against electrical shocks by 
quickly detecting any imbalance in the electrical circuit and interrupting the power supply. By incorporating 
RCCBs with a high Earth impedance, we prioritize human safety and minimize the risk of electrical accidents.
These comprehensive actions and measures demonstrate our commitment to maintaining and enhancing health 
and safety practices in our workplace. We continually assess our working conditions and practices to identify any 
potential risks or concerns, taking appropriate steps to address them promptly and effectively.

A.	
Conservation of energy
(i)	
Steps taken or impact on conservation of 
energy:
The organization is committed to assessing and 
managing energy consumption across all its 
facilities and areas. Significant advancements 
were made during the year to enhance 
energy efficiency and sustainability across our 
organization. Throughout the review period, 
numerous steps were taken to conserve and 
optimize energy usage. Here are some notable 
measures implemented:
•	
We 
installed 
Air 
Boosters 
in 
our 
machines, ensuring optimal utilization 
of 
air 
compressors. 
This 
strategic 
implementation has resulted in improved 
operational efficiency and reduced energy 
consumption.
•	
To minimize power usage and ensure 
consistent air distribution for human 
comfort, we introduced highly efficient, 
increased velocity systems with reduced 
speeds on our shop floors. This innovative 
approach not only curtails energy wastage 
but also promotes a conducive working 
environment.
•	
By employing Variable Frequency Drives 
(VFDs) and Inverter AC units, we have 
optimized our office air conditioning 
systems. These advancements enable us 
to regulate energy usage more effectively 
while ensuring optimal comfort for our 
employees.
•	
Transparent sheets were strategically 
installed on side walls to harness natural 
daylight, thereby reducing the need for 
artificial lighting during daytime hours. 
This initiative has significantly contributed 
to our overall power conservation efforts.
•	
We 
have 
implemented 
advanced 
controllers for lighting and air conditioning, 
ensuring minimal usage while still meeting 
operational requirements. By employing 
intelligent automation, we have achieved 
greater energy efficiency throughout our 
facilities.
•	
We have installed energy-efficient AHUs 
with stainless steel bodies and high-
efficiency motors, ensuring more effective 
air cooling and significant energy savings. 
These technological upgrades have had 
a positive impact on our overall energy 
consumption.
•	
To further reduce our carbon footprint, 
we prioritize the use of recyclable 
materials and avoid building materials that 
require excessive energy consumption 
during processing. This commitment to 
sustainable material selection supports 
our broader environmental goals.
•	
We remain dedicated to fostering a culture 
of energy conservation among our team 
members. Through regular campaigns 
and events, we continually educate and 
raise awareness about the importance 
of energy efficiency, empowering our 
employees to actively contribute to our 
sustainability efforts.
These initiatives, alongside numerous other 
ongoing projects, underscore our unwavering 
commitment to reducing energy consumption, 
mitigating environmental impact, and driving 
sustainable practices across our organization.
(ii)	
steps taken by the company for utilizing 
alternate source of energy:
•	
We have made significant strides by 
installing rooftop solar plants across our 
facilities. This not only helps us reduce our 
reliance on conventional power sources 
but also results in substantial cost savings. 
By embracing solar energy, we have 
taken a significant step towards achieving 
energy independence and environmental 
responsibility.

•	
Expanding Solar Power Infrastructure: 
Building upon our success with rooftop 
solar plants, we are committed to further 
expanding our solar energy capacity. We 
are actively engaged in the installation 
of additional solar plants, enabling us to 
enhance our energy independence and 
contribute to a more sustainable future.
•	
By strategically installing polycarbonate 
sheets on the roofs of our shop floors, 
we have harnessed the power of natural 
light during daytime hours. This innovative 
design not only enhances the working 
environment 
but 
also 
reduces 
our 
dependence on artificial lighting, leading 
to further energy conservation.
•	
To diversify our energy procurement and 
reduce our carbon footprint, we have 
initiated power purchase agreements with 
private sources, including wind power 
providers. 
•	
In our ongoing quest for innovative 
renewable energy solutions, we have 
implemented cutting-edge technologies 
such as windmills, light pipes, and solar 
tubes in select plants. These installations 
harness the power of nature to supplement 
our energy needs, resulting in reduced 
reliance on conventional energy sources.
•	
Transitioning to Cleaner Fuels- In our 
endeavour 
to 
reduce 
pollution 
and 
optimize operational costs, we have 
replaced diesel as a fuel source in 
generators with cleaner alternatives such 
as Piped Natural Gas (PNG). This transition 
not only helps us save on diesel costs 
but also significantly reduces our carbon 
emissions, contributing to a healthier 
environment.
These initiatives, backed by our dedicated team 
and a steadfast commitment to environmental 
responsibility, have positioned us as industry 
leaders in sustainable practices. By embracing 
renewable energy sources, optimizing resource 
usage, and investing in innovative solutions, we 
are forging a path towards a brighter and more 
sustainable future for our organization and the 
communities we serve.
(iii)	 the capital investment on energy conversation 
equipments:
The 
Company 
is 
following 
a 
scientific 
continuous process of making efforts on 
energy conservation and such measures 
include efforts at planning stage of expansion 
or modernization or replacement etc. (as the 
case may be). Accordingly, such expenses 
are considered in annual budgets. In addition 
to the above, considering size and extent of 
operations and turnover of the Company, any 
specific capital investment detail(s) in this 
respect, will be insignificant to segregate and 
separately report.

financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the

Other Information
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual report, but does not 
include the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made 
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether such other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or 
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation of these financial statements that give 
a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive income, 
cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management 
is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control. 
motherson sumi wiring india limited
146
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures 
made 
by 
management. 
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 
and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on 
Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to these financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to these financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to these financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to these financial statements.
Meaning 
of 
Internal 
Financial 
Controls 
With 
Reference to these Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; 
and 
(3) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
With Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
annual report  2022-2023
153
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by 
the ICAI.

manufacturers. The address of its registered office is Unit 705, C Wing, ONE BKC, G Block, Bandra Kurla Complex, 
Bandra East, Mumbai, Maharashtra. The Company is a public limited company and is listed in the Bombay Stock

During the previous year, the Company had given effect of the demerger of Domestic Wiring Harness (“DWH”)

("SAMIL") to the Company as per the order of Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench (“Hon’ble 
NCLT”) dated December 22, 2021 for the approval of the Composite Scheme of Amalgamation and Arrangement 
(“the Scheme”) among SAMIL, the Company, erstwhile Samvardhana Motherson International Limited and their 
respective shareholders.
The Company had given effect to the aforesaid demerger as on December 31, 2021 with effect from appointed

The listing process for these allotted shares was duly completed by March 28, 2022.
The financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on

2.1	 Significant accounting policies
(a)	 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended 
from time to time) and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, 
(Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the financial statements.

liabilities which have been measured at fair value or revalued amount:

motherson sumi wiring india limited

  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(i)	
Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract – Amendments to Ind AS 37
An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the 
contract costs (i.e., the costs that the Group cannot avoid because it has the contract) exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. 
The amendments specify that when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making, an entity needs 
to include costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services including both incremental 
costs (e.g., the costs of direct labour and materials) and an allocation of costs directly related to contract 
activities (e.g., depreciation of equipment used to fulfil the contract and costs of contract management and 
supervision). General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless 
they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract. 
These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Company.
(ii)	 Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to Ind AS 103
The amendments replaced the reference to the ICAI’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of 
Financial Statements under Indian Accounting Standards” with the reference to the “Conceptual Framework 
for Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standard” without significantly changing its requirements. 
The amendments also added an exception to the recognition principle of Ind AS 103 Business Combinations 
to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would 
be within the scope of Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or Appendix C, 
Levies, of Ind AS 37, if incurred separately. The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in Ind AS 37 or 
Appendix C, Levies, of Ind AS 37, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether 
a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. 
The amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for 
recognition at the acquisition date. 
These amendments had no impact on the financial statements of the Company.
(iii)	 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use – Amendments to Ind AS 16
The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items 
produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the 
directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment.
This amendment had no impact on the financial statements of the Company.
(b)	 Current versus non-current classification 
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. 
An asset is treated as current when it is:

(c)	 Foreign currencies
(i)	
Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional currency is Indian Rupee (INR) and the financial statements are presented in 
Indian Rupee (INR).
(ii)	
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 
year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit or loss. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried 
at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
(d)	 Revenue from contracts with customers
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred 
to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in 
its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services below, because it typically controls the goods or 
services before transferring them to the customer.
Revenue from sale of goods 
Revenue from sale of components is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred 
to the customer, generally on delivery of the equipment. 
The Company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance 
obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction 
price for the sale of equipment, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence 
of significant financing components, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer 
(if any).
Variable consideration
If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable 
consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant 
revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated 
motherson sumi wiring india limited

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Contracts for the sale of components 
provide customers with a customary right of return in case of defects, quality issues etc. The rights of return 
give rise to variable consideration.
The Company uses the expected value method to estimate the goods that will not be returned because 
this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Company will be entitled. The 
requirements in Ind AS 115 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to 
determine the amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For goods that 
are expected to be returned, instead of revenue, the Company recognises a refund liability. A right of return 
asset (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) is also recognised for the right to recover products 
from a customer.
Warranty obligations 
The Company typically provides warranties for general repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale, as 
required by law. These assurance-type warranties are accounted for under Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Revenue from assembly of components
The Company has contracts with customers to assemble, on their behalf, customised components from 
various parts procured from suppliers identified by the customer. The Company is acting as an agent in 
these arrangements.
When another party is involved in providing goods or services to its customer, the Company determines 
whether it is a principal or an agent in these transactions by evaluating the nature of its promise to the 
customer. The Company is a principal and records revenue on a gross basis if it controls the promised goods 
or services before transferring them to the customer. However, if the Company’s role is only to arrange 
for another entity to provide the goods or services, then the Company is an agent and will need to record 
revenue at the net amount that it retains for its agency services.
Judgements applied in determining amount and timing of revenue
The Company applied the following judgements that significantly affect the determination of the amount 
and timing of revenue from contracts with customers:
(i)	
Principal versus agent considerations
The Company enters into contracts with its customers to assemble, on their behalf, customised components 
using various parts procured from suppliers identified by the customer. Under these contracts, the Company 
provides assembly services (i.e., coordinating the procurement of various parts from the identified suppliers 
and combining or assembling them into components as desired by the customer). The Company determined 
that it does not control the goods before they are transferred to customers, and it does not have the ability 
to direct the use of the component or obtain benefits from the component. The following factors indicate 
that the Company does not control the goods before they are being transferred to customers. Therefore, the 
Company determined that it is an agent in these contracts.
•	
The Company is not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified equipment.
•	
The Company does not have inventory risk before or after the specified component has been 
transferred to the customer as it purchases various parts on just-in-time basis and only upon contract 
of the customer.
•	
The Company has no discretion in establishing the price for the specified component. The Company’s 
consideration in these contracts is only based on the difference between the maximum purchase price 
quoted by the customer and the cost of various parts purchased from the suppliers.
annual report  2022-2023
165
  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•	
In addition, the Company concluded that it transfers control over its services (i.e., assembling the 
component from various parts), at a point in time, upon receipt by the customer of the component, 
because this is when the customer benefits from the Company’s agency service.
(ii)	
Consideration of significant financing component in a contract
The Company develops customised tooling and secondary equipment’s for which the manufacturing lead 
time after signing the contract is usually more than one year. This type of contract includes two payment 
options for the customer, i.e., payment of the transaction price equal to the cash selling price upon delivery 
of the tooling or payment of the transaction price as part of the component’s selling price. The Company 
concluded that there is a significant financing component for those contracts where the customer elects to 
pay along with the component’s selling price considering the length of time between the transfer of tooling 
and secondary equipment and the recovery of transaction price from the customer, as well as the prevailing 
interest rates in the market, if any.
In determining the interest to be applied to the amount of consideration, the Company concluded that 
the interest rate implicit in the contract (i.e., the interest rate that discounts the cash selling price of the 
equipment to the amount paid in advance) is appropriate because this is commensurate with the rate that 
would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the entity and its customer at contract 
inception.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary 
course of business. They are generally due for settlement within one year and therefore are all classified as 
current. Where the settlement is due after one year, they are classified as non-current. Trade receivables 
are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant 
financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Company holds the trade receivables 
with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Trade receivables are disclosed in Note 5.
Contract Assets
A contract asset is the entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has 
transferred to the customer. A contract asset becomes a receivable when the entity’s right to consideration 
is unconditional, which is the case when only the passage of time is required before payment of the 
consideration is due. The impairment of contract assets is measured, presented and disclosed on the same 
basis as trade receivables.
Contract Liability
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company 
has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract. 
Impairment
An impairment is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of receivable or asset relating to 
contracts with customers (a) the remaining amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive 
in exchange for the goods or services to which such asset relates; less (b) the costs that relate directly to 
providing those goods or services and that have not been recognised as expenses.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(e)	 Other income
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, as income for the period in which it occurs. 
EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life 
of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of 
a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash 
flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, security deposit, 
prepayment etc.) but does not consider the expected credit losses.
Duty drawback and export incentives
Income from export incentives is recognized on an accrual basis.
(f)	
Government grants
Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the 
grant will be received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions.
Government grants relating to income are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period 
necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and presented within other 
income.
Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are included in non-current 
liabilities as deferred income and are credited to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the expected lives 
of the related assets and presented within other income.
When government grants relating to loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related 
institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable 
interest is regarded as a government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognised and measured at fair 
value and the government grant is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan 
and the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently measured as per the accounting policy applicable to 
financial liabilities.
(g)	 Income tax
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income 
based on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable 
to temporary differences.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at 
the end of the reporting period in India. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the standalone financial statements. 
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences only if it is probable that future 
taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
annual report  2022-2023
167
  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax 
assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either 
to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
 Investment allowances and similar tax incentives:
The Company may be entitled to claim special tax deductions for investments in qualifying assets or in 
relation to qualifying expenditure. The Company accounts for such allowances as tax credits, which means 
that the allowance reduces income tax payable and current tax expense.
(h)	 Leases 
The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration 
is considered as lease.
As a lessee
The Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and 
right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets
The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of 
right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease 
payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use 
assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets.
The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in section (i) 
Impairment of non-financial assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The 
lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company 
exercising the option to terminate. 
Lease liabilities, which separately shown in the financial statement are measured initially at the present value 
of the lease payments. Subsequent measurement of a lease liability includes the increase of the carrying 
amount to reflect interest on the lease liability and reducing (while affecting other comprehensive income) 
the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities 
is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments.

  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered 
to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(i)	
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. 
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates 
the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. 
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are 
corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available 
fair value indicators.
The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are 
prepared separately for each of the Company’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These 
budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow 
projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates 
cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an 
increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market 
in which the asset is used. Impairment losses including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
For assets an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the 
Company estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of 
the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such 
reversal is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the financial year 
at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
(j)	
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalent includes cash on hand, cash at banks and short term deposits with original 
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(k)	 Inventories
Raw materials, stores and spares, work in progress, stock in trade and finished goods are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost of raw material and traded goods comprise cost of purchase and is determined after rebate and 
discounts. Cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises direct materials, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of 
normal operating capacity.
Cost of inventories also includes all other cost incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Costs are determined on weighted average cost basis. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs 
of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(l)	
Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. 
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal 
amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
•	
Debt instruments at amortised cost
•	
Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
•	
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
•	
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
Debt instruments at amortised cost
This category is the most relevant to the Company. A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if 
both the following conditions are met:
a.	
The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows, and
b.	
Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. 
This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.
Debt instrument at FVTOCI
A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:
a.	
The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
the financial assets, and
b.	
The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting 
date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, 
the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in 
the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI is reclassified from the equity to statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI 
debt instrument is reported as interest income in statement of profit and loss using the EIR method.
Debt instrument at FVTPL
FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost 
or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). The Company has not 
designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss.
Equity investments
All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held 
for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which 
Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an 
irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The 
Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable. The Company elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments 
under this category.
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the 
cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) 
is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s balance sheet) when:
•	
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
annual report  2022-2023
171
  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•	
The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of 
the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations 
that the Company has retained.
Impairment of financial assets
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
a.	
Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt 
securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance 
b.	
Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI
c.	
Lease receivables under Ind AS 116
d.	
Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from 
transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115 
e.	
Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL
f.	
Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
•	
Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; and
•	
All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind AS 116
The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, 
it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial 
recognition.
For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines 
that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk 
has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument 
improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the 
entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.
Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events 
that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with 
the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at 
the original EIR.
motherson sumi wiring india limited
172
  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense 
in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the P&L. 
The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below:
•	
Financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: 
ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the 
balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, 
the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount.
•	
Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in the balance 
sheet, i.e. as a liability. Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, 
the expected credit losses do not reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet, which remains 
at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the asset was measured at 
amortised cost is recognised in other comprehensive income as the ‘accumulated impairment amount'.
The Company does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, i.e., 
financial assets which are credit impaired on purchase/ origination.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, 
as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and 
payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank 
overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised 
as well as through the EIR amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or 
costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement 
of profit and loss.
This category generally applies to borrowings and other payables.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is 
treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
(m)	 Fair value measurement
The Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•	
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
•	
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant 
that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient 
data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole:
•	
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
•	
Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable
•	
Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
The Company determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such 
as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring 
measurement.
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets and liabilities, if any. At each reporting date, the 
Company analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured 
or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting policies.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the 
basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as 
explained above.
This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the 
relevant notes.

(n)	 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Capital work in progress are stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment losses,

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
if any. Such cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items and the cost 
of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the 
recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at 
intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a 
major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as 
a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised 
in profit or loss as incurred.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the 
Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised.
Depreciation methods and useful lives
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets:

Over the period of lease
*Useful life of certain assets are different than the life prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 
2013 and those have been determined based on technical evaluation by the management. The management 
believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which 
the assets are likely to be used.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
(o)	 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of 
the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist

  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs 
also include exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
(p)	 Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions
Provisions for legal claims, product warranties and other obligations are recognised when the Company 
has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are 
not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is 
determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood 
of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually 
certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any 
reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Provision for onerous contracts
An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The Company at the end of every 
reporting period conducts the onerous contract test per the provisions of Ind AS 37 by comparing the 
remaining costs to be incurred under the contract with the related revenue of the contract. Where the costs 
of a contract exceed the related revenue of the contract, the Company makes a provision for the difference. 
Warranty provisions
In cases where the obligations include warranty liabilities, the Company provides warranties for general 
repairs of defects that existed at the time of sale, as required by law. Provisions related to these assurance-
type warranties are recognised when the product is sold or the service is provided to the customer. Initial 
recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty-related costs is revised annually.
Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence 
of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is 
either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount 
cannot be made.
(q)	 Employee benefits
Short-term obligations
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly 
within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised 
in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit 
obligations in the balance sheet.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Provident Fund & Employee State Insurance
Contribution towards provident fund and employee state insurance for employees is made to the regulatory 
authorities, where the Company has no further obligations. Such benefits are classified as Defined 
Contribution Schemes as the Company does not carry any further obligations, apart from the contributions 
made on a monthly basis.
Superannuation fund
The Company has a superannuation plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees who are members of 
the defined benefit superannuation plan are entitled to benefits depending on the years of service and salary 
drawn. The Company contributes up to 12% of the eligible employees’ salary or INR 100,000 / INR 150,000, 
whichever is lower, every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The 
Company does not have any further obligations beyond this contribution.
Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering eligible employees 
in accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 as well as accordance with the rules of the Company. 
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation 
or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of 
employment. The gratuity plan in the Company is funded through annual contribution to Life Insurance 
Corporation of India (LIC) under the Company’s Gratuity Scheme (refer note 17).
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The Company’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the 
end of each year. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the 
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds. Re-measurement gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity through other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. They are included in retained 
earnings through OCI in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet. Past-service costs are 
recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss.
Compensated Absences
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed within 12 months from 
the end of the year end are treated as short term employee benefits. The obligation towards the same is 
measured at the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount expected 
to be paid as a result of the unused entitlement as at the year end.
Accumulated compensated absences, which are expected to be availed or encashed beyond 12 months 
from the end of the year end are treated as other long term employee benefits. The Company’s liability is 
actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of government bonds. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in statement of profit or loss in the period in which they 
arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss.
(r)	
Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at 
the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the 
reporting period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(s)	 Earnings per share
(i)	
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Partly paid equity 
shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are entitled to participate in 
dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting period. 
The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events 
such as shares issued under Composite Scheme, bonus issue that have changed the number of equity 
shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
(ii)	
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account:
-	
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential 
equity shares, and
-	
The weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding 
assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.2	 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, the accompanying disclosures, 
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future 
periods.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, 
which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
(i)	
Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options – Company as lessee
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods 
covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered 
by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Company has several lease contracts that include extension and termination options. The Company 
applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to 
renew or terminate the lease.
(ii)	 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Company applies the judgements in respect to transactions relating to tooling development, Principal 
versus agent consideration that significant financing component in a contract that significantly affect the 
determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers. For more details, refer 
note 2.1 (d)
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
motherson sumi wiring india limited
178
  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the next financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters 
available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market change or circumstances arising beyond the control of the 
Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
(i)	
Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangibles
The Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the 
economic useful life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management 
periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised amount is charged over 
the remaining useful life of the assets.
(ii)	 Defined benefit plans
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment defined benefits are 
determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves various assumptions that may 
differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, 
future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its 
long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All 
assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
Further details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 17
(iii)	 Taxes
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, 
and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Given the nature of business differences arising 
between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could 
necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Company establishes 
provisions, based on reasonable estimates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, 
such as experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable 
entity and the responsible tax authority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety 
of issues depending on the conditions prevailing in the respective domicile of the companies. 
Valuation of recoverable income tax assets especially with respect to deferred tax assets on the tax 
loss carry forwards. The Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant 
judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. The Company 
recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will 
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the 
period in which such determination is made.

Above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in assumption while holding all the other assumptions 
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and change in some of the assumptions may be correlated. 
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions 
the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit

benefit liability recognised in balance sheet.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
basis of final salary and the period of service and paid as lump sum at the seperation. The risk associated 
with measuremetn of defined benefit plan obligations and thereby the financial results are:
(a) Interest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate based on 
government bonds, if bond yield fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
(b) Salary inflation risk: Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit 
obligation.
(c) Demographic risk: This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements 
that include mortality, withdrawal, disability and retirement. The effect of these decrements on 
the defined benefit obligation is not straight forward and depends upon the combination of salary 
increase, discount rate and vesting criteria .
(xi)	 Defined benefit liability and employer contributions
Weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9 years (March 31, 2022: 9 years)
Expected benefit payments are as follows:
Less than 
a year
Between 
1-2 years
Between

Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using 
valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on 
entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities included in level 3.
iii.	
Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
a.	
the use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
b.	
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
c.	
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and 
yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals
d.	
the fair value of the financial instruments covered under level 3 is determined using discounted cash 
flow analysis.
33	 Financial risk management
The Company in its capacity as an domestic active supplier for the automobile industry is exposed to various 
risks i.e., market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Concentrating on the plants make it necessary for implementing 
an organized risk management system. The Company is therefore exposed to risks associated with domestic 
automotive industry in particular.
motherson sumi wiring india limited

  (All amounts in INR Million, unless otherwise stated)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company has set up a Risk Management Committee (RMC) at the board level to periodically review 
operating, financial and strategic risks in the business and their mitigating factors. RMC has formulated Risk 
Management Policy for the Company which outlines the risk management framework to help minimize the 
impact of uncertainty on the Company’s strategic goals. The framework enables a structured and disciplined 
approach to risk management. The Company has developed guidelines on risk controlling and the use of financial 
instruments. These guidelines contain a clear allocation of duties. Risks are controlled and monitored by means 
of operational and financial measures.
Below are the major risks which can impact the Company:
A	
Market risk:
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market price/ rate. Market risk comprises three types of risk: foreign currency risk and other 
price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risk include payables/ receivables in foreign currencies.
a.	
Price risk:
Fluctuations in commodity price in global market affects directly and indirectly the price of raw material 
and components used by the Company in its various products segment. Substantial pricing pressure 
from major OEMs to give price cuts and inability to pass on the increased cost to customers may also 
affect the profitability of the Company.
The key raw material for the Company’s wiring harness business is copper. There are substantial 
fluctuations in prices of copper. The Company has arrangements with its major customers for passing 
on the price impact.
The Company is regularly taking initiatives like VA-VE (value addition, value engineering) to reduce its 
raw material costs to meet targets set up by its customers for cost downs. In respect of customer 
nominated parts, the Company has back to back arrangements for cost savings with its suppliers.
b.	
Foreign currency risk:
The foreign exchange risk majorly arises from imports, however the Company has arrangements with 
its major domestic customers for passing on the exchange impact on import purchases.
The hedged and unhedged foreign currency exposure is as follows:

Credit risk:
The credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Company and arises principally from the 
Company's receivables from customers and deposits with banking institutions.
Trade receivables
The Company has developed guidelines for the management of credit risk from trade receivables. The 
Company’s primary customers are major Indian automobile manufacturers (OEMs) with good credit ratings. 
Non-OEM clients are subjected to credit assessments as a precautionary measure, and the adherence of all 
clients to payment due dates is monitored on an on-going basis, thereby practically eliminating the risk of 
default and impairment. (Refer note 5 for total Trade receivables outstanding).

dated 31 March 2023 to amend the following Ind AS which are effective from 01 April 2023.
(i)	
Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8
The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting 
policies and the correction of errors. It has also been clarified how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023 and apply to 
changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of that 
period.
The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
(ii)	 Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing 
the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose 
their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in 
making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments to Ind AS 1 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. Consequential 
amendments have been made in Ind AS 107.
The Company is currently revisiting their accounting policy information disclosures to ensure consistency 
with the amended requirements.
(iii)	 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind 
AS 12
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under Ind AS 12, so that it no longer 
applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.
The amendments should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest 
comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, 
a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should 
also be recognised for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and 
decommissioning obligations. Consequential amendments have been made in Ind AS 101. The amendments 
to Ind AS 12 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023.
