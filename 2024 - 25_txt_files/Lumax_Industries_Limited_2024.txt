long-term benefits include enhanced operational performance, 
lower healthcare costs, and increased trust from stakeholders.
Positive Implications:
1.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
The Company has undertaken a wide range of energy-saving initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions across its facilities. These measures include:
	
1.	
Replacement of Old Fixed Speed Compressor with VFD-Based Energy-Efficient Compressor
	
	
•	
To reduce electricity consumption, the Company replaced a conventional fixed-speed compressor with a variable 
frequency drive (VFD)-based compressor. This transition significantly improves energy efficiency and contributes to 
lowering Scope 2 emissions
	
2.	
Solar Installation on Rooftop
	
	
•	
Installation of a rooftop solar plant offsets grid electricity usage, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuel-based 
energy sources and directly mitigating GHG emissions
	
3.	
Installation of IE-4 Class Energy-Efficient Motors in Annealing Oven
	
	
•	
Conventional induction motors are being replaced with high-efficiency IE-4 class motors, which reduce energy 
demand in heat treatment processes
	
4.	
Energy Optimization Project by Process Redesign 
	
	
•	
High-energy-consuming washing machines were replaced with three smaller tanks equipped with immersion 
heaters. This simple yet effective modification helps cut down energy usage in part-cleaning operations

•	
Older AC units have been substituted with 5-star rated models, and contribute to reduced indirect emissions
	
6.	
Optimization and Elimination of Pump Operation
	
	
•	
By eliminating one pump through process optimization, the facility has reduced its overall energy load, which in turn 
decreases GHG emissions

Quick Response 
Couplings (QRC) 
Installation on Machine
Quick Response Couplings (QRC) were installed on 
machines to prevent water leakage. This initiative aimed 
to reduce water wastage by effectively controlling and 
stopping leaks. The impact of this measure was monitored 
through daily tracking of water consumption.
Intangible benefits realized 
through reduced water 
leakage and improved 
operational efficiency.
 7
Auto Feeding to the Tank 
from the Builder Line
An automated feeding system was implemented to regulate 
water flow from the builder line to the tank. This initiative 
aimed to reduce water consumption by preventing overflow 
and leakage. The effectiveness of this measure was 
monitored through daily water consumption measurements.
Achieved zero overflow and 
leakage daily, optimizing 
water use and minimizing 
wastage.
 8
Energy Saving Project
The Company implemented an energy efficiency initiative 
aimed at reducing power consumption in the annealing 
oven. Conventional induction motors were replaced with 
high-efficiency IE-4 Class motors, known for their superior 
performance and reduced energy usage. This proactive 
equipment upgrade was undertaken to address high 
energy consumption in the process. Post-installation, 
energy savings were measured through detailed energy 
monitoring, confirming the effectiveness of the intervention 
in enhancing operational efficiency and supporting the 
Company’s sustainability goals.
Enhanced motor efficiency 
and reduced operational 
energy costs in annealing 
operations.
9
Water Consumption 
Reduction
The Company undertook a water conservation initiative 
aimed at reducing excessive water usage in urinal areas. 
The existing electronic and spring-return water taps were 
replaced with quicker-closing, sensor-based low-flow 
taps to minimize unnecessary water flow. This upgrade 
addressed the issue of high water wastage and ensured 
more efficient water management. Water savings resulting 
from this initiative were monitored and measured using a 
calibrated water meter, confirming the effectiveness of the 
intervention in reducing overall consumption.
Improved water 
conservation in sanitary 
systems with minimal 
infrastructure upgrades.
10
Rainwater Harvesting 
Capacity Increase
Within the plant area, the Company enhanced its rainwater 
harvesting system to support water conservation efforts. 
The storage capacity was increased by expanding the 
existing infrastructure. This upgrade aimed to improve 
water resource management by capturing and utilizing 
more rainwater. The effectiveness of the enhancement 
was measured based on the increased tank capacity, 
contributing to the Company's broader sustainability 
objectives.
Additional rainwater 
harvesting capacity added, 
contributing to improved 
rainwater utilization and 
water sustainability at the 
plant.

Optimize the process 
to reduce water 
consumption
The Company undertook a process optimization initiative 
aimed at reducing water consumption. As part of this 
initiative, the existing washing oven, which relied on large 
water tanks and pumps, was replaced with a more efficient 
system comprising three smaller water tanks for cleaning 
purposes. This improvement, implemented through the 
Kaizen approach, resulted in a significant reduction in 
water usage without incurring any additional costs. The 
effectiveness of the water-saving measure was verified 
using water meter readings.
