Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment

harassment cases and has the following features:
 
 
Make protected disclosure of any issue or concern. 
 
 
The Identity of the whistle blower shall be kept confidential and shall be disclosed only on need-to-know basis. 
 
 
Any employee or worker assisted in the investigation or furnishing evidence shall also be protected to the same 
extent as the whistle blower. 
 
 
Protection to whistle blower shall be available provided that protected disclosure is:
 
 
Made in good faith.
 
 
The whistle blower has reasonable information or documents to support the concern.
 
 
Not for personal gain or animosity against the subject.

complaints shall be liable to disciplinary action as decided by the Committee constituted under the Whistle 
Blower Policy.

Any kind of retaliation against any employee who reports or provides information on discrimination and harassment is 
strictly prohibited. We ensure complete protection of Whistle Blower against any unfair practice like retaliation, threat 
or intimidation of termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion, 
discrimination, any type of harassment, biased behavior. The Company has taken several steps to minimize difficulties, 
which the whistle blower may experience as a result of making the protected disclosure.
	
In instances where harassment occurs between the employees and is not covered under the POSH Policy, such as 
non-sexual harassment or harassment of men, employees are encouraged to report the incident to the Compliance 
Committee. This ensures that appropriate action can be taken to address the issue and prevent its recurrence. 
Confidentiality is paramount throughout the reporting and investigation process. All employees are expected to 
maintain confidentiality regarding the proceedings to protect the privacy and dignity of those involved.

5.	
Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation.
	
Yes, we have implemented a ZLD at one facility, emphasizing the reuse of water resources, alongside a Sewage 
Treatment Plant (STP) that produces 2746 kiloliters of water dedicated to gardening purposes. This initiative showcases 
our commitment to sustainable water management practices, ensuring minimal discharge of liquid waste and 
maximizing the repurposing of water within our operations. The STP not only efficiently treats wastewater but also 
contributes to the generation of a substantial volume of water specifically intended for landscaping and gardening 
needs. This integrated approach aligns with our dedication to environmental responsibility and underscores our role 
in promoting eco-friendly practices and resource efficiency within our industry.
	
Trade Effluent: “Spent” constitutes the sole effluent discharge originating from the factory premises, falling under 
hazardous waste category 12.2. Our operation protocol involves the comprehensive collection of this spent effluent 
via tanker units, followed by its diligent transfer of duly authorized recyclers. These specialized facilities play a 
pivotal role by incorporating the spent effluent or acid as a crucial raw material within their processing procedures. 
Consequently, our meticulous approach ensures that every drop of trade effluent is effectively diverted from external 
streams, guaranteeing its confinement within the factory's operational domain. This proactive measure underscores 
our commitment to environmental stewardship, as it mitigates the risk of any trade effluent contaminating external 
waterways or ecosystems beyond the factory confines.
	
Sewage Effluent: The factory diligently manages all generated sewage effluent by subjecting it to treatment 
through its Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Following treatment, the resulting water is repurposed solely for in-house 
gardening activities.
	
Expanding upon this, the factory's Sewage Treatment Plant employs a series of advanced processes to ensure the 
effective purification of sewage effluent. These processes may include sedimentation, biological treatment, filtration, 
and disinfection, among others, to remove impurities and contaminants from the wastewater. Once treated, the 
water meets stringent quality standards suitable for safe utilization in gardening applications within the factory 
premises.
	
By repurposing the treated water for in-house gardening purposes, the factory optimizes resource utilization while 
simultaneously minimizing environmental impact. This sustainable practice not only conserves freshwater resources 
but also reduces the volume of wastewater discharged from the facility. Additionally, utilizing treated sewage effluent 
for gardening helps foster a green environment within the factory premises, contributing to employee well-being 
and enhancing the overall aesthetics of the surroundings.

Our Company has implemented a solar project designed to generate a significant amount of energy, specifically 
222472.22 kWh. This initiative is a proactive measure aimed at reducing GHG emissions. By harnessing solar power, 
we contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape, aligning with global efforts to combat climate 
change. The solar project serves as a tangible manifestation of our commitment to environmental responsibility. The 
renewable energy generated not only aids in powering our operations but also plays a crucial role in minimizing our 
carbon footprint. This investment in sustainable energy sources not only reflects a forward-thinking approach but also 
positions our Company as a leader in adopting eco-friendly practices within the business sector.
