Energy 
Management
Risk
Entities in this industry require significant 
amount of energy for warehouses. 
An increasing number of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions regulations and 
incentives for energy efficiency and 
renewable energy may result in price 
increases for conventional electricity 
sources while making alternative sources 
more cost-competitive.
Energy sourcing decisions can 
lead to trade-offs concerning 
energy supply costs and the 
operational 
reliability. As 
a 
result, overall energy efficiency 
and 
access 
to 
alternative 
energy sources are becoming 
increasingly vital for entities to 
manage effectively. Currently, 
we are at the initial stage of 
discussion with a select few 
vendors regarding the transition 
to 
renewable 
energy. 
The 
Company is actively engaged 
in talks with these vendors for 
the installation of rooftop solar 
panels.

such 
as 
software 
or 
hardware 
malfunctions, 
system implementations or upgrades, 
computer viruses, third-party security 
breaches, employee errors, misuse, 
power disruptions, and other causes. 
Such events could result in significant 
interruptions of the operations, leading 
to a corresponding loss of revenue and 
profits. Furthermore, they may pose risks 
like breaches of data security, loss of 
critical data, and the inadvertent release 
and misuse of sensitive information, 
ultimately impairing our overall business 
operations.
We are continually dedicated to 
fortifying our digital infrastructure 
through the implementation of 
robust 
technical 
safeguards 
and vigilant monitoring of both 
emerging and existing threats. 
Our primary focus remains on 
mitigating data security risks
