2.
Climate
Risk
The risks  associated 
with the  physical 
impacts of  climate 
change  stem from  
catastrophic events 
that may affect 
our  Production 
infrastructure located 
in various parts of 
the country. The 
increasing frequency 
and severity of 
extreme weather 
events, such as 
Thunderstorms, 
Cyclones, Floods, 
Cloud Bursts, 
Landslides, Soil 
Erosion, Earthquakes, 
and Wildfires, pose 
significant challenges.
Mitigation can take 
place through careful 
assessment and 
planning for such risks 
with consideration 
for their time horizon 
and potential 
consequences. 
Ensuring the resilience 
of our infrastructure 
and implementing 
proactive measures 
are crucial to 
mitigating the 
adverse effects of 
climate change and 
safeguarding our 
operations. Moreover 
the company has 
taken comprehensive 
insurance to cover 
such eventualities.
Negative
3.
Human Rights
Opportunity
The Company has 
implemented a 
robust  Human Rights 
Policy and procedure 
which will enhance 
productivity at all 
levels.
—
Positive. Human 
rights policy clearly 
states inclusivity of 
employees, zero 
tolerance to abuse 
and discrimination. 
The adherence to 
this policy shall 
continue to generate 
best of talents 
and consequent 
productivity.
4.
Stakeholder 
Engagement 
Opportunity
The Company has a 
planned outreach to 
value chain partners 
by conducting 
awareness programs 
and also has ongoing 
programmes with 
engagement with 
investors and 
employees.
—
Positive. As the 
Company  has 
connected with 
local eco- chain on 
sustainability issues, 
the benefits of such 
good practices 
shall be apparent 
in its sourcing and  
branding.
5.
Water Management
Risk
Although the 
Company is engaged 
in achieving water 
positive status in all 
plants, water being 
a finite resource can 
become a challenge in 
future.
The Company is 
planning for better 
water conservation 
through rain water 
harvesting, recycling 
of  used water and 
reduced wastage in 
production facilities.
Negative. Shortage of 
water through natural 
resources could be a 
concern in future.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, 
the coverage such system?
	
Yes, the company has implemented an occupational health and safety management system which is covered to 
all stakeholders. This system encompasses risk assessment and planning, operational controls, employee training, 
monitoring and compliance reporting, emergency preparedness, and continuous improvement processes. The coverage 
and implementation details are tailored to meet the industrial standards and the specific operational needs of entity, 
aligning with ISO 45001 standards & certifications.
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
We follow a systematic approach to identify work-related hazards. This includes but is not limited to –
• 
Regular inspections of the workplace to identify hazards such as chemical exposure, machinery malfunctions, or 
ergonomic issues.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
214
• 
Reviewing incident reports and near-misses to identify areas of concern.
• 
Consulting with employees and safety representatives who work directly with the equipment or processes to gather 
insights into potential hazards.
• 
Using risk assessment tools like HAZOP, HIRA, QRA, etc. for each activity or process, routine and for any 
significant project changes, including green/brown field projects to quantify and prioritise risks & involving relevant 
stakeholders, including employees, supervisors, and safety experts, in the risk assessment process. For critical 
changes, a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) using HAZOP methodology is conducted by qualified professionals. This 
process systematically identifies potential hazards in the workplace and assesses the risks associated with them. 
Appropriate control measures are then determined to mitigate these risks. HAZOP studies are  carried out across all 
units, and safety improvements are regularly implemented to reduce or eliminate risks in processes and operations.
• 
Regular safety audits and inspections by both external and internal parties in planned/surprise fashion to ensure 
compliance with safety procedures and regulations.
• 
Comprehensive safety measures through routine and specialised assessments conducted by reputable agencies and 
consultants. These include Hazardous Area Classification, ATEX Studies, Chemical Process Safety Assessments, 
Fire & Life Safety Assessments, and Electrical Safety Assessments.
• 
Ongoing training and education programs to keep employees informed about potential hazards and safe work 
practices.
• 
Implementing feedback mechanisms like near miss reporting, Abnormality Identification, Safety committee review, 
etc. to allow employees to report hazards or suggest improvements to safety procedures.
• 
On a non-routine basis we are also conducting risk assessments before introducing new processes, equipment, or 
materials into the workplace.
• 
Developing specific risk assessment protocols for non-routine tasks or activities, such as maintenance work or 
emergency response procedures.
• 
All major injuries & high potential incidents undergo detailed investigation using the methodology like 5-why analysis, 
5W1H, Fishbone Analysis, etc. Corrective action & preventive action plan (CAPA) is then developed based on the 
findings of the investigation. The learnings are implemented & horizontally deployed across other units to avoid 
repetitive incidents and corrective actions are driven by site leadership of each location.
	
By following these steps, we can proactively identify and mitigate work-related hazards, helping to ensure the safety 
and well-being of their employees.
c.

meetings, and recognizing and rewarding safe behaviors. Creating an environment where employees feel empowered to 
report hazards and suggest improvements to safety practices.
	
The company also offers medical check-up, health and wellness programs to promote employee well-being, including 
access to healthcare services, counseling, fitness programs, and ergonomic assessments to prevent work-related injuries

With this approach, there had been no accident/major incidents in the past year. For minor spill and leakage related incidents 
which occurred previously both Corrective and preventive actions have been taken up. No environmental damage has 
occurred as the spills at the respective locations were contained and most of the material was also recovered however to 
ensure such material loss does not happen the installations were reviewed and necessary changes in the pipes and joints 
were being done by respective vendors. 
	
Change management has also been introduced to ensure that any transitions in the process/ product is transitioned 
smoothly by providing a structured approach to planning, implementing, and monitoring changes. Also we ensure effective 
communication at all stages of the change process. Clear and transparent communication helps employees understand the 
reasons for the changes, the expected outcomes, and their roles in the process. This reduces uncertainty and confusion, 
leading to better acceptance of the changes and safer working environment.

Yes. Futurestation Advisors LLP has conducted a reasonable assurance.
10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	
Company has launched a project WOW (War on Waste) under Manufacturing excellence umbrella which aims at 4R 
(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recreate) under which reduction of waste at source, Sticky loss recovery, powder RM reuse in 
batches and recreate a usable RM from waste is being done and system is set in place to monitor the process and ensure 
that no such material sent out as waste.
	
For filling operation all our plants have shifted towards use of automatics machines, where the chance of spillage is very less. 
Excess/less filing is stopped which could result in product rejection due to tinting.
      	Defect prevention is targeted in products through RFT (Right First Time) implementation to minimize process waste generation.
       Washing solvent generated from washing of equipment is being reused in subsequent production batches. Spent solvent is 
reused for cleaning purpose and after multiple such uses, fresh solvent is recovered in-house from waste solvent through 
distillation process. The recovered fresh solvent is recycled into paint manufacturing process related activities. ‘19th barrel 
syndrome’ – project taken to limit generation of washing solvent at plant so within 18 barrels washing solvent generated gets 
reused in washing.
	
Barrels used for production and storage purposes are re-used - another step towards Carbon Footprint reduction.
	
Plastic waste from raw material packaging and damaged packaging material is sent to an authorized plastic recycler. Under 
Plastic Waste management rules, Berger Paints has established action plan as per our EPR obligations and carried out the 
compliance for recycling with company appointed WMA (Waste Management Agencies). Also, recycled plastic content is 
used in our product packaging which ensured that use of virgin plastic can be reduced. 
	
Waste generated inside the plant is being collected and disposed through approved Cement plants for co-processing.
	
Powder collected from Dust extraction system is reused in making economy grade products.
	
Project JAL has been taken ahead by the plants to curb wastage of water and which has helped to save on an average 
of 3.2 lac Liters of water daily.
	
Through Project PARAGON our in-transit damages have reduced significantly causing lesser harm to environment and 
better storage condition at the depots.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
228
	
We have also implemented a number of waste reduction initiatives, such as reducing packaging, using recycled materials, 
and encouraging employees to reduce their own waste. We have implemented a number of waste recycling programs, such 
as paper, plastic, Container segregation and its best utilization. These initiatives help us to reduce our environmental impact 
and ensure that our products and processes are safe and sustainable.

Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be

Outcome of the initiative
1
Zero Liquid Discharge 
System
From the Effluent Treatment Plants installed at all of our 
Units, the treated water was earlier released after the 
characteristics of the effluent water were met as per the 
PCB recommendation but, to recycle & reuse that water & 
thereby, to reduce the water consumption of the Units, we 
have also installed ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge) systems at 
applicable units which consists of various Filtration units 
along with RO module & MEE (Multiple Effect Evaporator). 
Further we have upgraded the system with MVRE which is 
low energy consumption. After treating the effluent water 
coming from ETP, through ZLD system, this water is used 
for domestic & industrial utility application.
1) Zero discharge of liquid 
effluent & reuse of the same after 
treatment.
2) Reduction of water 
consumption.
2
Effluent Treatment Plants 
in all Berger Units, with 
Activated Sludge Process 
& Tertiary Treatment.
Essentially, the paints manufacturing process, as such, 
does not directly generate any wastewater streams to 
cause any water pollution. However, at a typical paints 
manufacturing facility, the wastewater streams generated 
from the operations include those from equipment cleaning/
reactor washing and from the support utilities. These waste 
water are collected from their respective point of generation 
& transferred to the ETP’s with Activated Sludge Process & 
Tertiary Treatment, where these are treated to maintain level 
for certain parameters like BOD, COD, TDS, TSS etc. within 
the limits prescribed by the PCB.
1) Reduction of BOD, COD, TSS 
etc. to the maximum extent in 
the treated water, to maintain the 
same within the prescribed limit 
of PCB.
3
Usage of Bio-Fuel instead 
of Diesel for the Thermic 
Fluid Heaters of Resin 
Plants.
In the Resin Plants, Thermic Fluid Heaters are used to 
supply process heat to the Reactors. Earlier we used 
Diesel as the fuel for this Thermic Fluid Heaters but now 
we have replaced the Diesel fired heaters by Bio-fuel fired 
Heaters like use of Ground nut pellets, cashew nuts pellets, 
Sugarcane baggase, etc. with fully automatic closed 
loop charging system. Bio-fuel being much greener fuel 
compared to Diesel, the Carbon foot print & Green House 
gas emission has reduced dramatically, apart from the huge 
monetary savings obtained.
1) Reduction of huge amount 
carbon foot print.
2) Reduction of Green House Gas 
emission.

Outcome of the initiative
4
Usage of PNG (CLEANER 
–Fuel) instead of  LSHS 
for the Thermic Fluid 
Heaters of Resin Plants 
and DUAL Fuel KIT PNG 
Based for operation of 
DG Set
1. PNG Cleaner Fuel has been used by replacing LSHS/
HSD/ FO Pollutant Fuel earlier being used for operation of 
Resin Thermopac, which is much cleaner fuel means that it 
produces fewer emissions and pollutants when burned. This 
helps to reduce air pollution and improve air quality.
2. PNG is also more efficient than LSHS, meaning that it 
requires less fuel to generate the same amount of heat. 
This can result in lower operating costs for the thermic fluid 
heater. 
3. PNG is also a safer fuel than LSHS, as it is non-toxic 
and lighter than air. This reduces the risk of fire and other 
accidents in the workplace. 
4. Finally, PNG is a more sustainable fuel than LSHS, as it is 
derived from Fossils fuels and very cleaner fuel not left any 
residue .This helps to reduce the environmental impact of 
the thermic fluid heater.
1) Reduction of huge amount 
carbon foot print.
2) Reduction of Green House Gas 
emission.
5
(B)All Out
Project (B)ALL Out, our flagship initiative to enhance 
grinding efficiency with safer & economically viable means, 
has made significant progress since you have last heard 
about it. We have successfully replaced Ball Mills with safer 
and more efficient technologies, such as Basket Mills, IEC, 
Stator Rotor, mixed combinations, or new technologies. 
This strategic move has not only mitigated safety risks and 
eliminated noise pollution but also delivered substantial 
power savings.
We have been able to save more 
than two lacs unit of electricity 
through this initiative. 
6
DPV Water reuse
We have installed Pigging system in our plant to collect 
maximum retention during emulsion and water based paints 
transfer. This is being recollected and used up in batches 
thereby helping to decrease material loss and decrease our 
ETP load.
Around 100 KL of water and 20 
MT of emulsion per month is 
being saved through this initiative. 
7
Project JAL
Taken across all our units with target to reduce our ETP 
intake water by 50% through re-using measures,  arresting 
leakages and spread awareness on less wastage of water 
and proper accounting.
1) 3.2 Lac Litres of water saved 
daily.
2) No need to enhance ETP 
capacity with increase in 
production load
8
Green STP
Rediscovering Nature’s Genius in treating Sewage - the 
cow’s stomach. The unique patented technology treats 
sewage in a decentralized, self- sustainable way in 
underground chambers without power, chemicals or human 
intervention. Using Biomimicry, regenerative innovation 
inspired by nature, the Green-STP utilizes functional 
principles and strategies of microorganisms and ecosystem 
found in a cow’s stomach
15,00,000 Liter sewage water 
purification per year capacity.
9
Rain-water harvesting by 
adaptation of pond
An artificial pond is being adopted in nearby village at 
Gaziveerpuram which will recharge 50 % rain water and 
50% will evaporate by sun dried of own storage capacity. 
43155 m3 of annual rainfall is 
being harvested
10
Installation of Roof Top 
Solar Power Plant
We have recognized the importance of sustainability and 
renewable energy. One of the initiatives they might have 
undertaken is the installation of rooftop solar plants on their 
facilities. Solar energy has significantly reduce electricity 
consumption over the long term. By generating our own 
electricity from solar panels, we have been able to offset the 
consumption from the grid, thus switching over to cleaner 
and greener alternatives.
1,00,74,876 kWh generated in 
FY 23-24

Reasonable Assurance Report of Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report – Core Indicators vide SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD- SEC-2/P/C 
CIR/2023/122 dated July 12, 2023
Assurance Statement
To The Management and Board of Directors 
Berger Paints India Limited
Futurestation Advisors LLP (also referred as “Futurestation” or “we” or “us”) was engaged by Berger Paints India Limited (also 
referred as “BPIL”) to conduct a reasonable assurance procedure on the BRSR Core attributes FY 2023-24 as reported by BPIL for 
the period stated below. This Assurance Statement applies to the procedure conducted by us as per the engagement agreement 
dated 22nd September 2023 signed between BPIL and Futurestation. The determination of the BRSR Core attributes is the 
sole responsibility of BPIL. Futurestation’s responsibility was to conduct reasonable assurance procedure based on applicable 
standards as per the engagement agreement referred above. 
Reporting Period
1st of April 2023 to 31st of March 2024. 
Level of Assurance
Reasonable Assurance. A reasonable assurance procedure involves assessing the risk of material mis-statement of the agreed 
attributes whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risk as necessary under the circumstances. We conducted 
our reasonable assurance procedure in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board. These standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the reported BRSR Core attributes are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria. 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of data recording procedures on sample basis particularly for operational attributes (like energy, water 
and waste), inspection of data collating and recording procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
• 
Made BPIL’s management and process owners aware of the procedures to be performed by us.
• 
Understood and evaluated the design of the key structures, systems, processes and controls for managing, recording and 
reporting on the identified attributes. 
• 
Checked consolidation for various plants and corporate offices for ensuring the completeness of data being reported 
• 
Based on that understanding and the risks that the reported data may be materially misstated, determined the nature, timing 
and extent of further procedures
• 
Performed substantive testing on a selective basis of the identified attributes at the corporate head office in Kolkata, office in 
New Delhi, and visited sample representative plants to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated 
and reported;
• 
Reviewed records and performed testing including recalculation of sample data to establish an assurance trail
• 
Reviewed the level of adherence to the reporting criteria and the reporting framework followed by BPIL in preparing the BRSR 
Core data
• 
Reviewed the level of risk involved in material incorrectness in recording, collating and reporting of the data
BRSR Core Attributes
The BRSR Core attributes are mentioned in page 3 of this statement. 
Observations
Our observations after conducting the reasonable assurance procedure are:
1.	
The data on GHG, Energy, Water, Waste and Safety include only those pertaining to the plants at Howrah, Pondicherry, 
Goa, Rishra, Jammu, Jejuri, Hindupur (2 plants), Naltali, Taloja, Sandila, Sikandrabad, Samba and Nalbari.

2.	
The Organisational Boundary considered in computation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions is limited to the plants 
mentioned above. Equity share, Financial or Operational control criteria of GHG Protocol have not been used to set the 
boundary.
3.	
The data recording, collation and reporting process for energy, water and waste is fair. However, there is scope to 
improve its robustness to reduce risk of misstatement. 
4.	
The waste segregation, measurement and storage facilities have scope of improvement
Inherent Limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non­ financial information 
allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities. In 
addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine 
emission factors and availability of updated credible values. 
Assurance Opinion: 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core attributes for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2024 are prepared in all material respects.
Statement of independence, impartiality and competence
Futurestation Advisors LLP is an independent professional services company that specializes in sustainability advisory and 
assurance services. No member of the reasonable assurance procedure performing team has a business relationship with BPIL, 
its directors or managers beyond that required of this assignment. We conducted this procedure independently and to our 
knowledge there has been no conflict of interest. The team has extensive experience in conducting assurance over environmental, 
social, ethical, governance, health and safety information, systems and processes, has over 30 years combined experience in this 
field and an excellent understanding of the subject matter.
