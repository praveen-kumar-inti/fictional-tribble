Financial implications

opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Economic 
Performance
Risk & Opportunity The Company's financial 
performance is largely driven 
by revenue from construction 
& maintenance contracts and 
tolls. While toll revenue is 
largely driven by toll rates and 
traffic growth, construction 
revenue is recognized over the 
course of the projects based on 
the percentage of completion.
Revision of toll rates is linked 
with “Wholesale price index” or 
periodical increase clause as per 
Concession Agreement. Rapid 
economic development increases 
traffic growth while low economic 
activity has a negative impact.
Low economic activity would 
lead to higher inflation which 
compensates the negative impact. 
Development of industrial corridors 
alongside our road assets are 
expected to boost traffic growth 
which ultimately helps toll revenue 
growth.
We use risk assessment, mitigation 
and contract management, to 
manage the risks associated with 
EPC projects. Also, with respect to 
increase in input cost such as raw 
materials, the Company has been 
instrumental in getting competitive 
pricing from its bulk purchases.
Positive and 
Negative
2
Corporate 
Governance
Opportunity
Effective governance practices 
are adhered by way of 
maintaining highest level 
of compliance to code of 
conduct and ethics throughout 
the Company’s business 
activities and operations. Good 
corporate governance practices 
enable in gaining the trust 
from the stakeholders such as 
investors, value chain partners, 
customers, employees and 
communities.
Diverse leadership of the Company 
such as Board of Directors, Key 
Management Personnel possess 
required expertise, skill and 
experience to effectively manage 
and lead the Company to attain its 
goals.
The Company has robust policies 
and standard operating procedures 
as a guiding instrument for its 
people to ensure ethical behavior 
transparency and responsibly.
Positive
3
Regulatory 
Compliance
Opportunity
Adhering to regulatory 
compliances aids in operating 
and driving the
Business activities smoothly. 
Protecting stakeholder 
interest as well as the public 
interest requires regulatory 
compliance, which is essential 
to maintaining the integrity of 
business processes.
The Company is driven by 
Business Responsibility policies 
as put forth by the Principles of 
NGRBC, the Companies Act, 2013 
and other applicable laws and 
regulations. The policies are written 
in accordance with the relevant 
regulatory requirements and are 
complied in timely manner.

4
Materials
Risk
Company requires raw 
materials such as bitumen, 
stone aggregates, cement 
and steel that involve logistics, 
storage and handling of 
materials and products.
The Company is required 
to ensure regular supply 
and adequate inventory of 
raw materials to avoid any 
operational disruptions, which 
has the risk of cost escalations 
and shortage of raw materials.
The Company is ensuring 
robust raw material inventory 
management across its 
project sites.
The Company regularly engages 
with its value chain partners 
such as raw material suppliers, 
logistic partners, dealers to ensure 
effective inventory planning.
The Company is conscious of 
its impact on environment and 
society. As a result, this ensures 
minimum negative impact through 
responsible sourcing, recycling 
and by following policies and 
procedures to use high-quality 
materials from ethical and 
sustainable sources.
Negative
5
Energy
Risk & Opportunity Plants & Machineries consume 
energy while producing 
construction materials. 
Increase in input fuel cost of 
power generation often leads 
to increase in energy usage 
cost and at some remote 
worksites, the availability of 
power becomes challenging 
and hence the requirement 
of portable diesel generators 
further impacts environment & 
cost of operation.
We are committed to reduce 
energy consumption by 
implementing energy efficient 
practices and technologies. We 
are upgrading the plants and 
machineries with latest version, 
which improves overall efficiency 
and reduces operating cost.
We further wish to reduce our 
dependence on fossil-fuel based 
power generation and inculcate 
practice of procuring green energy 
wherever possible.
Negative and 
Positive
6
Water
Risk & Opportunity Efficient water stewardship and 
usage helps in reducing
negative impact on 
groundwater depletion and 
water contamination.
Water is one of the key 
resources for construction 
activities and we acknowledge 
the fact that the availability of 
water across the country varies.
We recognize water as a 
shared resource and a precious 
commodity. The Company is not 
only committed to the judicial use 
of water resources but also ensures 
the effective management of the 
water from activities (sourcing, 
consumption, recycling) as per the 
guidelines and standard practices. 
Being a responsible company, we 
have adopted sustainable water 
management initiatives across 
operations to optimize water 
consumption.
Negative and 
Positive
7.
Emission 
Reduction
Opportunity
Carbon emission is considered 
as the primary driver of 
global climate change. The 
scientific studies have proven 
that carbon emissions from 
industries strengthen the 
greenhouse effect, and 
thus making it essential for 
the companies to manage 
effectively.
We understand climate change risk 
and we are responsible towards 
reducing carbon emissions. The 
Company's Sustainability Report 
reflects commitment to reduce 
emissions by adopting Sustainable 
practices.
