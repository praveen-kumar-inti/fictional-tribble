Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the 
Board.
	
The consultation with the Board on key stakeholder concerns is largely mediated by different organizational functions 
which are responsible for the respective stakeholders. Periodic Board reviews are held at least once a quarter, during 
which the Board holds extensive discussions with the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and other senior leaders 
representing these functions. For example, feedback on customer trends and issues is provided by the Heads of 
Businesses and Market Units, that on investors by the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and his team, on employees 
by the Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") and his team, on sustainability issues by the Chief Sustainability 
Officer, etc. Please refer to "Engagement Mode and Frequency" and "Topics of Engagement" in the "Stakeholder 
Engagement" Section of Wipro Annual Report for FY 2024-25. 
2. 
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, 
and social topics (Yes / No).
	
Yes 
	
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were 
incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Stakeholder engagement covers key material issues driven by strategic objectives through various modes of 
engagements. There is a primary internal custodian for each stakeholder group. For example, feedback from 
employees involve certain informed steps which are taken leading to enhanced communications and collaboration 
forums. For suppliers, this has improved the ease of doing business and ability to address environmental and social 
aspects. For communities, under the community ecology initiative, we focus on striking an ecological balance in 
our proximate communities by taking up projects that have direct and tangible benefits and strengthening our 
urban primary healthcare system is a focus area for us. This is because vulnerable communities still lack adequate 
personnel and amenities for their healthcare needs. Similarly, for employees, at Wipro, the health, safety, and 
wellbeing of our employees is of paramount importance. We look at wellbeing holistically, connecting mind, body, 
and community to help us focus on being healthy, feeling happy, and living our life's purpose. Our employee wellness 
programs encompass three areas of employee wellbeing: Physical, emotional, and financial. Inputs are received 
through the employee feedback mechanism. Customer surveys are conducted periodically to get customer inputs. 
Additionally, Quarterly reviews are held with customers where inputs are sought.

for social transformation and sustainable development. Within this ambit, we deliberatively focus on disadvantaged 
groups in a significant majority of our social initiatives e.g. Children with Disability, the Urban Poor, Women from 
disadvantaged communities, Suppliers from under-represented groups (e.g. Women owned enterprises), Employees 
with disability or from LGBTQ+ groups. Boosting and strengthening our urban primary healthcare system is a focus

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What 
mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
	
Around 86% of the environmental impact from GHG emissions is from our extended value chain. The main contributing 
categories are purchased goods and services, business travel and employee commute. We have mitigation plans 
for each of these - at a high level it is based on engagement and disclosures with our suppliers; travel reduction 
and avoidance for business travel; EV, public transport and pooling for employee commute and RE procurement for 
reducing upstream energy emissions.

We estimate that approximately 50% of suppliers by value of business would be assessed for environmental impact 
- across key categories of IT hardware, facility management services and Civil. The natural capital valuation program 
assesses the environmental impact of our value chain activities, including purchased goods and services. This is 
based on our spend data for each supplier and categories they belong to. Details of the same are provided in Annual 
Report under Wipro's Natural Capital Valuation Program. We engaged with 130 suppliers, who contributed to more

Renewable energy transition: Transition to renewable energy has 
been one of the big projects that Wipro has taken up, with an impact 
assessment evaluating effects on GHG emissions, air pollution, water, 
and land. In FY25, 81 million units were sourced, primarily from solar, 
followed by wind, hydel, and co-gen. Site assessments confirmed 
minimal environmental disruption, with wind towers placed outside 
forest zones and solar projects ensuring water conservation. Hero 
Future Energy implemented waste management measures. 
Impact: The program achieved GHG savings of 87,609 tonnes, 
water savings of 2.4 million m³, and a total impact saving of USD 12 
million, though land use introduced a negative externality of USD 
1.6 million. Overall, the CSR initiative was deemed highly positive for 
the environment.

We have undertaken to perform limited assurance engagement, for WIPRO LIMITED (the “Company”) vide our 
engagement letter dated March 19, 2025 in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below (the 
“Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance with the Criteria stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability 
Information is included in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (the “BRSR” or the “Report”) within 
the Integrated Annual Report (the “IAR”) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2025. This engagement was 
conducted by our multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers, and specialists.
2. 
Identified Sustainability Information
	
Our scope of limited assurance consists of the Sustainability Information listed in the Appendix I to our report. The 
reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with 
exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.
3.	
Criteria
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
•	 Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;
•	 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Requirements for listed entities per Master Circular No. 
SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 (the “SEBI Master Circular”);
•	 SEBI Press Release PR No.36/2024 dated December 18, 2024;
•	 Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core as per SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2024/177 
dated December 20, 2024; and
•	 SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD - PoD-1/P/CIR/2025/42 dated March 28, 2025.
4.	
Management’s Responsibility
	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary of the Report, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement 
with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant 
to the preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, which is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between companies.
6.	
Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Master Circular and clarifications thereto 
and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
	
We apply Standard on Quality Control (“SQC”) 1, “Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintain 
a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our Responsibility
	
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in 
Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 
3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 
3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued by the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.
	
These standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report is free from material misstatement.
	
As part of limited assurance engagement, in accordance with the Standard, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement.
8.	
Limited Assurance
	
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use 
of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information as listed in Appendix I, 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or 
error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation 
of the Identified Sustainability Information.
	
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation 
to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal controls, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
	
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of 
processes performed, inspection of documents and evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies and agreeing with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:
•	 Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
•	 Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements 
of the Identified Sustainability Information;
•	 Made inquiries of Company’s management, including the sustainability team, the facilities management group, 
the human resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
•	 Obtained an understanding of the key systems and processes for recording, processing and reporting on the 
Identified Sustainability Information at locations /offices on a sample basis;
•	 Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
•	 Reviewed the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of Greenhouse Gas (the 
“GHG”) emissions;
•	 Reviewed the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the 
Identified Sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and
•	 Reviewed the consolidation of the offices on a sample basis under the reporting boundary for ensuring the 
completeness of data being reported.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent 
than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Identified 
Sustainability Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited 
assurance conclusion.
9.	
Exclusions
	
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express a conclusion on:
•	 Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability 
Information; and
•	 The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions 
provided by the Company.
10.	 Limited Assurance Conclusion
	
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and presented in the 
Report for year ended March 31, 2025 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria as 
stated in paragraph 3 above.
11.	 Restriction on use
	
Our Limited Assurance report has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the 
request of the Company solely, to assist the Company in reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and 
activities. Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, other than the Company. Our Limited Assurance report should 
not be used for any other purpose or by any person other than the addressees of our report. We neither accept nor 
assume any duty of care or liability for any other purpose or to any other party to whom our report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come without our prior consent in writing.
