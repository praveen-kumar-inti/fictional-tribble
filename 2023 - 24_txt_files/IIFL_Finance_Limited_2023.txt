Data and 
Customer 
Privacy
Risk
Security and protection of customer 
data is crucial to avoid data misuse. 
Our Company relies heavily on its 
technology infrastructure. As majority 
of transactions are processed digitally, 
it increases cyber/information security 
risks.
Our 
Company 
has 
a 
strong 
Information and cyber security policy 
wherein cyber risk and its mitigation 
are monitored and updated. The 
IT Strategy Committee and Board 
of Directors review and approve 
any updates in data and customer 
privacy related matters. The Chief 
Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO) 
are responsible for the Company’s 
data and customer privacy and take 
decisions on any related issues. 
Plans for managing data privacy 
matters have been constituted, like 
Cyber Security Emergency Response 
Plan (CSERP), to adapt/mitigate any 
data and customer privacy related 
occurrences. We have increased 
efforts 
to 
update 
employees, 
customers and other stakeholders 
of any potential cyber frauds, data 
privacy, etc. Informative materials on 
data and customer privacy are shared 
via mail, SMS and on social media. We 
have adopted ISO 27001:2013 Risk 
Assessment methodology to identify 
and mitigate security risks.
Negatives
• Reputational risk
• Litigation risk
• Regulatory risk
• Financial risk
• Business loss
Customer 
satisfaction
Opportunity Customer centricity is at the core 
of all our activities and helps serve 
them better. As we fulfill their needs 
and expectations, we build enduring 
relationships with them based on their 
trust in our capabilities.
-
Positives
• Increase in 
repeat customer 
business
• Improvement in 
market share
• Better asset

Regulatory 
compliance
Risk
Compliance to rules and regulations 
helps 
us 
gain 
confidence 
of 
stakeholders and grow responsibly. 
However, any deviations from the 
same can have significant adverse 
consequences for us.
We ensure that there are no delays 
or 
discrepancies 
in 
complying 
with regulations applicable to our 
Company. A dedicated team led by the 
Chief Compliance Officer of qualified 
people has been set up to ensure 
efficient and timely compliance with 
all regulations we need to follow.
Negatives
• Non-transparent 
and poorly 
governed

Digitalization 
Opportunity Our focus is on leveraging the full 
potential of digitalization to drive 
innovation across our offerings, as 
well as our processes. Strategic 
partnerships with fintech companies, 
along with strong in-house digital 
capabilities have allowed us to expand 
customer base significantly and serve 
niche segments efficiently.
-
Positives
• Seamless 
business 
operation at 
lower cost
• Improved turn 
around time
• Competitive 
edge
Responsible 
lending
Risk
While we serve the underbanked 
sections, any inadequate evaluation 
of ESG factors on our part prior to 
loan disbursement, may lead to rise 
in risk of default on the part of such 
borrowers.
Integrating ESG factors into service/
product offerings helps us expand 
market access and reach out to more 
marginalized/vulnerable groups. Greater 
disclosures on ESG aspects may help 
increase access to larger pools of green 
financing.
Negatives
• Lower profits
• Weaker asset 
quality
Community 
development
Opportunity Our Company has a strong CSR 
practice with focus on the areas of 
health, education & environment, 
livelihood and poverty alleviation. 
These programs are designed to care 
for women and youth, make healthcare 
accessible 
to 
the 
marginalized 
sections of the society, contribute to 
the fight against climate change and 
drive holistic development across our 
communities. 
-
Positives
• Long lasting 
positive impact 
across our 
communities
• Enhanced 
reputation and 
brand image
Risk 
management
Risk
Our Company operates in a high-risk 
business involving large amounts of 
data and funds. Any error in compliance, 
and ensuring business sustainability 
can adversely affect our business and 
performance.
Optimizing our risk-return equation 
is possible through responsible risk 
identification 
and 
management 
processes – of both financial and 
non-financial risks. Our Company 
places immense focus on constantly 
strengthening and improving its risk 
management and control systems.
Negatives
• Unstable and 
unpredictable 
business
• Value 
destruction
• Affects business 
continuity
Engagement 
with business 
partners
Risk
We work with several business partners 
in the regular course of our business. 
Any potential negative environment, 
social or governance (ESG) impact 
through their operations could be a risk 
for us.
We are committed to imbibing ESG 
related 
factors 
while 
identifying 
and associated with our business 
partners. This approach will help us 
create sustained value in the long run.
Negatives
• Reputation risk
• Business losses
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity Fostering 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
within our Company not only nurtures 
innovation, creativity and a positive 
work culture but also extends our 
Company’s reach in terms of talent 
acquisition.
-
Positives

In the NBFC sector, there may be 
concerns 
related 
to 
misleading

strategies, 
and 
making false promises to facilitate 
sales.
We ensure that all our marketing 
initiatives and communication is 
in compliance with all applicable 
regulations. It is our constant endeavor 
to ensure high level of transparency 
and clarity in all our marketing 
campaigns and communication.
Negatives
• Reputational 
damage
• Loss of 
customer trust
• Loss of 
business
Customer 
financial 
protection
Opportunity With the rise in digital banking services, 
consumer financial protection plays a 
key role in establishing trust, ensuring 
regulatory compliance, and fostering 
financial inclusion. Effective protection 
measures, 
including 
educating 
customers about financial products 
and risks, ensure customer loyalty.
-
Positives
• Aid customer 
acquisition
• Enhance 
customer trust 
and loyalty
Human 
Rights
Risk
Upholding human rights through the 
promotion of equal opportunities, anti-
discrimination, and the eradication 
of child and forced labor is not just 
a moral imperative but also a legal 
necessity.
We 
ensure 
that 
we 
provide 
a 
culture of equal opportunities, anti-
discrimination within our organization, 
and do not engage with child and/or 
forced labor. Compliance with labor 
laws is paramount, for us at IIFL.
Negatives

Change 
and GHG

Opportunity Mitigating 
climate 
risks 
provides 
opportunities for enhancing efficiency, 
innovation and growth. Our Company 
seeks to reduce carbon footprint in its 
everyday operations. Further, being an 
NBFC, we can play an important role 
in the fight against climate change 
through our products. Our community 
initiatives also involve regular tree 
plantation drives, maintenance 
of 
public gardens and similar initiatives.
-
Positives
• Drives 
better work 
environment
• Widens

raising from 
development 
financial 
institutions
Resource 
management
Risk
Failing to manage resources like water 
and waste properly poses several 
risks for our Company, including legal 
penalties due to non-compliance with 
environmental regulations.
At IIFL, we are committed to reduce 
the environmental footprint of our 
operations.
Our focus lies on achieving resource 
efficiency in terms of energy, water, 
paper and e-waste, since we do 
not 
have 
any 
other 
significant 
environmental impact.
Negatives
• Reputational
