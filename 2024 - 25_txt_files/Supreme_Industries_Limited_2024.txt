Risk 
I Risks: 
• Factors such as 
unsafe working 
condillons, inadequate 
safety measures, 
lack of training, or 
noncompliance with 
safety regulations can 
increase the risk of 
accidents. 
• Excessive workloads, 
long hours, unrealistic 
deadlines, lack of 
work-llfe balance, or 
poor management 
practices can contribute 
to work-related stress, 
leading to mental health 
issues and decreased 
productivity. 
Opportunity Opportunities: 
• Prioritizing employee 
well-being can lead to 
increased productivity, 
efficiency, and overall 
job satisfaction. 
• By promoting employee 
well-being, a supportive 
work environment can 
be created that reduces 
absenteeism and 
turnover rates. 
Opportunity Opportunities: 
• By prioritizing customer 
salisf.:tction, we can 
foster customer loyalty 
and improve customer 
retenrion rates. We 
conduct customer 
satisfaction surveys 
to get the customer 
reedback and valuable 
insights. 
• A reputation for high 
customer salMaction 
can provide a 
competitive advantage 
in the markeL 
• We h.ive implemented 
robust safety policies 
and procedures. e.g., 
We have developed 
an orgamzatlon-w1de 
Health, Safety & 
Environment (HSE) 
policy to ensure a safe 
and healthy working 
environment across 
all plants and offices. 
This policy includes 
dear instructions and 
,;afety protocols for all 
employees and workers 
to follow, preventing 
damage to life and 
propeny. 
• We provide proper 
training to employees 
and conduct regular risk 
assessments, maintaining 
a safe working 
environment, promoting 
a culture of safety. 
Negative:

workplace accidents or 
health-related issues, 
medical expenses can 
Include Immediate 
medical treatment, 
hospitalization costs. 
rehabilitation services, 
and ongoing healthcare 
for injured or affected 
employees. 
• Injured or sick 
employees may require 
Lime off for recovery, 
resulting 111 decreased 
efficien<.y and 
increased workloads 
for other employees. 
This can impact 
overall productivity 
and polenlially lead 
to missed business 
opportunities. 
Positive: 
• Healthy and engaged 
employees tend to 
be more motivated, 
focused, and committed 
to their work. 
• When employees 
feel valued and their 
wellbeing is prioritized, 
they are more likely 
lo remain with the 
company, reducing the 
costs and disruptions 
a,;sodated with high 
~urnover. 
I i-o_sitive: 
• Satisfied customers are 
more likely to continue 
purchasing products from 
the company, reduring 
customer chum, and 
increasing repeat sales. 
• Differentiation with 
competitors and giving 
customers a compelling 
reason lo choose 
our products over 
alternatives. 
• Satisfied customers arc 
more likely lo make 
repeal purchases and 
potentially increase 
their spending with a 
manufadurer. This can 
lead lo higher sales 
volumes and revenue 
growth.

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG -related challenges, targets, and 
achievements 
As the Managing director of Supreme, I am proud to present our latest Business Responsibility Sustainability Report, a testament 
to our unwavering commitment to ESG principles and our readiness to combat dimate change. At Supreme, sustainability is nut 
just a goal, it is our way of doing business. 
We firmly believe that true succe!:5 is dt>fincd by balancing economic prosperity with environmental stewardship and social 
responsibility. We have successfully integrated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our core business 
strategies, resulting in noteworthy advancements in energy efficiency, waste reduction, and community engagement. We have 
committed to a Net Zero - Science Based Target Initiative (SHTI) and submitted the targets for validation. In line with our long-
term commitment to sustainability. We are actively procuring renewable energy, our progress is evident, with 847 Lacs kWh which 
con5lllute 21 .45'6 of energy consumed through renewable sources. Producing eco-friendly, Green-cenified building products 
not only contribute to minimizing our environmental footprint but also position us as a leader in sustainable manufacturing. This 
not only reduces our carbon fOOlprint but also contributes to a more sustainable energy ecosystem. As part of our environmental 
stewardship, we ;ire working to reduce our emissions and water intensity. 
We have prioritized initiatives like training our employees and workers on NGRBC principles, ensuring that sustainability is ingrained 
in our organizational culture. Being in the manufacturing of plastic business, we understand the criticality of conducting Produt't 
Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). We have completed LCAs for our 11 Nos oi products contributing a significant proportion 10 our 
overall revenue and are committed lo analysing the rest of our offerings. This enables U5 to identify areas for impmvernenl dfld 
make informed decisions to minimize our environmental footprint. Recognizing the importance of collaboratlon In achieving 
sustainability goals, we have initiated the ESG Assessment to our VCP Partners through online platform. 
In alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 6, which emphasizes 'dean Water and Sanitation', and Sustainable Development 
Goal 12, which focuses on 'Responsible Production and Consumption', we are actively engaged in a waler conservation drive. 
Our commitment to social responsibility extends beyond our organization. Through Supreme Foundation's CSR activities, we 
have rolled out community development initiatives, enriching the lives of those around us. Supplier sustainability is also a priority, 
and we are developing plans to ensure that our entire supply chain aligns with our sustainability goals.. 
We remain committed lO continuin~ our I?urney toward a more sustainable and resilient future.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details. 
Yes, please flnd below the several GHG emissions reduction initiatives undendken by Supreme: 
al 
We have formulated an Eneri,,y Policy that focuses on procuring advanced energy-efficient equipmenl for our process 
machinery such as injection moulding, extruders, and utility equipment including chillers, compressor~, va~um pump~, 
and water pumps. Our continuous efforts towards energy effidency lmprovemenr have led to a ,educ.tron rn our specific 
energy consumption. We consistently strive lo enhance our energy efficiency performance. 
b) 
We have substituted fossil fuels with PNG/LPG in our manufacturing activities. 
c) 
We closely monitor the energy periormance of our energy-intensive units. Already 16 of our facillties have been certified 
with 150-50001 EnMS (Energy Management System) to monitor energy efficiency. This certification highlights Supreme's 
commitment to implementing effective energy management practices throughout our operations. 
d) 
We have demonstrated a strong commitment to solar energy by significantly expanding our own solar capacity. As of FY 
25, we have scaled up our solar capacity to 35.65 MWp. This means thal we are now able to generate solar power at that 
capacity. However, we have sel a target to further increase our solar capacity to 42 MWp by FY26. This expansion will 
enable us to harness even more renewable solar energy, reducing our carbon footprint and contributing to a more sustainable 
future. 
e) 
We are proactivcly boo,ting the utilization of renewable energy in our units across all plants. We achieved this through the 
implementation of roof-top solar installations and by procuring clean energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) 
for wind and solar projects al various lucations throughout India These efforts enable us to reduce our dependence on 
non-renewable energy sourres and contribute to a more sustainable energy ecosystem. 33.75 kWp captive solar power for 
six locations in Maharashtra started from Feb-2025 which will reduce the annual CHC emission by 38746 tCO2e. 
f) 
Company has signed 2.5 MWp hybrid power supply for two locations in Gujarat which will reduce the CHG emission by 
8578 LCO2e. 
g) 
During FY25, our Chennai Hosur and Erode facilities made significant contributions 10 green energy, accounting for 65%, 
75% and 61% respectively, of their total energy consumption. These figures demonstrate our ongoing progress towards 
achieving our goal or utilizing 100¾ renewable energy across our operations. By prioritizing renewable Pnergy ~ourre~ and 
minimizing our reliance on non-renewable resources, we aim to drive sustainable practices and reduce our environmental 
impacL 
h) 
We have achieved significant success in avoiding emissions. Over the course of FY25, our efforts resulted in a notible 
increase in avoided emission levels. Specifically, we reduced emissions of 61,603 LCO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide 
equivalent) during this period. This marks a significant improvement compared to the previous FY24, where we reduced 
38,476 !CO2 emis.sions. Our commitment to emission reduction and sustainability remains steadfast a~ we continue to 
prioritize measures that contribute to a greener and more environmentally responsible future.

Yes. The staled figures are assured reasonably by the independent agency BSI Group India Private Limited. 
10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
m3n:,gc such w""tcs. 
Al Supreme, we are deeply com milted to responsible and sustainable waste management within our manufacturing operc1tions. 
Our approach focuses on minimizing environment.ii impact and advancing circular economy principles through effective recycling, 
reuse, and resource recovery. 
Recycling plastic waste within our manufacturing unrts is a significant step towards sustainable waste management at Supreme. 
By utilizing grinders and shredders, we can process and reuse plastic waste, reducing the need for new plastic production and 
minimizing the environmental impact associated with plastic disposal. 
In addition to plastic waste, we also prioritize the proper disposal of other types of waste such as e-waste, battery waste, spent 
orl, and scraps. These materials often contain hazardous components that require specialized handling and treatment to prevent 
harm LO the environment and human health. By engaging aulhorized vendors, we ensure Lhal these waste materials are managed 
in compliance wlth relevant regulations and best practices. 
Furthermore, we are committed to effectively managing horticultural waste generated on-site. Through vermi-composting, a 
natural process involving the use of earthworms, we convert horticultural waste into nutrient-rich compost. This compost is then 
utilized to maintain and develop the green areas within our premises, promoting a sustainable and lush environmenL 
Similarly, the sludge produced from our Sewage Treatment Planl (STP) is recycled and repurposed as organic manure. This 
nutrient-rich sludge c:ontributes to the fertilization of our green areas, supporting their healthy growth and maintenance. LastJy, 
we take responsible measures to manage food waste generated from our canteen. By diverting this waste to nearby animal farms, 
we ensure that ii is Utilized as a valuable resource, providing feed for domestic cattle, and reducing the amount of waste sent 
to landfills. 
Through these waste management practices, we strive to minimize our environmental Impact, promote sustainability, and 
contribute lo a circular economy by repurposing waste materials for beneficial reuse.
