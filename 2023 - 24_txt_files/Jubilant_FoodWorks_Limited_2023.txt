Food Safety
Opportunity, 
Risk
Opportunity:
•	 The Company has developed 
sustainable 
systems 
and 
processes for ensuring the 
highest standards of food 
safety 
and 
hygiene 
that 
results in increased consumer 
satisfaction 
and 
helps 
in 
attracting & retaining the 
customers
Risk:
•	 The 
Company 
operations 
involve various stages, from 
sourcing ingredients to food 
preparation 
and 
service, 
where potential food safety 
hazards may arise.
•	 These food safety incidents 
may:
	
-	 Impact the well-being of 
consumers
	
-	 Erode the brand reputation 
leading to loss of consumer 
trust and loyalty
	
-	 Result 
in 
regulatory 
repercussions, 
including 
fines or sanctions
	
-	 Disrupt normal business 
operations, 
causing 
temporary 
closures, 
product recalls or supply 
chain disruptions
•	 Therefore, 
inability 
to 
adhere to prescribed food 
safety 
standards 
or 
any 
contamination 
of 
food 
product poses a significant 
risk to the Company.
To address this risk:
•	 The 
Company 
has 
instituted 
stringent 
quality 
processes, 
standards and parameters that 
adhere to FSSAI norms across 
all sectors, including Restaurants, 
SCCs, 
Warehouses, 
Vendors, 
etc.
•	 Periodic testing of food products 
& regular food safety reviews are 
conducted to ensure sustained 
compliance and effectiveness
•	 The Company is highly committed 
in procuring raw materials from 
suppliers certified under GFSI 
program
•	 Regular training and awareness 
sessions are carried out for 
restaurant and SCC staff on 
adherence to quality norms
•	 The 
Company 
is 
actively 
monitoring and reducing food 
related customer complaints
Positive:
•	 Higher 
sales 
due 
to 
increased brand loyalty & 
customer retention
•	 Cost savings in production, 
transportation and inventory 
management 
due 
to 
reduced waste, optimized 
processes, and enhanced 
supply chain efficiency
Negative:
•	 Product 
recall 
and 
disposal costs
•	 Costs related to finding 
alternative 
suppliers, 
renegotiating 
contracts 
or 
even 
temporary 
production halts
•	 Penalties 
for 
non-
compliance 
with 
food 
safety regulations
•	 Legal fees, settlements 
and damages due to 
lawsuits 
from 
affected 
consumers or regulatory 
bodies

Health, 
Safety & 
Wellbeing
Opportunity, 
Risk
Opportunity:
•	 Safety 
and 
well-being 
of 
its 
employees 
& 
delivery 
associates 
is 
of 
high 
importance to the Company 
and a cornerstone of its 
operational priorities
•	 Ensuring 
a 
secure 
and 
supportive 
workplace 
environment 
fosters 
productivity & loyalty and 
enhances workforce morale
Risk:
•	 Given the nature and scale of 
the business which involves a 
large workforce engaging daily 
in food preparation, delivery 
logistics and interaction with 
diverse urban environments, 
ensuring workforce safety is 
paramount.
•	 Health, safety & wellbeing 
is 
considered 
as 
critical 
because of following reasons:
	
-	 Unsafe working conditions 
and lack of support for 
employee 
well-being 
can lead to low morale & 
productivity, violation of 
employee rights and high 
attrition
	
-	 Employee 
casualty 
can 
be subject to negative 
publicity 
and 
a 
loss 
of 
customer 
trust 
and 
confidence, 
which 
can 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
reputation
	
-	 Poor 
employee 
safety 
and well-being can lead 
to increased health care 
costs and compensation 
claims, which can have a 
significant financial impact 
on the organisation
To 
mitigate 
health 
and 
safety 
risks, several measures have been 
undertaken:
•	 The Company has systematically 
identified potential safety hazards 
at SCCs & restaurants and has 
ensured that adequate safety 
measures are implemented in 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
occupational health & safety 
regulations
•	 Additionally, 
the 
management 
has established a safety review 
process to ensure that employees 
comply with safety measures
•	 All 
reported 
cases 
undergo 
a comprehensive review and 
corrective and preventive actions 
are implemented as necessary
•	 To enhance employee awareness 
and preparedness, regular safety 
training and communications are 
carried out
•	 Each Company location maintains 
a first response plan and details 
of nearby medical facilities for 
emergency cases
•	 The Company ensures that all 
employees 
and 
workers 
are 
covered by insurance policies, 
including medical, accident cover 
etc. to provide financial support in 
case of unforeseen incidents
Positive:
Increased workforce morale, 
satisfaction and retention 
leading to:
•	 Enhanced 
productivity 
& 
improved 
service 
resulting 
in 
better 
customer 
satisfaction 
positively impacting sales 
and profitability
•	 Reduced 
costs 
associated with recruiting, 
training, and on-boarding 
new employees
Negative:
•	 Costs 
associated 
with 
medical 
treatment, 
rehabilitation, 
claims 
management & increased 
insurance premiums
•	 Fines and penalties due 
to non-compliance with 
Occupational Health & 
Safety regulations
•	 Litigation and settlement 
costs

of 
brand 
reputation
•	 Fostering 
trust 
among 
stakeholders
•	 Reinforce

Risk:

environment, 
maintaining 
a steadfast commitment to 
ethical conduct is paramount. 
While 
the 
company 
has 
a strong track record of 
upholding ethical principles, 
it’s essential to remain vigilant 
and proactive in addressing 
emerging ethical challenges.
•	 These ethical challenges can 
impact:
	
-	 Culture of ethical behaviour 
across all levels of the 
organisation
	
-	 Compliance with evolving 
regulatory frameworks
	
-	 Company reputation on 
being associated with any 
perceived ethical lapses
The Company has been practicing 
high standards of good governance 
& ethics by having:
•	 Clear ethical guidelines and code 
of conduct that outline expected 
behaviour for employees and 
vendors
•	 Robust and effective framework 
for 
reporting 
of 
statutory 
compliances and review on a 
periodic basis
•	 Confidential 
Whistle 
blower 
channels for employees to report 
unethical behaviour or concerns 
without fear of retaliation
•	 Regular training sessions and 
educational programs to raise 
awareness about ethical issues
•	 Effective oversight mechanisms, 
such as independent audits, 
compliance 
committees 
and 
Board Committees to monitor 
adherence to ethical guidelines
Positive:
•	 Enhanced collaboration, 
partnerships, 
and 
business 
opportunities 
leading 
to 
improved 
operations, access to new 
markets 
and 
strategic 
alliances that drive growth 
and innovation
Negative:
•	 Costs related to legal 
investigations & lawsuits
•	 Fines, 
penalties, 
and 
increased 
regulatory 
oversight
•	 Impact 
on 
sales 
& 
profitability 
due 
to 
negative publicity

through waste minimization & 
efficient use of resources
•	 Creation of a responsible 
brand 
image 
attracting 
environmental 
conscious 
customers
•	 Increased investor confidence
The Company has established clear 
pathway to address this risk through 
following:
a)	ESG framework:
•	 Review of business processes to 
identify material focus areas and 
to establish objectives & targets
•	 Periodic tracking and review 
of actual achievement against 
targets
Positive:

Dear Stakeholders,
	
Welcome to the Business Responsibility Report of Jubilant FoodWorks Limited (JFL). I am honored to share our Company's 
journey towards sustainability and how it is intricately links and supports to our overall performance.
	
At JFL, sustainability is the foundation of our operations. We firmly believe that by embracing sustainable practices, we not only 
create value for our stakeholders but also drive long-term success for our business.
	
Our commitment to sustainability is evident in everything we do. From implementing awareness programs on human rights 
to introducing innovative solutions like the "No Antibiotic Ever" in Poultry Birds, we prioritize sustainability across all facets of 
our operations. These initiatives not only reflect our values but also contribute to our overall performance by enhancing brand 
reputation, customer loyalty, and employee morale.
	
Furthermore, our dedication to environmental sustainability is reflected in our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint through 
initiatives such as procuring e-bikes for delivery, using renewable power for our Bangalore food tech park, introducing 
environmentally friendly solutions like the lidless pizza box etc.. By embracing sustainable practices, we not only minimize our 
environmental impact but also drive operational efficiency and cost savings, thereby enhancing our bottom line.
	
Additionally, our focus on employee development and well-being is another key aspect of our sustainability strategy. Through 
the successful implementation of our progression plan for store employees, we not only empower our team members to 
grow and thrive but also foster a culture of innovation and excellence, which ultimately translates into improved customer 
experiences and business performance.
	
In conclusion, sustainability is not just a standalone initiative for us; it's deeply integrated into our business strategy and is 
fundamental to our success. By prioritizing sustainability, we not only create value for our stakeholders but also ensure the 
long-term resilience and prosperity of our business.
	
Thank you for your continued support and partnership as we continue our journey towards a more sustainable future.
