Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
	
Aarti Pharmalabs Limited has implemented a comprehensive waste management system that prioritizes environmental 
sustainability and responsible waste disposal practices. APL recognizes the importance of minimizing the environmental 
impact of its operations and ensuring the efficient management of waste generated throughout its processes.
	
APL’s waste management system is designed to adhere to the highest industry standards and regulatory requirements. 
The company follows a systematic approach to identify, segregate, handle, treat, and dispose of waste in a safe and 
environmentally friendly manner. The company aims to minimize waste generation, promote recycling and reuse, and 
properly dispose of the hazardous waste.
	
• 	
During the product design stages, APL has integrated Hazard checklists that strictly adhere to the principles of 
green chemistry. The company’s primary goal is to eliminate the use of toxic chemicals and prioritize a design 
process that minimizes or completely eliminates the generation of hazardous waste. This approach follows a 
hierarchy of controls, where it actively seeks alternative materials and methods, effectively reducing the use of 
harmful substances and minimizing the production of hazardous waste.

• 	
Furthermore, in one of the product chains, APL has developed a specialized process that treats by-products and 
converts them into valuable resources. This innovative approach significantly minimizes the environmental impact 
and contributes to sustainable practices.
	
• 	
To address emissions during the processes, the plants are fully equipped with state-of-the-art scrubber systems, 
which effectively capture any emissions generated and prevent their release into the environment.
	
• 	
In order to manage wastewater responsibly, the company has installed advanced wastewater treatment plants and 
water recovery units that utilize cutting-edge technologies such as reverse osmosis (RO), multiple-effect evaporators 
(MEEs), and agitated thin film dryers (ATFD). These systems enable to recover and reuse water from wastewater 
streams. Recently APL has taken a significant step towards energy conservation by adopting a Mechanical Vapour 
Recompression (MVR) system to treat industrial effluent. For domestic effluent, Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) are 
in place.
	
•	
As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, APL has implemented a zero liquid discharge policy 
across all its units. This means that the firm aims to eliminate the discharge of any liquid waste by effectively 
treating and reusing all water resources within its operations.
