Health and 
Safety
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Isgec 
employs 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
employees 
and 
workers 
across its various offices, 
factories, and construction 
sites. 
Consequently, 
the 
Company places paramount 
importance 
on 
ensuring 
the safety of its employees, 
workers 
and 
contract 
workers. In the event of any 
lapses 
in 
the 
Company’s 
safety-related processes or 
injury and even fatality of 
workers, 
the 
government 
may 
issue 
a 
prohibition 
order, potentially resulting in 
the partial shutdown of the 
manufacturing 
unit 
/sites. 
Safety incidents also have 
detrimental effects on the 
physical and mental health, 
as well as the overall morale 
of the workforce.
Opportunity: 
Isgec 
is 
dedicated to ensuring the 
health and safety of its 
entire workforce, including 
employees 
and 
workers. 
Numerous 
initiatives 
have 
been implemented throughout 
the 
business 
operations, 
encompassing 
both 
Project and Manufacturing 
service lines, to establish a 
resilient health and safety 
management system. The 
ongoing 
efforts 
aim 
to 
cultivate a “Zero Accident 
Culture” across all operations.
Isgec 
has 
a 
steadfast 
commitment 
to 
ensuring 
a 
secure 
and 
healthy 
workplace 
for 
its 
entire 
workforce, 
aspiring 
towards a target of zero 
accidents. 
The 
Company 
has 
instituted 
robust 
processes and systems at 
all its locations and proudly 
holds the certification of ISO 
45001:2018 for Occupational 
Health 
and 
Safety 
Management Systems. 
Isgec 
conducts 
regular 
internal and external audits 
to evaluate the effectiveness 
of its health management 
practices, aiming to establish 
a 
secure 
and 
healthy 
workplace. Additionally, the 
Company performs health 
and safety risk analysis at 
various sites and projects. 
Further, 
at 
a 
regular 
frequency and across the 
Company, Isgec conducts 
multiple 
health 
check-up 
camps and webinars for its 
workforce with Doctors and 
Consultants. 
Negative Implication:
A 
significant 
negative 
financial implication of not 
ensuring compliance with 
health and safety regulations 
is the potential restrictions 
of the manufacturing unit 
following any government 
order. This can lead to 
substantial financial losses 
due to halted production, 
disrupted operations, and 
the associated costs of 
addressing and rectifying 
safety issues. Additionally, 
there 
may 
be 
legal 
penalties and reputational 
damage, further impacting 
the 
Company’s 
financial 
standing. 
In 
the 
event 
of accidents or injuries, 
legal costs and potential 
settlements 
can 
be 
financially burdensome.
Positive Implication:
A healthy and safe workplace 
fosters a positive work 
environment, 
enhancing 
employee 
morale 
and 
engagement. This, in turn, 
can lead to overall improved 
operational efficiency and 
productivity, 
building 
a 
positive 
reputation 
both 
internally and externally.

Emission 
Reduction 
& Emission 
Management
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
The 
Company 
is 
proactively working to meet and 
exceed regulatory standards 
while 
reducing 
its 
carbon 
footprint. 
By 
investing 
in 
emission control technologies, 
Isgec not only demonstrates its 
commitment to sustainability 
but also positions itself as 
a 
leader 
in 
environmental 
responsibility. 
Through 
these efforts, Isgec aims to 
enhance its reputation among 
stakeholders 
who 
prioritize 
eco-friendly practices. Isgec is 
confident in its ability to navigate 
the 
evolving 
environmental 
landscape while maintaining its 
competitiveness and esteemed 
reputation in the market.
Opportunity: 
Isgec 
views 
emission 
reduction 
as 
a 
strategic 
opportunity. 
With 
1,750 kW of solar power already 
generating 20.78 lakh units 
annually worth ₹1.56 crores, the 
Company has further enhanced 
its green energy share by 
installing 1,300 kWp rooftop 
solar at its Yamunanagar and 
Rattangarh units. Through fuel 
switching from diesel to RLNG, 
energy-efficient 
upgrades, 
and adoption of advanced 
boiler technologies, Isgec is 
accelerating its shift toward a 
cleaner, more sustainable future
Isgec 
tackles 
emission 
reduction 
challenges 
through strategic initiatives 
as 
part 
of 
its 
broader 
risk 
mitigation 
approach. 
Alongside its 1,750 kW solar 
power plants, the company 
has 
added 
1,300 
kWp 
rooftop solar installations 
at 
its 
Yamunanagar 
and 
Rattangarh 
units, 
significantly 
boosting 
its 
renewable energy capacity. 
Isgec 
is 
also 
upgrading 
air 
conditioning 
systems, 
switching 
from 
diesel 
to 
RLNG, 
and 
adopting 
advanced boiler technologies 
to enhance energy efficiency. 
Its ISO 14001 certification 
reflects 
a 
strong 
and 
ongoing 
commitment 
to 
environmental responsibility.
With a strong determination 
to 
minimise 
its 
environmental footprint, the 
Company remains steadfast 
in its pursuit of continuous 
improvement.
Positive Implication:
Embracing 
emission 
reduction 
measures 
fosters 
innovation 
and 
collaboration, making Isgec 
an appealing partner for 
investors and stakeholders 
aligned with sustainability 
goals. Isgec’s commitment 
to 
emission 
reduction 
represents 
a 
strategic 
investment 
in 
long-term 
resilience, competitiveness, 
and 
environmental 
stewardship.
Negative Implication:
Implementing 
necessary 
emission control measures 
demands 
upfront 
investments in technology 
and infrastructure, exerting 
pressure on the Company’s 
financial 
reserves 
and 
limiting its ability to allocate 
resources 
elsewhere. 
Operational 
costs 
are 
incurred, including ongoing 
maintenance 
and 
staff 
training are also required.
4
Supply Chain 
Management
Opportunity
Isgec’s 
large 
and 
diverse 
supplier base makes supply 
chain sustainability a critical 
issue – both as a risk and 
strategic opportunity. Risks 
include non-compliance with 
labour laws, human rights 
violations, 
environmental 
damage 
and 
ethical 
misconduct 
by 
suppliers, 
which can lead to reputational 
harm, 
project 
delays 
and

On 
the 
opportunity 
side, 
promoting a sustainable and 
resilient supply chain enables 
Isgec 
to 
collaborate 
with 
suppliers 
and 
contractors 
for its own as well suppliers’ 
capabilities, improve efficiency 
and 
drive 
innovation 
and 
enhance vendor performance. 
Sustainable supply chain also 
supports customer trust.
Prior 
to 
onboarding 
any 
suppliers, 
the 
Company 
conducts 
thorough 
assessments 
of 
potential 
suppliers or vendors. This 
evaluation ensures that there 
are no associated risks with 
the 
prospective 
suppliers, 
particularly in terms of financial 
and legal compliances, as well 
as adherence to robust health 
and safety measures.

Data 
Security and 
Privacy
Risk
Isgec confronts the substantial 
risk of data security and 
privacy, given the rising tide 
of cyber threats. An array of 
predatory entities, including 
hackers 
and 
cybercriminal 
syndicates, 
persistently 
endeavours to breach any 
Company’s digital defences, 
seeking unauthorised access 
to 
its 
confidential 
data 
repositories. These incursions 
are 
not 
haphazard 
but 
calculated efforts driven by 
motives ranging from financial 
gain to industrial deception 
and outright sabotage. As 
Isgec manoeuvres through 
the 
digital 
landscape, 
safeguarding 
its 
sensitive 
information 
becomes 
essential to shield against the 
ever-present threats posed 
by 
malicious 
individuals 
operating online.
Recognising 
the 
critical 
importance of data security, 
Isgec has taken proactive 
measures 
to 
fortify 
its 
defences. The Company has 
a data security policy which is 
in line with ITGC (Information 
Technology General Controls) 
and ensures data security 
and 
controlled 
access. 
Through collaborative efforts 
with external experts, the 
Company has implemented 
robust measures such as 
firewall 
setups, 
advanced 
software solutions, and strict 
authentication 
protocols. 
However, 
there 
remains 
ample scope for improvement 
in continually refining and 
updating 
these 
measures 
to address emerging cyber 
threats effectively. 
Negative Implication:
In the network of data 
security and privacy, the 
financial toll of risks is 
substantial. 
Remediation 
costs, legal battles, and 
regulatory fines can drain 
resources 
and 
strain 
budgets. 
Operational 
disruptions 
hamper 
productivity 
and 
stifle 
growth. 
Meanwhile, 
reputational 
damage 
erodes trust and investor 
confidence.

Human 
Rights, 
Diversity and 
Inclusion
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Risk: Possible occurrences 
of 
breaches 
in 
human 
rights or failure to adhere to 
legal standards may result 
in 
negative 
financial 
and 
reputational consequences.
Opportunity: 
Isgec 
holds 
the belief that championing 
human rights and promoting 
equity, diversity, and inclusion 
fortifies 
the 
Company’s 
business. 
A 
workforce 
characterised by diversity and 
inclusivity has the potential 
to enhance performance and 
innovation. Upholding human 
rights allows the Company 
to 
nurture 
shared 
values 
and 
maintain 
a 
positive 
workplace. This commitment 
contributes to the creation of 
a more equitable world and, 
at the same time, strengthens 
the business.
The 
Company 
prioritises 
safeguarding 
the 
human 
rights of its employees and 
workers. This commitment 
is evident in various policies, 
including 
the 
Human 
Resource 
(HR) 
policy, 
which 
explicitly 
states 
that 
no 
individual 
shall 
face discrimination by the 
Company or their peers. In 
addition, the Company is 
dedicated to being an equal 
opportunity employer and 
has a standalone Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment at 
Workplace (POSH) policy.
Through the implementation 
of human rights due diligence 
processes, engaging with 
suppliers and stakeholders 
on human rights issues, and 
promoting awareness and 
training among employees, 
the Company actively fosters 
a commitment to human 
rights. This comprehensive 
approach underscores the 
Company’s commitment to 
fostering a safe, respectful, 
and 
inclusive 
work 
environment.
Negative Implication:
Discrimination or human 
rights 
violations 
can 
lead 
to 
legal 
actions, 
investigations, and fines, 
resulting 
in 
significant 
financial liabilities for the 
Company. This can cause 
reputation damage, talent 
drain and even potential 
customer 
boycotts, 
negatively impacting sales 
and revenue.
Positive Implication:
Companies that prioritise 
human rights and create 
an inclusive environment 
are more likely to attract 
and retain better talent. 
This reduces recruitment 
and 
training 
costs 
and 
contributes 
to 
higher 
employee 
morale 
and 
productivity.

Waste 
Management
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Amidst 
tightening 
environmental regulations and 
heightened public awareness 
of 
waste 
disposal, 
Isgec 
faces a critical imperative: to 
uphold exemplary practices 
and secure public trust. In 
this pivotal moment, Isgec 
must rise to the challenge, 
navigating the complexities 
of waste management, to 
solidify 
its 
reputation 
as 
a 
responsible 
corporate 
citizen in an environmentally 
conscious world.
Opportunity: 
Waste 
management 
presents 
a 
prime opportunity for Isgec 
to showcase its commitment 
to sustainability. By adhering 
to 
the 
3-R 
principle 
and 
minimising 
plastic 
usage, 
Isgec 
underscores 
its 
dedication to curbing waste 
generation. 
Additionally, 
its 
proactive approach to e-waste 
management 
and 
water 
conservation further solidifies 
its reputation as a leader in 
sustainable business practices. 
While Isgec has made strides 
in waste management, the 
Company remains open to 
adopting new technologies for 
further waste minimisation, 
demonstrating its commitment 
to continuous improvement in 
environmental stewardship.
The Company has been 
actively working to reduce 
waste generated from its 
operations. Additionally, the 
Company has implemented 
initiatives 
to 
repurpose 
scrap materials within its 
operations, ensuring that 
valuable resources are not 
wasted. Furthermore, Isgec 
has invested in an Effluent 
Treatment Plant and Sewage 
Treatment Plant to manage 
liquid waste efficiently. This 
plant plays a crucial role 
in treating and recycling 
liquid 
waste, 
minimising 
environmental impact and 
promoting 
sustainability 
across its operations.
Positive Implication:
Efficient 
waste 
management 
presents 
financial opportunities for 
Isgec. By reducing waste 
and recycling, the Company 
cuts disposal costs and 
saves 
on 
raw 
material 
expenses by reusing scrap 
materials.
These practices enhance 
Isgec’s reputation, attracting 
environmentally conscious 
customers and investors 
while mitigating regulatory 
risks.
Negative Implication:
Inadequate 
waste 
management 
poses 
substantial financial risks 
for Isgec. Failure to comply 
with regulations may lead 
to significant fines, while 
inefficient 
processes 
inflate operational costs, 
diminishing profit margins. 
Poor practices can also 
damage 
the 
Company’s 
reputation, eroding investor 
confidence and potentially 
lowering market value.

commitment to judicious water 
usage aligns with emerging 
global trends and regulatory 
expectations. 
Implementing 
robust 
water 
management 
practices positions Isgec to 
mitigate 
operational 
risks 
associated with water scarcity 
and contamination, ensuring 
continuity 
and 
resilience. 
The Company actively takes 
measures to decrease overall 
water consumption in all its 
operations

Positive Implication:
Isgec’s strategic focus on 
water management also 
translates 
into 
tangible 
financial 
benefits. 
By 
actively 
reducing 
overall 
water 
consumption 
and 
implementing initiatives to 
enhance water recyclability, 
the Company can achieve 
operational cost savings. 
Additionally, the adoption of 
water-efficient technologies 
and 
practices 
not 
only 
aligns with environmental 
stewardship 
but 
also 
positions 
Isgec 
as 
an 
innovative industry leader. 
This, in turn, creates a 
competitive 
advantage, 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious customers and 
investors while contributing 
to the Company’s long-term 
viability and profitability.

Economic 
Performance 
and Market 
Share
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Operating 
in 
the 
engineering 
sector, 
Isgec 
is susceptible to economic 
fluctuations, 
rendering 
it 
vulnerable 
to 
downturns 
and 
market 
uncertainties. 
Economic 
downturns 
can 
negatively 
influence 
the 
demand for the products and 
services.
Intense competition requires 
constant 
innovation 
and 
adaptation 
to 
changing 
market dynamics. The risk 
is heightened in the context 
of emerging and disruptive 
technologies 
and 
evolving 
customer preferences. 
A 
proactive 
approach 
to 
market intelligence, product 
development, and strategic 
partnerships 
becomes 
essential to not only protect 
but also enhance Isgec’s 
market share.
Opportunity: 
Economic 
performance 
and 
market 
share 
serve 
as 
strategic 
opportunities 
for 
Isgec. 
In 
favourable 
economic 
conditions, 
the 
Company 
can 
maximise 
revenue 
and profitability, using the 
financial strength to invest in 
innovation and sustainability. 
Simultaneously, an increased 
market 
share 
positions 
Isgec as an industry leader, 
providing 
economies 
of 
scale, enhanced operational 
efficiency, 
and 
greater 
negotiating power.
Isgec 
maintains 
a 
commitment 
to 
strengthening relationships 
with its stakeholders while 
focusing 
on 
enhancing 
the 
quality, 
technology, 
and competitiveness of its 
products. Isgec has curated a 
diverse portfolio comprising 
manufacture 
of 
heavy 
capital 
goods 
machinery 
and equipment. Isgec also 
has extensive capabilities in 
executing industrial projects 
on Turnkey basis across 
chosen product lines. The 
Company holds a prominent 
position, ranking either as the 
top or second in the Indian 
market in its product lines.
Isgec’s 
strategic 
approach 
includes establishing technical 
tie-ups 
(collaboration 
and 
joint venture) with reputable 
companies, 
particularly 
in 
specialised fields such as Air 
Pollution 
Control, 
Process 
Plant Equipment, Boilers, and 
Presses. These collaborations 
empower Isgec to provide 
optimal technical solutions 
and high-quality products to 
customers both within India 
and internationally.
Negative Implication:
Economic downturns and 
a decrease in market share 
may 
lead 
to 
increased 
competition and can limit 
the Company’s ability to 
invest 
in 
research 
and 
development, 
hindering 
long-term growth. Financial 
challenges may lead to 
cost-cutting 
measures, 
potentially 
resulting 
in 
layoffs or reduced employee 
benefits, 
impacting 
workforce 
morale 
and 
productivity.
Positive Implication:
A 
larger 
market 
share 
and 
robust 
economic 
performance 
often 
contribute 
to 
improved 
pricing power, expansion 
opportunities, 
stakeholder 
confidence 
and 
overall 
enhanced profitability for 
the Company.

Yes. 
The Company recognizes that addressing grievances in a timely and effective manner is

grievances they may have. The team leader will then take the necessary steps to address 
the issue. If the complainant is not satisfied with the response or action taken, they have the 
option to escalate the matter to the Human Resource Head for further review.
In addition to this grievance redressal mechanism, the Company has established various 
committees to uphold employee welfare and workplace efficiency. These include the 
Grievance Redressal Committee, which oversees fair and transparent resolution of concerns, 
as well as specialized committees such as the Central Safety Committee, Works Committee, 
and Canteen Committee. Each of these committees plays a crucial role in maintaining a 
safe, inclusive, and supportive work environment, reinforcing the Company’s commitment to

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, Isgec has undertaken several initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across its operations:
	
I.	
Energy Efficiency Improvements: Isgec has achieved electricity savings of approximately 337,492 kWh through various 
energy conservation measures. 
	
II.	
Renewable Energy Adoption: A total of 1,300 kWp rooftop solar capacity was installed at Yamunanagar and Rattangarh units 
during the year, supplementing the existing 1,750 kWp. In FY 2024-25, these systems collectively generated 81,39,533 units 
of green energy.
	
III.	
During this year, Isgec signed an agreement with M/s Fourth Partner Solar Power Private Limited for the supply of solar 
power under a Group Captive Power Arrangement. The agreement includes a 5 MW connection, through which 72 lakh units 
if electricity will be supplied annually. This will meet approximately 50% of the total power consumption of Isgec Steel Casting 
plant located in Muzaffarnagar.
	
IV.	
Low-Carbon Power Procurement: The Company established a power linkage with the  Saraswati Sugar Mills ethanol-based 
power plant, using 1,485,789 units of ethanol-derived electricity in FY 2025. This initiative not only reduces dependence on 
fossil fuels but also contributes to earning carbon credits in the long run.
	
V.	
Circular Economy Practices: Approximately 85 LED lights were recovered and reused after minor repairs, and around 17 MT 
of scrap steel was repurposed to construct 750 m² of shopfloor area in the main store, resulting in savings of INR 12 lakhs.
	
VI.	
Fuel Switching: While the Yamunanagar plant was already operating on Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG), the 
Rattangarh unit transitioned all its furnaces from diesel to RLNG in the past year. Additionally, the Muzaffarnagar unit 
has received a new LNG connection, and all furnaces are scheduled to switch to LNG this year, significantly reducing 
Scope 1 emissions.
	
VII.	 Boiler technology initiatives:
 
 
Isgec manufactures Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC) Boilers up to 150 MWe under a technology licensing 
agreement with Sumitomo SHI FW Energia Oy, Finland, enabling the use of biomass and waste fuels.
 
 
The Company also utilizes reheat design for CFBC Boilers up to 100 MW, licensed from Sumitomo, which improves 
thermal efficiency and lowers GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated.
 
 
Through a collaboration with BHI FW Korea, Isgec offers super-critical and sub-critical pulverized coal-fired boilers (60 
MWe to 1000 MWe), which operate at higher efficiencies and reduce CO₂ emissions compared to conventional systems.
 
 
Under a technology agreement with Amec Foster Wheeler Energia S.L.U, Spain, Isgec supplies high-efficiency oil & gas 
packaged boilers (up to 260 TPH), designed to optimize combustion and reduce fuel-related emissions.
 
 
In partnership with Siemens Heat Transfer Technology b.v, Netherlands, Isgec provides Drum-type Heat Recovery 
Steam Generators (HRSGs) that recover waste heat from gas turbines, reducing the need for additional fuel combustion 
and associated GHG emissions.
 
 
On a case-to-case basis, Isgec collaborates with Tenova, Italy to supply Waste Heat Recovery Boilers for submerged 
arc, electric arc, and reheat furnaces, enabling energy recovery from industrial processes and reducing fossil fuel use.
