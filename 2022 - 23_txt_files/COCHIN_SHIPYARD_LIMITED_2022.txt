Presently, governments across the globe are looking at the corporates for implementing sustainable development models. India, 
under the able leadership of the Honourable Prime Minister has set an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2070. 
CSL being a Central PSU under the administrative control of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, is committed to play 
its part in achieving the target set by the Honourable Prime Minister. Towards this, CSL has already initiated several initiatives 
to curb marine pollution. Continuing with the green initiatives, CSL is building 23 Hybrid Electric Catamaran Hull Vessels for the 
Kochi Water Metro Project, which is one of its kind, modern, technologically advanced, energy efficient and environment friendly 
boat and is expected to integrate the urban water transport system for the seamless transportation requirements of the Kochi 
citizenry. CSL’s commitment to green initiatives may also be seen from the execution of order of two Autonomous Electric 
Vessels for ASKO Maritime AS, Norway. Further CSL is also building 2 Commissioning Service Operation Vessels for Pelagic Group, 
Cyprus and 2 Zero Emission Feeder Container Vessels for SAMSKIP Group, Norway. Further, the Company is also in the process 
of development of Hydrogen Fuel Cell vessels. Also, CSL in collaboration with indigenous partners and under the aegis of the 
Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways is implementing a pilot project for design, development and construction of Hydrogen 
Fuel Cell Vessel based on Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Technology (LT-PEM) also called Fuel Cell Electric Vessel 
(FCEV), which is a step towards greener tomorrow. Taking into consideration the growing impetus on hydrogen economy and 
hydrogen-based fuel cell technology both nationally and internationally, it is only prudent to explore its use case in the marine 
segment, especially in India, where there is vast possibility for its use on coastal & inland vessels.

The Company’s major initiative in the conservation of energy was installation of solar panels on the rooftop of various buildings 
inside CSL premises. The programme commenced in the year 2013-14. As of March 31, 2023, solar power plant having capacity of 
1622 kWp has been commissioned in CSL. Further, during the financial year 2022-23, CSL commissioned 600KVA, 750 Amps state-
of-the-art energy efficient static frequency converter. With this addition, CSL can now provide pure sine wave power to all its docks 
and quays. This along with CSL’s 1.6MWp PV solar power enables CSL to supply clean energy to 60 Hz category ships. The Company 
is also spearheading the building of battery operated zero emission vessels and development of Hydrogen Fuel Cell vessels, the 
details of which are more specifically given in the Directors’ Report.
