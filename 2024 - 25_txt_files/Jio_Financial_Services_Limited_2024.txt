Financial 
Inclusion

Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
JFSL 
recognises 
the 
evolving 
cybersecurity landscape and prioritises 
strong defences to protect data and 
mitigate cyberattacks. These threats 
can lead to significant financial, legal 
and reputational risks, undermining 
stakeholder trust and resulting in 
penalties for non-compliance with data 
protection regulations. As a responsible 
financial services provider, JFSL is 
enabling enhanced inclusivity, access 
and overall customer experience.
JFSL prioritises data security as a 
cornerstone of trust and compliance. It 
implements industry-leading safeguards 
to 
protect 
sensitive 
information, 
minimising 
legal 
and 
reputational 
risks associated with data breaches. 
JFSL’s unwavering commitment to data 
protection regulations and transparency 
fosters an environment where its 
stakeholders can trust the Company 
with their financial information.
Negative
Opportunity
JFSL is dedicated to safeguarding 
data and maximising its value through

JFSL prioritises adherence to evolving 
regulations, 
ensuring 
robust 
data 
governance and proactive compliance. 
By exceeding legal and regulatory 
requirements, JFSL builds trust among 
stakeholders and mitigates compliance 
risks. This comprehensive approach 
not only ensures a secure environment 
but also facilitates responsible data 
utilisation, unlocking its full potential. 
JFSL’s focus on advanced security 
measures and regulatory compliance 
underscores 
its 
commitment 
to 
maintaining high standards, building 
stakeholder confidence and promoting

Governance 
and 
Transparency
Risk
JFSL 
views 
strong 
corporate 
governance as essential for sustainable 
success, beyond regulatory obligations. 
Robust 
governance 
prevents 
fraud, mismanagement and missed 
opportunities, 
which 
can 
cause 
financial losses and erode shareholder 
confidence. 
Companies 
with 
weak 
governance 
are 
more 
vulnerable, 
hindering growth. Failing to meet ethical 
standards may lead to legal issues and 
damage 
reputations, 
compromising 
stakeholder 
trust. 
Prioritising 
governance 
strengthens 
resilience 
and supports long-term growth and 
stakeholder relationships.
JFSL prioritises a robust governance 
framework with clearly defined roles, 
responsibilities 
and 
reporting 
lines 
for all stakeholders, including Board 
members, Management and employees. 
Dedicated committees specialising in 
audit, risk management and ethics foster 
a culture of compliance and proactive 
risk mitigation. Regular assessments 
ensure continuous improvement and 
alignment with evolving regulations and 
industry best practices.
Additionally, 
comprehensive 
training 
programmes, 
clear 
communication 
and consistent policy enforcement 
cultivate 
an 
environment 
where 
ethical behaviour is deeply ingrained. 
Robust 
internal 
controls 
further 
safeguard 
against 
potential 
fraud, 
mismanagement 
and 
irregularities. 
Proactive risk identification, assessment 
and mitigation strategies guarantee the 
long-term success and sustainability of 
JFSL’s operations.
Negative
Opportunity
JFSL emphasises robust corporate 
governance and transparency as key 
drivers of trust and sustainable success. 
By adhering to strict governance 
standards, 
JFSL 
boosts 
investor 
confidence, ensuring steady access 
to capital and financial stability. The 
company values clear communication 
and proactive stakeholder engagement, 
which 
builds 
trust 
and 
enhances 
brand reputation. JFSL’s commitment 
to ethical leadership and responsible 
decision-making builds a culture that 
attracts and retains top talent, aligning 
the workforce with the company’s 
values. This strategic focus empowers 
JFSL to achieve its long-term goals.

Climate Change
Risk
JFSL 
acknowledges 
that 
climate 
change presents significant threats to 
its assets and operations, including 
physical 
damage 
from 
extreme 
weather and transition challenges like 
regulatory shifts and technological 
disruptions. These risks can lead to 
considerable losses and potential legal 
penalties, jeopardising market standing. 
Meeting climate expectations is vital 
for maintaining the confidence of its 
stakeholders. 
JFSL 
prioritises 
identifying 
assets 
vulnerable to extreme weather (e.g., 
floods, droughts, wildfires) and invests 
in infrastructure resilience, relocation 
and natural flood defences. Ensuring 
operations continue after such events, 
staying 
informed 
about 
climate 
regulations and adopting renewable 
energy 
and 
sustainable 
practices 
are key to long-term resilience and 
environmental responsibility. Tracking 
progress 
on 
emissions 
reduction 
and collaborating with policymakers, 
investors and customers for climate-
friendly solutions is crucial. Proactive 
communication of climate risks and 
mitigation strategies to stakeholders is 
a priority

10. Health and safety management system:
a.	 Whether an Occupational Health and Safety Management System has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/No). If yes, 
what is the coverage of such a system?
Yes, JFSL is committed to health and safety management as a fundamental aspect of its operations, with an Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) Management System supported by our OHS Policy held at https://www.jfs.in/docs/cms/assets/jfs/investor-
relations/policy-documents/occupation-health-and-safety-policy.pdf. We establish safety guidelines within the office, 
conduct regular fire safety drills, provide ambulance accessibility and ensure a doctor is available on-site for medical assistance. 
To further promote employee well-being, JFSL offers various leaves, including privileged leaves for new joiners during their probation 
period. Additionally, on World Health Day, we conducted blood pressure checks to raise awareness about hypertension. Regular 
cleanliness drives are also conducted to ensure a hygienic workplace. Our crèche facility supports employees with young children, 
enhancing work-life balance. 
We conducted influenza vaccination drives, organised healthcare camps and utilised innovative HR bots for streamlined processes. 
On International Women’s Day, we arranged special health check-ups and doctor visits for female employees. These initiatives 
reflect our commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. For further details, the OHS Policy can 
be accessed at: https://www.jfs.in/docs/cms/assets/jfs/investor-relations/policy-documents/occupation-health-and-

b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
To identify work-related hazards and assess risks, JFSL implements several processes on both routine and non-routine bases. 
This includes encouraging all employees to undergo annual health check-ups, with the costs covered by JFSL. Additionally, we 
conduct evacuation drive assessments and utilise a checklist for safety mapping to ensure comprehensive safety evaluations. These 
measures help in maintaining a safe working environment and proactively managing potential risks.
c.	 Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks.
To uphold a safe work environment, JFSL implements a comprehensive communication framework for addressing workplace health 
and safety (WHS) concerns. When an issue arises, targeted meetings are convened, during which affected employees receive 
detailed information, proposed solutions and justifications. 
This process allows employees the necessary time to absorb the information and provide constructive feedback to key personnel. 
Management carefully considers all contributions and ensures that employees are kept informed about final decisions and the 
rationale behind them. To maintain transparency and accountability, a record of all resolved WHS issues is meticulously maintained 
and reported to senior leadership on a quarterly basis. These essential procedures are enshrined in the Occupational Health and 
Safety (OHS) Policy adopted by the Company.
d.	 Do the employees/workers of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Yes, JFSL focuses on employee well-being and safety by ensuring that 100% of its workforce is insured through group term life, 
health and accident insurance plans, all accessible via the HRMS portal. Additionally, JFSL offers comprehensive healthcare services, 
including annual health check-ups and on-site medical assistance during working hours, supplemented by a health insurance policy 
that supports employees with health-related needs beyond the workplace.

governance mechanisms in place.
•	 Conducted substantive testing on a sample basis to verify the accuracy and reliability of the Identified Sustainability Information.

data/information.
