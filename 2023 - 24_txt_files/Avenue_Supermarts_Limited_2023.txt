*ASL as an organisation is conscious about all grievances/complaints received from its stakeholders. Our Business 
Responsibility Manual and Vigil Mechanism/Whistle-Blower Policy provide a robust framework for dealing with concerns 
and grievances raised by any stakeholder. We have also engaged a reputed third party which runs an independent 
Ethics Helpline (Web based complaints, toll-free telephone number, email and post complaints can be logged by all 
employees).
	
	
	
Each of our stakeholders has an option to register any grievance/complaint through the feedback section of our website. 
In addition, they can also register their grievance/complaint through a central helpline number, email and post. Customers 
have a further option of raising grievances/complaints through a Digital Kiosk at our stores as well as a Register at our 
stores. Through a formal mechanism we address each grievance/complaint. Due care is taken to maintain complete 
confidentiality of all grievances/complaints received. Our Senior Management Team is directly involved in all critical 
issues. They also periodically review feedback and suggest corrective actions in our internal processes, where required.

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk 
along with its financial implications, as per the following format:

risk, approach

Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative
implications)
1
Talent 
Management
Opportunity 
and Risk
Talent attraction: 
Retail being a service industry attracts 
talent naturally due to comfortable 
working environment, local recruitment 
opportunities and competitive wages. At 
the same time, the industry also requires a 
significant amount of hard work and rigour.
Diversity and Inclusion: 
We attract a high share of women 
employees vis-à-vis other industries 
through our geographical spread of 
stores. Safe and comfortable working 
environment along with less commute to 
work are the key factors.
Local Community Development: 
Retail offers local communities good entry-
level jobs at competitive wages which 
allows community members to acquire 
skills and an opportunity to advance 
to higher wages and better careers, 
especially in smaller towns.
Learning and Development (L&D): 
Our strong emphasis on L&D leads to 
enhanced career opportunities and helps 
us build employee loyalty.
Employee Voice and Engagement: 
Our corporate culture emphasises 
all employees to raise any concerns/
feedback directly with the Management. 
An independent Ethics Helpline is also 
available.
-
The inherent advantages 
of the industry ensure 
continuous availability of 
talent at junior to mid-level 
positions. However, at times 
there are challenges in hiring 
industry appropriate senior 
leadership positions.
Diversity and inclusion 
enables equitable 
development, improved 
performance and retention of 
our culture & values.
Local community 
development augurs well 
for the reputation and brand 
image of our organisation.
A strong L&D programme 
enables us to internally fill a 
significant portion of mid-level 
positions through promotions 
and internal job postings.
Employee voice allows for 
actionable insights and better 
decision-making based on 
employee feedback.

Customer 
Experience
Opportunity 
and Risk
Value Retailing:
Our business model is based on the 
concept of offering value retailing to 
our customers using the Every Day 
Low Cost/Every Day Low Price (EDLC/
EDLP) strategy. The EDLC/EDLP 
strategy is based on offering low prices 
on an everyday basis by achieving low 
procurement and operations cost rather 
than as special promotion limited to 
certain products or to a particular day, 
week or any other specific period in the 
year. However, competitive intensity in the 
country can adversely affect our strategy 
as more players adopt similar business 
models through their operations.
Optimal Product Assortment:
We sell a wide range of goods and 
merchandise across our product 
categories. We have an extensive network 
of suppliers and we endeavour to source 
our products from regions where they are 
widely available or manufactured. We also 
consciously focus on local assortment in 
each area.
Customer Feedback:
Our store personnel interact with 
customers frequently to understand 
their experience and take feedback 
on our services. We also encourage 
our customers to share their valuable 
feedback with us and have made available 
several channels which they can use to 
reach us.
-
Our EDLC/EDLP model 
ensures that customers 
always get good quality 
products at great prices 
throughout the year. This 
ensures customer loyalty and 
repeat purchases.
Competitive intensity from 
existing retailers (including 
E-retailers) and prospective 
entrants and consequent 
pricing pressures may impact 
our business, financial 
condition and results of 
operations.
Our extensive assortment 
ensures that customers are 
provided quality products.
Procurement of products 
from closer to our distribution 
centers/stores allows us to 
reduce costs. Further, our 
focus on local assortment 
enables development of local 
vendors in each area.
Continuous feedback from 
customers enables us to 
improve our service quality 
and enhances customer 
satisfaction.

Climate Change Opportunity 
and Risk
Extreme Weather Events: Rising 
temperatures and changes in weather 
patterns could impact and disrupt our 
business operations.
Value Chain Impact: Climate change 
could also potentially impact the business 
operations of our supply chain and 
sourcing partners leading to product 
unavailability and increase of products and 
services cost.
Resource Availability:
There could be challenges in availability 
of resources including water which could 
impact our business and those of our 
value chain partners.
Climate Regulations: Increasing shift 
towards a low-carbon economy could 
trigger several changes in Climate 
Regulations potentially leading to higher 
cost of compliance and new ways of 
conducting business.
Value Retail 
as an industry 
is significantly 
less resource 
intensive. Our 
efficient cost and 
agile operations 
allow us to adapt/
change multiple 
levers of cost, 
risk and business 
opportunities in 
the context of 
adverse effects of 
climate change.
Considering 
the overall 
development 
of the country, 
the emission 
per person and 
the nature of 
our business 
model, we have 
developed a 
matrix for our go 
to market strategy 
to address risks 
from climate 
change. This 
has helped us 
to integrate and 
deploy several 
best practices 
that help in 
areas of energy 
conservation, 
water 
conservation, use 
of sustainable 
building materials, 
recycling/reuse 
of materials and 
transportation 
efficiency.
Climate Change may result 
in lower sales, lesser profits 
and/or increased investments 
in the short to medium-term. 
However, the operating 
efficiencies of our business 
allow for limited impact 
compared to other formats of 
retail/similar industries.
Further, any potential change 
in Climate related regulations 
may lead to higher cost of 
compliance.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and

We are deeply committed to achieving our ESG related objectives. Our focus is best reflected through our core values of Action, 
Care and Truth which are a guiding light for all our activities. We continue to strengthen our approach to sustainability through 
various means that would have a meaningful long-term positive impact to our Company, its employees, the environment and 
all other stakeholders. Considering the overall development of the country, the emission per person and the nature of our 
business model, we have developed a matrix for our go to market strategy on sustainability. It is an approach that is practical and 
appropriate. It is not aggressive or path breaking; however, it is contextual to deliver incremental results over a long period of time.
	
Retail needs a lot of hard work from our employees and partners, precision systems and a competent workforce. Hence our focus 
on recruiting locals in every location and then upskilling them and grooming them to become leaders of tomorrow is very intrinsic 
to our model of efficient operation and long-term competitive advantage. Our endeavour is also to nurture local products and local 
businesses so that they too can compete with minimal costs to launch their products.
	
We believe that as a Company we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to make meaningful contributions to the lives of 
beneficiaries through our structured interventions. The key objective of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme is 
to foster better quality of life and create equal opportunities for supporting the economically and socially disadvantaged in our 
country.

Awareness programmes conducted for value chain partners on any of the Principles during the financial year: 
	
We regularly interact with our vendors to facilitate discussions on conducting business in an ethical, transparent and fair manner. 
Further, we also encourage our large vendors to focus on products that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable. 
We have introduced several articles for our customers that are made from recycled plastic/ fabric/ yarn. Some of the product 
categories where such articles are introduced: planters & plates, shopping bags, pillows, bath towels, dusters, floor mats and 
casual t-shirts. We constantly share with them industry best practices that enable them to suitably adopt policies and procedures, 
which lead to better overall governance, reduced environmental impact and social equity. The Company’s principle nature of 
business is to procure everyday use products from reputed brands/manufacturers and provide the same to end consumers. A 
significant number of these companies have their own programmes to improve on all sustainability initiatives through their products, 
processes and policies.
2.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid / manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes / No). If yes, 
provide details of the same.
	
Our Code of Conduct for the Board Members clarifies that Directors and Senior Management personnel shall not engage in any 
business, relationship or activity, which may be in conflict with the interests of the Company. Any incident of conflict, about a Board 
Member’s or senior management personnel’s actual or potential conflict of interest with the Company should be brought promptly 
to the attention of the Chairman of the Board, who will review the case and determine a proper course of action. Further, our policy 
mandates that Directors or senior management personnel who may be involved in any conflict or potential conflict situation shall 
exclude themselves from any discussion or decision in relation thereto. If any related party transaction is unavoidable, it must be 
fully disclosed to the board of the Company.

B.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs was sourced sustainably?
	
The Company has a structured procedure which is followed before collaborating with any business partners/ associates. Our team 
visits their facilities to assess and evaluate them on health and safety parameters.
	
Further, the Company is aiming to reduce its fuel consumption in transportation by operating through common distribution centres 
in vicinity of our store locations, wherever feasible. This minimises the distance to transport goods to our stores and helps us 
consolidate multiple trips by individual suppliers to our various stores, thus reducing fuel consumption. For details please refer to 
our Section on Environment at DMart on page 12 of this Annual Report.
	
With a view to empower our customers, we continued our interactions with our large suppliers to introduce products that reuse 
materials thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint. To this end we have taken small steps and introduced some articles which 
use recycled materials in a few large categories. Our endeavor is to further partner with our vendors and make available products 
which are economically viable and environmentally sustainable.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics 
(including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company’s principle nature of business is to provide everyday use products to end consumers. However, one of our subsidiary 
Company procures, processes and repacks certain products which are provided to end consumers through our stores. Owing 
to the nature of our business we generate very limited amount of waste. The plastic packaging and paper waste generated at 
our stores/packaging units is segregated at source and stored in a secured place. This waste is then handed over to authorised 
recyclers. We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for plastic waste compaction. These baling machines 
present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good hygiene and also the reduced transportation frequency. This initiative 
helps in reducing the number of truck trips for the recycler and thus reduces Scope 3 emissions to that extent.

with regards to safety practices. Further, we have several mandatory safety trainings for all employees across all locations. 
These include basic and advanced fire safety training, construction safety training, asset operations and management, 
evacuation of premises, electrical safety training etc. Trainings are conducted by a dedicated safety team who have relevant

logged by all employees). All our employees are free to connect with the helpline. It is ensured that all engagement is completely 
confidential and is only shared with Senior Management of the Company. This helps employees report any grievance/ complaint/ 
issue that they may face at any time during employment.

provided a platform through our website where all stakeholders can directly share feedback. This feedback can be shared 
anonymously and is accessed directly by a small team at the Central Corporate Office. Key points/ issues/ suggestions are then 
directly shared with the Management Team to further direct appropriate changes in line with our culture and values.

under “The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013”. The purpose of this 
policy is to provide protection against acts of sexual harassment of women at workplace and for the prevention and redressal of 
complaints of sexual harassment in addition to the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
	
The Company’s principle nature of business is to procure everyday use products from reputed brands/manufacturers and provide 
the same to end consumers. Given this nature of business, our water consumption is primarily for drinking, personal hygiene and 
general cleaning purposes. However, we understand the importance of water conversation and therefore we have installed Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs) at 180 locations. The wastewater generated is treated and reused for flushing toilets in our washrooms. 
This helps us to reduce our fresh-water requirement and intake. 36% of our total water usage at these premises is through recycled 
water. We estimate to have reduced usage of 154,895 kiloliters of freshwater.
	
We have also started using Pressure Washers at our premises. Water is released with pressure from the nozzles of this equipment 
which helps in efficient cleaning at significantly lower water consumption. The equipment also has an integrated auto-stop system 
which enhances energy efficiency. Further, we have installed low-flow water efficient fixtures at our stores. These have aerators 
fixed by default to maintain and regulate water flow. We have developed Rainwater Harvesting system comprising of 386 pits/tanks 
with a designed cumulative capacity of 9,694 cubic meters per day.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
We have commissioned 36 solar plants in FY 2023-24 with a capacity of 8.2 MW. We now have a total of 226 solar plants with 
cumulative capacity of 36.0 MW from these installations. Of the total energy requirement at these 226 premises, 24.1% (PY: 21.8%) 
is met through Solar Energy. Subject to on-ground feasibility, it is our endeavour to ensure that all our new premises have a solar 
plant installed. We have also commenced installing rooftop solar plants at some of our distribution and production centers. Further, 
we have installed car ports at 36 stores during the year. We have 58 stores in the month of March 2024 that met more than 50% 
of their total electricity requirement through Solar Energy.
	
Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less energy in comparison to 
conventional air conditioners. We have also commenced using energy efficient inverter air conditioners at select locations.
	
Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers:  To maintain safe vehicular movement within our premises we install speed breakers at strategic points. 
We have installed the speed breakers made up of composite material which has a combination of recycled plastic, concrete waste and 
rubber waste. For the year FY 2023-24, we have installed 6,631 meters of recycled speed breakers instead of the conventional PVC 
speed breakers This cumulatively consists of 96% of the total speed breakers installed at our premises last year.
	
Installation of Baling Machines: We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for plastic compaction. These baling 
machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good hygiene and also reducing overall trip counts due to higher weight 
of plastic waste carried per vehicle. This initiative helps in reducing the Scope 3 emissions.
	
Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring several of our energy 
consuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible breakdowns and energy conservation possibilities.
	
Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators. They produce no particulate matter, 
relatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators.
	
CPCB-IV Compliant Diesel Generator Sets: We have commenced installation of CPCB-IV compliant Diesel Generator Sets at some 
of our stores. These produce significantly lesser emissions.
	
Retrofit Emissions Control Device (RECD): We have commenced installation of RECD and Dual Fuel kit for some of our legacy diesel 
generators at select locations. These devices can capture Particulate Matter Carbon from polluting the air with more than 70% efficiency.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
	
Waste Management is one of the most critical processes that we have established in the organisation. We have a space to keep the 
cartons and plastic scrap. This is segregated at the store level. This segregated scrap is then compressed using baling machines 
as available. This scrap is then stored at a dedicated location and then sustainably disposed through authorised channels. We have 
installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, 
good hygiene and also reducing overall trip counts due to higher weight carried per vehicle. This initiative helps in reducing the 
Scope 3 emissions.
	
Products with Recycled Materials: We have introduced several articles for our customers that are made from recycled plastic/ 
fabric/ yarn. Some of the product categories where such articles are introduced: planters & plates, shopping bags, pillows, bath
