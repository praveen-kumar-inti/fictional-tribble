The Company has a grievance policy so that employees have a way to convey issues related to their employment. The Policy 
makes sure that these complaints are resolved swiftly, fairly, and impartially in accordance with the Organization’s policies. This 
comprises employee concerns about a supervisor’s, another employee’s, or Management’s behaviour, inaction, or proposed 
action in relation to them.
According to the policy’s grievance redress mechanism, the first step in addressing any problem is to speak directly to the other 
party about the grievance. If consultation is unsatisfactory or impossible for whatever reason, the employee may speak to their 
next-level supervisor. If the grievance is still not resolved at the Department or Second Level, the HR Head of the Site will speak 
directly with the other party to try to address the situation. Even if the issue goes unresolved, the director will be involved to settle 
the complaints and will try every option at his command.
