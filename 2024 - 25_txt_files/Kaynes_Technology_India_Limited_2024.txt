Waste 
management 
 Risk
Inadequate waste management 
poses 
risks 
to 
electronics 
manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
regulatory 
noncompliance, 
reputational 
damage, increased operational 
costs and environmental impact. 
Improper handling and disposal 
of waste materials can lead to 
pollution, legal liabilities and 
negative public health, impacting 
the Company's performance and 
sustainability.
To effectively manage waste 
and 
hazardous 
materials, 
we 
implement 
measures 
to 
address 
present 
and 
future 
risks, 
mitigating 
environmental 
impact 
through 
proper 
disposal 
and containment. We also 
adopt eco-friendly materials, 
optimise consumption and 
closely monitor usage for a 
sustainable approach.

Community 
wellbeing
Opportunity
Community well-being presents 
an opportunity for electronics 
manufacturing companies to build 
strong 
relationships, 
enhance 
brand 
reputation 
and 
foster 
longterm sustainability. Engaging 
in initiatives that support local 
communities, such as education, 
job creation and social welfare 
programmes, can create positive 
social impact and contribute to a 
thriving business ecosystem.

 Positive
 3.
Business 
Ethics and 
governance
 Risk
Lack of business ethics, integrity 
and proper governance poses 
risks to electronics manufacturing 
companies, including damage to 
reputation, legal consequences, 
loss of stakeholder trust and 
financial losses. Engaging in 
unethical 
practices, 
such 
as 
bribery or fraud, can lead to legal 
disputes, 
regulatory 
penalties 
and erosion of the Company's 
credibility and long-term viability.
At Kaynes Technology, we 
place a paramount emphasis 
on 
business 
ethics 
and 
governance, 
recognising 
its crucial role in driving 
sustainable 
business 
performance and promoting 
transparency. To uphold these 
values, we have implemented 
several 
mechanisms 
and 
policies, such as the code of 
conduct, risk management 
policy, 
Board 
Diversity 
policy 
and 
Related 
Party 
Transactions policy. These 
policies work together to 
govern and ensure ethical 
practices 
throughout 
the 
Company, fostering a culture 
of integrity and responsible 
decision making.
 Negative
 4.
Material 
sourcing 
efficiency
 Risk
Inefficient material sourcing poses 
risks to electronics manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
supply 
chain 
disruptions, 
increased 
costs, reputational damage and 
environmental impact. Reliance 
on non-sustainable or unreliable 
sources can result in material 
shortages, 
price 
fluctuations, 
ethical concerns and failure to 
meet stakeholder expectations 
for responsible sourcing, affecting 
the Company's operations and 
competitiveness.
The rationale behind material 
sourcing 
efficiency 
and 
building an efficient supply 
chain is to ensure a smooth 
production 
function 
and 
meet 
customer 
demands 
effectively. These efforts have 
a significant impact on the 
overall business, as they lead 
to 
streamlined 
operations, 
reduced costs and enhanced 
customer 
satisfaction, 
ultimately 
contributing 
to 
the Company's success and 
growth.

Product 
design and 
Lifecycle 
management
 Risk
Inadequate product design and 
lifecycle management pose risks 
to 
electronics 
manufacturing 
companies, 
including 
product 
failures, 
market 
rejection, 
legal 
liabilities 
and 
negative 
environmental 
impact. 
Poorly 
designed products, insufficient 
quality control and lack of end 
of-life planning can lead to safety 
issues, customer dissatisfaction 
and 
non-compliance 
with 
regulations, 
jeopardising 
the 
Company's 
reputation 
and 
financial success.
To effectively manage use 
of 
hazardous 
materials, 
we 
implement 
measures 
to 
address 
present 
and 
future 
risks, 
mitigating 
environmental 
impact 
through gradually adopting 
ecofriendly 
materials, 
optimising consumption and 
closely monitoring usage for a 
sustainable approach.
 Negative
6.
Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
security
Risk
Inadequate 
IT 
security 
infrastructure and procedures can 
result in data security and integrity 
issues. 
However, 
we 
closely 
monitor 
critical 
aspects 
like 
access controls, physical security 
and logical security to ensure 
comprehensive protection.
As per the risk management 
roadmap, necessary actions 
are implemented to mitigate 
the adverse effects of actual 
or potential threats.
Negative
7.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity
The significance of customer 
satisfaction lies in elevating our 
Net Promoter Score (NPS), which 
directly correlates with improved 
customer loyalty and advocacy. 
By 
prioritising 
customer 
satisfaction, we cultivate a loyal 
customer base who are more 
likely to recommend our products 
and services to others.

To the Board of Directors of Kaynes Technology India 
Limited, 
1.	
We 
have 
undertaken 
to 
perform 
Reasonable 
Assurance engagement, for Kaynes Technology India 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) vide 
our engagement letter dated May 07, 2025 in respect 
of the agreed Sustainability Information listed below 
(the “Identified Sustainability Information” or “BRSR 
Core indicators”) in accordance with the Criteria 
stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability 
Information is included in the Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) of the Company 
for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. 
	
This 
engagement 
was 
conducted 
by 
our 
multidisciplinary 
team 
including 
assurance 
practitioners, 
environmental 
engineers 
and 
specialists.
2.	
Identified Sustainability Information 
	
Our scope of Reasonable Assurance consists of 
the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to 
our report. The reporting boundary of the BRSR is 
as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General 
Disclosures of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by 
way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, 
where applicable.
	
Our Reasonable Assurance engagement was with 
respect to the year ended March 31, 2025 information 
only and we have not performed any procedures with 
respect to earlier periods, and any elements thereto, 
and, therefore, do not express any opinion thereon.
3.	
Criteria
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the 
Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
	
The criteria used is the “BRSR Core”, which is a subset 
of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”)/ metrics under nine Environmental, 
Social and Governance (“ESG”) attributes, as per the 
format of BRSR Core specified in Annexure 17A, 
read with the format of BRSR and the Guidance Note 
given in Annexure 16 and 17, respectively, of the SEBI 
Master Circular for ‘compliance with the provisions of 
the SEBI LODR Regulations, 2025 by Listed Entities’ 
dated November 11, 2024, and the SEBI Circular on 
the ’Industry Standards on Reporting of BRSR Core’ 
dated December 20, 2024 (collectively referred to as 
the “SEBI Circulars”).
4.	
Management Responsibilities
	
The Company’s management is responsible for 
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing 
the Identified Sustainability Information including 
the reporting boundary of the BRSR, disclosing 
environmental information basis operational control 
approach, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations including the SEBI circulars, related to 
reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, 
identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of 
the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance 
with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the 
measurement of Identified Sustainability Information, 
which is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
	
The Management and the Board of Directors of the 
Company are also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s compliance with the requirements of 
LODR Regulations and the SEBI Circular in relation to 
the BRSR Core.
5.	
Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw to evaluate and 
measure non- financial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measures and measurement 
techniques and can affect comparability between 
companies.
	
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core 
metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, 
GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint and 
waste. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to 
support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty 
in the amounts and metrics.
6.	
Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm 
that we have met the requirements of the Code 
of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) and the SEBI Circular 
No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 
July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have 
the required competencies and experience to conduct 
this assurance engagement.

evaluation of the design of the key systems, 
processes and controls for recording, processing 
and reporting on the Identified Sustainability 
Information at the corporate office and at other 
locations/offices on a sample basis under the 
reporting boundary. This included evaluating 
the design of those controls relevant to the 
engagement and determining whether they have 
been implemented by performing procedures in 
addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible 
for the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
Based on the above understanding and the risks 
that the Identified Sustainability Information may 
be materially misstated, determined the nature, 
timing and extent of further procedures.
•	
Where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability 
Information in the BRSR, we have relied on the 
information in the audited standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2025 and the underlying trial balance.
•	
Evaluated 
the 
reasonableness 
and 
appropriateness of significant estimates and 
judgements made by the management in the 
preparation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information.
•	
Tested the Company’s process for collating 
the sustainability information through agreeing 
or reconciling the Identified Sustainability 
Information with the underlying records on a 
sample basis.
•	
Tested the consolidation working of the corporate 
office and other locations/offices on a sample 
basis under the reporting boundary for ensuring 
the completeness of data being reported; and
•	
Obtained representations from the Company’s 
management.
	
We also performed such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion.
