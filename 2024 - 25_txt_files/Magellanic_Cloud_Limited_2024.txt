7. Statement by director responsible for the
business responsibility report, highlighting
ESG related challenges, targets, and
achievements:
As a company at the forefront of cybersecurity,
digital transformation, and cloud-based enterprise
solutions, Magellanic Cloud Limited recognizes 
the increasing significance of its role in a digitally
connected society. We are committed to 
maintaining the highest standards of ethical 
governance and operational excellence,
ensuring that our business strategies align with
the evolving needs of our stakeholders and the
broader digital ecosystem, while also integrating
sustainable practices that contribute to long-
term value creation.
Over the past year, we have taken purposeful 
strides toward strengthening our ESG foundation.
One of our key achievements has been the
institutionalization of a secure-by-design 
approach across client engagements, supported
by upgraded data governance frameworks and
stronger internal IT audit protocols. These
enhancements are especially significant given
the sensitive and mission-critical nature of 
services we deliver in domains such as security,
and enterprise digital operations. In parallel, we
have expanded our reach in international 
markets through our subsidiaries, and remain 
committed to ensuring that all group companies
are aligned with our responsible business ethos.
We have also advanced on our social 
responsibility agenda. This includes structured 
efforts to improve diversity across leadership 
levels, invest in digital skills development for 
underrepresented groups, and create a work 
environment that prioritizes employee well-
being and ethical conduct. Our internal HR 
analytics systems now provide deeper insights
into workforce inclusion, enabling data-driven 
decisions around equity, representation,
and growth opportunities.
On the environmental front, while our 
operational footprint is inherently low-carbon 
due to our services-based model, we are 
focused on further reducing our impact by

increasing the efficiency of our digital infrastru-
cture and exploring green IT alternatives in cloud
hosting and facility management. These efforts
align with our broader goal of contributing to a
net-zero future, even though we are at an early
stage of formalizing climate commitments.
However, we view these not as obstacles, but
as catalysts for innovation and growth. We
remain committed to building an organization
remain committed to building an organization
where responsible governance, stakeholder-

olders for their continued trust and support, 
and reaffirm our commitment to being a

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of
Magellanic Cloud Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statement
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of Magellanic Cloud Limited (hereinaf-
ter referred to as “the Company”), which comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Standalone State-
ment of Changes in Equity and Standalone Statement Cash Flow for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Financial Statements, including a summary of the material accounting policies and other explanatory informa-
tion (hereinafter referred to as the “Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended(“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Stan-
dards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”") and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its profit including other comprehen-
sive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“the 
SAs”) specified under sub-section (10) of section 143 of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are 
further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
section of our report.
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the “Code of Ethics” Issued by the Institute of Char-
tered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules there under, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our audit 
opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit 
of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
204   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
1. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstate-
ments can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone 
Financial Statements.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the Standalone 
Financial Statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The other information is expected to be made avail-
able to us after the date of this auditors’ report. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection 
with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information iden-
tified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements.
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in sub-section (5) of Section 134 of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash 
flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were oper-
ating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, Management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liqui-
date the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors 
are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
3. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the stand-
alone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in 
(i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect 
of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
4. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
5. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safe-
guards.
2. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also :
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstate-
ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit proce-
dures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or condi-
tions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Independent Auditor’s Report
STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
“Annexure - B” to Independent Auditors’ Report
(Referred to in paragraph 2(vi) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of
our report to the Members of of even date)
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid Standalone Financial
Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act’)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of
Magellanic Cloud Ltd (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
financial controls Over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accoun-
tants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and complete-
ness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under
the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Audit-
ing prescribed under sub-section (10) of Section 143 of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and both issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal finan-
cial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an under-
standing of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements.
216   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accu-
rately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial state-
ments in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial State-
ments, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstate-
ments due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial control reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may dete-
riorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, 
in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial State-
ments and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal financial control over financial reporting criteria estab-
lished by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accoun-
tants of India.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
1. Background 
2. Summary of Material accounting policies 
2.1 Basis of preparation of standalone financial statements
2. 2 Use of Estimate and Judgement 
Magellanic Cloud Limited, (formerly known as South India Projects Limited) ("the Company") incorporated on
04 December, 1981 is a domestic company, and is domiciled in Hyderabad, India.
The registered office of the Company is at Dallas Centre, 6th & 7th Floor, 83/1, Knowledge City, Raidurg,
Hyderabad, Talengana 500032. The Company is engaged in the business of IT solutions, E-Surveillance and
Human Capital. 
Compliance with Ind AS: These financial statements have been prepared to comply, in all material aspects,
with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the
‘Act’), read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and the relevant provisions of the Act.
Basis of preparation and presenation
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis of
accounting, except for certan finacial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair
valueat the end of each reporting period,as explained in the accounting policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and
services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal
operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between
deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such
services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months The statement of cash flows
have been prepared under the indirect method. All amounts included in the financial statements are reported
in lakhs of Indian rupees except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding off, the
numbers presented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may
not precisely reflect the absolute figures.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application
of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed.
222   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Notes Forming Part of The Standalone Financial Statements
For The Year Ended 31st March 2025
(All amounts in Indians ₹ Lakhs, Unless Otherwise Stated)
Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware of changes in circumstances
surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements
in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the
Standalone financial statements.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the
aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Acquisition
related costs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition
date. Contingent consideration classified as financial liability is measured at fair value with changes in fair
value recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and
any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of
the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is recognized as
capital reserve after reassessing the fair values of the net assets.
Business Combination under common control are accounted under “the pooling of interest method” i.e. in
accor dance with Appendix C in Ind AS 103 Business combinations, at carrying amount of assets and liabilities
acquired and any excess of consideration issued over the net assets acquired is recognised as
capital reserve on common control business combination.
(i) Initial recognition
Transactions in foreign currencies entered into by the company are accounted at the exchange rates
prevailing on the date of transaction or at rates that closely approximate the rate at the date of the
transaction.
(ii) Measurement of monetary items denominated in foreign currency at the Balance Sheet date
Monetary items denominated in foreign currency (other than those related to acquisition of property
plant and equipment) of the Company outstanding at the  Balance Sheet date are restated at the
year-end rates. Non monetary foreign currency items are carried at cost. 
(iii) Treatment of exchange differences 
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in
the State ment of profit and loss. The translation  differences on monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary
assets and  liabilities are recorded at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Transactions
with fixed Rupee exposure are not revalued at the balance sheet date as  the Company’s exposure is
fixed in INR terms

STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
2. 5 Fair Value Measurement
The Company records certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company
determines fair values based on the price it would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most
advantageous market for that asset or liability.
The Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity securities, which must be measured using
the guidance for fair value hierarchy and related valuation  methodologies. The guidance specifies a
hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or
unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions. The fair value
hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when  measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related
valuation methodologies are as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
in active markets.
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active and model derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are
directly or indirectly observable in active markets.
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are
unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
In accordance with Ind AS 113, assets and liabilities at fair value are measured based on the following
valuation techniques:
(a) Market approach - Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving 
dentical or comparable assets or liabilities.
(b) Income approach - Converting the future amounts based on market expectations to its present
value using the discounting method.
(c) Cost approach - Replacement cost method.
Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets consist primarily of
non-financial assets such as goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized
in business combinations are measured at fair value initially and subsequently when there is an indicator
of impairment, the impairment is recognized.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest  and best use or by selling it to another
market participant who would use the asset in its highest and best use.
2. 6 Revenue Recognition
1. The Company derives from information technology services, staffing and related services. These include
revenue earned from services rendered on ‘time and  material’ basis, time bound fixed price engagements
and fixed price development contracts.
224   |   2024-25 Annual Report
(i) Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration the Company expect  to receive in exchange for those products or
services. Revenue is measured based on transaction price, which is the consideration, net of indirect taxes,
discounts, rebates, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonus, penalties, or other similar item. 
2. (i) Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are
performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts  over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price
maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of 
benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even
through the period of the contract because the services  are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive.
The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises
in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
2. 7 Interest Income
2. 8 Income Tax
3. Revenue with respect to time-and-material, volume based and transaction based contracts is recognized
as the related services are performed through efforts  expended, volume serviced transactions are
processed etc. that correspond with value transferred to customer till date which is related to the right to
invoice for services performed.
4. (i) Contracts assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts.
Contract assets are classified as unbilled revenue for time  and material and fixed price maintenance contracts,
when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual
terms. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract
and, therefore, the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers.
The right to consideration in such cases depends on completion of contractual milestones.
(ii) Contract liability (“Unearned revenue”) arises when there are billing in excess of revenue.
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow
to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably.
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax.
Income tax expense is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to
items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity. Current income tax for current and
prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using
the tax rates and tax  laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Provision for income tax includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts,
and it is intended to realize the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the  financial statements. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for those temporary differences which originate during the tax holiday
period and are reversed  after the tax holiday period. For this purpose, reversal of timing differences is
determined using first-in-first-out method.
Notes
2024-25 Annual Report   |   225
STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
2. 9 Property, plant and equipment
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and
are expected to  apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same
taxation authority.
At costs less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.
The cost includes purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, any import duties and other taxes
(other than those subsequently recoverable from the tax authorities), any directly attributable expenditure on
making the asset ready for its intended use, other incidental expenses and interest on borrowings attributable
to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. The cost of an
item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an  asset if, and only if it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure on fixed assets after its purchase/completion is capitalized only
if such expenditure results in an increase in the future benefits from such asset beyond its previously assessed
standard of performance. 
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from  its use. Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are measured as the difference between
the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in
the statement of profit and loss when the property, plant and equipment is derecognized.

(ii) Depreciation/Amortisation:
(iii) Derecognition:
2. 10 Intangible Assets
Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the
depreciable amount, i.e. the costless estimated residual value, over its estimated useful lives. The estimated
useful lives and  residual values are reviewed annually and the effect of any changes in estimate is accounted
for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of an item of property, plant and
equip ment is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the
item and  is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as of the date of acquisition, as applicable, less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any.  Intangible assets are amortized on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful lives from the date that they are available for use. The estimated usefu
 lives of the intangible assets and the amortization period are reviewed at the end of each financial year and
the amortization period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if any.

The estimated useful life on a straightline basis of amortization is mentioned below:

2. 11 Borrowing Cost
Borrowing costs, general or specific, that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of
qualifying assets is capitalized as part of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes
substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. All other borrowing costs are charged to the
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The Company determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as the actual borrowing
costs incurred on that borrowing during the year less any interest income earned on temporary investment
of specific bor rowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets, to the extent that an entity borrows
funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. In case if the Company borrows generally
and uses the funds for obtaining a qualifying asset, borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation are determined
by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on that asset.
Borrowing cost includes exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they
are regard ed as an adjustment to the finance cost. 
2. 12  Lease
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 and
this may require significant judgment. The Group also uses  significant judgement in assessing the lease
term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both
periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain based
on relevant facts and circumstances that the option to extend or terminate will be exercised. If there is
a change in facts and circumstances, the expected lease term is revised accordingly.
The discount rate is generally based on the interest rate specific to the lease being evaluated or if that
cannot be easily determined the incremental borrowing rate for similar term is used.
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the
lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Company As Lessor
Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of
the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease
are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same
basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognized as revenue in the year in which they are earned
or contingency is resolved.
Leases in which the Company transfers substantially all the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset
are classified as finance leases. Assets given under finance lease are recognized as a receivables at an
amount equal to the present value of lease receivables. After initial recognition, the Company apportions
lease rentals between the principal repayment and interest income so as to achieve a constant periodic
rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the finance leases.

Goodwill
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
2. 14  Provision and Contingent Liabilites
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-
use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to
which the asset belongs. Impairment, if any, is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the
asset exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. Subsequently if there is a change in the
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, the impairment loss is reversed. Such reversal is made
only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined on the date of reversal, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Such impairment and
any subsequent reversal is recognized under the head "Depreciation and amortization expense" in the
statement of profit and loss.
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions
are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows.
The Company uses significant judgement to disclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed
when there is possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the
Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.
Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.
Goodwill is tested annually on March 31, for impairment, or sooner whenever there is an indication that
goodwill may be impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans and
future cash flows. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is
allocated to the Company's cash generating units (CGU) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from
the business combination. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when
the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value
in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Total impairment loss
of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the
other assets of the CGU, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss on goodwill recognized in the statement of profit and loss is not reversed in the
subsequent period
2. 13  Impairment of Non Financial Assets
The interest income is recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs such as legal  cost,
brokerage cost etc. are recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets 
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at
:-  Amortised cost
:-  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)- equity investment; or 
:-  Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instruments Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value except for trade
receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial
recognition of financial asset or financial liability. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in Standalone statement
of profit and loss.
Providend Fund
Employees of the Company receive benefits under the provident fund, a defined benefit plan. The employee
and employer each make monthly contributions to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to the
provident fund trust managed by the Company or Government administered provident fund; while the
balance contribution is made to the Government administered pension fund, a defined contribution plan.
For the contribution made by the Company to the provident fund trust managed by the Company, the
Company has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the Trust's investments over the administered
interest rates. The liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at the end of the
year.
Gratuity Fund
The Company provide for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the "Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or
termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's base salary and the tenure of
employment (subject to a maximum of 20 lacs per employee). The liability is actuarially determined (using the
projected unit credit method) at the end of each year. Actuarial  gains losses are recognized immediately in
the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive income in the year in which
they occur.
2. 16  Financial Intruments
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the
Company changes its business model for managing financial assets.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL
Notes
2024-25 Annual Report   |   229
STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
Derecognition
Financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all
of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither
transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the
financial asset. If the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance
sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred
assets are not derecognized.
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at
FVTPL if it is classified as held- for- trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,
are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in
profit or loss.
On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading,  the Company may irrevocably elect
to present subsequent changes in the investment`s fair value in OCI (designated as FVOCI equity investment).
This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at
amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivatives financial
assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets
the requirement to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Financial Liabilities
:-  The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash
     flows;
:- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely for
    payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or
expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under
the modified terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms
is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished
and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial Liabilities
230   |   2024-25 Annual Report
The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets
which are not fair valued through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance is recognized for trade receivables
with no significant financing component. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured
at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial
recognition in which case they are measured at lifetime ECL. The amount of expected credit losses
(or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date is recognized in statement of
profit and loss.
Impairment Testing  of financial Assets
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when,
and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either
to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts and
interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Derivatives
embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109 are
treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the
host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair
value at the date the contracts are entered into and are subsequently remea- sured to their fair value at the
end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in
profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
Offsetting
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Final dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is recognized upon approval by the shareholders who
have the right to decrease but not increase the amount of dividend recommended by the Board of Directors.
Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by the Board of Directors. Final and interim

(x) The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all other assumptions constraint. In practice it is unlikely to occur and change in some of the assumption may be
correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated
with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.
(xi) The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation are after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors including supply and
demand in the employment market. The above information is as certified by the Actuary.
(xii) The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

Trade payables (current and non current)
Management of the Company has assessed that trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, other financial assets, trade payables and other financial liabilities
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which
the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Level1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives and equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the
reporting period for identical assets or liabilities. These instruments are included in level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques
which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable,
the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3:
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent
consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3. There are no transfers among levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year

established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment
analysis is performed at each reporting date on trade receivables by lifetime expected credit loss method
based on provision matrix. The Company does not hold collateral as security. There is one single customer
from whom the Company earns revenue of more than 10%, however, there is no credit default risk from this
customer since the amount are generally received in advance. Refer note 5(B) for movement in credit loss
allowance during the year.
(ii) Financial instruments and deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company's treasury
department in accordance with the Company's policy. Investments of surplus funds are made in bank

not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or
processes for managing capital during the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024. The Company monitors

STANDALONE FINANCIAL SECTION
Opinion
We have audited the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of  Magellanic Cloud Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Holding 
Company”), and its subsidiaries (Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred 
to as “the Group”), which comprise the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 
2025, the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and Consolidated Cash Flow 
statement for the year then ended, and notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including a summary of the significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
Consolidated Financial Statements”)
In our opinion and to the best of our 
information and according to the explanations 
given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated 
Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true 
and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the 
consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 
March 31, 2025, of consolidated profit, total 
comprehensive income, consolidated changes 
in equity and its consolidated cash flows for 
the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing specified under 
sub-section (10) of section 143 of the Act (“the 
SAs”). Our responsibilities under those SAs 
are further described in the Auditors’ 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of 
our report. We are independent of the Group 
in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Consolidate Financial Statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined that there are no key audit matters 
to be communicated in our report.

Consolidated Financial Statements 
and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Management and 
Board of Directors are responsible for the

preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included 
in the annual report but does not include the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The other information 
is expected to be made available to us after 
the date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated Ind AS financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained during the course of our 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that 
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors 
and management are responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of these 
Consolidated Financial Statements in term of 
the requirements of the Act that give a true 
and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance 
including other comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group including  
in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of 
Directors of the companies included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the each company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that give a 
true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by the Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the companies in the 
Group  are responsible for assessing the ability 
of the Group  to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless Management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
Those respective Board of Directors of the 
Companies included in Group are also 
responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Consolidated 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditors’ report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
Auditor’s Report
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
2024-25 Annual Report   |   265
a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with 
with Standards on Auditing will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
1.
Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
2.
Obtain an understanding of internal 
controls relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
the section 143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 
2013, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial 
controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
3.
Evaluate the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by 
Management.
4.
Conclude on the appropriateness of 
Management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the ability of the Group  
to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our 
auditors’ report to the related disclosures 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditors’ report. 
However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
5.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
6.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its to 
express an opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial 
statements of such entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of which 
we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, which have been 
audited by other auditors, such other 
auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with 
governance of the Holding company and such 
other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other 
266   |   2024-25 Annual Report
matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the financial year ended March 31, 2025 and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditors’ report 
unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Other Matters
1.
We did not audit the financial statements 
and other financial information in respect 
of two subsidiaries and one step down 
subsidiary, whose financial statements, 
before consolidation adjustments, reflect

operations of Rs. 44,876.10 Lakhs and net

information have been audited by other 
auditors whose reports have been

our opinion on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in 
respect of these subsidiaries, and our 
report in terms of sub-sections (3) of 
Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates 
to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based 
solely on the reports of the other auditors.

March 31, 2024 which have been audited

Auditor’s Report
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
2024-25 Annual Report   |   271
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained by 
the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph 
below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls to these Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Holding Company, 
its subsidiaries which are incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with 
reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal 
financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal 
Financial Controls with Reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal 
financial controls with reference to these 
Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to these Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to these Consolidated Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information 
and according to the explanations given to us, 
and based on the consideration of reports of 
other auditors, as referred to in Other Matters 
paragraph below, the Holding Company, its 
subsidiaries , which are companies 
incorporated in India have, maintained in all 
material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to

operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, 
based on the internal financial controls over 
financial reporting criteria established by the 
Holding Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the

in Hyderabad, India. The registered office of 
the Group is at Dallas Centre, 6th & 7th Floor, 
83/1, Knowledge City, Raidurg, Hyderabad, 
Talengana 500032. The Group is engaged in 
the business of IT solutions, E - Surveillance 
and Human Capital.
2  Summary of material accounting policies
2.1  Basis of preparation of financial   
       statements
Compliance with Ind AS
These Consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared to comply, in all material 
aspects, with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’), read with 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and the relevant provisions of the 
Act. Basis of preparation and presenation
These financial statements have been prepared 
on a historical cost convention and on an 
accrual basis of accounting, except for certan 
finacial instruments and defined benefit plans 
which are measured at fair valueat the end 
of each reporting period,as explained in the 
accounting policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the 
fair value of the consideration given in 
exchange for goods and services. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date .
All assets and liabilities have been classified as 
current and non-current as per the Company’s 
normal operating cycle. Based on the nature 
of services rendered to customers and time 
elapsed between deployment of resources and 
the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of 
the consideration for such services rendered, 
the Company has considered an operating 
cycle of 12 months The statement of cash flows 
have been prepared under the indirect method. 
All amounts included in the financial statements 
are reported in lakhs of Indian rupees except 
share and per share data, unless otherwise 
stated. Due to rounding off, the numbers 
presented throughout the document may not 
add up precisely to the totals and percentages 
may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.
2.2  Basis of Consolidation 
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of the 
Group and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group 
has control. Subsidiaries are consolidated 
on a line-by-line basis from the date the 
control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control 
ceases. The acquisition method of accounting 
is used to account for business combinations 
by the Group.
Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries 
that do not result in a loss of control are 
accounted as equity transactions. The 
carrying amount of the Group’s interests and 
the non-controlling interests are adjusted to 
reflect the changes in their relative interests 
in the subsidiaries. Any difference between 
the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in equity and attributed to owners of 
the Group.
In case of loss of control of a subsidiary, the 
difference of the aggregate of fair value 
of consideration received and fair value of 
retained interest as compared to the carrying 
amount of the assets (including any goodwill) 
and liabilities of the subsidiary and related 
noncontrolling interest, if any, is recognised as 
gain or loss in Consolidated statement of profit 
and loss. Additionally, components of Other
2024-25 Annual Report   |   279
Comprehensive Income of Subsidiaries are 
reclassified to Consolidated statement of profit 
and loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings.
The fair value of any investment retained at 
the date when control is lost is regarded as the 
cost on initial recognition of investment in an 
associate or jointly controlled entity or as the 
fair value on initial recognition of investment 
classified as a financial asset. Intergroup 
transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
on transactions between group companies 
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. These financial statements are 
prepared by applying uniform accounting 
policies in use at the Group.
2.3  Use of Estimate and Judgement
The preparation of the financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires the 
Management to make estimates, judgments 
and assumptions. These estimates, judgments 
and assumptions affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the period. 
The application of accounting policies that 
require critical accounting estimates involving 
complex and subjective judgments and the use 
of assumptions in these financial statements 
have been disclosed . Accounting estimates 
could change from period to period. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. 
Appropriate changes in estimates are made 
as management becomes aware of changes 
in circumstances surrounding the estimates. 
Changes in estimates and judgments are 
reflected in the financial statements in the 
period in which changes are made and, if 
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes 
to the Standalone financial statements
2.4  Business combinations and goodwil
The Group accounts for its business 
combinations under acquisition method of 
accounting. The acquiree’s identifiable assets 
including liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the condition for recognition 
are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, 
and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) 
over the net of the acquisition-date amounts 
of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. 
Before recognising capital reserve in respect 
thereof, the Group determines whether there 
exists clear evidence of underlying reasons 
for classifying the business combination as 
a bargain purchase. Thereafter, the Group 
reassesses whether it has correctly identified 
all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and recognises any additional 
asset or liabilities that are identified in that 
reassessment. The Group then reviews the 
procedures used to measure the amounts 
that Ind AS requires for the purposes of 
calculating the bargain purchase. If the gain 
remains after this reassessment and review, the 
Group recognises it directly in equity as capital 
reserve.
Non-controlling interest is initially measured 
at fair value or at the proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The 
choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent 
to initial acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interest is the amount of 
those interest in initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent 
changes in equity of subsidiaries. When the 
consideration transferred by the Group in 
business combination includes assets or 
liabilities resulting in a contingent consideration 
arrangement, the contingent consideration 
is measured at its acquisition date fair value 
and included as a part of the consideration 
transferred in a business combination. Changes 
in the fair value of the contingent consideration 
that qualify as measurement period 
adjustments, are adjusted retrospectively, with 
corresponding adjustments against goodwill 
or capital reserve as the case may be. When a 
business combination is achieved in stages, the 
Group’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition-date 
fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, 
is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising 
from interests in the acquiree prior to the
280   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Notes
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
acquisition date that have previously been
recognised in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified to profit or loss where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
were disposed off. If the initial accounting 
for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amount for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional 
amount are adjusted during the measurement 
period (which cannot exceed one year 
from the acquisition date), or additional 
assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed at the acquisition 
date that, if known, would have affected the 
amount recognised at that date.
In consolidated financial statements, acquisition 
of non-controlling interest is accounted as 
equity transaction. The carrying amount of 
the Group’s interests and the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in 
their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any 
difference between the amount by which the 
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the 
fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognised directly in equity and attributed 
to owners of the Group.
Business Combination under common control 
are accounted under “the pooling of interest 
method” i.e. in accordance with Appendix C in 
Ind AS 103 - Business combinations, at carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities acquired and 
any excess of consideration issued over the net 
assets acquired is recognised as capital reserve 
on common control business combination.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and any previous interest held, 
over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the excess is 
recognized as capital reserve after reassessing 
the fair values of the net assets.
Business Combination under common control 
are accounted under “the pooling of interest 
method” i.e. in accor dance with Appendix C in 
Ind AS 103 - Business combinations, at carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities acquired and 
any excess of consideration issued over the net 
assets acquired is recognised as capital reserve 
on common control business combination.
2.5   The Effects of Changes in Foreign  
        Exchange Rates
The Group’s Consolidated financial statements 
are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which 
is also the Company’s functional currency. 
For each foreign operation, the Company 
determines the functional currency which is its 
respective local currency.
i) Initial recognition Transactions in foreign 
currencies entered into by the company are 
accounted at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of transaction or at rates that 
closely approximate the rate at the date of the 
transaction.
(ii) Measurement of monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency at 
the Balance Sheet date Monetary items 
denominated in foreign currency (other than 
those related to acquisition of property plant 
and equipment) of the Company outstanding 
at the Balance Sheet date are restated at the 
year-end rates. Non monetary foreign currency 
items are carried at cost.
(iii) Treatment of exchange differences
Exchange differences arising on foreign 
currency transactions settled during the year 
are recognised in the State ment of profit and 
loss. The translation differences on monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognized in the Statement 
of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities are recorded at the rates prevailing on 
the date of the transaction. Transactions with 
fixed Rupee exposure are not revalued at the 
balance sheet date as the Company’s exposure 
is fixed in INR terms.
2024-25 Annual Report   |   281
2.6  Fair Value Measurement
The Company records certain financial assets 
and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. 
The Company determines fair values based 
on the price it would receive to sell an asset 
or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date in the principal or most 
advantageous market for that asset or liability.
The Company holds certain fixed income 
securities, equity securities, which must be 
measured using the guidance for fair value 
hierarchy and related valuation methodologies. 
The guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation 
techniques based on whether the inputs 
to each measurement are observable or 
unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market 
data obtained from independent sources, while 
unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s 
assumptions about current market conditions. 
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity 
to maximize the use of observable inputs and 
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when 
measuring fair value. The prescribed fair value 
hierarchy and related valuation methodologies 
are as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted inputs that reflect quoted 
prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments 
in active markets, quoted prices for identical 
or similar instruments in markets that are not 
active and model- derived valuations, in which 
all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable in active markets.
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation 
techniques, in which one or more significant 
inputs are unobservable inputs which are 
supported by little or no market activity.
In accordance with Ind AS 113, assets and 
liabilities at fair value are measured based on 
the following valuation techniques:
(a) Market approach - Prices and other relevant 
information generated by market transactions 
involving identical or comparable assets or 
liabilities.
(b) Income approach - Converting the future 
amounts based on market expectations to its 
present value using the discounting method.
(c) Cost approach - Replacement cost method.
Certain assets are measured at fair value on 
a non-recurring basis. These assets consist 
primarily of non-financial assets such as 
goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and 
intangible assets recognized in business 
combinations are measured at fair value initially 
and subsequently when there is an indicator of 
impairment, the impairment is recognized.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant who 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
2.7  Revenue Recognition
1. The Company derives from information 
technology services, staffing and related 
services. These include revenue earned from 
services rendered on ‘time and material’ basis, 
time bound fixed price engagements and fixed 
price development contracts.
i) Revenue is recognized upon transfer of 
control of promised products or services 
to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration the Company expect to receive 
in exchange for those products or services. 
Revenue is measured based on transaction 
price, which is the consideration, net of 
indirect taxes, discounts, rebates, credits, price 
concessions, incentives, performance bonus, 
penalties, or other similar item
2.i) Fixed-price maintenance revenue is 
recognized ratably on a straight-line basis 
when services are performed through an 
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a 
specified period. Revenue from fixed-price 
maintenance contract is recognized ratably 
using a percentage-of-completion method 
when the pattern of benefits from the services 
rendered to the customer and Company’s 
costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of the contract because the services 
are generally discrete in nature and not 
repetitive. The use of method to recognize the 
maintenance revenues requires judgment and 
is based on the promises in the contract and 
nature of the deliverables.
282   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Notes
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
3. Revenue with respect to time-and-material, 
volume based and transaction based contracts 
is recognized as the related services are 
performed through efforts expended, volume 
serviced transactions are processed etc. that 
correspond with value transferred to customer 
till date which is related to the right to invoice 
for services performed.
4.i) Contracts assets are recognised when 
there is excess of revenue earned over billings 
on contracts. Contract assets are classified 
as unbilled revenue for time and material and 
fixed price maintenance contracts, when there 
is unconditional right to receive cash, and only 
passage of time is required, as per contractual 
terms. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-
price contracts is based on milestones as 
defined in the contract and, therefore, the 
timing of revenue recognition is different from 
the timing of invoicing to the customers. The 
right to consideration in such cases depends 
on completion of contractual milestones.
ii) Contract liability (“Unearned revenue”) arises 
when there are billing in excess of revenue.
Interest Income
Interest income from a financial asset is 
recognised when it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably.
2.8   Employee benefit
Providend Fund
Employees of the Company receive benefits 
under the provident fund, a defined benefit 
plan. The employee and employer each make 
monthly contributions to the plan. A portion 
of the contribution is made to the provident 
fund trust managed by the Company or 
Government administered provident fund; 
while the balance contribution is made to the 
Government administered pension fund, a 
defined contribution plan. For the contribution 
made by the Company to the provident fund 
trust managed by the Company, the Company 
has an obligation to fund any shortfall on 
the yield of the Trust’s investments over the 
administered interest rates. The liability is 
actuarially determined (using the projected unit 
credit method) at the end of the year.
Gratuity Fund
The Company provide for gratuity, a defined 
benefit plan (the “Gratuity Plan”) covering 
eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides 
a lump sum payment to vested employees 
at retirement, death, incapacitation or 
termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee’s base 
salary and the tenure of employment (subject 
to a maximum of 20 lacs per employee). 
The liability is actuarially determined (using 
the projected unit credit method) at the 
end of each year. Actuarial gains/losses are 
recognized immediately in the balance sheet 
with a corresponding debit or credit to other 
comprehensive income in the year in which 
they occur.
Other Employee benefit (IF ANY, Discussion 
with Management)
2.9   Property plant and equipment
 
i) At costs less accumulated depreciation 
(other than freehold land) and impairment 
loss, if any.
The cost includes purchase price net of 
any trade discounts and rebates, any 
import duties and other taxes (other than 
those subsequently recoverable from the 
tax authorities), any directly attributable 
expenditure on making the asset ready for 
its intended use, other incidental expenses 
and interest on borrowings attributable to 
acquisition of qualifying fixed assets up to the 
date the asset is ready for its intended use. 
The cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, 
and only if it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Company and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. Subsequent expenditure 
on fixed assets after its purchase/completion 
is capitalized only if such expenditure results 
in an increase in the future benefits from such 
asset beyond its previously assessed standard 
of performance.
2024-25 Annual Report   |   283
ii) Derecognisation
An item of property, plant and equipment 
and any significant part initially recognised is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of property, plant and equipment and 
are recognized in the statement of profit and 
loss when the property, plant and equipment is 
derecognized.
Life of Assets
(iii) Depreciation/Amortisation
Depreciation is provided on straight-line basis 
for property, plant and equipment so as to 
expense the deprecia ble amount, i.e. the 
costless estimated residual value, over its 
estimated useful lives.The estimated useful 
lives and residual values are reviewed annually 
and the effect of any changes in estimate is 
accounted for on a prospective basis
(iv) Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition 
of an item of property, plant and equip ment is 
measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the item and is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss in the year the asset is 
derecognised.
(v) Intangible Assets
1. Intangible assets purchased are measured 
at cost as of the date of acquisition, as 
applicable, less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment, if any.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful lives from 
the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets and the amortization period are 
reviewed at the end of each financial year and 
the amortization period is revised to reflect the 
changed pattern, if any.
The estimated useful life on a straightline basis 
of amortization is mentioned below:
Type of Asset	 -  Softtware
Useful Life - 3 Year
2. For one of the subsidiary company Ivis 
International Private Limited,
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of 
acquisition less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment, if any.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible 
assets are accounted by the Company using 
revaluation model for its software used in 
e-surveillance business. the revaluation gain 
is recognised in Other comprehensive income 
as revaluation reserve and carrying amount 
adjusted to the extent. Any decrease in the 
carrying amount as a result of revaluation is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss 
except to the extent of any credit balance 
in the revaluation surplus available with the 
Company in respect of that asset. Intangible 
assets are amortised on a straight line basis so 
as to reflect the pattern in which the asset’s 
economic benefits are consumed.
Intangible assets under development: The 
Group expenses costs incurred during research 
phase to profit or loss in the year in which they 
are incurred. Development phase expenses 
are initially recognised as intangible assets 
under development until the development 
phase is complete, upon which the amount is 
capitalised as intangible asset. Intangible assets 
acquired under business combination Intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination and 
recognised separately from goodwill are initially 
recognised at their fair value on the acquisition 
date (which is regarded as their cost). 
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible 
assets acquired in a business combination are 
reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, on the 
same basis as intangible assets that are 
acquired separately.
Intangible assets purchased are measured 
at cost as of the date of acquisition, as 
applicable, less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment, if any.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful lives from
284   |   2024-25 Annual Report
Notes
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets and the amortization period are 
reviewed at the end of each financial year and 
the amortization period is revised to reflect the 
changed pattern, if any.
The estimated useful life on a straightline basis 
of amortization is mentioned below:
Type of Asset	 -  Softtware
Useful Life - 3 Year
Impairment Testing of Property, Plant and 
Equipment, and Intangible Assets
The carrying amounts of the Company’s 
non-financial assets, other than inventories 
and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of 
cash generating units are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the 
unit on a pro-rata basis. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
When an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset 
or a cash-generating unit is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so 
that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating 
unit) earlier.
2.10  Leases
The Group evaluates if an arrangement 
qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements 
of Ind AS 116 and this may require significant 
judgment. The Group also uses significant 
judgement in assessing the lease term 
(including anticipated renewals) and the 
applicable discount rate.
The Group determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable period of a lease, together 
with both periods covered by an option to 
extend or terminate the lease if the Group is 
reasonably certain based on relevant facts and 
circumstances that the option to extend or 
terminate will be exercised. If there is a change 
in facts and circumstances, the expected lease 
term is revised accordingly.
The discount rate is generally based on 
the interest rate specific to the lease 
being evaluated or if that cannot be easily 
determined the incremental borrowing rate for 
similar term is used.
The Group has elected not to recognise right-
of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term 
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or 
less and leases of low-value assets. The Group 
recognises the lease payments associated with 
these leases as an expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Company As Lessor
Leases in which the Company does not 
transfer substantially all the risks and benefits 
of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating an operating lease are added to 
the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognized over the lease term on the same 
basis as rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognized as revenue in the year in which 
they are earned or contingency is resolved.
Leases in which the Company transfers 
substantially all the risk and benefits of 
ownership of the asset are classified as finance 
leases. Assets given under finance lease are 
recognized as a receivables at an amount equal 
to the present value of lease receivables. After 
initial recognition, the Company apportions 
lease rentals between the principal repayment 
and interest income so as to achieve a constant 
periodic rate of return on the net investment 
outstanding in respect of the finance leases. 
The interest income is recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss. Initial direct costs 
such as legal cost, brokerage cost etc. are 
recognized immediately in the statement of 
profit and loss.
2024-25 Annual Report   |   285
2.11   Earnings per share (EPS)
The Basic EPS is computed by dividing the 
net profit / (loss) attributable to the equity 
shareholders for the year by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding 
during the reporting period.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net 
profit / (loss) as adjusted for dividend, interest 
and other charges to expense or income 
(net off any attributable taxes) relating to the 
dilutive potential equity shares by the weighted 
average number of equity and dilutive equity 
equivalent shares outstanding during the year, 
except where the results would be anti-dilutive.
2.12    Income taxes
(i) Current tax
Current tax is determined as the amount of 
tax payable in respect of taxable income for 
the year. The Group’s current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
recognised for the future tax consequences of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
values of assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities 
and assets are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
end of the reporting period. The measurement 
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the end 
of the reporting period, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
income will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences could be 
utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. Minimum 
Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with 
the tax laws, which gives future economic 
benefits in the form of adjustment to future 
income tax liability, is considered as an asset 
if it is probable that the Group will pay normal 
income tax against which the MAT paid will be 
adjusted. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
(iii) Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in 
profit or loss, except when they relate to items 
that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the 
current and deferred tax are also recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity respectively. Where current tax or 
deferred tax arises from the initial accounting 
for a business combination, the tax effect is 
included in the accounting for the business 
combination.
2.13   Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs, general or specific, that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
construction of qualifying assets is capitalized 
as part of such assets. A qualifying asset is 
one that necessarily takes substantial period 
of time to get ready for intended use. All other 
borrowing costs are charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
The Company determines the amount of 
borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation as 
the actual borrowing costs incurred on that 
borrowing during the year less any interest 
income earned on temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure 
on qualifying assets, to the extent that an 
entity borrows funds specifically for the 
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. In 
case if the Company borrows generally and 
uses the funds for obtaining a qualifying asset, 
borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation are 
determined by applying a capitalisation rate to 
the expenditures on that asset.
Borrowing cost includes exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regard- ed as an adjustment to 
the finance cost

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
2.14  Provisions and contingencies:
Provisions are recognised when the Group 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation. The amount 
recognised as a provision is the best estimate 
of the consideration required to settle the 
present obligation at the end of the reporting 
period, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When 
provision is measured using the cash flow 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of these 
cash flows (when the effect of the time value 
of money is material).
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the 
financial statements and are disclosed in the 
notes forming part of the financial statements.
 
Contingent assets are neither recognized and 
disclosed in Financial statements.
2.15  Financial instruments
Classification and subsequent measurement 
Financial assets
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised 
when the Group Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value except for trade 
receivables which are initially measured at 
transaction price. Transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities (other 
than financial assets and financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss) are added to 
or deducted from the fair value measured on 
initial recognition of financial asset or financial 
liability. Transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets or financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are 
recognised in Standalone statement of profit 
and
Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial assets
On initial recognition, a financial asset is 
classified as measured at -
;- amortised cost
;- Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)- equity investment; or
:- Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their initial recognition, except if and in the 
period the Company changes its business 
model for managing financial assets.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost 
if it meets both of the following conditions and 
is not designated as at FVTPL
:- the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold assets to collect 
contractual cash flows; and - the contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
for payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as measured 
at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability 
is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as 
held- for- trading, or it is a derivative or it 
is designated as such on initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at 
fair value and net gains and losses, including 
any interest expense, are recognised in 
profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Interest 
expense and foreign exchange gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss.
On initial recognition of an equity investment 
that is not held for trading,
the Company may irrevocably elect to present 
subsequent changes in the investment`s fair 
value in OCI (designated as FVOCI equity 
investment). This election is made on an 
investment-by-investment basis.
All financial assets not classified as measured 
at amortised cost or FVOCI as described 
above are measured at FVTPL. This includes 
all derivatives financial assets. On initial 
recognition, the Company may irrevocably 
designate a financial asset that otherwise 
meets the requirement to be measured at 
amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if
2024-25 Annual Report   |   287
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an 
accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
Derecognition Financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the financial asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a 
transaction in which substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset 
are transferred or in which the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership and does not retain 
control of the financial asset
If the Group enters into transactions whereby it 
transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, 
but retains either all or substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the 
transferred assets are not derecognized.
Finacial Liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial liability 
when its contractual obligations are discharged 
or cancelled or expire. The Group also 
derecognises a financial liability when its terms 
are modified and the cash flows under the 
modified terms are substantially different. In 
this case, a new financial liability based on 
the modified terms is recognised at fair value. 
The difference between the carrying amount 
of the financial liability extinguished and the 
new financial liability with modified terms is 
recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment Testing of financial Assets
The Company recognizes loss allowances 
using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for 
the financial assets which are not fair valued 
through profit and loss. Lifetime ECL allowance 
is recognized for trade receivables with no 
significant financing component. For all other 
financial assets, expected credit losses are 
measured at an amount equal to the 12-month 
ECL, unless there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk from initial recognition in which 
case they are measured at lifetime ECL. The 
amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) 
that is required to adjust the loss allowance at 
the reporting date is recognized in statement of 
profit and loss.
 
Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and the net amount presented in the balance 
sheet when, and only when, the Group currently 
has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
amounts and it intends either to settle them on 
a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
The Company enters into derivative financial 
instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward 
contracts and interest rate swaps, to manage its 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. Derivatives embedded in non-derivative 
host contracts that are not financial assets 
within the scope of Ind AS 109 are treated 
as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those 
of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not measured at FVTPL. Derivatives are 
initially recognised at fair value at the date the 
contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remea- sured to their fair value at the end of 
each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless 
the derivative is designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument, in which event the timing 
of the recognition in profit or loss depends on 
the nature of the hedging relationship and the 
nature of the hedged item.
Dividend
Final dividend proposed by the Board of 
Directors is recognized upon approval by the 
shareholders who have the right to decrease 
but not increase the amount of dividend 
recommended by the Board of Directors. Interim 
dividends are recognized on declaration by the 
Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend 
excludes dividend on treasury shares.
2.17  Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies 
new standards or amendments to the existing 
standards under Compa nies (Indian Accountin 
Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. 
For the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has 
not notified any new standards or amendments 
to the existing standards applicable to the 
Company.

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than 
its carrying amount.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impair-
ment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment 
of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity 
analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carry-
ing amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit.

Valuation Technique
Significant  
unobservable inputs
Inter-relationship between key  
observable inputs and fair  
value measurement
1.	
Relief from Royalty Method:  
A method in which the value of the 
asset is estimated based on the 
present value of royalty payments 
saved by owning the asset instead of 
taking it on lease. 
2.	
Greenfield Method: The method 
assumes that the intangible asset 
to be valued is the only asset to be 
valued is the only asset with all other 
tangible or intangible assets being 
created, leased or acquired. The 
Contributory asset charge generally 
deducted from the cash flows.

(vi)  Quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions is as shown below:
(vii)  Maturity profile of defined benefit payments:
(viii)  Discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian Government securities as at the  
          balance sheet date for the estimated term of the obligations.
(ix)    The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the  
          impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions  
          occurring at the end of the reporting period while holding all other assumptions constraint. In    
          practice it is unlikely to occur and change in some of the assumption may be correlated. When  
          calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions  
          the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected  
          unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the   
          defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.
(x)     The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation are after taking into   
          account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in  
          the employment market. The above information is as certified by the Actuary.
(xi)   The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change 
         compared to the prior period.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SECTION
Management of the Group has assessed that trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank 
balances, other financial assets, borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities and other financial liabilities 
approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be 
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
(i)  Fair value hierarchy
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives 
and equity securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period for identical 
assets or liabilities.These instruments are included in level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded 
bonds, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument 
is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and 
indemnification asset included in level 3.
There are no transfers among levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year
This section explains the judgement and estimates made in determining the fair value of  
financial assets that are:
(a)  Recognized and measured at Fair value
(b)  Measured at amortized cost and for which fair value is disclosed in financial statements

36.  Financial risk management objectives and policies
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks namely credit risk, interest risk, currency risk 
& liquidity risk. The Group’s primary focus is to achieve better predictability of financial markets and seek to minimize 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
The financial risks are managed in accordance with the Group’s risk management policy which has been approved by its 
Board of Directors.
(a)  Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk and currency risk. Financial instruments 
affected by market risk include loans deposits, and investments, and foreign currency receivables and payables. The 
sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at reporting date. The analysis exclude the impact 
of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of gratuity obligations and the non-financial assets and 
liabilities. The sensitivity of the relevant profit and loss item and equity is the effect of the assumed changes in the 
respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held as of March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024.
(i)  Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s major customers are located in international market due to which the Group 
is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions primarily with respect to the 
movement in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates 
relates primarily to the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in foreign currency). 
The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows established risk 
management policies approved by its Board of Directors.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency exposure at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Company’s profit before tax is due to 
changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities as given below:
At the Consolidated level the Group immaterial foreign currency exposure and therefore foreign currency 
sensitivity risk is not disclosed.
(ii) Interest rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term 
borrowings with variable rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of 
fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. All the existing borrowings of the Group carry fixed rate of 
interest and in functional currency. At 31 March 2025, the Group has following variable rate borrowings:
(b)  Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral 
obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum 
levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Group closely monitors its liquidity 
position and deploys a robust cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing 
through the use of short term bank deposits, short term loans, and cash credit facility etc. Processes and 
policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Group’s 
liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. The Group assessed the 
concentration of risk with respect to its debt and concluded it to be low.
The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rate. The 
impact on the Company’s profit before tax is due to changes in interest rate on borrowing:

Maturity profile of financial liabilities
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual 
undiscounted payments.
(c)  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations towards the Group and arises principally from the Group’s 
receivables from customers and deposits with banking institutions. The maximum amount of the credit 
exposure is equal to the carrying amounts of these receivables. Management has a credit policy in place 
and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
(i)  Trade Receivables
The customers are subjected to credit assessments as a precautionary measure, and the adherence of all 
customers to payment due dates is monitored on an on-going basis, thereby practically eliminating the risk 
of default.
Customer credit risk is managed by respective department head subject to the Group’s established policy, 
procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed 
at each reporting date on trade receivables by lifetime expected credit loss method based on provision 
matrix. The Group does not hold collateral as security. There is one single customer from whom the Group 
earns revenue of more than 10%, however, there is no credit default risk from this customer since the 
amount are generally received in advance. Refer note 9(a) for movement in credit loss allowance during the 
year.
(ii)  Financial instruments and deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury 
department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made in bank deposits 
and other risk free securities. The limits are set to minimize the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate 
financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments. The Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at March 31, 2025 is the carrying amounts . The Group’s 
maximum exposure relating to financial instrument is noted in liquidity table below.
