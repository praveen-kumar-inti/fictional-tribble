may increase the severity of extreme 
weather events such as cyclones and 
floods in our logistics and supply 
chains. In the next 3-5 years, our 
ESG priorities may require planned 
investments.
The Company implements 
global reporting standards 
to baseline and capture 
relevant data to evaluate its 
impact on climate change.

in ESG Rating to benchmark 
the relevance and gaps in 
the programs. The Company

several levels of checks which

product, vendor and the risks 
associated. We constantly 
strive to procure sustainably.
Negative

Business 
Continuity
Risk
Our environment—both geopolitically 
and in terms of regulations—is 
complicated. Unwanted events 
like natural disasters, workplace 
accidents, wars, sanctions, continuous 
cyberattacks, and other similar events 
can have a substantial negative impact 
on our operations and commitment to 
meet patient demands in the absence 
of strong business continuity plans and 
safeguards.
The Company has a robust 
Risk management strategy 
which helps in addressing, de-
risking and troubleshooting 
the emerging risks during 
the business operations. 
Strategies 
are 
thought 
through and solutions were 
built to keep the business

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Stakeholders are people, groups or organizations interested in the company either directly or indirectly and can influence or get 
impacted by its operations, goals, and policies. The primary stakeholders in NLL include investors, board members, workers, clients, 
suppliers, the community, and regulators. We believe businesses that spend time cultivating relationships of trust and a cooperative 
working environment with stakeholders succeed more. Effective stakeholder communication is, therefore, a key component of our 
approach. On the foundation of trust and respect, we have developed solid relationships with our stakeholders throughout the years. 
We communicate with them frequently through a variety of channels to learn about their needs and goals so that we can concentrate 
on meeting them.
