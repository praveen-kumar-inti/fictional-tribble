Risk 
Management 
(Including 
ESG risks)
Opportunity ABC Group Companies acknowledge 
the crucial role that effective risk 
management plays in achieving their 
business goals and creating long-
term value for their stakeholders. The 
Company is dedicated to managing 
a variety of risks, such as those 
associated with market fluctuations, 
and is aware of the intricate challenges 
presented by risks related to 
Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) factors, particularly climate 
change. ABC Group employs a data-
centric approach to risk management, 
underpinned by a comprehensive Risk 
Management Framework that has 
received the Board’s approval. There is 
potential for the Company to further 
improve its emphasis on integrating 
ESG considerations by updating its 
risk management framework to better 
address new and emerging risks. These 
include risks linked to ESG factors, 
climate change, and changes in the 
regulatory landscape of the financial 
services industry.
ABC Group has established a Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) 
tasked with the critical responsibility 
of supervising key aspects of 
risk management. The existing 
Risk Management Framework is 
thoughtfully crafted to actively detect, 
engage with, and lessen the impact 
of new risks in a timely and effective 
manner. This framework is in line with 
fundamental goals such as providing 
oversight, supporting strategic 
decisions with data, and maintaining 
strong internal controls, showcasing 
ABC Group’s commitment to tackling 
the evolving challenges head-on. By 
putting this extensive system into 
practice, ABC Group reinforces a culture 
that prioritizes policies and procedures 
designed to effectively counteract 
emerging risks. The RMC plays a pivotal 
role in overseeing the management 
of ESG and related risks within the 
organization, cultivating a proactive 
and flexible approach to managing and 
adapting to new risks in the current 
year, and their financial impacts.
Positive:
Leveraging its robust risk 
management framework and the 
vigilant oversight of the Committee, 
the Company has once again 
demonstrated its proficiency in 
managing emerging risks effectively. 
A proactive approach has enabled it 
to steer through uncertainties and 
maintain operational stability.
In the current year, ABC Group 
remains unwavering in its endeavors 
to enhance its performance on risk 
management, to proactively address 
unforeseen and evolving risks, 
including ESG and climate-change-
related risks, and its impact on the 
Company’s resources, assets and 
business performance.
This strategic focus highlights the 
Company’s dedication to staying 
agile and responsive in the face of 
evolving risks, and managing its 
financial impact.

Data Security 
and Privacy
Risk
The financial services industry 
is experiencing a significant 
transformation with the increasing 
move towards digitisation, which is 
changing operational models and 
introducing related risks, particularly in 
the areas of data security and privacy. 
As digitisation continues to evolve 
within the financial services sector, 
effectively managing cybersecurity 
risks and protecting the privacy of 
customer data are deemed critical 
priorities for the current year.
These risks have the potential to impact 
ABC Group’s core IT infrastructure, 
encompassing both internal and 
external databases, as well as the 
financial security of customers, which 
in turn could affect the Company’s 
reputation and standing in the 
marketplace.
ABC Group remains resolutely committed 
to upholding the confidentiality of its 
employees’ and customers’ data. Its 
strategy in this regard is anchored in 
a cohesive approach to data privacy 
compliance, which is applied uniformly 
across all subsidiaries and associate 
companies. ABC Group adheres to a 
robust set of principles and procedures 
that align with regulatory requirements 
to securely handle and protect 
customer data.
To counter risks such as data theft 
or cyber-attacks, the Company has 
established a sturdy reporting and 
resolution system for both customers 
and employees, and strong IT and data 
systems. These proactive steps also 
include the continuous reinforcement 
of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies.
As an affirmation of these efforts, 
we are proud to announce that in FY 
24, there have been no instances of 
security breaches or data loss incidents 
being reported.
Negative:
Potentially limiting or inadequate 
levels of investments in data 
security and privacy measures can 
have a negative impact on:
1.	
Preparedness for fraud or data 
breach attacks, and operational 
losses
2.	
Potential regulatory action 
(fines, penalties) taken because 
of limitations in IT, data and 
privacy-related systems
Corporate 
Governance
Risk
ABC Group prioritizes key governance 
issues such as business ethics, integrity, 
responsible business practices, and 
adherence to the changing regulatory 
requirements and disclosure obligations.
The fluctuating nature of financial 
markets, the ever-evolving regulatory 
environment in the financial services 
industry, and modifications in 
regulations concerning product 
offerings pose a variety of risks. 
These include the possibility that 
ABC Group’s processes and responses 
may be insufficient or not promptly 
adapted to such regulatory changes 
or requirements.
Additionally, the shifting landscape of 
regulatory demands and disclosures 
concerning Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) factors pose 
ESG-related risks. The Company 
is dedicated to proactively and 
effectively addressing these risks 
to ensure compliance and maintain 
its commitment to responsible 
corporate conduct.
ABC Group is unwavering in 
its commitment to fostering 
ethical business practices and 
upholding the highest standards of 
corporate governance.
To solidify this commitment, ABC Group 
has put in place extensive frameworks 
and policies that guide their operations 
and decision-making processes on 
governance.
At ABC Group, the Board of Directors 
takes an active role in overseeing the 
management of ESG-related risks 
and opportunities, ensuring strong 
governance practices throughout all 
subsidiary and associate companies.
Negative:
Shortcomings or limitations in the 
oversight and surveillance of ABC 
Group’s governance practices, as 
well as its compliance track record, 
can have a negative effect on the 
Company’s:
1.	
ESG Rating
2.	
Market Reputation (Indirect 
financial impact)
3.	
Potential to attract additional 
investment
4.	
Regulatory risks (Impact in 
terms of fines or penalties 
imposed)

Climate 
Strategy
Opportunity ABC Group is actively engaged in 
reducing their carbon footprint and 
addressing the changing impacts 
and risks related to climate change. 
Their initiatives in greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emission reduction, energy 
efficiency, water conservation, and 
waste management are recognized as 
opportunities to make a positive impact 
on the environment.
Moreover, these initiatives present 
an avenue to interact and share 
information with various stakeholders 
about Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) issues, reinforcing 
the Company’s image as an entity that 
is aware of ESG considerations and 
committed to social responsibility.
The Company regards their initiatives 
to mitigate the effects of climate 
change as a driving force for generating 
enduring value for stakeholders 
and effecting a sustainable, positive 
influence on the natural environment.
The Company has taken active 
steps, such as implementing waste 
composting at its corporate office in 
Mumbai, showcasing its translation of 
commitments into concrete actions on 
responsible environmental practices.
To further improve energy efficiency, 
there has been a continuous shift from 
traditional incandescent lighting to 
energy-saving LED lights across office 
spaces. Moreover, the Company is in the 
process of expanding its installation of 
solar panels at selected office locations, 
signaling a stronger move towards 
renewable energy and a reduction in 
carbon footprint.
Positive:
The Company’s steadfast dedication 
to adapting to the challenges 
posed by climate change can lead 
to positive impact on improved 
risk management (physical and 
transition risk), and the Company’s 
investment attractiveness to global, 
EGS-aware investors
Employee

holistic well-being of its employees,

insurance products from the Company’s 
range.
Through such initiatives, the Company 
sees an opportunity to empower its 
employees to take charge of their 
health and to be at their best, both 
professionally and personally.
Positive:
Cultivating an environment that 
prioritizes holistic well-being can aid 
ABC Group in its endeavors to: 
1.	
Support the personal growth 
and development of its 
employees, enabling them to 
achieve their full potential, and

the benefits of a productive

women, micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs), and youth.

enhancing revenue streams.

Precise identification of key 
target segments and a thorough 
understanding of their financial 
requirements.

Development of value-added 
products that are tailored based 
on a needs assessment and adhere

transformation of operational 
processes, encompassing customer 
experience and service, offers ABC 
Group the chance to:
1.	
Utilize technology and unify data 
systems throughout ABC Group, 
enabling sustained growth of the 
customer base.
2.	
Further improve service delivery

3. Move towards a paperless 
processing cycle within its 
operations.
ABC Group has implemented strong 
monitoring and verification mechanisms 
to manage the risks that come with the 
digitalization of their operations.
Key strategies include the use of 
DigiLocker for KYC processes, eSign for 
digital signatures, and the application 
of analytics-driven models to inform 
decisions in lending, investment, and 
insurance sectors.
These ongoing digital processes are 
critical in overseeing and mitigating 
new risks, enabling the acquisition of 
customers without physical contact, 
reducing the time needed to complete 
processes (Turnaround Time, or TAT), 
and lessening the reliance on paper-
based documentation. With a continued 
focus on digitalization, ABC Group aims 
to provide a frictionless customer 
experience, improve operational 
efficiencies, and support environmental 
sustainability by moving from paper to 
digital formats.
Positive:
Focusing on digitalization can help 
the Company further its support 
to its customer base, in terms of 
improvements in connectivity, 
interoperability, TAT, grievance 
resolution, and the overall customer 
journey and experience. Leveraging 
the power of One ABC can help in 
an expansion of the customer base, 
with a positive impact on business 
growth and revenue streams
Customer 
Satisfaction 
and 
Relationship

effects on the brand and 
reputation in the market.
2.	
Customer Acquisition: Impacts 
on customer acquisition and any 
expansion plans.
3.	
Existing Customer Base: Potential 
repercussions on the existing 
customer base
To mitigate risks such as customer 
complaints, ABC Group has put in 
place comprehensive systems and 
channels for grievance resolution. These 
include both face-to-face and digital 
platforms for addressing customer 
issues, complemented by an escalation 
hierarchy for grievances that are not 
promptly resolved.
With a focus on customer-centricity 
in all its operations and procedures, 
ABC Group is dedicated to delivering a 
satisfactory and positive experience for 
its customers.
Negative:
Customer dissatisfaction or any 
challenges in delivering a positive 
experience can have a direct effect 
on:
1.	
Customer trust levels
2.	
Potential for customer 
acquisition and retention
3.

Reputation 
Management
Opportunity The Company’s dedication to putting 
customers first, and managing its 
reputation effectively is viewed as 
a chance to maintain its status as 
a preferred provider of financial 
services in India. ABC Group is 
continually implementing actions 
to protect and further cement their 
brand and reputation, with a focus on 
responsibility, ethical practices, and 
prioritizing the well-being of people.
This commitment opens up prospects 
to capitalize on the existing widespread 
network across India and to reinforce 
the Company’s position as a leading 
institution that is conscious of ESG 
factors. The increasing importance 
of ESG in both the Indian context and 
the financial services sector offers the 
Company the opportunity to develop 
and broaden their range of products 
and initiatives that align with ESG 
principles.
To counteract risks such as 
greenwashing or the misrepresentation 
of the Company’s achievements 
in ESG areas, ABC Group has taken 
steps to ensure that its sustainability 
communications are authenticated 
and reflect the genuine advancements 
made across all sectors.
The focus is on providing stakeholders 
with thorough and validated 
information, as well as updates on 
the Company’s progress. ABC Group is 
dedicated to preserving its reputation 
as a prominent organization that is 
aware of and actively engaged in ESG 
practices.
Positive:
By dedicating specific resources to 
prioritize and implement reputation 
management strategies, ABC Group 
can improve their standing as a 
responsible provider of financial 
services.
Adopting this proactive stance can 
contribute to the Company’s growth 
and add to its efforts in value 
creation.
Community 
development
Opportunity The Company’s commitment to 
community development is centered 
on building and strengthening 
communities. ABC Group makes 
significant contributions to community 
betterment through CSR initiatives 
carried out under ‘The Aditya Birla 
Centre for Community Initiatives and 
Rural Development.’
ABC Group sees community 
development as a valuable opportunity 
to interact with and support 
communities throughout India, 
with involvement spanning several 
areas such as education, healthcare, 
sustainable livelihoods, financial 
inclusion, and the empowerment of 
women.
Additionally, ABC Group considers 
community development as an 
opportunity to promote fairness and 
socio-economic growth on a large scale 
within the country.
To manage and alleviate potential 
risks or complaints related to 
stakeholder engagement in its CSR 
activities, ABC Group have set up 
a grievance resolution mechanism. 
Through consistent interaction with 
implementation partners, such as NGOs, 
the Company is able to effectively 
address any issues raised by the 
beneficiaries of its CSR initiatives.
Negative:
The inefficient administration 
of community development 
programmes, resources and 
practices for engaging stakeholders 
could adversely affect the 
Company’s reputation.
Challenges such as financial resource 
mismanagement for example can 
impact community trust levels, 
and in turn, programme scope, 
expenditures, effectiveness, and 
compliance with requirements such 
as overall level of expenditures on 
community development (CSR).

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements.
As a purpose-led organization and a leading provider of diverse financial services in India, the Company continues to prioritize sustainability 
and ESG as a core pillar in its pursuit of creating long-term value for its people, and the planet. As part of our sustainability strategy, our 
focus remains on taking efforts to minimize our impact on the environment and adapting to the multi-faceted challenges posted by climate 
change and ESG-related issues.
The Company continues to proactively take efforts to manage its impact on the natural environment, reduce its emissions, and positively 
impact the lives of its key stakeholders – especially its workforce, customers, and local communities.
In line with the Company’s purpose-led commitment to build responsible businesses and institutions that inspire trust, the Company is proud 
to share the progress in the past year on key ESG-related issues. By proactively incorporating ESG and sustainability in the way we manage 
our business, growth objectives, and how serve our stakeholders, we have achieved significant progress. This progress is captured through 
positive outcomes we have achieved across areas including emissions and waste management, strengthening our employee workforce 
and supporting their holistic well-being, and continuing our commitment to support inclusive growth, financial inclusion, and community 
development in underserved areas.
We are committed to continue working towards protecting our natural environment and prioritizing a focus on responsible and 
environmentally sustainable practices. At two of our primary corporate offices in Mumbai, we have prioritized the use of green energy in our 
premises – translating our commitment towards emissions reduction into a reality. Through partnerships with our trusted vendors, in FY24, 
the Company successfully recycled over 34 MT of waste, including continued momentum in recycling waste types such as sanitary napkins.

On the people management front, we continue to focus on creating a vibrant, diverse and inclusive work environment, and dedicate 
resources and efforts towards championing diversity in our workforce. Celebrating diversity, promoting inclusion, and cultivating a sense of 
belonging are key focus areas in our efforts to empower our workforce. We have continued to build on the momentum achieved in enhancing 
women’s representation across our companies. We have seen consistent progress made on this front – with women’s representation at ABCL 
now standing at 31% as of FY24. In addition to maternity benefits, through measures for example for new mothers in the form of day care 
support, we have continued to prioritize efforts to holistically support our diverse workforce.

services to our diverse customer base. Our efforts remain to expand our offerings in a digitized manner, and to underserved segments,

ABC Group has adopt 
the recycling of sanitary 
napkins/pads through the 
reputed menstrual hygiene 
management company, Pad 
Card, which leverages its 
patented innovation called 
‘PadCareX’.
In order to switch to a more sustainable 
solution to sanitary waste disposal, the 
Company has tied up with Padcare Labs – to 
recycle sanitary hygiene pads, preventing 
landfill pollution and incineration that causes 
air pollution.
For ABC Group, this began in its Mumbai offices, 
and the Company has now expanded this 
initiative across locations, including in Noida 
and Chennai.
In FY24 alone, we have supported the recycling 
of over 950 Kgs of sanitary pads – helping make 
a milestone contribution in our efforts towards 
diverting waste from landfills and preventing/
reducing air pollution.
As a result of our efforts, in FY24, we have saved 
over 19,000 Litres of landﬁll area - by redirecting 
the waste to make paper from its recycled output.

Outcome of the initiative
4.
Composting food waste
At our Mumbai offices, the wet waste, including 
the food waste from the on-site cafeteria, 
has been composted in/by an Organic Waste 
Compost Machine (OWC).
The manure generated from the Organic Waste 
Machine is used for the plantations and horticulture 
of the Mumbai office properties.
Thus, the wet waste is recycled and re-used 
efficiently and sustainably in the form of compost.
5.
Auto Power Generated and 
Conserved System (APGC) 
has been installed in urinals 
- to replace old battery-
powered sensors.
APGC is an innovative solution where the 
power required to operate an automatic urinal 
flushing system is auto generated by the 
flushing system itself.
	y It helps save water and power into urinals for 
hygienic flushing.
	y This helps save heavy battery consumption and 
external electric power consumption.
	y APGC conserves power through advanced micro-
chip technology that enables the system to 
function 24x7 with continuous and steady power 
supply.
6.
Introduced centralized bins 
across our branches
Differently labelled bins have been placed 
across office spaces, to segregate waste 
generated by category (dry waste, wet waste)
This initiative has helped the Company further 
improve its recycling levels, and to help avoid the 
issue of mixing up of different waste categories for 
e.g. in bins placed under desks

To efficiently manage consumer complaints and feedback, the Company has established a four-tiered grievance mechanism 
that also leverages AI technologies such as Chat Bots and e-Bots, in addition to traditional email and call services.
	
This system enables consumers to easily contact the Company and have grievances addressed through an established 
escalation matrix. Additionally, the Company routinely carries out customer satisfaction surveys to gather feedback at 
different points in the customer’s journey.

feedback. For example, ABHFL offers customers the option to raise any grievance pertaining to services provided or to report 
any improper misconduct by ABHFL or its representatives through its Customer Service Helpline on 1800-270-7000, via email 
at care.housingfinance@adityabirlacapital.com, in writing, addressed to ABHFL’s corporate office in R Tech Park, Mumbai, or
