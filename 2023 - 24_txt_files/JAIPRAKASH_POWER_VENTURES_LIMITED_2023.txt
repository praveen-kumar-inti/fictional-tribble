diversify their energy sources by 
investing in renewable energy 
projects. 
By 
incorporating 
renewable energy technologies,

generation portfolio, the company 
can reduce their reliance on 
fossil fuels and contribute to the 
decarbonisation of the energy 
sector.

energy, contributing to a 
greener power supply.
