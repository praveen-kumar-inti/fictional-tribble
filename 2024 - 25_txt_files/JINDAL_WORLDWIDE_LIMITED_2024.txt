development. BRSR covers topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, 
aiming to promote transparency and accountability.

1.
Product 
Design and 
Innovation
O
In the dynamic textile 
market, staying competitive 
and current can be 
achieved through product 
design and innovation. 
By embracing emerging 
technologies and materials, 
textile manufacturers 
can seize new market 
prospects and enhance 
their operational efficiency 
and productivity. 
Furthermore, innovation 
in textile materials and 
manufacturing processes 
hold the potential to reduce 
the industry’s environmental 
footprint.
The Company is 
continuously investing in 
new innovative technologies 
across spinning, weaving 
and processing to bring 
differentiated products to its 
customers. One very large 
opportunity to leverage 
is ‘Recycling’. It ties into 
12th goal of SDG of UN 
hence it is very relevant for 
customers.
Positive 
In this increasingly 
competitive environment, 
customers value product 
design and innovation- they 
prefer to work
with suppliers who offer 
them innovation across 
process, products and 
costs.

(Indicate positive or

2.
Carbon 
Emissions 
and Energy 
R
The process of production 
in a textile company can 
contribute notably to its 
carbon footprint. Besides 
greenhouse gases (GHGs), 
the manufacturing process 
might also release other 
air pollutants such as 
sulphur dioxides (SOx), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
and other harmful airborne 
substances.
The Company has 
successfully initiated usage 
of sustainable 
fuels like biomass for 
generating steam. This 
is replacing coal thereby 
reducing GHG emissions. 
Company is increasing 
the usage of energy from 
renewable resources (solar 
panels) to address scope 1 
energy consumption.
Positive 
Brands globally have high 
traction for reduction of 
GHG emissions. This is 
viewed as an opportunity 
in terms of increase in 
business as brands 
have favourable outlook 
towards Company’s 
environmental initiatives.
3.
Water and 
Wastewater 
R
Water plays a pivotal role 
in production processes. 
Businesses with operations 
that consume large 
amounts of water may 
encounter increased risks 
of operational interruptions 
due to water scarcity. This 
can also cause a surge in 
water procurement costs 
and capital investments. 
Concurrently, manufacturing 
activities produce process 
wastewater that needs to be 
treated prior to discharge. 
Failure to adhere to water 
quality standards could lead 
to expenses associated with 
regulatory compliance and 
mitigation.
The Company has installed 
a wastewater recovery 
facility.
Positive 
As the Company is into 
B2B business, water 
conservation is viewed 
positively by customers. 
Therefore, the Company will 
be a preferred supplier to 
these customers.
4.
Waste 
R
Waste is generally 
produced as a by-
product of a company’s 
operational activities, 
machinery maintenance, 
and administrative 
tasks. Inadequate waste 
management could lead 
to air pollution, climate 
change, and a range 
of direct and indirect 
consequences on the 
ecosystem. It may also pose 
health and safety risks.
At Company we recycle 
and re-use process waste 
as well as post industrial 
waste.
Positive 
In order to meet 
sustainable goals 
companies around the 
globe are preferring to work 
with suppliers who can 
offer fabrics with recycled 
components. The Company 
meets with these categories 
and will continue to meet 
in future and gain more 
business opportunities.

(Indicate positive or

5.
Responsible 
R
Hazardous chemicals 
can pose threats to the 
health and safety of both 
employees and consumers 
who interact with the 
products. 
Various nations enforce 
limitations or prohibitions 
on the usage of certain 
substances, and non-
compliance with these 
regulations can lead to 
legal difficulties and fines. 
Also, the Company is 
responsible for controlling 
any risks associated with 
storage and manipulation 
of hazardous chemicals. 
Inappropriate handling of 
these substances, including 
spills, can inflict damage on 
the environment and human 
health, while also 
exposing the Company to 
hefty fines and potential 
damage to its reputation.
There is a robust Chemical 
Management System (CMS) 
in place at the Company. 
This has resulted in our 
facilities getting certified for 
credible certifications like 
ZDHC, OEKOTEX, GOTS. 
This CMS is continuously 
monitored by 3rd party 
auditors.
Negative 
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms of 
loss of business if the CMS 
is not complied with.
6.
Employee 
Wellbeing
R
Greater employee retention 
often signifies effective 
company policies and 
practices. Conversely, 
a high rate of employee 
turnover 
could signal low employee 
satisfaction to potential 
investors. Prioritizing 
employee welfare can 
enhance team morale and 
lower 
costs associated with 
recruitment and new 
employee integration.
During the year under 
review, safety & skill 
upgradation training was 
given to all the employees 
of the Company.
Negative
7.
Human 
Rights
R
Violation of human 
rights can lead to legal 
consequences, reputational 
damage, and loss of 
investor confidence.
The Company ensures 
respect, dignity, fairness, 
and human rights of all 
our members. Our anti-
discrimination Policy 
covers this. The Company 
has procedures in place 
including an internal code of 
conduct.

Product 
Quality & 
Safety
R
In the textile industry, 
ensuring safety and 
product quality is of 
utmost importance for any 
business. Emphasizing 
product quality and safety 
not only helps the sector 
enhance its reputation, 
but also builds customer 
loyalty, gains a competitive 
advantage, 
reduces liability risks and 
ensures compliance with 
regulations. By investing 
in the quality and safety 
of their products, textile 
manufacturers can secure 
their long-term success and 
sustainability.
There is a robust Process 
Control and Quality 
Assurance System in 
place. This is backed by a 
100% inspection of goods 
before dispatch. Thanks to 
this, there have been ‘Zero’ 
incidents of 
product recall on account 
of safety.
Negative 
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms of 
loss of business if the safety 
and quality standards are 
not met.
9.
Workplace
Health & 
Safety
R
Failure to ensure the health 
and safety of workers can 
lead to financial penalties 
and legal consequences. 
Serious incidents can 
result in severe injuries and 
potential liabilities due to 
legal or regulatory actions. 
Health and safety risks can 
also lead to project delays 
and downtime, which in turn 
increase project costs and 
reduce profitability.
There is a skilled and 
empowered safety team 
at the locations of the 
Company. It has 
implemented the right 
processes and takes up 
regular training sessions 
backed up by safety drills. 
Safety monitoring metrics 
like:
1.	
Accident Frequency
2.	
Accident Severity Rate 
and
3.	
Accident Incident 
Rate are regularly 
monitored and 
recorded by the Head 
of Safety
Negative 
It can have a very large 
negative impact in terms 
of loss of business if the 
workplace health and 
safety standards are not 
met.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
I am delighted to present our inaugural Sustainability Report, a reflection of our unwavering commitment to 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. At Jindal, we are dedicated to making sustainability 
a core part of our operations in the textile manufacturing industry. Our journey is marked by challenges such 
as combating climate change, promoting responsible consumption and production, and ensuring access to 
clean water and sanitation. We have transformed these challenges into opportunities by actively developing and 
implementing strategies to address them.
	
A key achievement in our sustainability efforts is the shift to sustainable fuels for steam generation, replacing coal 
and significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. To further reduce our energy consumption, we have 
embraced renewable energy by expanding our use of solar panels. Our commitment to water stewardship is 
demonstrated through the installation of a wastewater recovery and Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) water treatment 
facility, which enables us to treat and reuse process water, reducing water wastage.
	
Our robust waste management system allows us to recycle and reuse both process waste and post-industrial 
waste. Additionally, we have implemented a stringent Chemical Management System (CMS), which has earned 
us certifications such as ZDHC, OEKO-TEX, and GOTS, ensuring compliance with global standards. Our 
commitment to quality assurance is reflected in our rigorous process control and 100% inspection of goods 
before dispatch, resulting in zero product recalls due to safety concerns.
	
We continue to invest in innovative technologies across spinning, weaving, and processing to deliver high-quality 
products. Our safety team enforces strict safety protocols, with regular training and monitoring, ensuring a safe 
work environment. As we move forward, we remain committed to continuous improvement and confident that, with 
support of all our stakeholders, we will achieve our ambitious sustainability goals.

The Company is committed to cultivating a safety-centric culture across all levels of our organization, focusing 
on behavior-based safety and process safety among our workforce. We are actively implementing strategies to 
strengthen control processes and unit operations as part of our safety enhancement efforts. Regular safety audits 
are conducted at our plants to identify and rectify any safety gaps that may arise.
	
Our safety protocols emphasize several key measures:
	
Ensuring that emergency exits are easily accessible in all workplaces, installing safety guards on machines, 
and mandating the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for all plant employees. Additionally, we have 
implemented automated fire detection and control systems and maintain round-the-clock availability of fire 
extinguishers and fire tender services.
	
We firmly believe in the preventability of occupational illnesses, safety incidents, and environmental hazards. To 
ensure a safe and healthy workplace, our facilities undergo regular internal and external audits. To mitigate fire 
risks, pressurized fire protection systems have been strategically installed throughout our premises.
	
In prioritizing emergency preparedness, we conduct regular training sessions, mock drills, safety talks, and 
seminars for our employees and workers. These initiatives are designed to raise awareness and equip our 
personnel with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage emergencies.

The Company is committed to expanding its use of renewable energy sources, particularly through the 
implementation of solar panels, as part of its ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. By transitioning to 
renewable energy, our aim is to significantly decrease harmful air pollutants and eliminate greenhouse gas 
emissions linked to fossil fuels. Additionally, we have successfully integrated sustainable fuels like biomass 
for steam generation in our operations. Approximately 10-30% of poultry waste is utilized as an alternative to 
coal in our captive power plant, effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative not only mitigates 
environmental impact but also helps alleviate various forms of air pollution. Moreover, we have implemented 
energy-efficient measures such as replacing electricity-intensive dosing in wastewater treatment with gravity 
dosing and installing Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to minimize energy consumption.
