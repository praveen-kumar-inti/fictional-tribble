climatic glass façade with motorized blinds, etc. for energy 
saving.

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for 
	
sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
Considering the business activities of the Company, 
this question has limited applicability. As a NBFC, 
REC’s resource use is mainly limited to electricity, 
office supplies and communication or IT equipment.
	
Being a NBFC, REC is less resource-intensive in terms 
of material requirements. Despite the limited scope, 
REC ensures responsible sourcing of all its material 
requirements. The Company promotes GeM portal 
(Government e-Marketplace) in its procurements 
and also promotes sourcing from MSE vendors. All 
procurement / sourcing of material and services is 
done as per the procedure defined in the Procurement 
Guidelines of the Company.
	
Further, REC required its borrowers of conventional 
energy projects, to follow all applicable environmental 
norms, as a part of its loan disbursement conditions. 
REC also finances renovation and modernization of 
old thermal power plants and installation of pollution 
control equipment, with the overall objective of 
safeguarding the environment and reducing emission 
of harmful oxides and particular matter.
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced 
sustainably?
	
In terms of material requirements, REC has made it 
mandatory to procure common use goods & services 
available on GeM (Government e-Marketplace) 
portal, with purchase preference to MII/MSEs as per 
Government directives. During the financial year 
2022-23, REC not only achieved but exceeded its 
target for procurement from GeM. The procurement 
from GeM portal was 89.28% in respect of MoU and 
procurement from MSEs was 55.01%. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim 
your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and 
(d) other waste.
	
Given the nature of business and operations, the 
Company does not have material plastic waste, 
e-waste and other waste. Further, the Company does 
not have any hazardous waste.
	
Further, the Company has such mechanism in which 
most of the products are used made of recycled 
plastic and also reduced plastic use to very minimal 
and encourages use of substitutes such as jute bags, 
cloth bags etc.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is 
applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Not Applicable, since REC is a NBFC and is not involved in 
manufacturing of any kind of product.
	
LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/
Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service 
industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?
	
Being a NBFC categorized as IFC, the main products offered 
by REC include rupee term loans, short-term and medium-
term loans etc. to borrowers for schemes and projects in 
the entire power and infrastructure & logistics sector value 
chain. Further, as nodal agency for various programmes of 
the Government of India, REC contributes towards the overall 
development of power sector.
	
The loan products are developed in line with the market 
norms, borrower requirements and applicable statutory and 
regulatory provisions of RBI and/or any other regulators. 
Details of loan products offered by the Company are available 
at the website at https://recindia.nic.in/financial-products. 
	
REC has prepared Environmental Social Impact Analysis (ESIA) 
report, under Official Development Assistance - KfW-III, which 
is applicable for financing renewable energy projects. The 
same serves as the roadmap for REC to address environmental 
& social issues in financing renewable power projects.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products 
/ services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same 
along-with action taken to mitigate the same.

Other Financial Services 
and Activities - Other Credit 
Granting
No 
significant

REC is not a manufacturing Company. However, as a part of its 
appraisal process for all the power project it finances, REC identifies 
and assess the potential environmental risks of the projects. 
Environmental issues, if any, are identified through due diligence, 
site visits and review of applicable complainces etc. 
REC is also financing installation of pollution control equipment 
in thermal power plants, in line with Government directives. 
This includes installation of Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGDs), 
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Electrostatic Precipitators 
(ESP), which contribute towards curbing of harmful emissions and 
particulate matter. During the financial year, REC has sanctioned 7 
projects for installation of pollution control equipment, with total 
loan amount of ₹1,647.08 crore.

3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for manufacturing industry)

to MSEs, out of which 4% is reserved for MSEs owned 
by SC, ST and 3% is reserve MSEs owned by women 
entrepreneurs for all cases where L1 vendor is other 
than MSE vendors by allowing MSE vendors for 
price matching with L1 if MSE bidders have quoted 
price within the band of L1+15%, wherever splitting 
is feasible. The Company extends various facilities in

corrective measures.  The Key objectives for the Consumer 
Service Index are:

To create a minimum set of parameters related to quality 
and reliability of electricity supply and consumer service
•	
Track performance of DISCOMs across these aspects 
over a period of time
•	
Develop a spirit of healthy competition amongst 
DISCOMs to enhance consumer experience

best practices and promote inter-se learning.

of Power Management and Training (RECIPMT), which 
caters to the training and development needs of engineers 
and managers of power sector organizations across the
