8.82 To provide sustainable power for our operations, we have constructed a 16 
MW solar power generation plant at Sarod Village, Bharuch District, Gujarat to 
provide electricity to our current operational three manufacturing facilities, 
which became operational in Fiscal 2023. This Solar Power plant will cater to 
the day units of our electricity for 3 of our manufacturing facilities. We have 
installed a Solvent Recovery Plant (SRP) to reduce waste generation. We have 
tied up with government affiliated agencies to dispose-off liquid/ powder 
chemical waste post treatment at our end. Further, order of 15 MW hybrid 
power plant is also awarded.
The company consistently evaluates R&D expenditures, the R&D Expenditure is meant for the R&D side of the

social and environmental considerations, the company demonstrates its commitment to sustainable practices 
and responsible decision-making aligned with long-term business objectives.
(B)Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? If yes, what percentage of inputs were 
sourced sustainably? 
Yes. The company is dedicated to incorporating social, ethical, and environmental considerations throughout

used in the operations. However, the company always ensures that the inputs are obtained through
sustainable means. 
(C) Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end

As a company operating within the chemical sector, we acknowledge the significance of minimizing waste and 
lessening our environmental footprint. To this end, we've instituted a comprehensive waste recycling initiative 
aimed at diminishing waste generation and discovering inventive methods for its reuse or recycling. Our 
program encompasses several key initiatives: 
Waste Reduction: 
We've implemented strategies to curtail waste production through more efficient production methods, 
reduced raw material usage, and optimized supply chain management. 
Waste Segregation:  
Ensuring recyclable materials are separated from non-recyclables maximizes our ability to reuse or recycle 
waste. 
Recycling Partnerships: 
Collaborating with local recycling facilities and specialists allows us to recycle waste effectively, including 
operating our Solvent Recovery Plant. 
Education and Training: 
Providing employees with education and training on waste reduction and recycling fosters awareness and 
participation in environmental stewardship. 
Innovation: 
Investing in research and development enables us to explore novel technologies and processes for 
repurposing waste materials into new products. Our waste recycling endeavours have not only reduced our 
environmental impact but also led to new business opportunities and cost savings. Embracing a circular 
economy model allows us to conserve resources, diminish waste, and deliver value to our customers and 
stakeholders. 
Overall, we view our waste recycling program as integral to our sustainability commitment and responsible 
business conduct. We remain steadfast in our dedication to discovering fresh, innovative approaches to 
curbing our environmental impact and building a more sustainable future.

Currently the Company does not conduct LCA, but have made the decision to conduct Life Cycle Assessments 
(LCA) for all of our products wherein we will be analysing the environmental impact of our products from their 
initial creation all the way through their use and eventual disposal. 
Conducting LCAs offers several advantages. Firstly, it allows us to identify areas where we can reduce our

materials, or improving end-of-life disposal methods, it also it aligns with our vision of being a responsible 
corporate and creating a positive impact on the environment for future generations.

(D)Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation. 
 
The entity has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism. The ZLD plant is designed to treat 
wastewater and minimize the amount of liquid waste produced. Here is a breakdown of the treatment process. 
Industrial effluent from the various stages of the process is collected and treated in an Effluent, Treatment 
Plant having primary treatment facility. The effluent is first collected in Collection tank. The effluent is then 
transferred into Equalization cum Neutralization tank and retained for enough time, where pH of the effluent is 
raised to 8.5 by addition of lime solution from lime dosing tank. Effluent is then pumped to primary settling 
tank, where suspended particles are settled. The primary treated effluent is collected into a collection tank. 
The settled sludge from primary settling tank is dewatered and dried in a Filter Press. The filtrate collected is 
returned to the neutralization tank for treatment. The dried sludge is sent to the TSDF site for secured land 
filling. Then the primary treated effluent is Going for stripper to Remove Low Volatile Organic and Bottom 
Material Is Going for Evaporation in MEE/MVR. The Condensate from Evaporation System is transfer for 
Secondary treatment (SBT Plant).

(C)Provide details of the following disclosures related to water, in the following format
SBT Treatment: 
SBT is based in bioconversion process where fundamental action of nature namely, respiration, Mineral 
weathering and photosynthesis are brought about in a controlled media containing Selected micro and macro-
organisms. Accordingly in the said process three fundamental Reactions of this plant viz. 1) respiration brings 
about removal of organics by oxidation of the Organic molecules 2) mineral weathering brings about pH 
correction 3) while photosynthesis Serves to regulate the process at work.In coming pH is in range of 6-7 and 
has to be adjusted with lime treatment before taking to the filter (this is done in neutralization section). 
Advanced Oxidation is provided as treatment using ozone generator to break down molecules to smaller size 
and to improve BOD/COD ratio. This biological treatment is a batch processes in which wastewater is pumped 
and applied into the top surface of the Bioreactor as shown in Figure. The design has suitable provision for 
manual removal of suspended solids from the bio-filter surface. Distribution of wastewater over the media is 
achieved via pumping, piping and distribution arrangements. Separate distribution lines are provided for raw 
wastewater as well as recycle water. The suspended Water first percolates through the bioreactor media which 
in houses cultured media in 40-60 mm and gets collected into the collection tank. It can then be pumped on 
to the media again (recycling) in order to achieve maximum solid liquid contact. The recirculation mode is 
provided for further polishing of the effluent. Dissolved organic and inorganic are oxidized and the water is 
purified further. The SBT Treated Effluent  is feed in to R. O. Plant. From R. O. Plant, R. O. Permeate water is 
recycle in to Utilities .  Reject Water is subjected to Evaporation and Condensate is Recycle to Utility.
