hazardous waste in a safe manner. The Company safely and responsibly disposes such waste via authorized recyclers 
and ﬁles returns with the appropriate statutory bodies.  Also, the Company has optimized its processes to the point 
where the majority of the waste produced is recycled and reused in its own operations. As a result, the amount of 
waste which is disposed of is minimal.
