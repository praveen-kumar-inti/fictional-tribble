Corporate Overview
26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
A materiality assessment is an essential tool to identify, evaluate, and address stakeholder expectations, preferences, and 
priorities. In FY 2024-2025, a materiality assessment was conducted to identify and prioritize key Environment, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) topics. This process involved secondary research of global standards and frameworks such as SASB, 
MSCI, and DJSI, along with an industry peer review.
	
Additionally, management discussions were held with identified internal and external stakeholders (investors, vendors, NGO 
partners) to gather their perspectives on the most relevant "material aspects" for the business. A materiality assessment 
survey further solicited stakeholder input, rating the importance of various aspects on a high-to-low scale. The integration 
of stakeholder feedback and secondary research culminated in the identification and prioritization of material topics. The 
finalized list of selected material topics is as follows. Each material topic is aligned with relevant Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDG), contributing collectively to the broader agenda of global sustainable development.

Governance, Leadership, and Oversight
7.	
Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
At JM Financial, our journey is rooted in a purpose-led approach that places Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles 
at the very heart of our strategy. We view ESG as a standalone initiative, but as an integrated path that shapes how we operate, 
innovate, and create value. Our vision continues to build a resilient, responsible, and future-ready organization—one that aligns financial 
performance with positive societal and environmental impact. This belief forms the cornerstone of our identity, guiding how we engage 
with clients, partners, communities, and our people. Our ESG journey is driven by the conviction that purpose and performance are not 
mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing.
To deliver on this commitment, we have established five key Leadership Objectives that define our transformation roadmap:
1. 	 Cultural Transformation – We are embedding sustainability thinking across the organization by nurturing a values-driven culture. 
Through training, transparent communication, and inclusive dialogue, we are equipping our people to think toward impact, innovation, 
and long-term stewardship. We have established Thrive a structured initiative to invest in employee growth, well-being, collaboration 
and community engagement.
2. 	 Innovation & Sustainable Operations – Our business processes are being reimagined to reduce environmental impact, improve 
operational efficiency, and adopt sustainable technologies. From carbon-conscious decision-making to green infrastructure, we are 
taking steps to a sustainable and low carbon footprint future.
3. 	 Ethical Oversight – We have assessed our governance framework to strengthen integrity, accountability, and ethical behaviour at all 
levels. Oversight mechanisms are in place to ensure that all decisions are aligned with our ESG values and corporate purpose.
4. 	 Regulatory Alignment – As the regulatory landscape evolves, we remain proactive in aligning with global and local ESG standards. 
Our internal policies are continuously updated to reflect compliance, while also advocating for responsible business practices across 
our value chain.
5. 	 Responsible Investing and Stakeholder Empowerment – We are designing services that are socially and environmentally 
responsible. Our focus is on delivering long-term value to clients through sustainability-oriented offerings, while fostering trust and 
transparency in every stakeholder interaction.
As part of our sustainability journey, we place strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement, inclusive leadership, and embedding ESG 
principles across all levels of the organization. We recognize that a sustainable future can only be achieved through collaboration, 
innovation, and accountability. Our leadership is dedicated to fostering a workplace culture that is not only diverse and inclusive, but also 
one that encourages purpose-led thinking, continuous learning, and ethical decision-making. We have created an environment where 
every individual feels empowered to contribute meaningfully, and where sustainability is not just a strategy but a shared responsibility. 
Through structured training, transparent dialogue, and strategic alignment, we are cultivating a culture that supports long-term business 
success and social impact.
Our commitment towards a sustainable future is reflected in our business actions across verticals:
Investment Banking: As one of the leading financial service providers, JMFL has consistently demonstrated its commitment to driving 
sustainable economic transformation through innovative deal-making and strategic advisory. Our Investment Banking division plays a 
pivotal role in channelling capital toward environmentally and socially responsible sectors. With a firm belief in the power of finance to 
accelerate positive change, we have successfully executed 25 ESG-aligned deals to date. These include impactful transactions in solar 
pump deployment, waste treatment infrastructure, plastic recycling, electric mobility, renewable energy, MSME financing, hospitals, 
housing finance, and NBFCs. Each of these deals reflects our determination to support the transition to a greener, more inclusive 
economy, while delivering lasting value to stakeholders.
Private Equity - Our Private Equity business remains committed to responsible investing and integrates ESG considerations throughout 
the investment lifecycle. We actively seek out and support companies that demonstrate strong alignment with sustainable and inclusive 
growth. For instance, Fund’s investment in Zoff Spices supports sustainable innovation through its partnership with BigHaat to source 
pesticide-free spices from responsible farms, while also empowering farmers and women-led communities. Similarly, Balwaan Krishi 
is driving sustainable agriculture by developing fuel-efficient, low-emission equipment for smallholder farmers, emphasizing durability, 
repairability, and education around responsible agri-input use. Our broader portfolio reflects this ESG focus, with investments in companies 
such as API Holdings and Aarman Solutions—leaders in accessible healthcare, BigHaat Agro Private Limited—enhancing efficiency in 
agri-input and output supply chains, and Energy Beverages Private Limited (CLEAR Premium Water)—pioneering sustainable packaging 
and energy-efficient production. We remain steadfast in our approach to partner with businesses that are not only financially sound but 
also champions of environmental and social responsibility.
JM Financial Limited

Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) (Contd.)
Portfolio Management Services - Our Portfolio Management Services (PMS) business is committed to responsible investing, with a 
strong focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. We actively integrate ESG considerations into our investment 
decision-making process to drive long-term value for our clients while supporting sustainable business practices.
As a testament to our ESG-focused approach, our current 36 portfolio companies held that are aligned with the NSE 100 ESG Index. 
These ESG-compliant stocks collectively account for 44.78% of our total portfolio value for discretionary portfolio services, reflecting our 
strategic intent to build a resilient and forward-looking investment portfolio rooted in sustainability.
Private Wealth - As of the latest reporting period, private wealth business have initiated marketing of relevant ESG schemes to 
investors and there has been an active participation from them as well. This reflects a growing commitment among private investors 
towards responsible investing and sustainable value creation. This trajectory signifies a maturing investment landscape where ethical 
considerations are integral to wealth management.
These pillars not only reflect our cultural transformation but reinforce our dedication to sustainable growth, ethical governance, and long-
term impact. We believe that by embedding sustainability at the core of our operations, we are building resilience, driving innovation, 
and shaping a better future for all.
