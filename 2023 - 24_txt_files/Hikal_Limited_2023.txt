1.
Energy 
efficiency 
& carbon 
emissions/ Air 
pollution
R/O
Energy efficiency, carbon 
emissions, and air pollution 
pose risks and opportunities for 
our organization. Neglecting 
these issues leads to regulatory 
pressures, fines, and reputational 
damage. However, embracing 
efficiency and reducing emissions 
enhances our organization brand, 
attracts eco-conscious customers, 
and improves competitiveness. 
Sustainable practices save costs 
and improve efficiency. Prioritizing 
energy efficiency and emissions 
aligns with environmental goals, 
driving growth and sustainability.
Our organization has implemented 
effective measures to address 
energy efficiency and carbon 
emissions/air pollution risks. 
These include dust collectors, 
bed scrubbers, and flue gas 
monitoring. We recycle organic 
vapors and have a green belt and 
environmental management 
cell for ongoing monitoring. 
These efforts demonstrate our 
commitment to environmental 
sustainability and regulatory 
compliance.
Positive/ 
Negative
2.
Water and 
effluent 
management/ 
Waste 
management
Risk
Water scarcity, pollution, and 
inadequate waste management 
pose risks to our organization and 
the environment. Insufficient water 
availability disrupts operations, 
raises costs, and jeopardizes 
well-being. Improper waste 
handling risks environmental 
harm, health hazards, and non-
compliance. Addressing these 
risks is crucial to avoid penalties, 
reputation damage, and 
strained relationships. Effective 
management brings financial and 
environmental benefits, enhancing 
our position in the sector.
Our organization prioritizes waste 
and water/effluent management. 
We securely store and responsibly 
dispose of discarded containers, 
hand them over to authorized 
recyclers, and ensure proper 
recycling practices. Specific 
wastes are securely stored and 
safely disposed of in authorized 
incinerators. We reprocess spent 
solvents using environmentally 
sound technology and 
government-approved recyclers. 
These measures showcase our 
commitment to responsible 
waste management, reducing 
environmental impact, and 
complying with regulatory 
requirements.
Negative
3.
Biodiversity 
protection
Risk
We understand that business 
operations have an impact 
on biodiversity. Pollution and 
contamination worsen the 
situation, impacting species 
diversity and ecological balance. 
Addressing these risks is crucial 
to safeguard biodiversity and 
promote responsible practices in 
our industry.
The green belt near our chemical 
manufacturing factory acts as 
a refuge for diverse species, 
conserving biodiversity. It serves as 
a buffer zone, reducing pollution 
impacts and improving air and 
water quality. The green belt 
acts as an environmental asset, 
fostering ecological resilience and 
mitigating risks associated with 
our operations.

Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Occupational health and safety are 
a critical risk for our organization. 
Neglecting a safe working 
environment leads to accidents, 
injuries, and illnesses, impacting 
employee wellbeing, morale, 
productivity, and absenteeism. 
Non-compliance results in legal 
liabilities, fines, penalties, and 
reputational damage. Prioritizing 
comprehensive health and 
safety programs, training, and 
preventive measures is crucial to 
mitigate risks, protect employees, 
and maintain a safe workplace.

and safety ensures the wellbeing 
of our workforce and safeguards 
our organization's reputation and 
success.
The Company prioritizes creating 
a safe work environment and 
preventing harm. It regularly 
identifies hazards and develops 
mitigation plans. Ongoing 
safety trainings are provided 
to employees and workers to 
safeguard their overall well-being. 
The goal is to maintain a holistic 
approach to safety and well-being.

8.
Human 
rights and 
community 
development
Risk/
Opportunity
Human rights violations or 
perceived violations pose a 
significant risk to our organization, 
causing reputational damage, 
legal consequences, and loss 
of stakeholder trust. Failing to 
uphold labour rights can result in 
employee dissatisfaction, protests, 
and potential boycotts. Respecting 
human rights, complying with 
laws, and addressing grievances 
transparently are crucial. On 
the other hand, community 
development offers opportunities. 
Engaging in initiatives like 
education, skills training, and 
infrastructure development builds 
relationships, enhances reputation, 
and creates a positive social 
impact, leading to community 
support, market access, and long-
term sustainability.
We have well established systems 
to ensure that human rights of our 
internal and external stakeholders 
are secured. There are necessary 
policy frameworks implemented 
in this regard. We have been 
engaging with local communities 
through our various CSR initiatives 
to make a positive impact on 
their lives and foster sustainable 
development.

Negative
9.
Product, 
quality, safety, 
and labelling
Risk
In the chemical sector, product 
quality, safety, and labelling are 
significant risks. Inadequate 
control measures can lead to 
defects or hazards, causing legal 
liabilities and reputational damage. 
Misleading labelling may result in 
consumer misuse. Implementing 
robust quality control, safety 
protocols, and accurate labelling 
ensures compliance and consumer 
trust.
To mitigate risks related to 
product quality, safety, and 
labeling, our organization has 
implemented several measures. 
These include rigorous quality 
control procedures throughout 
the production process, adherence 
to safety protocols and standards, 
comprehensive testing and 
certification of products, accurate 
and transparent labeling practices 
in compliance with regulations, 
and ongoing monitoring and 
assessment to ensure continuous 
improvement. These measures 
aim to maintain high product 
standards, ensure consumer safety, 
and uphold our reputation for

Data integrity & 
security
Risk
Data integrity and security are 
crucial for protecting valuable 
assets and maintaining 
stakeholder trust. Breaches or 
unauthorized access can lead 
to financial losses, reputation 
damage, and legal liabilities. 
Data integrity issues undermine 
decision-making and operational 
efficiency. Implementing robust 
security measures and employee 
awareness programs mitigate 
risks and safeguard data assets, 
reputation, and competitive 
position.
To mitigate risks related to 
data integrity and security, our 
organization has implemented 
robust measures. These include 
the implementation of encryption 
technologies to protect sensitive 
data, strict access controls 
and authentication protocols, 
regular data backups, ongoing 
monitoring of network and system 
vulnerabilities, comprehensive 
employee training on data security 
best practices, and the use of 
advanced firewalls and intrusion 
detection systems. These measures 
aim to safeguard our data assets, 
protect against unauthorized 
access or data breaches, and 
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of our data.

Risk 
management 
& business 
continuity
Risk/ 
Opportunity
Risk management and business 
continuity pose both risks and 
opportunities. Inadequate 
management can lead to 
accidents, disruptions, non-
compliance, and reputational 
damage. Prioritizing risk 
assessment, safety protocols, 
emergency plans, and supply 
chain resilience minimizes 
incidents, protects stakeholders, 
and enhances trust.
Effective business continuity 
planning ensures swift response, 
essential operations, and efficient 
recovery, securing long-term 
sustainability and success.
To address risk management and 
business continuity issues, our 
organization has implemented 
various measures. These include 
conducting proactive risk 
assessments, implementing 
safety protocols and emergency 
response plans, ensuring supply 
chain resilience, establishing 
business continuity plans, regularly 
reviewing, and updating risk 
management strategies, and 
conducting drills and simulations 
to test preparedness. These 
measures help mitigate risks, 
enhance operational resilience, 
and ensure the continuity of our 
business operations in the face of 
potential disruptions.

a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
We have a Green Supply Chain Policy, which is applicable for all our value chain partners. The policy 
outlines our commitment towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) related responsible 
business practices. We expect all our value chain partners to adhere with our green supply 
chain requirements.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
100% of inputs from critical suppliers in India is sourced in a sustainable manner.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.
	
Given the nature of our business, we have limited scope to reclaim our products for reusing, recycling, and 
disposal at the end of life. However, we have implemented a waste management system at all our facilities 
and have dedicated teams to ensure its effective implementation. All the categories of wastes are collected, 
segregated, stored, transported, and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements 
and best industry practices. We have detailed SOP for collection, storage and disposal of various type of 
waste generated from process.
	
We are segregating all waste into two categories i.e., recyclable, and non-recyclable wastes. Recyclable 
waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner to authorized recyclers, and non-recyclable waste 
is disposed of via co-processing to the cement industry or incineration or secured landfill based on calorific 
value of waste. The packing material generated by raw materials and in-process material are being disposed 
to authorized plastic recycler or via Common Hazardous Waste Collection, Treatment, Storage & Disposal 
Facilities (CHWTSDF).
	
We have been consistently enhancing our waste management practices and have embedded them with our 
circular economy approach. In terms of process improvements, we have implemented systems to recover 
the organic solvents and reuse them in the same process. We have a dedicated lab working exclusively on 
waste treatability studies and have converted by-products into desired intermediates by using a simple 
process, which in turn reduced the hazardous organic waste to a great extent. In addition, we have initiated 
a process of reusing the plastic material used in the internal product transfer for the storage and disposal 
of hazardous waste and hence reduced the overall consumption of fresh plastic products and packaging 
material in our operations.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). 
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
EPR is applicable to us as an importer, HIKAL sought license from relevant statutory body to comply with 
the requirement under EPR.
Leadership Indicators
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the 
following format?
	
No, we will be conducting the life cycle assessment of our products in future.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) 
or through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
Not applicable, as we have not conducted the life cycle assessment of our products.
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Given the nature of our pharmaceutical and specialty chemical products, we do not use recycled or reused 
input materials in the manufacturing process. However, we are recovering more than 90% of process 
solvents and reusing them in the manufacturing process of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products.
4.	
Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) 
reused, recycled, and safely disposed, as per the following format:
	
We are into institutional sales and providing our products to leading companies and they convert 
intermediates in to final products for the consumers. Hence, the responsibility for reclaiming products and 
packaging material does not apply to us. However, we give instructions and guidelines to our customers for 
handling and disposal of the products.
	
In addition, the waste generated in our manufacturing process, raw material packaging and e-waste are 
being sent to authorized recyclers wherever possible in accordance with the statutory requirements. In the 
reporting period, we have initiated a process of reusing the plastic material used in the internal product 
transfer for the storage and disposal of hazardous waste and hence reduced the overall consumption of 
fresh plastic products and packaging material in our operations

our manufacturing facilities. All five manufacturing facilities are certified with ISO 45001:2018 
management system and the research & technology center is in process of obtaining the certification.
	
	
We make our best efforts to ensure safe operations. We have implemented various programs like 
“Surakshapath” which is a behavior-based safety program to minimize behavioral risk. We have other 
safety awareness programs like “One Minute for Safety”, “EHS Induction”, “Weekly wet drills”, “Mock 
drills” etc. to enhance safety at our workplace. In addition, we have also initiated cross-functional safety 
audits at all the sites by the Corporate EHS team. To create awareness we have initiated an EHS Theme 
program every month, where we are adopting a different EHS theme to design and execute various 
awareness programs for all levels of employees and workers.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and 
non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
We have well established systems to identify and access work-related hazards and risks. We have 
implemented Hazard Identification and Risk assessment (HIRA) process for routine and non-routine 
activities, and Hazard operability (HAZOP) techniques for process related hazards at all our facilities. In 
addition, we have developed a guidance document in which, we have identified and documented all 
the hazards and risks associated with our operations to standardize implementation of safety measures.
	
	
At all our facilities, we have a dedicated EHS team to identify, assess and mitigate risks, monitor the 
implementation of safety measures, conduct a weekly safety inspection, and provide regular training 
on safety-aspects to employees and workers. Also, there are periodic internal and external audits 
conducted to assess the effectiveness of Occupational health and safety processes implemented at 
our facilities.
	
	
We analyze and generate safety related data of chemicals externally through recognized laboratory and 
use it in facility design to ensure inherent safety in infrastructure and operation. There are dedicated 
employees for process safety management at our R&T center.
	
	
We have set up a process safety laboratory at R&T Pune to carry out various safety-related tests of 
reaction calorimetry of new processes to ensure inherent safe processes in new projects.

implemented a safety reporting system through MY SETU software at all the facilities through which 
employees can online report work-related hazards/risks such as near misses, unsafe conditions, 
injuries, and other serious incidents. This is followed by a detailed root cause analysis, development 
and implementation of corrective action plans, and monitoring of the effectiveness of safety measures. 
All the reported issues can be tracked online till its closure with the corrective action plan and any 
employee can access the portal through their login credentials. Apart from this, regular safety briefing 
sessions/toolbox talks take place on a daily basis, where workers actively participate to give suggestions 
for strengthening the safety measures at the sites.

Department (OPD) with qualified medical officers and support staff for any medical emergencies and 
consultation for non-occupational health issues. As a standard process, annual health check camps 
are organized across our facilities. The employees and workers having exposure to heat, noise, and 
chemicals during their routine work are required to undergo preventive health examination every six 
months to diagnose any occupational disease in the initial stage. We have obtained Group accidental 
and medical insurance policies that cover our employees. At all our facilities, we ensure that contractors 
must obtain accidental insurance policy/workmen compensation policy and ESIC for workers.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators 
above, provide details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such 
areas along-with prevention and remediation activities.
	
We have only Jigani Unit, which is in proximity to Bannerghatta National Park. To conserve the ecology, 
we have partnered with the International Association for Human Values (IAHV) for the development work 
of Yallammanadoddi lake, which is near our Jigani Unit. Three villages in the surrounding area are directly 
dependent on this lake for water. However, the accumulation of mud, waste and weeds made the lake unfit 
for direct domestic use.
	
We carried out lake desiltation work in collaboration with villagers and provided bunds and silt traps to 
prevent ingress of waste and silt. This has increased the water capacity of lake by four times. In addition, 
we carried out a plantation of more than 40 varieties of aquatic plants and removed water hyacinths 
from the lake. Development of flora in the area promoted suitable eco-system to flourish various local 
birds and butterflies in the area. This has improved the overall ecology and provided clean water to the 
local communities.
