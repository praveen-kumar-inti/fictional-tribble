Outcome of the 
initiative 
The company has implemented a solution to replace 40 grading conveyors with Cut Seed Separators, which resulted in improved 
quality recovery and increased daily output, while meeting packing timelines. This approach also minimized waste generation and 
reduced manpower requirements.
To enable the systematic operations of a wide range of Vegetable Seed products, the company has built a dedicated 35000 SFT 
Processing, Packing & Cold Storage facility. This facility ensures proper handling and accountability of these valuable products.
To safeguard foundation seeds from high temperature and humidity, the company established a large-capacity cold storage facility 
in close proximity to the processing plant. This makes it easier to monitor and control operations, as well as reducing logistics costs.
The company has made cotton seed pouches packing more efficient by switching from carton packing to BOPP bags. This integrated 
conveying system, which includes pouch filling in BOPP bags, weighing of secondary bags, and stitching of FG bags in online operations, 
significantly reduces waste from discarded cartons.
