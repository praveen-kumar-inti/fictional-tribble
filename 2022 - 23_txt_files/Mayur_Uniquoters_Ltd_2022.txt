The establishment of an Oxygen
Zone in Mayur offers a promising
opportunity. This initiative not only
contributes 
to 
environmental
sustainability but also brings about
long-term benefits for the ecosystem.
By undertaking this project, the
company can effectively enhance its
brand image, while fostering a deeper
sense of community engagement and
connection.
i.
We 
have 
extraordinary
accomplishment of planting a total of
6500 trees across four distinct
locations: Badawali, Bhomiya Ji Park,
Singod Kalan, and Jaitpura School
Ground. These sites, conveniently
positioned within a radius of 1 km and
3 km near our Dhodsar factory, evoke
a sense of joy and fulfillment.
ii.
During this reporting period, a total of
6000 plants were established, and we
have successfully planted 17000 trees
on 28 hectares of land so far.
Air quality poses various risks for
companies, including potential health
hazards for employees, decreased
productivity, increased absenteeism,
higher healthcare costs, and potential
damage to the company’s reputation.
Poor air quality can lead to respiratory
issues, allergies, and other health
problems, which can result in
reduced employee performance and
efficiency. Moreover, high levels of
air pollution can lead to increased
sick leaves and healthcare expenses
for both employees and the company
During the reporting period, a Bag Filter
was installed in one Thermopack unit as
a technological intervention to improve air
quality. The site plan highlights ten
emission points, and
Clean water and sanitation risks for
companies include compromised
employee 
health, 
increased
operational costs, regulatory non-
compliance, reputational damage, and
legal liabilities. Insufficient access to
clean water can lead to waterborne
diseases, while poor sanitation
facilities can impact productivity and
cause accidents. Non-compliance
with regulations can result in fines
and penalties, damaging reputation
and stability. Inadequate facilities may
lead to legal liabilities and financial
burdens.
We have improved the water quality by
inducing technological advancement in
our ETP process installation of MBR
Module of 140 KLD

Greenhouse gas emissions can lead
to

vulnerability to climate change
impacts. Failing to address these
emissions can result in fines,
penalties, and negative perceptions
from stakeholders, affecting the
company’s stability and long-term
sustainability.
The Company has done baseline
measurement of year in 2021-22 with
Global PCCS as a second party
consultant.
For 2022-23, we are doing GHG
accounting with MNIT as second party
consultant. We are actively analyzing and
monitor our GHG gas emissions for better
understanding of its environmental impact.
For Decreasing the GHG, we are moving
towards sourcing from Local Suppliers:
for reducing the transportation distance.
Green Supply chain: We want our supply
chain to comply with our policies and we
are 
starting 
the 
assessment 
of
sustainability of Supplier.
As part of our ongoing efforts, we are
currently engaged in conducting a
comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment
(LCA) of our product. Our primary
objective is to gain a thorough
understanding of the product’s carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions throughout its
manufacturing process. Moreover, we are
actively exploring opportunities to replace
certain components with Sustainable
alternatives. By adopting this approach,
we aim to mitigate our ecological impact
and transition towards a more sustainable
product.
Exploring energy consumption,
monitoring, and efficiency presents
an excellent opportunity to optimize
resource 
utilization, 
minimize
environmental impact, and enhance
operational efficiency. By focusing on
these aspects, organizations can
drive sustainability, reduce costs, and
improve overall performance while
contributing to a greener and more
sustainable future.
We are performing energy saving projects
implemented during this fiscal year which
includes:
a.
We have replaced 255 conventional
lights of plant with 101 LED lights
which led to saving of 32.85 MWH of
