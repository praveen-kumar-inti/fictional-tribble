1
Air Emissions
R
A key parameter for gauging our 
environmental performance. 
Our systems must be in place 
to maintain emissions within 
the NAAQS. This has also been 
identified through the TCFD 
assessment.
We are committed to preventing, and reducing 
our air emissions through efficient use of 
technologies, specific policies and strategies. We 
closely monitor our monthly progress and take 
corrective actions as necessary.
Negative

Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
R
We aim to achieve zero harm 
across all our operations. Health 
and Safety are a very important 
part of JSW Group’s values.
We are committed to providing a healthy and 
safe working environment for the employees, 
contractors, business associates, visitors on 
premises and community impacted by our 
operations. We aim to be compliant with all 
applicable health and safety legal requirements. 
Safety is at the utmost priority across all sites, 
and we have stringent safety systems in place 
to achieve and maintain zero harm. From a 
governance standpoint, our senior management, 
along with key plant personnel, assume the 
overall accountability for ensuring the appropriate 
safety practices.
Negative
3
Biodiversity
R
Given the nature of our 
operations, all of our 
locations fall under the 
coastal regulations zone. We 
understand that preserving 
and restoring the biodiversity 
is critical for maintaining a 
balanced ecosystem and even 
more important is ecologically 
sensitive zones.
We strive to achieve, “No Net Loss” of biodiversity. 
For our greenfield projects, and brownfield 
expansions, we ensure that minimum harm is 
caused to the biodiversity in that area. We are 
continuously increasing biodiversity across all our 
locations.

Climate 
Change
R
Our operations are impacted 
by many natural phenomena 
like heavy precipitation, heavy 
winds, etc and consumption of 
resources. Also some sites are 
prone to landslides and high 
temperature as identified in our 
TCFD assessment. Therefore, 
it is not only our responsibility 
as a corporate citizen, but also 
critical for our operations to 
consider the impact of climate 
change.
We have set stringent Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Intensity Targets to quantify our efforts towards 
climate change mitigation. We also strive to 
increase our energy efficiency, increase the 
share of renewables in our energy basket, 
improve the current processes, and experiment 
with blending of biofuels. We have updated our 
risk management framework as per the TCFD 
study and accordingly included in our Business 
Continuity Plan.

through development of 
greenfield ports and brownfield

	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your
company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
	The Company is committed to minimizing waste generation and promoting the principles of reuse, recycling, and responsible disposal.
Operating within the port sector, JSWIL facilitates import and export services across multiple industries. As our operations do not involve
manufacturing or production activities, the use of hazardous or toxic chemicals is inherently limited. Nonetheless, JSWIL ensures full
compliance with all applicable waste management regulations prescribed by the Central and State Pollution Control Boards. The limited
hazardous waste generated primarily comprising spent oil and oil-soaked cotton waste is strictly managed and disposed of through
authorized vendors in accordance with regulatory guidelines. In addition to managing hazardous waste responsibly, JSWIL proactively
implements initiatives for the effective handling of organic waste. Food and plant waste generated at our facilities is processed using
composting systems to produce organic compost. This compost is then utilized for plantation activities and the development of green
spaces within and around our operational areas. These initiatives reflect JSWIL’s holistic approach to sustainable waste management,
emphasizing environmental conservation, reduction of landfill burden, and contribution to circular economy practices through resource
recovery and soil enrichment.
