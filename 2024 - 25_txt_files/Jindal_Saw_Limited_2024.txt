Product 
innovation, 
safety, and 
quality 
Risk 
Issues related to 
product innovation, 
quality, and safety can 
greatly affect our 
capacity to fulfill 
customer expectations 
and deliver value to 
stakeholders. Failures in 
these areas may result 
in reputational harm, 
reduced market share, 
and potential legal 
consequences. 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
We have implemented strict testing 
protocols, robust compliance 
procedures, and comprehensive 
quality management systems to 
proactively detect and resolve 
potential issues. Continuous 
investment in employee training 
helps our workforce to uphold the 
highest standards. As part of our 
proactive approach, we were 
among the industry’s early 
adopters of ISO 45001 certification, 
underscoring our strong 
commitment to safety and quality. 
Our global accreditations further 
affirm our dedication to excellence. 
Positive: Focusing 
on product 
innovation and 
quality is expected 
to yield positive 
financial 
outcomes, as we 
strive to enhance 
customer 
satisfaction and 
drive revenue 
growth through 
value-added 
offerings. 
8 
 
2 
Economic 
Value 
Distributed 
Opportunity 
The distribution of 
economic value is a 
core component of our 
stakeholder strategy, 
enabling the effective 
allocation of financial 
resources toward 
strategic investments 
that align with our 
defined objectives. 
We remain committed to 
responsibly distributing economic 
value through fair wages, timely 
payments to suppliers, and 
community investments. This 
approach helps us sustain 
stakeholder trust, supports long-
term growth, and mitigates risks 
related to social and regulatory 
challenges. 
Positive: 
Economic value 
distribution is 
expected to boost 
market 
capitalization, 
creating 
opportunities for 
fundraising to 
support future 
growth. 
3 
Energy and 
Emissions 
Management 
Risk 
With regulatory and 
compliance demands 
around climate change 
becoming more 
stringent, our business 
must adapt by making 
appropriate 
investments. However, 
the financial returns 
from investments in 
energy and emissions 
management may not 
be immediately 
apparent, leading to 
potential financial 
uncertainty. 
We remain committed to 
sustainability by emphasizing 
energy-efficient processes and 
initiatives aimed at reducing 
emissions. Our ongoing 
investments in energy and 
emissions management enhance 
process efficiency and underscore 
our commitment to environmental 
responsibility. 
Negative: We 
continue to 
prioritize initiatives 
focused on 
energy-efficient 
processes and 
emission 
reduction. We 
recognize that 
investments in 
energy and 
emission 
management 
systems and 
technologies have 
financial 
implication but we 
view them as an 
integral part to our 
strategic 
commitment to 
sustainability and 
regulatory 
compliance. 
4 
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety 
Risk 
Our workforce is the 
cornerstone of our 
operations, making it 
essential to provide a 
safe and healthy 
working environment. 
Incidents related to 
occupational health and 
safety pose not only 
regulatory and 
reputational risks but 
also jeopardize 
business continuity and 
employee well-being. 
Non-compliance can 
negatively impact 
operational efficiency 
and hinder our ability to 
meet customer 
expectations. 
We focus on creating a secure 
workplace by investing in safety 
measures and adopting advanced 
technologies, alongside 
implementing comprehensive 
safety training programs to 
effectively manage risks. Our fully 
equipped Occupational Health 
Centers (OHCs) reflect our deep 
commitment to employee health 
and safety. Additionally, 
partnerships with nearby hospitals 
at our plant locations ensure 
immediate medical support during 
emergencies. 
Positive: While 
maintaining safety 
standards 
requires 
consistent 
investment in 
technology and 
training, ensuring 
a safe work 
environment 
remains our top 
priority. The 
financial gains 
from uninterrupted 
operations 
significantly 
outweigh the 
associated costs, 
protecting both 
our employees 
and our 
operational 
resilience. 
5 
Customer 
Satisfaction 
Opportunity 
Enhancing customer 
satisfaction is a key 
strategic driver for 
market expansion, 
deeper market 
penetration and 
delivering superior value 
to our clients. It also 
plays a crucial role in 
reinforcing brand 
We remain dedicated to 
consistently meeting and 
exceeding customer expectations. 
By prioritizing quality, service and 
responsiveness, we aim to 
strengthen customer trust, foster 
loyalty and proactively address 
potential risks to our reputation and 
market position. 
Positive: Greater 
customer 
satisfaction leads 
to higher repeat 
business and a 
stronger market 
presence. This 
reinforces our 
position as a 
trusted and

reliability, which in turn 
supports long-term 
growth and profitability. 
reliable partner, 
resulting in 
favorable financial 
outcomes and 
contributing to 
sustained 
business. 
6 
Ethics and 
Compliance 
Opportunity 
By placing ethics and 
compliance at the 
forefront, we cultivate a 
positive work 
environment that 
enhances employee 
loyalty, reduces 
turnover, and improves 
ability to attract top 
talent. A motivated, 
engaged workforce 
contributes to increased 
productivity and fosters 
a unified culture. 
Additionally, our 
commitment to ethical 
practices and regulatory 
compliance uplifts 
employee morale and 
generates cost savings 
through greater 
operational efficiency 
and enhanced 
productivity. 
We remain committed to upholding 
the highest standards of ethics and 
integrity in all our operations. By 
ensuring strict adherence to laws, 
regulations and internal policies, 
we aim to foster a culture of 
transparency and accountability, 
thereby reducing legal and 
reputational risks and reinforcing 
stakeholder confidence. 
Positive: A strong 
commitment to 
ethics and 
compliance brings 
clear benefits, 
including 
improved 
employee 
retention and 
reduced costs 
related to rehiring. 
Moreover, it 
enables us to 
exceed 
performance 
targets, fostering 
sustainable 
business growth 
and long-term 
success. 
7 
Risk, 
Opportunities 
and Crisis 
Management 
Opportunity 
Adopting a proactive 
approach to crisis 
management not only 
helps to build resilient 
systems but also 
positions the 
organization as a 
forward-thinking leader, 
staying ahead of 
competitors in the 
industry. 
We proactively identify and assess 
potential risks and opportunities to 
safeguard our business interests. 
Through effective risk management 
and crisis preparedness, we aim to 
minimize disruptions, capitalize on 
emerging opportunities, and 
ensure resilience in the face of 
unforeseen challenges, thereby 
protecting our reputation and 
supporting sustainable growth. 
Positive: While 
implementing 
strong Health, 
Safety, and 
Environment 
protocols and 
employee training 
requires initial 
investments, the 
prevention of 
avoidable 
operational 
disruptions leads 
to significant long-
term benefits, 
organizational 
resilience and 
sustainability. 
8 
Supply Chain 
Management 
Opportunity 
The current global 
climate, marked by 
conflicts and instability, 
has notably disrupted 
supply chain systems, 
presenting a valuable 
opportunity for us to 
innovate and develop 
alternative supply chain 
models. This strategic 
initiative positions us to 
better manage 
uncertainties and 
enables us to gain a 
competitive advantage 
in the market by 
optimizing costs. 
We are committed to maintain a 
robust and efficient supply chain by 
fostering strong relationships with 
suppliers, ensuring timely 
procurement of quality materials, 
and optimizing logistics operations. 
Through transparent practices and 
continuous improvement, we aim 
to enhance overall supply chain 
resilience, reduce costs, and 
deliver value to our customers 
while adhering to ethical standards 
and sustainability principles. 
Adopting a 
positive strong 
supply chain 
management 
strategy not only 
boosts operational 
efficiency but also 
enhances 
customer 
satisfaction, 
creating a 
foundation for 
sustainable 
business growth 
and increased 
profitability. 
10 
 
9 
Employee 
Wellbeing 
Opportunity 
Prioritizing employee 
well-being is crucial for 
the organization’s long-
term growth. Although 
assessing immediate 
ROI can be challenging, 
investing in employee 
well-being not only 
attracts top talent but 
also improves retention 
and boosts overall 
workforce morale. 
We prioritize the health, safety, and 
overall wellbeing of our employees 
by fostering a supportive and 
inclusive work environment. We 
are dedicated to promoting work-
life balance, providing opportunities 
for personal and professional 
development, and ensuring access 
to health and wellness programs. 
Our commitment to employee 
wellbeing helps build a motivated, 
engaged workforce capable of 
contributing to the company's 
sustainable success. 
Positive: While 
implementing and 
sustaining 
employee well-
being programs 
involves initial and 
ongoing costs, 
tangible benefits 
like increased 
employee loyalty 
and longer service 
tenure, contribute 
significantly to 
improved 
organizational 
performance and 
overall business 
success. 
10 
Water 
Management 
Risk 
Water, a vital yet limited 
resource, 
poses a significant risk 
due to its scarcity. Our 
commitment to efficient 
water management 
involves stringent 
monitoring and 
conservation efforts, 
including recycling 
practices. We ensure 
that our plants follow 
Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) mechanism for 
efficient water 
management and 
conservation. 
Although we have made significant 
efforts to reduce water usage in 
our manufacturing processes, the 
inherent risks of meeting discharge 
standards and addressing water 
scarcity remain. To mitigate these 
risks, we focus on water recycling 
initiatives and integrate water 
reuse at multiple stages of our 
production processes. 
Negative: While 
our direct water 
consumption 
remains low, we 
continue to incur 
associated costs

significant 
investments to 
maintain robust 
water 
management 
practices. To 
conserve natural 
water resources, 
we have installed 
a 10 MLD Sewage 
Treatment Plant in 
Bhilwara to treat 
city’s sewage and 
utilize clean water 
within plant for 
different activities.

Waste 
Management 
Risk 
Despite our ongoing 
efforts to reduce the 
generation of solid and 
hazardous waste, waste 
management continues 
to be a critical risk area 
within our operations. 
Our waste management strategy is 
centered on recycling and the 
proper disposal of solid waste. 
Furthermore, we repurpose waste 
as a raw material in our production 
processes, minimizing 
environmental impact. 
Negative: 
Although our 
direct operations 
generate minimal 
waste, 
maintaining 
effective waste 
management 
practices incurs 
associated costs 
and investments. 
While essential, 
these 
expenditures 
present financial 
challenges for our 
operations.

Diversity and 
Inclusion 
Opportunity 
Fostering a diverse and 
inclusive workplace 
culture, where 
discrimination based on 
caste, creed, faith, 
gender, or reduced 
mobility has no place, is 
crucial for the success 
of our organization. We

We are dedicated to fostering a

environment of equal opportunity, 
ensuring that everyone can thrive 
and grow within our Company. 
Inclusion 
positively impacts 
employee morale,

productivity, and 
drives overall 
business success. 
13 
Respect for 
Human Rights 
Risk 
Human rights 
considerations are 
inherently sensitive, 
often influenced by 
external factors beyond 
our direct control. Our 
reliance on external 
environments and 
stakeholders can 
present challenges in 
consistently upholding 
human rights standards 
across our operations. 
To mitigate this risk, we have 
implemented comprehensive 
policies and procedures that foster 
ongoing dialogue and collaboration 
with stakeholders, ensuring a 
supportive and inclusive work 
environment across the 
organization. 
Positive: Investing 
in frameworks and 
guidelines to 
preserve human 
rights incurs 
minimal costs, but 
the benefits—
such as fostering 
a positive work 
environment and 
upholding ethical 
standards—far 
exceed the initial 
investment.
