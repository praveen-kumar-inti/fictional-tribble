1
Data Privacy, 
Information & 
Cyber Security
Risk
The risk associated with data privacy, information, and cyber 
security is paramount for Star Health.
•	
Highly Sensitive Data: The Company is aware of the traffic of 
personal and health sensitive information, making it a prime 
target for theft, fraud or extortion.
•	
Increasing Digitalization: Growing reliance on digital 
platforms for operations expands the vulnerabilities for data 
breaches.
•	
Escalating Cyber Threats: Possibilities of increasing cyber-
attacks such as ransomware, phishing, will lead to financial 
losses, operational disruption and reputational damage.
•	
Stringent Regulations: India’s Digital Personal Data 
Protection Act (DPDPA) and IRDAI regulations impose strict 
obligations and significant penalties for data breaches and 
non-compliance, making privacy and security failures a 
major financial and legal risk.
Star Health has adopted the following measures to mitigate risks;
•	
Robust Security Measures: Implementing advanced security 
technologies, conducting regular security assessments and 
performing penetration testing to proactively identify and 
mitigate vulnerabilities.
•	
Employee awareness & training: Investing in comprehensive 
training programs for capacity building
•	
Strong Data Governance & Compliance: Maintaining stringent 
data governance policies and practices to ensure full 
adherence to the DPDPA and other applicable regulations.

Innovation & 
Technology 
Adoption
Opportunity 
& Risk
The Company understands the inherent risks associated with 
adopting new technologies or business models.
•	
AI Bias & Fairness: Risks of AI algorithms (such as 
in underwriting, claims assessment) inadvertently 
discriminating against certain policyholder demographics 
based on biased training data, leading to ethical and 
regulatory issues.
•	
Data Quality for Analytics: Poor data quality from new 
sources (such as wearable data, telemedicine platforms) 
can lead to flawed insights and incorrect policy decisions or 
premium calculations.
•	
Regulatory uncertainty for New Models: Lack of clear 
guidelines from IRDAI or other bodies regarding emerging 
technologies like AI in underwriting or new digital health 
service.
The following are the key measures:
•	
Data Governance for new data sources: Establishing clear 
policies for the collection, storage, processing and use of data 
from new technologies (such as wearable and telehealth data) 
to maintain privacy and quality
•	
Regulatory sandboxes & engagements: participating in 
regulatory sandboxes or engaging proactively with IRDAI to 
seek clarity and influence policy development for emerging 
health tech
•	
Internal Capacity building: The company also invests in 
employee training and awareness programs to ensure that 
relevant staffs are equipped to understand the efficient use of 
new technology and aware of inherent potential risk.

** Emissions calculations are based on fugitive emissions only from fire extinguishers across all offices. Other sources of fugitive emissions such as 
owned vehicular emission are not included in the calculations as they are yet maintained by the Company. The increase in the emissions (Scope 1 and 2) 
data for FY 2025 is due to an increase in the branches considered from 655 compared to 398 in FY 2024.
