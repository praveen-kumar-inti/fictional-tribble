Product 
Quality and

Opportunity
By 
prioritising 
quality 
and 
design, we can minimise product 
failures, 
recalls, 
and 
waste, 
shrinking 
our 
environmental 
impact. 
Sustainable 
design 
allows us to craft energy-efficient 
products. Furthermore, quality 
improvements 
benefit 
both 
workers (safer production) and 
end-users 
(enhanced 
product 
safety). This focus aligns our 
business with ESG goals, meeting 
stakeholder expectations – from 
investors 
seeking 
responsible 
practices 
to 
customers 
and 
employees desiring safe, long-
lasting products.

efficiency and profitability, we 
gain the resources to invest in 
sustainable practices, innovation, 
and 
social 
programs. 
This

reduce injuries, and decrease 
absenteeism, thereby fostering 
a more productive workforce. 
Additionally, fostering a safety-
conscious 
culture 
can 
boost 
employee morale, increase loyalty, 
and enhance job satisfaction. 
Through the implementation of 
comprehensive health and safety 
protocols, we not only meet the 
expectations 
of 
stakeholders 
such as employees, customers,

Training and 
Upskilling 
of Human

Opportunity
Enhancing productivity, fostering 
innovation, 
and 
boosting 
employee satisfaction are key 
drivers 
towards 
achieving 
higher profitability. Furthermore, 
dedicating resources to employee 
development 
initiatives 
can 
facilitate 
social 
mobility 
and 
mitigate income inequality, thus 
fostering 
broader 
economic 
and social advancement within 
the region. Through prioritising

we underscore our dedication

Risk 
Management
Opportunity
We can identify and mitigate 
potential risks, including those 
related 
to 
the 
environment, 
society, 
and 
governance. 
A 
robust risk management strategy 
can reduce the likelihood of 
negative 
incidents, 
such 
as 
legal 
violations, 
reputational 
damage, 
and 
environmental 
disasters. Ultimately, a focus on 
risk management can help us 
align our business operations 
with ESG goals and meet the 
expectations 
of 
stakeholders, 
including investors, customers, 
and employees.

Risk
In case we are unable to identify 
and mitigate risks related to 
environmental impacts, labour 
practices, or governance, the 
same can lead to legal liabilities, 
reputational 
damage, 
and 
financial 
losses. 
Additionally, 
inadequate 
risk 
management 
can negatively impact employee 
safety and well-being and harm 
the surrounding communities.
Therefore, failure to prioritise risk 
management can pose significant 
ESG risks for the company and its 
stakeholders.

Risk
Failure 
to

ethical

and 
comply 
with 
regulations can lead to legal 
liabilities, reputational damage 
and financial losses. Additionally, 
inadequate governance practices 
can harm stakeholder trust and 
negatively 
impact 
employee 
morale. By not prioritising good 
governance, 
ethical 
behavior 
and regulatory compliance, we 
risk damaging our reputation 
and stakeholder trust. Thus, it 
is crucial for us to identify and 
mitigate ESG risks associated with 
governance, values, ethics, and 
compliance.
We have developed 
and 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
code 
of 
conduct 
that 
outlines 
ethical 
behavior 
and 
compliance 
with 
regulations. 
We also have an 
independent board 
and committees to 
ensure transparency

accountability 
in decision-making. 
Additionally, 
we 
prioritise employee

Similarly, 
sustainable 
waste 
management 
practices 
can 
include promoting recycling and 
reuse, reducing waste generation, 
and implementing proper waste 
disposal 
methods. 
Prioritising 
sustainable water and wastewater 
management practices presents 
us with the opportunity to drive 
long-term value and contribute 
to sustainable development.
Risk
Inadequate 
management 
of 
water resources and wastewater 
can lead to water scarcity, water 
pollution, and negative impacts 
on 
ecosystems 
and 
human 
health. 
Moreover, 
regulatory 
frameworks and public pressure 
are increasing to address water- 
related 
environmental 
issues. 
Failure to manage water resources 
and wastewater responsibly can 
lead to legal liabilities, reputational 
damage, and financial losses. 
Thus, it is crucial for us to identify 
and mitigate ESG risks associated 
with 
water 
and 
wastewater 
management.
To mitigate the ESG 
risks 
associated 
with 
water 
and 
w a s t e w a t e r 
management, 
we 
have 
implemented 
several approaches.
This

water conservation 
measures, reducing 
water 
usage, 
and 
increasing

to

Implementing 
energy-efficient

reduce our energy consumption,

on 
operational 
costs. 
Prioritising

driving 
stakeholder 
engagement

Moreover, 
adopting

Overall, 
prioritising

management presents a valuable 
ESG 
opportunity 
that 
can 
generate long-term value.
Risk
Inadequate waste management 
practices can lead to pollution, 
harm to ecosystems, and public 
health 
risks. 
Furthermore, 
regulatory frameworks and public 
pressure are increasing to address 
waste-related 
environmental 
issues. Failure to manage waste 
responsibly can lead to legal 
liabilities, reputational damage, 
and financial losses. Thus, it is 
crucial for us to identify and 
mitigate ESG risks associated with 
waste management.
We strive to reduce 
the 
amount 
of 
waste 
generated, 
promoting recycling 
and 
reuse, 
and 
i m p l e m e n t i n g

At Uniparts, our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is deeply embedded in 
the Company’s values and long-term growth strategy. As a global manufacturer serving the off-highway vehicle 
market, Uniparts recognises the increasing relevance of ESG issues and strives to align its business practices with 
stakeholder expectations and global sustainability imperatives. Over the last three decades, the Group has evolved 
from a small enterprise into a dynamic global organisation, reaching customers across geographies. This growth 
has been underpinned by our unwavering commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and responsible 
business conduct. Our business is built on a clear purpose—delivering value to all stakeholders while placing 
customers at the core of our decision-making.
The Company continues to prioritise local community development through targeted Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, particularly in underdeveloped areas surrounding our manufacturing units. These 
efforts focus on improving education, healthcare, and infrastructure, reflecting our strong sense of responsibility 
towards inclusive growth. In recent years, including during the disruption caused by the global pandemic, Uniparts 
has demonstrated resilience and agility. We ensured the safety and wellbeing of our workforce while maintaining 
operational continuity and financial stability. These achievements were supported by proactive ESG strategies, 
which fostered a safe, engaging, and inclusive workplace, and strengthened relationships with employees, 
customers, suppliers, investors, and community partners.
Uniparts’ core values - Passion, Innovation, Integrity, Excellence and Teamwork guide our ESG journey. We 
promote innovation to develop solutions aligned with evolving customer and regulatory expectations. Integrity and 
transparency define our corporate culture, while our collective pursuit of excellence drives superior performance 
across business functions.
In response to emerging global climate regulations Uniparts has initiated steps to reduce its environmental footprint 
and integrate climate-conscious practices into its operations. These include:
	y
	Transitioning to renewable energy sources, including the installation of solar power systems and procurement 
through open access
	y
	Engaging with suppliers to enhance the sustainability of our supply chain
	y
	Increasing the share of renewable energy in procurement and operational processes
Looking ahead, Uniparts is focused on strengthening its ESG performance through measurable targets, continuous 
stakeholder engagement, and a commitment to sustainable innovation. We view ESG not as a compliance 
requirement but as a strategic lever that contributes to long-term value creation and risk mitigation.

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals 
in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Uniparts has implemented waste management practices to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals by 
following these measures:
	
Storage:
	
ETP sludge/paint sludge is filled in leak-proof HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) bags that are labelled and 
stored in an impervious leachate-proof room.
	
Used oil and waste are stored in barrels that are clearly labelled and kept under cover.
	
Treatment:
	
ETP sludge and paint sludge are routed through an authorised treatment storage disposal facility. Specifically, 
ETP sludge is securely landfilled at the TSFD site in adherence to all applicable regulations and standards.
	
Waste oil used oil and waste batteries are periodically sold to CPCB-approved waste recyclers. This approach 
ensures that these materials are effectively managed and recycled in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner.
