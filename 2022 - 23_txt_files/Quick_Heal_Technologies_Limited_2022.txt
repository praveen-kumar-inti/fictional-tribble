any employee, irrespective of hierarchy, has access to senior management. In addition, the Company’s whistle-blower policy

person/management.

their grievances on the SART Portal. This tool allows employees to maintain their confidentiality and also ensures that there 
are independent and unbiased investigations done for all reported grievances.
	
The Company has formulated a Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace for the prevention, prohibition, 
and redressal of sexual harassment at workplace and an Internal Complaints Committee has also been set up to redress 
any such complaints received. The Company periodically conducts sessions for employees across the organization to build 
awareness about the Policy and the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at workplace (Prevention, Prohibition 
and Redressal) Act, 2013.
