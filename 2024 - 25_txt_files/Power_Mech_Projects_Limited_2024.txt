Energy 
Management
Risk
Energy management is 
identified as a critical material 
issue for Power Mech Projects 
Limited, a prominent player 
in infrastructure construction 
within the power sector. 
Owing to its specialization 
in power generation and 
infrastructure development, 
the company’s operations 
naturally entail substantial 
energy consumption.
In this context, robust 
energy management 
is essential to enhance 
operational efficiency, reduce 
environmental impact, and 
manage costs effectively. 
Conversely, inadequate 
energy management practices 
present several risks, including 
decreased operational 
efficiency, environmental 
degradation, and rising 
operational expenses.
To mitigate energy management 
risks, Power Mech can adopt a 
multifaceted strategy. Investing 
in energy-efficient technologies 
and upgrading existing machinery 
can significantly reduce energy 
consumption per unit of output. 
The implementation of Energy 
Management Systems (EMS) 
facilitates real-time monitoring and 
optimization, thereby minimizing 
energy waste.
Additionally, employee training plays 
a vital role in reinforcing energy-
saving practices and promoting 
a culture of sustainability across 
the organization. Furthermore, the 
integration of renewable energy 
sources such as solar and wind 
into the company’s energy mix 
can diversify its portfolio, decrease 
dependency on fossil fuels, and 
substantially reduce environmental 
impact.

Water & 
Waste 
Management
Risk
The material issue of Water 
and Waste Management is 
a significant concern for 
Power Mech Projects Limited, 
given its operations in the 
infrastructure construction 
sector, particularly within 
power generation. This issue 
presents inherent risks due to 
the extensive use of water in 
both construction activities 
and power generation 
processes.
Moreover, the generation 
of waste materials—such 
as construction debris and 
hazardous waste from power 
plant operations—introduces 
environmental and regulatory 
challenges. Ineffective 
management of water 
resources and waste materials 
can result in a range of risks, 
including water scarcity, 
environmental pollution, non-
compliance with regulations, 
and potential reputational 
damage.
To address the identified risks 
associated with Water and Waste 
Management, Power Mech can 
implement a series of targeted 
strategies. Primarily, the adoption 
of water conservation measures 
and efficient waste management 
practices can help reduce the 
company’s environmental footprint 
and lower the risk of regulatory non-
compliance.
These measures may include 
recycling and reusing water in 
construction activities, installing 
wastewater treatment systems, 
and ensuring proper segregation 
and disposal of waste materials. 
In addition, investing in advanced 
technologies and infrastructure 
for sustainable water and waste 
management can significantly 
improve operational efficiency and 
enhance the company’s resilience to 
regulatory changes.
Negative

Waste & 
Hazardous 
Materials 
Management
Risk
Given the nature of Power 
Mech’s operations—which 
involve extensive construction 
activities and power generation 
processes—the generation 
and handling of waste 
materials, including hazardous 
substances, present a range of 
environmental, regulatory, and 
reputational risks.
Improper management of 
waste and hazardous materials 
can lead to the contamination 
of air, soil, and water, as well 
as pose significant health and 
safety hazards to workers 
and nearby communities. 
Additionally, non-compliance 
with applicable waste 
management regulations 
can result in legal penalties, 
financial fines, and potential 
damage to the company’s 
reputation.
To mitigate the identified risks 
associated with Waste and 
Hazardous Materials Management, 
Power Mech can implement a range 
of proactive measures. Foremost, 
the establishment of stringent 
waste management protocols 
and hazardous material handling 
procedures is crucial to minimizing 
environmental impact and ensuring 
regulatory compliance.
Key actions may include the proper 
segregation, storage, transportation, 
and disposal of waste materials, 
along with the mandatory use of 
appropriate Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE) for workers involved 
in handling hazardous substances. 
Furthermore, investing in advanced 
technologies and infrastructure for 
waste treatment, recycling, and 
pollution control can significantly 
reduce environmental risks and 
decrease dependence on landfill 
disposal

Product
Quality &
Safety
Opportunity The rationale for identifying 
Product Quality and Safety as a 
strategic opportunity lies in its 
potential to differentiate Power 
Mech’s offerings from those 
of competitors and attract 
clients who prioritize high 
standards in their projects. 
By consistently delivering 
products and services that 
meet or exceed industry 
benchmarks and regulatory 
requirements, Power Mech can 
strengthen customer loyalty 
and foster repeat business.
Additionally, a strong emphasis 
on product quality and safety 
serves to mitigate risks related 
to construction defects, 
workplace accidents, and legal 
liabilities. This, in turn, helps 
reduce the likelihood of costly 
legal disputes and protects the 
company’s reputation.
Positive
5
Employee 
Health & 
Safety
Risk
The rationale for identifying 
Employee Health and Safety 
as a key issue arises from the 
inherent risks associated with 
construction activities, which 
can pose significant threats to 
the well-being of employees 
if not effectively managed. On 
one hand, a lack of attention 
to employee health and safety 
can result in accidents, injuries, 
and occupational health 
hazards, leading to human 
suffering, legal liabilities, and 
reputational harm.
On the other hand, prioritizing 
employee health and safety 
provides an opportunity 
for Power Mech to foster 
a safe and supportive work 
environment, boost employee 
morale and productivity, and 
cultivate a positive corporate 
culture.
In terms of risk mitigation, Power 
Mech can adopt a comprehensive 
approach to safeguarding employee 
health and safety. This may involve 
the implementation of robust safety 
protocols, the provision of regular 
training and awareness programs 
focused on hazard identification 
and prevention, and the execution 
of thorough risk assessments across 
construction sites and power plants. 
Ensuring full compliance with 
applicable occupational health and 
safety regulations is also essential.
In addition, investing in appropriate 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 
establishing effective emergency 
response plans, and deploying 
health monitoring systems can 
further mitigate risks and help 
prevent accidents or incidents from 
occurring.

a.
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? 
 
 
Power Mech is committed to ethical and environmentally responsible procurement across all operations. A dedicated 
Procurement Team ensures that sourcing decisions align with the company’s sustainability goals through the 
following key practices:
 
Supplier Evaluation: Rigorous assessment of suppliers to ensure compliance with ethical standards, labor practices, 
and social responsibility.
 
Sustainable Materials: Preference is given to vendors offering eco-friendly and sustainable materials for 
construction and infrastructure projects.
 
Energy-Efficient Technologies: Adoption of energy-efficient equipment and renewable energy solutions, such as 
solar and wind, wherever feasible.
 
Regulatory Compliance: All procurement activities strictly adhere to environmental laws, supported by regular 
audits for continued compliance.
 
Stakeholder Engagement: Active collaboration with local communities and stakeholders to maintain transparency 
and address environmental concerns.
 
 
Through these initiatives, Power Mech reinforces its commitment to sustainable development, ethical sourcing, and 
environmental stewardship.
b.
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
 
 
Since Power Mech is into construction of power plants and infrastructure sector and there are numerous vendors, 
sustainable inputs will be accounted for in the years to come.
As of now, the Company does not have a formal mechanism to accurately compute the concentration metrics due to 
the diverse and decentralized nature of its vendor and customer network. The earlier figures were purely indicative and 
assumption-based. To ensure responsible disclosure, the Company prefers not to publish estimated data that may not reflect 
actual business activity. Efforts are ongoing to enhance internal tracking capabilities for future reporting.

The Company currently does not maintain a 
geographical wage classification system and hence 
is unable to provide location-wise wage data. As 
operations span across multiple regions without 
segmented tracking, computing such percentages is 
not feasible at present. The figures previously shared,
