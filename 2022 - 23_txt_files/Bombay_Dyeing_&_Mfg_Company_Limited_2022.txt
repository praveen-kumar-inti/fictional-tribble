S. No.

In case of risk, 
approach to adapt 
or mitigate
Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1
Usage of plastic 
for packaging by 
Retail division
Risk
Central law on PWM Rules, 2016 and 
enactments on plastic usage & waste 
management by different states pose 
challenges for PAN India operations.
The onus of collecting and responsibility 
to dispose of plastic waste generated by 
packaging has been
put on companies.
The Company is 
putting its efforts 
to keep pace with 
the changing 
regulations around 
plastic waste 
management
Negative - Failure to comply 
with current or future 
regulations on plastic 
packaging or failure to meet 
commitments on packaging 
and the environment would 
attract hefty fines
2
Resource 
efficiency of 
homes over their 
lifecycle through 
sustainable 
design practices 
and choice of 
materials
Opportunity
Importance of the energy and water 
efficiency creates a potential for 
companies to increase demand in their 
target market, thereby increasing revenue 
and/or margins.
NA
Positive - These measures, 
which are intended to 
improve the resource 
efficiency of homes, can 
decrease the costs of home 
ownership through lower 
utility bills. Water saving 
features such as low-flow 
faucets alleviate strain on 
local communities, while 
likely also lowering costs.
3
Community and 
urban planning
Opportunity
Home development can bring economic 
growth and workforce opportunities while 
moderating cost-of-living increases, and 
can provide communities with safe and 
vibrant neighborhoods.
NA
Positive - To Improve 
communities’ environmental 
and social impacts by 
providing access to public 
transportation and/or not
overburdening existing 
transportation or utilities 
infrastructure, providing 
access to green spaces, 
developing mixed-use spaces, 
and creating more walkable 
communities.
4
Alteration of 
product to avoid 
impact in its end 
use
Opportunity
Alteration in manufacturing company 
is necessary if the desired work and 
production are not obtained in order 
to maintain business expansion and 
consumer connectivity.
NA
Positive - Company  has to 
make quick changes to their 
production process, calibrate 
their production equipment, 
source and change their 
suppliers of raw materials, 
and conduct staff training.
5
Rising of price of 
raw material
Risk
The major divisions in PSF division are 
significantly dependent on crude oil price 
and supply of cotton crop.
The company is 
mitigating the risks 
by observing the 
fluctuations in the 
Indian Rupee/US$, 
so as to lessen the 
impact on business.
Negative - Increased 
competition due to surplus 
capacity in the country 
has resulted in pressure 
on margins due to price 
undercutting in the market.
