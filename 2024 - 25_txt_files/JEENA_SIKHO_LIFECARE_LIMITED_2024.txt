Inside 
this report
Our journey is anchored in a profound belief: true healing 
begins when the body, mind, and spirit are treated as one. 
In a world increasingly leaning towards instant fixes, we are 
championing a return to balance, where the time-honoured 
wisdom of Ayurveda meets the needs of modern lives.
FY25 was a year of transformation and purpose. We continued 
to scale our reach, expand our offerings, and strengthen our 
engagement with individuals seeking sustainable, side-effect-
free wellness solutions. With every clinic we open, every 
product we formulate, and every patient we serve brings us 
one step closer to a healthier India, an India that embraces the 
power of nature and the depth of tradition.
Our model, deeply rooted in Ayurvedic science, is designed 
not just to treat symptoms, but to address the root cause of 
illness. This preventive and integrative approach allows us 
to offer personalised healing pathways, giving our patients 
renewed energy, improved immunity, and long-term vitality. 
The heart of our success lies in the thousands of lives we 
have touched - people who have rediscovered hope and health 
through our therapies, Panchakarma treatments, formulations, 
and compassionate guidance. Our teams, comprising 
skilled doctors, trained therapists, and passionate wellness 
professionals, are united by a shared mission to promote 
holistic well-being with care, credibility, and conviction.
As we look ahead, our strategy 
is not merely about growth, it 
is about purpose-driven impact. 
We are strengthening our sales 
funnel, enhancing unit economics, 
and deepening our distribution 
ecosystem. But more importantly, we 
are building a trusted brand that 
stands for more than profit:
it stands for transformation, 
healing, and the return to our 
roots.

Healing India  
holistically
Empowering lives 
through Ayurveda
At the heart of our existence lies a 
powerful purpose: to make the world 
a healthier place. We believe true 
wellness goes beyond the absence of 
illness. It is about balance - of body, 
mind, and lifestyle. Through authentic 
Ayurvedic therapies, formulations, and 
personalised treatment plans, we offer 
more than care; we offer transformation.
Guided by the vision of our founder 
Acharya Manish Ji (Mr. Manish Grover) 
and our leadership team, we have 
built a strong foundation of trust and 
outcomes-driven care. Under their 
leadership, we offer over 330 natural 
and Ayurvedic products, each crafted 
to support preventive and curative 
health, with the goal of restoring internal 
balance and long-term vitality.
Rooted in science. 
Relevant for today.
We are firm believers in the 
transformative power of Ayurveda, not as 
a relic of the past but as a living science 
that continues to evolve. Our healthcare 
model blends time-tested Ayurvedic 
wisdom with modern delivery systems, 
making it accessible, understandable, and 
relatable for today’s generation.
Ayurveda is seeing a strong resurgence, 
particularly among the youth who are 
increasingly inclined towards natural and 
sustainable alternatives. Government 
support and rising awareness have 
further created tailwinds for growth. At 
JSLL, we have aligned our capabilities to 
harness this momentum and become a 
trusted healthcare partner for thousands 
of individuals each day.
From cure to care 
to conscious living
We do not stop at treatment. Our role 
extends into awareness creation, lifestyle 
education, and prevention. Through 
health camps, outreach programmes, 
and strong presence across digital 
and traditional media, we consistently 
advocate for Ayurvedic principles and 
healthy living.
Our approach to wellness is 
comprehensive; from identifying root 
causes of illness to offering long-term 
lifestyle solutions. We envision a future 
where Ayurveda is seamlessly integrated 
with mainstream healthcare, offering 
individuals choice, clarity, and confidence 
in their pursuit of well-being.
Over the years, we have expanded our footprint  
across the nation, empowering individuals to live 
healthier, stress-free lives. Our commitment to 
this cause is visible across our pan-India presence 
through a network of over 115 healthcare centres, 
including hospitals, clinics, and day-cares. 
We operate under the rapidly growing brand 
‘Shuddhi’, which reflects our philosophy of 
natural purification and holistic healing. As a 
publicly listed Company on the NSE & BSE, we 
continue our journey with greater accountability, 
transparency, and growth orientation.
A name that stands 
for purity and 
purpose
‘Shuddhi’, meaning purification in Sanskrit, 
is not just a name, it is a promise. A 
promise to detoxify, to heal, and to renew. At 
our Shuddhi clinics and hospitals, treatment 
is not limited to herbal remedies. It is a 
complete lifestyle intervention, encouraging 
individuals to adopt routines that are more 
disciplined, more natural, and more aligned 
with the body’s innate rhythm.
Through Shuddhi therapies and counselling, 
we help individuals reconnect with nature, 
reduce dependency on synthetic medicines, 
and embrace a preventive, long-term 
approach to health.
Our vision
To make the world healthy.
To create awareness about the causes 
and prevention of disease.
To use the benefits of Ayurveda and 
alternative treatments for recovery 
from disease.
Our mission
Our mission centres on providing 
enhanced Ayurvedic healthcare 
services, spreading vital awareness 
about healthy lifestyles, and revitalising 
India’s rich medical heritage through 
innovative approaches. 
Our values
With values rooted in integrity, 
authenticity, and efficacy, Jeena Sikho 
places a paramount focus on creating 
genuine products, offering ethical 
services, and delivering effective 
solutions.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
The man who 
gave Ayurveda
a modern avatar
Our founder & leadership team 
At the heart of Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited is Acharya Manish Ji, 
a visionary leader, healer, and educator whose life’s mission is to 
realise a disease-free, drug-free Bharat. What began as a personal 
quest for healing during his own childhood illness, eventually 
transformed into a nationwide movement - one that repositions 
Ayurveda not just as an alternative, but as a primary path to wellness.
From vision to  
nationwide impact
Through JSLL, Acharya Ji has laid the foundation 
for a robust, structured, and accessible Ayurvedic 
care network, with over 115 clinics and hospitals 
across India. His expertise, accumulated over 
more than 15 years, extends across product 
formulation, treatment protocols, patient care, and 
public education.
He is not just a practitioner but a catalyst for 
change, using digital platforms like YouTube, 
Facebook, and Instagram to share knowledge; 
delivering informative sessions on major news 
channels such as NDTV and India TV; and leading 
community wellness initiatives through yoga 
sessions and health camps.
His reach extends far beyond cities and towns, 
as he speaks to millions of households each 
day, raising awareness and offering alternative 
solutions to modern-day health problems.
Making Ayurveda  
mainstream again
From his roots as a motivational speaker 
promoting preventive health to becoming a 
national voice in Ayurveda, Acharya Manish Ji 
has brought pragmatism, authenticity, and scale 
to an ancient science. He is widely regarded for 
demystifying Ayurveda and making it relevant for 
today’s generation, especially among the youth 
who increasingly seek natural and sustainable 
solutions.
His contribution extends beyond treatments. 
He has created educational content, led public 
engagement campaigns, and initiated grassroots-
level healthcare awareness, ensuring that Ayurveda 
is seen not as a last resort, but a first step.
A symbol of hope  
and healing
For us at Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited, Acharya 
Manish Ji is more than a founder; he is our guiding 
force. His resolute commitment to wellness, his 
deep faith in Ayurveda, and his drive to serve society 
have shaped every decision and direction we take.
He envisions a future where holistic health is not a 
privilege, but a right. His dream is not limited to India 
as he aspires to take India’s Ayurvedic heritage to 
the global stage. And with every new patient healed, 
every clinic opened, and every product created, we 
move one step closer to that dream.

A visionary with a mission
Driven by a singular mantra - ‘अपना डॉक्टर खुद बनो’ (‘Be 
your own doctor’), Acharya Manish Ji has redefined how 
we view healthcare in modern India. His philosophy is 
based on self-awareness, preventive health, and nature-
aligned living. He firmly believes that the key to good 
health lies not in chemicals but in a harmonious balance 
of the body, mind, and lifestyle, guided by ancient 
Ayurvedic wisdom.
Through years of rigorous study in Ayurveda and 
Naturopathy, Acharya Ji developed the golden therapy; a 
proprietary, holistic treatment approach that addresses 
chronic and lifestyle diseases without harmful side 
effects. This revolutionary therapy now brings renewed 
hope to thousands across the country.
Media Presence
National &  
Regional TV Presence:
Acharya Ji’s journey started when 
conventional medicine failed to address his 
childhood health challenges. It was only after 
being introduced to Ayurveda by his uncle that 
his condition began to improve. That turning 
point ignited in him a purpose far greater 
than personal healing: to revive Ayurveda 
as a mainstream, science-backed, lifestyle-
oriented healthcare system accessible to all.
Today, along with the vision of  
Acharya Manish Ji, the Company is being 
driven forward by an equally strong and 
dedicated management team. This leadership 
brings deep expertise across diverse domains 
of healthcare.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
From a 
vision to a 
Movement
Our journey
Our journey began in 2009, 
a single step towards a 
healthier, more balanced 
future, guided by the visionary 
ideals of Acharya Manish Ji. 
What started as a humble effort to 
offer Ayurvedic solutions has today 
grown into a respected healthcare 
institution impacting lives across 
India and beyond. Over the years,  
our focus has remained clear: to 
bring Ayurveda to the centre of 
modern healthcare, and to make 
holistic wellness accessible to all. 
The birth of a vision
The seeds of our story were planted in 2009, 
when Acharya Manish Ji envisioned a Bharat 
free from disease and drug dependency. That 
same year, we commenced the sale of Ayurvedic 
medicines, initiating our mission to offer natural, 
root-cause-based health solutions.
Expanding  
with new 
models and 
new markets
We surpassed 1,600 
operational bed 
capacity with newly 
added 573 beds across 
a total of 77 units.
Towards  
integrated care
We expanded from products to 
personalised healthcare services, 
establishing our first Ayurvedic 
centre in Chandigarh. This 
marked our entry into community-
based healing, offering patients 
the benefit of in-person diagnosis 
and lifestyle guidance.
Advanced 
care through 
Panchakarma
We reached a significant 
milestone in 2020 with the 
inauguration of the Shuddhi 
Ayurveda Panchakarma Hospital 
in Derabassi. This facility elevated 
our capacity to deliver deep 
detoxification and rejuvenation 
therapies, enhancing treatment 
outcomes and reinforcing our 
expertise in Panchakarma.
A milestone  
year
We crossed a remarkable 
revenue threshold, 
registering ₹324 crore in 
FY24, reflecting both the 
efficacy of our model and 
the growing relevance of 
Ayurveda in today’s health-
conscious environment.
Scaling  
with purpose
Our community’s trust fuelled 
our growth. By 2021, we had 
established over 50 operational 
centres across India, a tribute 
to the increasing demand for 
authentic, holistic healthcare and 
the credibility we had earned.
Public support
We successfully completed 
our IPO in 2022, raising  
₹55.5 crore. This capital 
infusion allowed us to 
accelerate our growth, 
strengthen our infrastructure, 
and expand our reach, 
reinforcing our commitment 
to wellness at scale.
Expanding reach. 
Deepening impact.
We widened our national  
footprint by opening large 
hospitals in Lucknow, Jaipur, 
and Navi Mumbai, while also 
launching 20 mid- and small-
sized centres across other cities.
Our brand  
of care
With our brand ‘Shuddhi 
Ayurveda’ officially launched 
in 2018, we began building a 
network of dedicated Ayurvedic 
healthcare centres across India.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Ease of access to  
holistic wellness
Our footprint
Accessibility of the healing power of Ayurveda is a key element of our 
mission. Through strategic expansion and focus on patient-centric 
care, we have built one of the most extensive networks of Ayurvedic 
hospitals and clinics in the country.
Pan-India presence 
Our corporate headquarters in Zirakpur, 
Punjab, along with a key business 
execution centre in Delhi, serve as 
strategic anchors in our mission 
to extend the reach and impact of 
Ayurveda across the nation.
Hub-and-spoke model
We operate on a robust hub-and-
spoke geographical expansion 
model, which enables us to deliver 
consistent, high-quality care while 
scaling efficiently. This strategic 
model anchors large, well-equipped 
Ayurvedic hospitals as hubs, 
supported by a growing constellation 
of spoke clinics, ensuring wide access 
to preventive, curative, and lifestyle-
based therapies. By decentralising 
care and streamlining delivery through 
this model, we not only optimise 
resource utilisation but also enhance 
reach across urban and rural India.
International 
expansion
We have taken our first step towards 
global growth with plans for a centre 
in UAE, which will mark our foray into 
the international markets.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Synergistic. 
Scalable.   
Sustainable.
Business model positioning
We operate a well-integrated, 
dual-vertical business model 
that combines high-margin 
Ayurvedic products with scalable 
healthcare services. This unique 
convergence reinforced by a light 
capital model, robust franchise 
network, and synergistic 
cross-sell structure, enables 
us to deliver holistic wellness 
solutions while maintaining 
operational flexibility, optimising 
capital deployment, and achieving 
sustained financial growth.
As we expand our footprint 
across India and venture globally, 
we remain focused on delivering 
value to all stakeholders - 
patients, partners, franchisees, and 
shareholders alike.
85%. Sales are driven through multiple 
channels, including in-house healthcare 
centres, franchise partners, tele-calling 
operations, e-commerce, and now via 
OTC channel. By working with a trusted 
network of third-party manufacturers, 
we ensure uncompromised quality and 
uninterrupted supply. This vertical not 
only strengthens our service ecosystem 
but also generates healthy cash flows 
that reinforce the Company’s financial 
stability.
Strong Synergy 
Between Products 
and Services
A key differentiator of our model 
is the natural synergy between the 
services and product businesses. 
Patients who initially purchase our 
Ayurvedic products often engage with 
our healthcare centres for deeper 
wellness interventions, while patients 
receiving treatments at our centres are 
introduced to our product portfolio for 
Integrated  
Hub-and-Spoke 
Healthcare Network
Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited delivers 
Ayurveda-based healthcare through a 
wide network of hospitals and clinics, 
strategically structured using a hub-
and-spoke model. This design ensures 
maximum accessibility for patients 
while maintaining operational efficiency. 
The model is both CAPEX and OPEX-
efficient, enabling optimal utilisation 
of resources and minimisation of fixed 
costs. By leveraging economies of 
scale, we gain substantial operating 
leverage once occupancy breakeven 
levels are surpassed, allowing for 
sustainable and scalable expansion.

Turning interest   
into impact 
Robust Care Funnel
Our robust care funnel lies at the heart of our mission to make 
holistic, Ayurvedic healthcare accessible and effective for all. 
Built on the pillars of education, engagement and empathy, our 
care funnel transforms first-time interactions into lasting 
relationships. It enables us to reach out, inform, inspire and 
ultimately convert interest into action, spanning the entire patient 
journey from awareness to inpatient care.
Our funnel is a meticulously structured system that integrates online engagement, 
multimedia outreach, offline initiatives, and personalised patient support. Through 
this, we not only expand our reach but also reinforce our commitment to quality 
care, enhancing our revenue streams and operational growth in the process.
Omni-channel visibility
Building trust and awareness at scale
Our care funnel begins with omnipresent visibility, 
leveraging the vast reach of social media, national and 
regional television, radio, print, and even cinema to 
spread awareness about holistic wellness and Ayurvedic 
care. These platforms help us position ourselves not just 
as healthcare providers, but as health educators.
Our media presence includes:
•	
National & regional television, newspapers, radio, and 
cinema - These traditional media channels enable 
us to access a diverse and expansive demographic, 
driving both brand credibility and patient inflow
•	
Social media channels - We maintain one of the most 
formidable digital footprints in the Indian alternative 
medicine space, fostering awareness and patient 
education
Our digital impact includes
Call centre 
outreach
Converting queries into 
consultations
Beyond visibility, our Client Support 
Centre ensures that every enquiry 
is nurtured into meaningful 
engagement. Through continuous 
and proactive interaction, our trained 
executives reach out to potential and 
existing patients, resolve queries, and 
schedule appointments. This touch 
point forms the connective tissue 
between awareness and action, 
ensuring timely medical guidance and 
fostering patient trust.
Healthcare camps
Direct outreach.  
Direct impact.
Our 72-hour healthcare camps play a 
pivotal role in identifying and guiding 
patients who require more intensive 
care. These camps not only serve as 
revenue-generating events but also 
create a structured referral system for 
our clinics and hospitals. 
During FY25, we conducted 18 
healthcare camps, attended by  
1,244 cumulative visitors, each of 
whom entered our ecosystem through 
real-time, on-ground engagement.
Outpatient growth
From walk-in to wellness
Our outpatient, COD, and VC model 
have collectively helped us serve 
millions of patients, year after year. 
This steady rise in OPD and allied 
volumes reflects the trust we have 
built, and our ability to cater to diverse 
patient needs across geographies.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
A year of 
Purposeful 
Progress
Letter to shareholders
Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pride to 
address you at the close of yet 
another transformative year at 
Jeena Sikho Lifecare. 
FY25 was a period of focused 
execution, disciplined expansion, 
and deep commitment to our 
mission of healing India through 
authentic Ayurvedic and 
alternative medicine practices.
Staying true to our purpose
Our journey is rooted in a simple yet powerful 
belief that nature has the power to heal, and that 
holistic care can change lives. We continue to 
lead the resurgence of Ayurveda and alternative 
therapies as trusted and effective solutions for 
chronic, lifestyle and critical ailments.
As India grapples with rising healthcare costs 
and accessibility challenges, especially in 
non-urban geographies, our approach stands 
out. We offer a complete continuum of 
care - from prevention and wellness to cure 
and maintenance - by integrating Ayurveda, 
Panchakarma, Homeopathy, and Naturopathy. 
Our focus is not only on treating symptoms but 
also on addressing the root cause and restoring 
harmony in body, mind, and spirit.
Strengthening our 
foundations
We now have 1,600 operational beds (with 
1,218 in pipeline) across our facilities - a 
significant increase from the previous year. Our 
focus on expanding access through a capital-
light model has proven to be a game-changer. 
This strategy allows us to add capacity with 
minimal upfront investment, faster break-even, 
and greater operational leverage.
Additionally, our average occupancy rate for 
the entire portfolio averaged 53%, with several 
mature hospitals like Dera Bassi, Lucknow, and 
Mumbai achieving 70-90% occupancy. We’re 
now aiming for an overall occupancy level of 
60-70% in FY26.
Our hospitals are known for delivering 
consistent and high-quality care. With 41 
NABH-certified facilities and 6 more on the 
way, we remain committed to the highest 
standards of quality & clinical excellence. We 
are also proud to have developed scientific 
rigour, with 370 research papers contributed, of 
which 70 have been accepted and 17 published.
Scaling with purpose
Our mission to make Ayurveda more accessible 
is being realised through the strategic rollout 
of new centres, capacity additions in existing 
hospitals, and aggressive brand building 
across underpenetrated regions. We are also 
scaling high-margin verticals such as liver 
health, infertility (especially IVF failure cases), 
depression, and sexual wellness. Liver check-
up camps are now driving significant patient 
flow across seven hospitals, and we are seeing 
tangible outcomes, including 16 cases of 
conception in IVF failure patients using our 
integrative approach.
We are also enabling cashless insurance 
options to increase volumes, supported by tie-
ups with 12 private insurers and multiple public 
insurance players. The recent inclusion of 
Ayurveda under Ayushman Bharat will further 
democratise access to our services.
On the product side, we are exploring OTC 
channels and e-commerce for our Ayurvedic 
kits and formulations. We are preparing 
for a more focused push into this space. 
Accordingly, we are also constantly expanding 
our product offerings in this segment. 
Strong growth. 
Strengthened belief.
FY25 was a landmark year in many ways.  
We crossed a significant threshold with 
revenues reaching ₹469 crore, growing 
45% over the previous year. This was driven 
primarily by an 84% surge in our services 
revenue to ₹254 crore, as patient confidence 
in our hospitals, clinics, and day-care centres 
deepened. Simultaneously, our products 
business grew to ₹215 crore, supported by a 
strong portfolio and the successful launch 
of innovations like the Water INJK Technique 
Device and most recently Pet Liver Shuddhi 
Kit. We have over 10 more innovative product 
launches planned this year, which will further 
boost our overall product portfolio. 
Notably, we achieved this while navigating 
inflationary pressures and the costs of 
expansion. Our EBITDA stood at ₹125 crore with 
a margin of 27%, and PAT at ₹91 crore. These 
numbers reflect not just financial prudence, but 
the scalability and resilience of our model.
Investing in people and 
processes
Behind every milestone lies the dedication of our 
people. Our team strength rose to 3,700 in FY25, 
including 481 Ayurvedic doctors. We continue to 
invest in hiring, training, and onboarding talent 
from top Ayurvedic institutions, which will be 
strengthened especially through our Ayurveda 
college hospital tie-ups. These partnerships not 
only support our growth but also enhance the 
clinical experience and quality of care.
We’ve also expanded our call centre to 800 seats 
to improve outreach, patient education, and 
follow-up services. With this infrastructure in 
place, we are better equipped to serve patients 
at scale with personalised care.
Looking ahead with 
confidence
As we look to FY26, we are optimistic about 
achieving another record year in revenue and 
crossing 3,000 operational beds. Over the next 
five years, we aim to scale up to 8,000-10,000 
beds, mostly via our asset-light model. With 
increasing traction in insurance, new product 
launches, and higher utilisation of our existing 
assets, we expect profitability to improve further.
Our migration to the main board has marked 
another step in our journey of transparency, 
governance, and shareholder value creation. We 
remain deeply committed to creating long-term 
value through operational excellence, disciplined 
expansion, and the transformative power of 
Ayurveda.
Thank you for your 
continued trust and belief 
in our vision. Together, 
we are not just building a 
Company, we are nurturing 
a movement for a healthier, 
more balanced India.
Warm regards,
Manish Grover

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
A robust 
framework for a  
responsible future
Corporate Governance
Corporate governance is 
more than a regulatory 
requirement, it is a 
reflection of our 
commitment to long-
term value creation and 
our mission of advancing 
holistic healthcare 
through Ayurveda. Our 
governance framework is 
anchored in ethics, driven 
by transparency, and 
guided by accountability. 
It ensures that we 
remain steadfast in our 
responsibilities to our 
shareholders, our patients, 
our employees, and the 
communities we serve.
Over the years, we have steadily 
enhanced our governance 
standards to align with the 
scale and ambition of our 
growing organisation. In FY25, 
we took several meaningful 
strides to reinforce the 
governance backbone that 
supports our operations and 
drives stakeholder confidence.
Trust through transparency
We believe that informed investors are confident 
investors. That is why we prioritise proactive, 
two-way communication. Through detailed 
investor presentations and regular conference 
calls, we provide timely updates on our financial 
performance, strategic direction, and operational 
developments. These interactions reflect our 
openness and foster a strong foundation of trust 
with the investor community.
Three years of consistent 
dividend for our 
shareholders
FY25 marked the third consecutive year of dividend 
payouts since our listing in 2022. Our continued 
payouts in FY23, FY24, and FY25 highlight 
our ability to generate consistent profits while 
reinvesting in our core mission: delivering high-
quality, affordable Ayurvedic healthcare at scale.

Upholding ethical leadership

making, encouraging our leadership to uphold 
the highest standards of integrity. We ensure 
compliance with all laws and regulations, not just 
in form, but in spirit, across every geography in 
which we operate. The code reinforces our values 
of honesty, responsibility, and purpose-driven 
leadership.

mainboard in August 2025
With consistent financial performance and 
strengthened governance practices, Jeena Sikho

architecture. Our Code of Conduct, and any

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Strategically scaling 
alternative medicine 
Outlook
Our journey is guided by a single, clear vision: to make holistic, 
affordable and evidence-based Ayurvedic healthcare accessible 
to all. We are building a robust and scalable ecosystem that 
combines the wisdom of Ayurveda with strategic operational 
expansion and clinical excellence.
Our growth is rooted in our commitment to integrated, evidence-based 
alternative healthcare. Our unique strengths position us well to scale 
responsibly, serve more patients, and lead the way in Ayurvedic and  
holistic healing.
An integrated and 
holistic model
Our model is built around an integrated 
approach that combines Ayurveda, 
Panchakarma, Homeopathy, and 
Naturopathy. This enables us to deliver 
complete healthcare - prevention, 
diagnosis, treatment, and wellness 
management - under one roof. Through 
this synergy, we address a broad range 
of chronic and lifestyle diseases with 
safe, natural, and time-tested solutions.
Founder-led vision 
and deep expertise
Our journey is guided by the profound 
vision of our founder, Acharya Manish 
Ji, whose expertise and commitment to 
Ayurveda have laid the groundwork for 
JSLL’s mission. Backed by a qualified 
and passionate professional team, we 
deliver consistent, compassionate care 
to all patients.
Optimising existing 
assets
We are working to increase the 
utilisation of our existing hospitals 
and clinics by improving patient flow 
and service delivery. This will help us 
extract greater value from our current 
network and achieve better operating 
leverage.
Capacity expansion
To meet rising demand, we plan to open 
new centres and expand bed capacity 
in our existing ones. This expansion will 
not only increase our service coverage 
but also help us cater to a broader 
demographic more effectively.
Skilled medical talent
Our team of highly qualified Ayurvedic 
doctors has extensive experience in 
managing complex and chronic health 
conditions. Their clinical expertise 
ensures superior patient outcomes 
through holistic therapies, fostering 
trust and credibility in our offerings.
Proven track record
Over the years, we have treated several 
lakh patients, enabling them to live 
healthier lives without side effects. Our 
products and therapies have repeatedly 
demonstrated clinical effectiveness, 
building strong validation for our 
approach.
Capital-light, scalable 
business model
Our unique capital-light model, 
comprising a mix of Company-operated 
and franchised centres, enables 
fast-paced expansion with high 
operating leverage. By keeping per-bed 
investment minimal and focusing on 
swift breakeven, we generate robust 
ROCE and strong profitability, making 
our growth highly scalable.
Widening medicine 
reach via OTC 
channel
We are entering the OTC (over-the-
counter) sales segment for Ayurvedic 
medicines, making our products easily 
accessible via pharmacies, retail 
outlets, and online platforms. This 
will boost product visibility, consumer 
access, and revenue.
Innovative product 
kits
We will continue to introduce new 
Ayurvedic kits catering to specific 
health conditions and lifestyle needs, 
strengthening our product portfolio and 
consumer engagement.
Insurance enablement 
to drive volumes
We are collaborating with insurance 
providers to facilitate cashless 
insurance at our facilities. This will 
reduce the financial burden on patients 
and make Ayurvedic care more 
accessible to a wider audience.
Rigorous quality 
and accreditation
We maintain high-quality standards 
across our network. As of FY25, 41 
of our facilities are NABH-certified, 
with 6 more under accreditation. 
This reinforces our credibility and 
adherence to best practices in 
Ayurvedic healthcare.
Scientific validation 
and evidence-based 
care
We remain committed to backing 
Ayurveda with science. We have 
developed and submitted 370 
research papers, of which 70 have 
been accepted and 17 published. This 
drive for empirical validation sets 
us apart in the alternative medicine 
space.
Increased coverage 
under government 
schemes
We anticipate greater inclusion of 
our centres under government health 
panels and the Ministry of AYUSH 
programmes. This will help us serve 
government employees and their 
families with affordable Ayurvedic 
treatment.
Accelerating brand 
building
To support our expansion, we are 
investing in focused brand-building 
campaigns to enhance awareness 
and recall, especially in untapped 
and underpenetrated geographies. A 
strong brand will be critical in capturing 
consumer trust and market share.
Strengths driving holistic growth
Strengths driving holistic growth
As Ayurveda gains mainstream acceptance across India and 
globally, we are building on our strengths to scale sustainably, 
deepen our presence, and enhance our offerings. Our strategic 
roadmap focuses on multiple growth levers.

Voices of trust 
Testimonials
We believe the true measure of our impact lies not just in 
numbers, but in the lives we transform. The voices of our 
patients, drawn from cities, towns, and villages across India, 
speak with sincerity and conviction about their journeys 
toward better health and well-being through Ayurveda.
Their stories echo our 
commitment to holistic 
healing, our empathy in 
care delivery, and the 
tangible improvements 
they’ve experienced 
under our guidance. 
Whether its relief from 
long-standing chronic 
conditions or renewed 
vitality in daily life, our 
patients stand as living 
proof of the effectiveness 
and credibility of our 
therapies.
Comedian Bharti 
Singh’s Mother
When Mrs. Singh was admitted to 
our facility, allopathic doctors had 
advised her to take dialysis but 
she avoided this course of action. 
Since she began her treatment, she 
noticed significant improvement 
in her health. She was on insulin 
for 20-25 years before she came 
to Jeena Sikho Lifecare. Within 4 
days, she was off the insulin.
Mr. Vivek Kumar
A Liver Cirrhosis patient for five 
years, taking multiple treatments. 
After getting in touch with 
Acharyaji, he has now stopped his 
allopathy medicines.
Mr. Rajiv Thakur
When our clients’ parents came 
to Jeena Sikho after years of 
declining health, Acharya Manish’s 
personalized Ayurvedic care began 
reversing chronic issues within 
just three months. Half of their 
conditions have already healed, with 
steady progress on the rest. More 
than caregivers, our team fearlessly 
advocates for patients, challenging 
medical doubt with results. 
Mr. Rajesh Narang
He was suffering since 2013 and 
had already taken over seven 
chemo sessions, ultimately having 
to hear that it is not curable. 
After coming to Jeena Sikho and 
undergoing all the treatment for a 
week, he is feeling much better and 
a hope that he will be cured.
Smt. Neeta Kapoor
In 2017 when she came to Jeena 
Sikho, her heart pulse was very low, 
had a fatty liver, high uric acid, and 
a high lipid profile. Other doctors 
had advised her to use a pacemaker, 
otherwise her heart won’t function 
properly. She had consulted doctors 
across India and abroad too. But 
after getting in touch with Jeena 
Sikho, her heart pulse has improved 
and all other problems are in control.
Mr. Akshay Kumar
When he experienced a 14-day 
Ayurvedic retreat, he left behind 
TV, phones, and junk food—
embracing white kurta-pajamas, 
wholesome meals. He felt lighter, 
more peaceful, and renewed—like 
discovering a hidden paradise. 
The experience helped him truly 
understand the value of traditional 
treatments, including Ayurvedic 
medicines and therapies.
Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi’s 
Brother 
When Modi ji’s brother came to us 
he used to undergo dialysis twice 
a week wherein 4.5 litres of water 
was removed from his body. Now 
the water content has reduced to 3 
litres and he is looking forward to 
being free from dialysis soon.
Mr. Vivek Oberoi
He came to Jeena Sikho seeking 
true wellness through balance of 
mind and body. Guided by Acharya 
Manish, he began daily Shatayu 
Tea and learned meditation for 
lasting peace and mental stability. 
Now, he meets challenges with 
self-awareness and clarity. Grateful 
to Acharya Manish and our team, 
he proudly supports our mission to 
uplift the health and happiness of 
every Indian.
Mr. Ashwini 
Upadhyay  
When top hospitals 
recommended knee surgery for 
his father, he came to our HIMS 
Chandigarh centre - just ten days 
of Ayurvedic and rehab care had 
his father walking pain-free, no 
surgery needed. These recoveries 
show our commitment to 
effective, affordable healing.
Dr. Suresh 
Chavhanke  
A respected journalist brought 
his father - told he needed 
surgery - to Jeena Sikho. 
Just two and a half weeks of 
Ayurvedic and Panchakarma 
care, his father’s reports 
came back clear. A powerful 
example of our compassionate, 
evidence-based healing.
Each testimonial is not merely a 
statement of satisfaction, it is an 
affirmation of trust. These grateful 
words reflect our ability to deliver 
time-tested Ayurvedic solutions with 
compassion, consistency, and results.
We consider it our privilege to walk 
alongside our patients on their path to 
healing, and their gratitude strengthens 
our resolve to make authentic 
Ayurvedic care more accessible and 
impactful across geographies.

STATUTORY REPORT
Economic overview
Indian economy
FY25 marked another year of 
resilience and strong economic 
fundamentals for India, despite 
prevailing global uncertainties. 
The Indian economy retained its 
position as the fastest-growing 
major economy, driven by strong 
domestic demand, robust investment 
activity, and improved infrastructure 
development. Real GDP growth 
continued above 7%, reinforced by 
private consumption, government 
capital expenditure, and a healthy 
revival in manufacturing and services.
Inflationary pressures witnessed a 
moderation due to effective supply-
side management and a favourable 
global commodity environment. The 
RBI’s monetary policy maintained 
a calibrated balance between 
controlling inflation and supporting 
growth, while financial stability 
remained intact. Bank credit grew 
steadily, supported by strong capital 
adequacy ratios and improved asset 
quality.
The government’s continued thrust 
on infrastructure, health, and digital 
connectivity spurred employment 
generation and enterprise 
development. Initiatives promoting 
ease of doing business, rural 
empowerment, and skill development 
contributed to inclusive growth. Public 
sector capex reached record levels, 
crowding in private investments 
across sectors.
Particularly relevant to our industry, 
the wellness and preventive 
healthcare ecosystem received a 
boost through increased attention 
to AYUSH systems, backed by 
awareness campaigns, research 
support, and insurance linkages under 
Ayushman Bharat. The environment 
remained conducive for traditional 
healthcare players like Jeena Sikho 
Lifecare Limited to build scale and 
deepen patient engagement across 
urban and rural landscapes.
Outlook 
Looking ahead, India’s economic 
outlook remains optimistic and 
forward-looking. The foundations 
laid over the past years, ranging 
from policy reforms to infrastructure 
investments, are expected to yield 
long-term dividends. Real GDP growth 
is projected to remain strong in FY26, 
with estimates placing it in the range of 
6.5% to 7%, driven by robust domestic 
demand, enhanced formalisation, 
and continued government push on 
public capital expenditure. The revival 
in manufacturing, growth in services, 
and better monsoon forecasts for 
agricultural output are expected to 
further support the momentum.
However, certain external headwinds 
could introduce an element of volatility. 
Among them, the recent imposition 
of tariffs by the United States on key 
sectors such as steel, aluminium, and 
certain pharmaceutical ingredients 
could create ripple effects across 
global trade channels. While India’s 
direct exposure remains moderate, 
any prolonged disruption in trade flows 
or weakening of global demand may 
have indirect implications on exports 
and investor sentiment. Policymakers 
are expected to remain agile, closely 
monitoring the evolving geo-economic 
environment.
Rural and semi-urban consumption is 
likely to improve with better agricultural 
output, while service sector expansion 
and export opportunities are expected 
to strengthen. With inflation expected 
to stay within manageable bounds, 
monetary policy may offer additional 
headroom for stimulating growth 
where needed.
For the healthcare sector in particular, 
the outlook is promising. Continued 
promotion of traditional systems of 
medicine under the Ministry of AYUSH, 
wider insurance coverage including 
Ayurveda under Ayushman Bharat, and 
empanelment of Day Care Therapy 
Centres are likely to deepen access to 
holistic healthcare. The government’s 
‘Heal in India’ medical tourism push 
further enhances the export potential 
of Ayurvedic treatments.
At Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited, 
we see these macroeconomic 
tailwinds as aligned with our growth 
strategy. The growing demand for 
alternative medicine, coupled with 
digital health initiatives, increased 
affordability through insurance, and a 
rising preference for preventive care, 
presents a compelling opportunity. 
As we expand our hospital footprint, 
strengthen our product portfolio, 
and enter new geographies including 
international markets, we remain 
confident of sustained growth and 
long-term value creation for all our 
stakeholders.

Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)
Industry overview
Indian Ayurvedic 
products market 
The Indian Ayurvedic products market 
is experiencing remarkable momentum 
and expansive growth. In 2024, the 
market reached a substantial size of 
₹875.9 billion. Consumer preference 
is shifting decisively towards natural 
and chemical-free remedies, driven by 
rising awareness of health, wellness, 
and side-effect concerns, all of which 
bolster the demand for Ayurvedic 
offerings.
Looking forward, the market is 
projected to grow at a robust CAGR of 
16.17% from 2025-2033, culminating in 
an anticipated value of ₹3,605.0 billion 
by 2033. This trajectory positions 
the sector as one of the fastest-
growing in wellness and personal care, 
underpinned by widening distribution 
networks, rising digital adoption, and 
increasing interest in preventive care.
Several core dynamics are driving this 
expansion:
1.	 Organised segment 
leadership
	
The organised market, comprising 
branded, standardised products, 
has emerged as the dominant 
segment, reflecting enhanced 
consumer trust, regulatory 
compliance, and brand visibility.
2.	 North India at the helm
	
North India leads the market in 
both consumption and growth, 
benefiting from rising disposable 
incomes, improved supply chains, 
and high e-commerce penetration.
3.	 Healthcare products  
at scale
	
Within the product mix, healthcare 
categories, such as nutraceuticals 
and therapeutic medicines, occupy 
the largest market share, driven by 
increasing demand for wellness-
oriented supplements and herbal 
formulations.
4.	 Expanding reach and 
government support
	
Widespread availability, across 
urban and rural centres via online 
and offline channels, is increasing 
accessibility. Simultaneously, 
government-led initiatives, 
including trade fairs, exhibitions, 
and R&D incentives, are further 
promoting Ayurveda domestically 
and globally.
5.	 Innovation and consumer 
trust
	
The market is witnessing strong 
growth in consumer interest 
across segments such as 
organic skincare, home remedies, 
and herbal-infused products. 
Meanwhile, the surge in digital 
awareness, due to rising social 
media use, has opened new 
avenues for product discovery and 
brand engagement.

Bottom line is, the Indian Ayurvedic

economic tailwinds, institutional

preferences, this sets a compelling 
stage for Jeena Sikho to deepen 
its presence, innovate responsibly,

Indian health & 
wellness industry 
The Indian health and wellness 
sector is evolving into a multifaceted 
ecosystem, embracing both clinical 
and preventive care. According to 
IMARC Group, the overall wellness 
market reached approximately 
USD 156 billion in 2024, with 
projections for it to reach USD 256.9 
billion by 2033 at a healthy CAGR 
of 5.3%. A closely related segment, 
wellness tourism, is already valued at 
USD 19.22 billion, expected to grow to 
USD 38.13 billion by 2033 with a CAGR 
of 7.3%.
Supporting this growth, the Ministry 
of AYUSH, through programmes like 
the National AYUSH Mission (NAM), 
has established over 12,500 AYUSH 
Health & Wellness Centres (AHWCs), 
delivering primary AYUSH-based 
healthcare via initiatives such as 
Yoga, medicinal plants, and lifestyle 
advice. These efforts reflect a 
significant government commitment 
to promoting holistic health across 
urban and rural India.
Strategic alignment
This robust market growth mirrors 
many of Jeena Sikho’s strategic 
priorities:
•	
Our Shuddhi-branded portfolio, 
covering over 330 SKUs, is well-
placed to leverage rising demand 
across healthcare and personal 
care categories.
•	
High gross margins in our product 
business (~85%) and expanding 
access through call centres, 
e-commerce, clinics, and emerging 
OTC channels position us strongly 
against the shifting market 
currents.

growth engine
	
India’s reputation as a wellness 
hub is on the rise. Wellness 
centres, retreats, yoga hubs, and 
Ayurvedic resorts are attracting 
both domestic and global 
travellers. Wellness tourism, 
growing at 7.3% CAGR, is outpacing 
the broader wellness market.
C.	 Digital enablement and 
Tele-Ayush

driven segment
	
Consumers are gravitating 
towards certified, evidence-based 
wellness providers. The NAM’s

professionalising the sector.
E.	 Growing corporate 
wellness
	
A strong corporate wellness 
market (USD 2.5 billion in 2024, 
growing 5.1% CAGR) underlining 
workplace health as a rising 
segment.
Key opportunities
Scale through wellness 
tourism
India’s wellness tourism market, 
already large and mounting, offers 
opportunities for integrative centres 
combining treatments, retreats, 
and digital engagement pathways, 
including Ayush Visa facilitation.
Ayush centre expansion
The rollout of over 12,500 AHWCs 
under Ayushman Bharat provides a 
platform to expand services, conduct 
health camps, and integrate AYUSH 
protocols in underserved areas.
Digital & tele-wellness reach
With telemedicine and mobile health 
platforms, scaling outreach and 
follow-up care into India’s hinterlands 
becomes viable, enabling personalised 
wellness journeys at scale.
Brand differentiation via 
quality accreditation
NAM-supported certification 
frameworks offer trust. Jeena Sikho 
can leverage NABH standards 
alongside NAM endorsements to 
position itself distinctly in quality-
focused care.
Integrated offerings tailored 
to working professionals
Drawing on corporate wellness 
demand (USD 2.5B market), JSLL can 
design preventive programmes, stress 
management retreats, and digital 
wellness campaigns for businesses.
Rising lifestyle disorders 
The escalating incidence of lifestyle-
related ailments such as diabetes, 
hypertension, and cardiovascular 
conditions is significantly contributing 
to the growing demand for alternative 
healthcare solutions.
Ayurveda’s Renewed Relevance
The popularity of Ayurveda and other 
alternative healing systems has 
witnessed a marked rise, both in India 
and globally, particularly in the wake 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Inclusion of AYUSH under 
Insurance
In a landmark regulatory development, 
IRDAI has mandated the inclusion 
of AYUSH treatments under health 
insurance coverage.
Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)

Annual Report 2024-25
JEENA SIKHO LIFECARE LIMITED
STATUTORY REPORT
Key threats & 
challenges
Regulatory harmonisation
Multiple authorities - AYUSH, NAM, 
NABH, state bodies, govern the sector. 
Keeping compliance aligned across 
geographies is critical.
Quality assurance and 
consumer trust
Standardisation of service and 
safety protocols is essential to 
avoid reputational risks amid rising 
expectations.
Market competition and 
brand proliferation
While certification channels create 
differentiation, competition from 
rapid-scaled organised players and 
overseas resorts is intense.
Economic/cross-border 
volatility
Wellness tourism is sensitive to 
macroeconomic shifts and travel 
disruptions, so international ambitions 
must be hedged accordingly.
Talent and institutional 
capability
Scaling high-quality AYUSH care 
requires skilled practitioners. While 
AHWCs build awareness, training and 
retaining talent remains a challenge.
Limited awareness and 
perception
Ayurveda continues to face a 
credibility gap, primarily due to limited 
public awareness and the perceived 
lack of evidence-based treatment 
protocols.
Insufficient professional 
recognition
Despite its ancient lineage and 
cultural significance, Ayurveda as 
a profession still struggles with 
institutional recognition.
Gaps in research and 
scientific validation
While India is actively promoting Yoga 
and Ayurveda on global platforms, 
the lack of a robust scientific 
research ecosystem remains a key 
impediment.
Need for stronger 
regulatory oversight
The Ayurveda industry, though 
rapidly growing, remains largely 
unregulated, raising concerns around 
standardisation, quality assurance, 
and authenticity.
Conclusion
India’s health and wellness industry 
is undergoing robust transformation, 
fuelled by government policy, rising 
health consciousness, wellness 
travel, and digital enablement. This 
environment offers a fertile platform 
for Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited to 
deepen geographical reach, reinforce 
quality credentials, and integrate 
experiences, from AYUSH centre 
networks to holistic retreats and 
digital wellness.
By focusing on trust, clinical rigour, 
and evidence-based holistic care, 
we aim to build enduring value for 
patients and stakeholders. Well 
positioned at the intersection of 
tradition and modernity, Jeena Sikho 
is poised to emerge as a national 
leader in holistic healthcare, delivering 
wellness with purpose and scale.

STATUTORY REPORT
Operational 
highlights
FY25 marked a significant phase of 
expansion and operational scale-up 
for Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited. 
We achieved a notable increase 
in our inpatient capacity, growing 
from 1,277 operational beds in the 
previous year to 1,600 beds by year-
end, the highest in our history. This 
scale-up is further supported by a 
robust pipeline of 1,218 beds, setting 
the stage for continued growth in 
the years ahead. Our IPD (in-patient 
department) volumes witnessed a 
sharp 87% increase YOY, reaching 
24,578 patients. Outpatient (OPD) 
footfalls also rose to 3.37 lakh during 
the year. This growing trust in our 
services reflects not just patient 
satisfaction, but also our ability 
to deliver integrated, high-touch 
alternative healthcare at scale.
In parallel, we strengthened our 
revenue mix through focused growth 
in both services and products 
verticals. We expanded the availability 
of high-incidence, high-margin 
therapies like liver care, infertility, 
sexual wellness, and musculoskeletal 
conditions, supported by free 
screening campaigns across centres. 
Our operational efficiencies were 
further enhanced through better 
average revenue per bed, which now 
stands at ₹8,200 vs. ₹7,900 in the 
previous year. We also advanced 
our integration with insurance 
providers to offer cashless Ayurvedic 
treatments and increased our 
presence in government healthcare 
panels, including Ayushman Bharat 
and Ministry of AYUSH programmes. 
These operational strides position 
us strongly to meet rising demand, 
expand access, and strengthen our 
leadership in holistic wellness.

Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)
Risk and concerns
At Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited 
(JSLL), we have established a robust 
Risk Management framework 
designed to proactively identify, 
evaluate, and mitigate potential 
business risks. This structured 
approach ensures continuity, 
compliance, and competitiveness 
across all aspects of our operations. 
The key risks and our strategic 
responses are outlined below.
Competition risk
As a player in a highly fragmented 
and competitive Ayurvedic healthcare 
market, JSLL operates amidst 
both organised and unorganised 
competitors. The easy availability of 
free information and home remedies 
online further intensifies competition.
Mitigation
We differentiate ourselves through 
our integrated healthcare ecosystem, 
comprising over 330 proprietary 
Shuddhi-branded products, more than 
480 experienced Ayurvedic doctors, 
and a nationwide network of hospitals, 
clinics, and franchises. In addition, 
virtual and telephonic consultations 
help us reach patients across 
geographies, offering convenience 
without compromising care quality.
Regulatory risk
Global scrutiny over the safety, 
efficacy, and standardisation of 
herbal and alternative treatments 
is increasing. Evolving regulatory 
frameworks may result in higher 
compliance costs and more rigorous 
documentation.
Mitigation
JSLL proactively adheres to all 
applicable laws and standards. Our 
emphasis on clinical excellence is 
reflected in 41 NABH-accredited 
clinics, with 6 more in the pipeline. 
We maintain strict quality protocols in 
both product development and patient 
care to ensure compliance and trust.
Reputational risk
Brand equity is central to our 
expansion strategy. Any damage 
to our reputation, whether due to 
quality issues, misinformation, or 
customer dissatisfaction, could 
adversely impact our operations and 
stakeholder trust.
Mitigation
We continue to invest in building 
and protecting the ‘Shuddhi’ brand. 
Under the active leadership of our 
founder, Acharya Manish Ji, we 
maintain visibility through national 
TV campaigns, digital platforms, and 
public awareness initiatives. We also 
focus on service consistency and 
patient satisfaction across all touch 
points.
Third-party dependency 
risk
A portion of our operations, 
including product manufacturing and 
franchisee-driven service delivery, 
relies on third-party partnerships. 
This introduces risks related to quality 
assurance, compliance, and brand 
reputation.
Mitigation
All third-party arrangements are 
governed by stringent contractual 
clauses and regular audits. 
We partner only with reputed 
manufacturers who align with our 
quality standards, and closely monitor 
franchisee performance to ensure 
adherence to JSLL’s protocols.
Litigation and legal risk
Potential consumer complaints or 
treatment-related grievances could 
lead to legal proceedings, adverse 
publicity, and erosion of consumer 
confidence.
Mitigation
We enforce a strict zero-tolerance 
policy towards quality lapses. Only 
qualified, experienced doctors are 
entrusted with patient care. Our 
dedicated contact centres are 
trained to promptly handle inquiries, 
resolve concerns, and maintain high 
customer satisfaction levels, thereby 
minimising potential disputes.

i.	
The voting period begins on Friday 26.09.2025

5.00 P.M. During this period, shareholders of the

Pursuant to SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/
CMD/CIR/P/2020/242 dated 09.12.2020, under 
Regulation 44 of Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, listed entities 
are required to provide remote e-voting facility to 
its shareholders, in respect of all shareholders’ 
resolutions. However, it has been observed that 
the participation by the public non-institutional 
shareholders/retail shareholders is at a negligible 
level.
	
Currently, there are multiple e-voting service 
providers (ESPs) providing e-voting facility to listed 
entities in India. This necessitates registration on 
various ESPs and maintenance of multiple user 
IDs and passwords by the shareholders.
	
In order to increase the efficiency of the voting 
process, pursuant to a public consultation, it 
has been decided to enable e-voting to all the 
demat account holders, by way of a single 
login credential, through their demat accounts/
websites of Depositories/Depository Participants. 
Demat account holders would be able to cast 
their vote without having to register again with 
the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating seamless 
authentication but also enhancing ease and 
convenience of participating in e-voting process.

information included in the annual report but does not 
include the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available 
to us after the date of this auditor’s report. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance or conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we will read the annual report, if we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take appropriate actions as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with 
Governance for the Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of 
the Company in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards specified under section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.

Annual Report 2024-25
JEENA SIKHO LIFECARE LIMITED
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE 
AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls system in place 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management. 
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ANNEXURE - B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS OF JEENA SIKHO LIFECARE LIMITED
(Referred to in Paragraph 2 point (f) under the heading of “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements” of our report 
of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial 
reporting of JEENA SIKHO LIFECARE LIMITED (“the 
Company”) as at March 31, 2025, in conjunction with our 
audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year 
ended on that date.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Company, considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls over financial reporting based on 
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on 
Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies 
Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls over financial 
reporting was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system 
over financial reporting.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal financial control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL 
FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls over financial reporting to future 
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control over financial reporting may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Expected to be realized within twelve months after the 
reporting period; or
- 	
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
- 	
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
- 	
It is held primarily for purpose of trading;
- 	
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period; or
- 	
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the 
liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period 
All other liabilities are classified as non current.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified 
as non- current assets and liabilities.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of 
assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as 
its operating cycle.
2.3 Use of estimates
The preparation  of the financial statements  requires 
the Management to make estimates and assumptions 
considered in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
(including contingent liabilities) and the reported income and 
expenses during the year. The Management believes that the 
estimates used in preparation of the financial statements 
are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ due 
to these estimates and the differences between the actual 
results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in 
which the results are known/materialise.
2.4 Inventories
The inventory are valued at lower of cost or net realizable 
value. The inventory costs are based on first in first out 
method. Cost includes all charges in bringing the goods to 
the point of sale, including octroi and other levies, transit 
insurance and receiving charges.
2.5 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise 
of cash at bank and in hand and short term investments 
with an original maturity of three months or less. Earmarked 
balances with bank, margin money or security against 
borrowings, guarantees and other commitments, if any shall 
be treated separately from cash and cash equivalent.
2.6 Cash flow statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby 
profit/(loss) before extraordinary items and tax is adjusted 
for the effects of transactions of non-cash nature and any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or 
payments. The cash flows from operating, investing and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated based 
on the available information.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, Plant and equipment including capital work in 
progress are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost 
comprises of purchase price, taxes, duties, freight and 
other incidental expenses directly attributable and related 
to acquisition and installation of the concerned assets 
and are further adjusted by the amount of input tax credit 
availed wherever applicable. Subsequent costs are included 
in asset’s carrying amount or recognised as separate assets, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefit associated with the item will flow to the Company 
and the cost of item can be measured reliably.

2.8 Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided 
on prorate basis on straight line method using the useful 
lives of the assets estimated by the management and in 
the manner prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies 
Act 2013. The estimated life of various assets is as follows:
Building
30 Years
Motor Cycle
10 Years
Electrical equipment's
10 Years
Furniture and Fixture
10 Years
Motor Car
8 Years
Office Equipment
5 Years
Computer and Software

2.9 Intangible assets
Separately acquired intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated 
intangibles, excluding capitalized development cost, are 
not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected 
in statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the 
expenditure is incurred. Cost comprises the purchase price 
and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.
Internally Generated intangible assets
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset 
comprises all expenditure that can be directly attributed, or 
allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis, to creating, 
producing and making the asset ready for its intended 
use. No cost incurred in the Research Phase of the asset 
is recognized. The cost incurred in the development phase 
is recognized only if the company can demonstrate the 
following conditions: 
(a) 	 the technical feasibility of completing the intangible 
asset so that it will be available for use;
(b) 	 its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or 
sell it;
(c) 	 its ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
(d) 	 how the intangible asset will generate probable future 
economic benefits. Among other things, the company 
should demonstrate the existence of a market for the 
output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset 
itself or, if it is to be used internally, the usefulness of 
the intangible asset;
(e) 	 the availability of adequate technical, financial and 
other resources to complete the development and to 
use or sell the intangible asset; and
(f) 	 its ability to measure the expenditure attributable to the 
intangible asset during its development reliably.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired on the purchase of business is recognized 
as a difference between the purchase consideration and the 
value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized over 
the period over which the economic benefits are expected to 
accrue to the Company. 
2.10 Revenue recognition
Sale of goods
Sales are recognised, net of returns and trade discounts, on 
transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership to the 
buyer, which generally coincides with the delivery of goods 
to customers. Sales exclude GST. The company follows 
the mercantile system of accounting and recognizes the 
income and expenditures on accrual basis except in case of 
significant uncertainties. 
Sale of service
Sales of services are recognized when the services are 
rendered.
2.11 Other income
Interest income is recognised on time proportion basis. 
Rental income is recognized on accrual basis.
2.12 Foreign currency transactions and 
translations
Initial recognition
Transactions in foreign currencies entered into by the 
Company are accounted at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction or at rates that closely 
approximate the rate at the date of the transaction.
Measurement of foreign currency monetary 
items at the Balance Sheet date
Foreign currency monetary items (other than derivative 
contracts) of the Company outstanding at the Balance Sheet 
date are restated at the year-end rates.
Exchange differences arising out of these translations are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.13 Investments
Long-term investments, are carried individually at cost 
less provision for diminution, other than temporary, in the 
value of such investments. Current investments are carried 
individually, at the lower of cost and fair value. Cost of 
investments include acquisition charges such as brokerage, 
fees and duties.

2.14 Employee benefits
The Company has adopted the Accounting Standard 
15- Employee Benefits prescribed under the Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006. ‘Employee benefits 
include provident fund, bonus and gratuity benefits. The 
Company’s obligation towards various employee benefits 
has been recognized as follows:
Short Term Employee Benefits
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months 
of rendering the service are short-term employee benefits. 
Benefits such as salaries, wages and bonus wages, etc, are 
recognized in the Profit and Loss statement in the period in 
which the employee renders the related service.
Defined contribution plans
The Company’s contribution to provident fund are considered 
as defined contribution plans and are charged as an expense 
as they fall due based on the amount of contribution required 
to be made.
Defined benefits plans
(i) 	 For defined-benefit plans, the amount recognised in 
the Balance Sheet is the present value of the defined-
benefit obligation less the fair value of any plan assets 
and any past service costs not yet recognised. The 
present value of the defined-benefit obligation is the 
present value of expected future payments required to 
settle the obligation resulting from employee service 
in the current and prior periods. The discount rate 
used is the market yields on government bonds at the 
Balance Sheet date with remaining terms to maturity 
approximating those of the Company’s obligations.
(ii) 	 Actuarial gains and losses in respect of post 
employment and other long-term benefits are charged 
to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Employee Stock Options
The Company measures compensation cost relating to 
employee stock options using the Fair Value Method. 
Compensation expense is amortised over the vesting period 
of the option on a straight line basis.
2.15 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred and exchange differences arising from 
foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded 
as an adjustment to the interest cost. Costs in connection 
with the borrowing of funds to the extent not directly related 
to the acquisition of qualifying assets are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss over the tenure of the loan. 
Borrowing costs, allocated to and utilised for qualifying 
assets, pertaining to the period from commencement 
of activities relating to construction/development of the 
qualifying asset up to the date of capitalisation of such 
asset is added to the cost of the assets.
Borrowing cost attributable to the fixed assets during 
construction/exploration, renovation and modernization are 
capitalized. Such borrowing costs are apportioned on the 
average balance of capital work in progress for the year. 
Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
2.16 Segment reporting
The Company identifies primary segments based on the 
dominant source, nature of risks and returns and the internal 
organisation and management structure. The operating 
segments are the segments for which separate financial 
information is available and for which operating profit/loss 
amounts are evaluated regularly by the executive. 
2.17 Taxes on income
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current 
income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities in accordance with Income Tax Act, 
1961. Deferred income tax reflects the impact of current year 
timing differences between taxable income that originates 
in one period and are capable of reversal in one or more 
subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised on timing differences, being the 
differences between the taxable income and the accounting 
income that originate in one period and are capable of 
reversal in one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax is 
measured using the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or 
substantially enacted as at the reporting date. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all timing differences. Deferred 
tax assets in respect of unabsorbed depreciation and carry 
forward of losses are recognised only if there is virtual 
certainty that there will be sufficient future taxable income 
available to realise such assets. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for timing differences of other items only to the 
extent that reasonable certainty exists that sufficient future 
taxable income will be available against which these can be 
realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if such 
items relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing 
tax laws and the Company has a legally enforceable right 
for such set off. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date for their realisability. 
2.18 Impairment of assets
The carrying values of assets/cash generating units are 
reviewed at each Balance Sheet date for impairment. If any 
indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of 
such assets is estimated and impairment is recognised if the 
carrying amount of these assets exceeds their recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net 
selling price and their value in use. Value in use is arrived at 
by discounting the future cash flows to their present value 
based on an appropriate discount factor. When there is 
indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset 
in earlier accounting periods no longer exists or may have 
decreased, such reversal of impairment loss is recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.19 Provisions and contingencies
A provision is recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation in 
respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions 
(excluding retirement benefits) are not discounted to their 
present value and are determined based on the best estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted 
to reflect the current best estimates.
A contingent liability is disclosed where, as a result of past 
events, there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of 
resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of 
resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
2.20 Leases
a) Finance lease
i)	
Assets taken on finance lease are capitalised at 
fair value or net present value of the minimum lease 
payments, whichever is less.
ii)	
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance 
charges and outstanding liability in respect of assets 
taken on lease.
b) Operating lease
i)	
Leases, where the lessor effectively retains substantially 
all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased 
term are classified as operating lease. Lease rent are 
recognized as an expense in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
2.21 Earning per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year. Partly paid equity shares are 
treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they 
were entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully 
paid equity share during the reporting year. For the purpose 
of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or 
loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders and 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity shares.

NOTE 34: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
(A) Defined benefit Plan
The defined benefit plan operated by the Company is as below:
Retiring gratuity
The Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan 
provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of 
employment of an amount equivalent to 26 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon 
completion of five years of service. The Company does not make any contributions to gratuity funds and the plan is unfunded. 
The Company accounts for the liability for gratuity benefits payable in the future based on an actuarial valuation.

JEENA SIKHO LIFECARE LIMITED
Notes to Financial Statement (Contd.)
For the year ended March 31, 2025
(All amounts in Indian Rupees in Lakhs, unless otherwise stated)
The defined benefit plans expose the Company to a number of actuarial risks as below:
(a) 	 Interest risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability.
(b) 	 Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
(c) 	 Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
The following table sets out the amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of 
retiring gratuity plan:

NOTE 42: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND 
COMMITMENT
(i)	
Director General of GST Intelligence conducted search 
on the Company premises (along with other Companies 
owned by the same promoters) on 13.04.2018. On 
03.02.2025, the GST department has issued an Order 
under section 74(9) of the Central Goods and Service 
Tax Act 2017, imposing a demand for ₹ 507.99 Lakhs 
(Inclusive of penalty of ₹ 253.99 Lakhs). The GST 
department has alleged that the Company has been 
involved in the suppression of turnover and have sold 
the goods under incorrect classification. The Company 
is preparing to file writ petition against this Order with 
the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The 
Company is expected to get the favourable opinion 
from the Hon’ble Hight Court and hence the amount 
has been disclosed as a contingent liability.
(ii)	 The Company has given Bank Guarantees amounting to 
₹ 1.29 crores to  CGHS, RGHS, NDMC, ECHS and State 
Insurance etc. for empanelment of hospital.
(iii)	 The Company received five demand notices, each 
dated 27.02.2025, from Rajasthan Government Health 
Scheme (RGHS) alleging that the Company has been 
paid an excess amount of ₹ 93.28 lacs by RGHS panel 
because of various reasons such as unnecessary 
therapies, treatment not justify etc. The RGHS has also 
levied a penalty of ₹ 186.55 Lacs on the Company and 
has raised a consolidated demand notice for ₹ 279.82 
Lacs. The Company has already paid an amount of 
₹ 93.28 Lacs to RGHS in the month of April/May 2025 
and have also recognized a provision for this amount in 
the financial statement. However, the penalty amount 
of ₹ 186.55 Lacs has been considered as a contingent 
liability as the Company is pursuing the matter with 
RGHS and has a positive opinion that the penalty 
amount will be dropped off by the RGHS.
