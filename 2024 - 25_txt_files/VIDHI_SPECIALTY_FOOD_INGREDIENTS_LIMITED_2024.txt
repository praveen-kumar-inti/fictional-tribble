1
GHG 
Emissions
R
Production processes 
generate GHG 
emissions from fossil 
fuel combustion. With 
stricter emission norms, 
the company may 
face regulatory fines, 
operational challenges, 
and compliance costs.
• Transition to low carbon 
renewable energy through a 2.5 
MW solar project at Sunbless 
Solar Park, Maharashtra.
• Energy conservation practices 
across operations
• Phasing out old equipment and 
replacing with energy-efficient 
equipment.
• Emission control by installing 
wet scrubbers on HCL, Oleum, 
and H2SO4 tanks.
• Conducting regular air quality 
monitoring and inspections to 
control air pollution.
• Wastewater recycling using 
RO systems at Dahej.
Negative
2
Water and 
Wastewater 
Management
R
Water is a critical input 
in chemical production. 
Rising scarcity, higher 
treatment costs, and 
climate change risks can 
disrupt operations and 
increase costs.
• Efficient Water Recycling by 
directing 80 KL process-water 
through Multi Evaporator Plant 
and repurposing the water for 
gardening and domestic use. 
Thus, minimising wastewater 
discharge and maximising 
resource utilisation.
• Comprehensive Wastewater 
treatment of the remaining 
process water through our 2 
stage ETP and then further 
through a Common Effluent 
Treatment Plant to reduce 
environmental impact and 
meeting regulatory standards.
• Rainwater Harvesting for use in 
gardening and other operational 
activities to conserve water and 
meet our water management 
goals.

Waste and 
Hazardous 
Material 
Management
R
Our manufacturing 
processes generate 
hazardous waste, 
such as heavy metals 
and sludge, that are 
governed by strict 
regulatory requirements 
for handling, transport, 
and disposal. Inadequate 
management could 
lead to compliance 
risks, penalties, and 
environmental liabilities.
• Responsible waste 
management: Vidhi adheres 
to Pollution Control Board 
guidelines to ensure responsible 
handling, treatment, and 
disposal of hazardous waste.
• Scientific Disposal: Hazardous 
waste, including ETP sludge, 
is safely collected and 
transferred to Mumbai Waste 
Management Limited (MWML) 
for proper treatment and 
disposal.
• Calorific Value Norms: Waste 
with a calorific value below 3000 
kcal/kg is managed in line with 
prescribed practices, reducing 
environmental impact.
Negative
4
Energy 
Efficiency
R
Chemical production 
is energy-intensive, 
typically relying 
on fossil fuels or 
purchased electricity. 
This makes energy 
sourcing a significant 
operational cost and a 
potential compliance 
risk, depending 
on environmental 
regulations. Inadequate 
energy management 
could hamper operations 
and increase costs, 
emissions and regulatory 
exposure.
• Commitment to Renewable 
Energy: Vidhi is reducing 
dependence on non-renewable 
sources by integrating 
renewable energy solutions, 
including its 2.5 MW solar power 
project.
• Carbon Footprint Reduction: 
The company actively pursues 
sustainable practices to lower 
emissions and contribute 
positively to climate goals.
• Energy-Efficient Operations: 
Adoption of modern, 
energy-efficient equipment 
and continuous process 
improvements help optimize 
energy use, reduce pollution, 
and strengthen environmental 
stewardship.

Human 
Rights
R
Respecting human 
rights is essential to 
sustainable business 
operations. It includes 
fair treatment of 
employees, fair labour 
practices, safe working 
conditions, respect 
for community rights, 
and diversity. Failure 
to uphold human 
rights could result in 
reputational damage, 
regulatory penalties and 
potential litigations.
• Commitment to Human 
Rights: Vidhi upholds 
international human rights 
standards through established 
policies and procedures 
embedded in its governance 
framework.
• Reporting Mechanism:

ensuring independent oversight 
and accountability.
• Human Rights Training: 
Regular training programs are 
conducted to raise awareness, 
reinforce ethical practices, and 
ensure alignment with human 
rights principles.
Negative
6
Community 
Relations
R
While chemical 
companies contribute 
to local communities 
through employment, 
tax revenue, and 
investments, they also 
face challenges related 
to environmental impact, 
public health and 
process safety. It is very 
important to maintain 
good community relations 
as non-maintenance can 
lead to regulatory fines, 
legal issues, reputational 
damage and potential 
disruptions to operations.
• Commitment to Community 
Well-being: Vidhi prioritizes the 
health, safety, and well-being of 
the communities surrounding its 
operations.

undermine stakeholder 
trust, damage reputation, 
disrupt business

sustainable value 
creation.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this 
disclosure)
At Vidhi Specialty Food Ingredients Ltd., sustainability is not just a commitment—it is embedded in our 
strategy and operations. As a responsible manufacturer of synthetic and natural food-grade colours, we 
recognize the growing importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices in shaping 
the resilience and long-term success of our business.
Over FY 2024–25, we have continued to address key ESG challenges. On the environmental front, 
our priority remains reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving water, and managing waste 
responsibly. The successful commissioning of our 2.5 MW solar power project at Sunbless Solar 
Park, Maharashtra has significantly lowered our reliance on non-renewable energy. We also enhanced 
wastewater management at our Dahej facility through advanced Reverse Osmosis systems and 
Effluent Treatment Plants, enabling recycling and reuse of process water. These initiatives underline 
our focus on resource efficiency and climate stewardship.
From a social perspective, we have strengthened employee health, safety, and well-being through 
regular training, medical check-ups, and ISO-certified systems. We are also committed to inclusivity, 
diversity, and human rights, supported by robust grievance redressal mechanisms and awareness 
programs. Our CSR initiatives in education, healthcare, women’s empowerment, and community 
development reflect our belief in shared growth.
On the governance front, we uphold high ethical standards through our Code of Conduct, whistle-
blower mechanism, and rigorous internal controls. We continue to enhance transparency and 
accountability in our disclosures, aligned with stakeholder expectations.
Looking ahead, we aim to further scale up renewable energy usage, reduce water consumption, and 
innovate sustainable product solutions through R&D. With the trust of our stakeholders, we remain 
committed to building a responsible, resilient, and future-ready organization.

10.Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The company, a leader in synthetic food colours and specialty chemicals, is deeply committed to ensuring safety 
and environmental responsibility by minimizing the use of hazardous and toxic substances in our products and 
processes. We strictly adhere to all legal standards governing emissions, wastewater, and waste disposal, and 
maintain rigorous monitoring across our manufacturing sites.
Our wastewater management system is designed for efficiency and sustainability. We recycle 80 KL of post- 
process water daily using a Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) plant, which is then repurposed for gardening and other 
day-to-day activities. The remaining wastewater undergoes treatment at our Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), and 
the treated water is safely discharged into the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). Sludge generated from 
this process is responsibly disposed of through government-authorized third-party vendors.
In addition, we implement comprehensive waste management practices that focus on minimizing waste generation, 
segregating waste at its source, and recycling processed wastewater. Hazardous materials are handled with the 
utmost care, and all waste disposal methods are fully compliant with the regulations set forth by the Maharashtra 
Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), and other relevant authorities.
To further enhance workplace safety and environmental stewardship, we have established robust monitoring 
mechanisms and conduct regular compliance checks. All effluents, emissions, and waste are maintained well 
within the limits prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards 
(SPCB).
