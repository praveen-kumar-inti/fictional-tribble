LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS
Solid Foundation for 
Better Future 
in API procurements and about 
H 100+ cr. in logistics costs during the 
year. A favourable market condition 
also contributed to this. All this will 
enable us to Craft the Future with 
accelerated growth.
With all these efforts, our Profit After 
Tax grew by 39% to H 816 cr. PAT 
margin expanded to 19% in FY 2024 
from 16% in the previous year. By 
building operational efficiencies 
and following financial discipline of 
profitable growth, we established 
a solid foundation for crafting 
future growth.
During the financial year, your 
Company distributed a total of 
H 642 cr. to shareholders in the form 
of dividend. This translates to a 
remarkable dividend yield of 2.28%, 
based on the closing price as of 
31 March 2024.
Dear Stakeholders,
We are happy to present you the 
outstanding performance your 
Company achieved during this year. 
This performance can be attributed 
to our well diversified business model 
which provides the solid foundation 
and surety for our growth. 
This diversity comes from our 
business being spread across 
3 distinct segments: Branded 
Generics in emerging markets, 
Generics in the USA and Institution 
Business in Africa. 
Segment Review
Our Branded Generics business 
stood at 71% of the total sales in 
FY 2024. This attributed to 31% 
in India, 25% in Asia, and 15% in 
Africa, posting a 10% annual growth 
during the year. During the financial 
year, we further strengthened 
our foundation in these markets, 
launching 42 new products, adding 
300+ people and enhancing our 
promotional efforts. We have a 
strong product portfolio under 
registration and development 
in R&D, which will enable us to 
grow faster.
Generics business in the US 
contributed 23% of the total sales 
in FY 2024 with a growth of 16%. 
This growth was on the back of 
new product launches, some 
opportunities amidst shortages 
and softening of price erosions. 
Our execution in this market has 
been flawless and excellent, and we 
continue to be a preferred partner 
for the distributors. In FY 2025, 
we expect this business to grow at 
a much slower pace in the wake of 
fewer launches, that too towards the 
end of the financial year. We are glad 
to inform you that during the year our 
manufacturing facilities at Paithan 
and Dahej have cleared the US FDA 
inspections with zero observations, 
and we are proud to be among just 
a few to achieve this milestone.
Our Institution business in Africa, 
which consists of antimalarial 
products being distributed through 
multilateral aid agencies, saw growth 
of 31% in the year. This business 
contributed to 6% of total sales. 
As this business is dependent on the 
availability of funds with agencies, 
there is a high level of uncertainty, 
so we remain neutral on this vertical.
Financial Highlights
FY 2024 marked a significant 
milestone for Ajanta Pharma 
with notable achievements 
in sales, PAT, and EBITDA. 
These commendable 
results position us as 
a leading player in the 
pharmaceutical industry.
Revenue from operations grew by 
12% to H 4,209 cr. Our EBITDA grew by 
50% to H 1,172 cr. EBITDA margin grew 
to 28% in FY 2024 from 21% in the 
previous year.
During the year, we took a 
collaborative approach, partnering 
with our vendors and industry experts 
to mitigate the volatility in API prices 
and international logistics cost.
With focused execution of this 
strategic approach, we were able 
to improve efficiency which helped 
in savings of about 300 basis points 
Our balance sheet position remains 
pristine with H 460 cr. as cash and 
liquid investments. We generated 
free cash flow of H 637 cr. in the 
year, which is 78% of PAT. We remain 
prudent in our capital allocation by 
returning excess cash generated in 
the business to shareholders. Given 
this strong financial position, the 
Board of Directors has approved 
the distribution of H 351 cr. to 
shareholders in the form of a 
buyback, including tax, constituting 
0.82% of the total paid-up equity 
share capital.
Our successful efforts in building 
a Solid Foundation gives us the 
confidence for Crafting the Future 
with better performance and 
lesser impact on environment in 
coming years.
At Ajanta, sustainability is our core 
value and we continue to work 
towards it, year after year. 
You would be pleased 
to know that this year, 
we achieved a crucial 
milestone with the 
commissioning of a new 
6.4 MW solar power plant 
at Partur in Maharashtra, 
taking our renewable 
energy portfolio to 
30%+ of our total 
energy consumption.
This plant leads to a remarkable 
reduction of CO2 emissions by 
4,200 tonnes annually which is 
equivalent to planting 300,000 trees 
or saving 15,000 kilolitres of water 
every year. We aim to fulfill over 
50% of our energy requirements 
from green energy in the next two 
years. We are already maintaining 
water neutrality and follow a zero-
discharge policy at our facilities.
We take this opportunity to express 
our deepest appreciation to all our 
employees and their families for their 
consistent contribution in our journey. 
We continue to improve our people 
practices, benchmarking against the 
best in the world, which is confirmed 
by our recognition of 'Great Place to 
Work', second year in a row. We also 
thank you for your continuing trust, 
support, and commitment to Ajanta.

OUR BUSINESSES
Ajanta has a well-diversified 
Branded Generics business 
with sales coming from India 
and 30+ emerging market 
countries across Asia and 
Africa. It is this geographical 
diversification that provides 
business surety, scalability 
and sustainability. It also 
gives us the confidence to 
keep growing faster than 
the market in each of the 
countries we are present in.
We have strengthened this core 
business by penetrating deeper 
into select countries of our existing 
markets and also expanding into 
new promising countries. Our 
focused execution of this strategy 
involved identifying treatment 
gaps to add new products and 
therapies. It also involved expanding 
our field force to widen our reach 
with medical professionals through 
segment-focused marketing. 
This has helped us establish the 
Solid Foundation which is helping 
us in Crafting the Future growth 
at an accelerated pace in this 
vertical. Our expanded field force 
is now helping us reach out to a 
larger number of doctors through 
our continuous medical education 
programmes to keep them abreast 
with the latest developments in 
their therapeutic fields. Our efforts 
to enhance the understanding of 
our customers, enable us to add 
more value to them. It also helps us 
build strong brand recall and faster 
scale-up of our business. Our success 
record in building formidable 
brands in different parts of the 
world reaffirms the effectiveness 
of our strategy. 
In India, we have 300+ strong 
product portfolio across specialty 
segments of Cardiology, 
Antidiabetic, Ophthalmology, 
Dermatology and Pain Management. 
It is built through the introduction 
of first-to-market products, which 
contributes over 50% of the product 
portfolio. Our focused execution 
involves 3,000 strong field force 
promoting these products and 
provide us a very strong position in 
the market.
Branded Generics business in Asia 
and Africa consists of eight major 
therapeutic segments where we 
hold leading positions in our sub-
therapeutic segments. We have a 
basket of more than 200 products 
for these markets. Our strategic 
intent in these markets is to grow 
the chronic portfolio of Cardiology, 
Antidiabetic, Ophthalmology, 
Dermatology and Pain Management. 
We are one of the pioneers to 
introduce field force in some of 
these markets.
We added 27 new products in these 
markets in FY 2024 and further 
enhanced the field force, taking total 
strength to 1,800+. We plan to add 
200 more next year to support the 
deeper penetration in these markets 
through new product launches.

We continue to outpace the IPM 
by 180 basis points, with Ajanta 
growing at 9.4%, surpassing the IPM 
growth of 7.6%, as per IQVIA MAT 
March 2024. This trend extends to 
most of the therapeutic segments 
we are in, where our growth has 
consistently outpaced the segment 
growth. However, in cardiology our 
growth was lower to IPM due to the 
government-led price revision for 
one of our major products MET XL, in 
Dec 2022. Our overall ranking in IPM 
jumped 1 position to 26th rank. 
In the covered market, we continue 
to be the fourth largest in IPM 
and amongst the top 10 in all our 
therapeutic segments. As per IQVIA 
MAT March 2024, our faster growth is 
contributed mainly by volumes and 
new launches. Volume was about 
2x to IPM, and new launches were 
about 1.4x to IPM. We have 3 brands 
in the top 500 list of brands.
During the year, we launched 18 new 
products in the region solidifying the

Our Enablers - Best-in-Class 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Our seven state-of-the-art 
manufacturing facilities are another 
key stone of our solid foundation, 
producing world-class quality 
products. Two of our facilities are US 
FDA-approved and others are WHO 
cGMP compliant. We have been 
able to achieve digitalisation by 
continuously enhancing our quality 
systems to ensure highest quality 
product for our patients. One of 
the key additions to our capability 
during the year was the first-ever 
'Form Fill Seal' machine for drinkable 
ampoules at one of our facilities. 
A drinkable ampoule is an airtight 
container that holds a single dose of 
liquid medication for patient use and 
we are, probably, the first in India to 
use this technology.
Dahej and Paithan received US FDA Approvals with zero observation. 
Among 4% in the world.
Digitisation
At Ajanta, we 
have built a strong 
foundation and a 
digital backbone 
by integrating 
most of our 
operations for better 
customer service. 
Be it R&D, manufacturing, quality-
control, marketing, human resource 
or finance, we are able to collate 
and analyse data to provide our 
customers a seamless experience 
in terms of quality product and 
service. This enables us to carry 
out predictive analytics across our 
operational supply chain, helping 
us build efficiencies. 
Higher R&D output through lead 
time management, reduced 
production downtime, responding to 
customers online, are few benefits 
of our digitisation efforts which will 
enable us to craft a future with 
more certainty.
Dahej manufacturing facility
Our supply chain is one 
of the best in the industry 
as we make sure that 
there is no stock-out 
of our products in any 
of our markets even for 
a day. Ajanta has now 
become synonymous with 
high-quality products and 
near perfect scorecard for 
supply assurance.

At Ajanta, operating 
business in an 
environmentally and 
socially responsible way 
is a core value. 
Committed to a  
Sustainable Future
With commissioning of a new 
6.4 MW solar power plant at Partur 
in Maharashtra in FY 2024, our solar 
energy capacity has increased to 
12.69 MW, which fulfills 30%+ of our 
energy requirements. Further, we 
aim to fulfill over 50% of our energy 
requirements from green energy in 
the next two years. 
At Ajanta, we not just meet 
environmental regulations, but go 
beyond compliance to ensure a 
sustainable future. Our air emission 
levels and waste generated quantity 
are much below the permissible limit 
approved by regulatory authorities. 
We conserve water by recycling 
every drop in our manufacturing 
facilities and ensuring zero 
discharge from our units.
We are committed to addressing 
climate change and global 
warming by operating our business 
in a socially, ecologically, and 
economically responsible manner 
to minimise the impact. We have 
well-defined safety, health, and 
environmental policy. The policy 
covers the Company, all our 
subsidiaries, and the contractors 
working within our premises.
Our actual output can be compared with any of the

Economic Overview and Outlook
The global economy is set for 
another year of slow but steady 
growth, the International Monetary 
Fund said in April. The strength 
in the U.S. economy is pushing 
world output through headwinds 
from lingering high inflation, weak 
demand in China and Europe, 
and spillovers from two regional 
wars. The IMF forecasts global real 
GDP growth of 3.2% for 2024 and 
2025 - the same rate as in 2023. 
The IMF forecast that global median 
headline inflation will fall to 2.8% by 
the end of 2024 from 4% last year, 
to 2.4% in 2025.
A potential escalation of the 
Middle East conflict would raise 
oil prices and inflation, triggering 
tighter monetary policy from 
central banks. The IMF said that 
in an "adverse scenario" in which 
a Middle East escalation would 
lead to a 15% increase in oil prices 
and higher shipping costs would 
hike global inflation by about 0.7 
percentage points.
Pharmaceutical Sector Overview
Global health systems have 
demonstrated remarkable resilience 
in the face of the pandemic, global 
inflation, and regional conflicts 
and have moved forward to adopt 
novel therapies and increase 
usage. Overall, the global use and 
spending on medicines is exceeding 
pre-pandemic growth rates and is 
expected to continue significantly 
above those trends through 2028. 
The pharmaceutical industry has 
and will continue to have a significant 
impact on the global economy in 
terms of contribution to GDP.
Invoice Spending and Growth
The volume use of medicines 
globally plateaued in 2023 but is 
expected to grow at an average 
2.3% rate through 2028, as per 
the IQVIA report, “Global use of 
Medicines 2024”. It will be driven 
by China, India, and other Asian 
markets all growing faster than 3%. 
Countries in Latin America have 
grown more rapidly than other 
regions in the last five years and 
are expected to grow further at 
1.9% annually through the forecast. 
North America, Western Europe, 
and Japan are expected to grow 
medicine usage more slowly, partly 
due to their already higher per 
capita use. In 2024, Eastern Europe's 
volume growth is expected to return 
to trends prevailing prior to the start 
of the Ukraine conflict.

Spending globally is expected to 
grow by more than USD 600 billion, 
reaching USD 2.3 trillion driven by 
existing branded medicines in the 
leading ten developed markets, which 
will grow by USD 385 billion. New 
products will add USD 193 billion but 
will be offset by the impact of patent 
expiries, removing USD 192 billion. 
Other developed markets and fast-
growing Pharmerging markets will 
together add another USD 184 billion. 
In each of these cases, growth drivers 
are an acceleration over the past five 
years, reflecting a rebound from the 
disrupted 2019-2023 period.
The types of medicines driving 
spending and growth vary 
considerably across countries 
broadly correlated with a degree of 
economic development. Generally, 
wealthier countries have higher 
levels of spending on original 
branded products, especially earlier 
in the patented periods of these 
products. Lower-income countries 
have a greater reliance on generic 
drugs and sometimes prefer 
non-original branded versions, called 
branded generics.
The relative amount of medicine 
spending has been shifting over time, 
with some fast-growing countries 
becoming more important to the 
total level of global spending. Volume 
growth, often of older generic 
medicines, has been the primary 
driver of growth in many Pharmerging 
markets, although the more recent 
rising rankings ahead of leading 
developed markets are also driven 
by shifts in the mix of spending.

pharmaceuticals formulation 
company with a well-diversified 
Branded Generics business spread 
across India, Asia, and Africa as 
also US Generics and Institutional 
business in Africa. In Branded 
Generics business, the Company 
has a strong chronic-focused 
product portfolio led by a first-
to-market strategy and front-end 
presence which helps it outgrow the 
market. The Company is committed 
to investing in R&D for product 
innovations to fill identified gaps.

Exhibit 3: IPM vs Ajanta Pharma Growth
The Branded Generics business in 
Asia and Africa consists of eight 
major therapeutic segments and 
we hold the leading position in all 
our sub-therapeutic segments.
Basket of More than 200 
Products
Our Asia business is spread across 
the Middle East, South East Asia, and 
Central Asia regions with a presence 
in 10 countries. This business saw 
a growth of 10% in the year and 
contributed 26% to total sales. 
We launched 18 new products in 
these markets in the financial year. 
The growth was well-diversified in 
terms of new product launches, 
besides volume growth of 
existing products. 
Our Africa business grew by 5% in the 
year. Here also our product basket 
is spread across various therapeutic 
segments and enjoys leadership 
position in some of them. 
We launched 9 new products 
in these markets in the financial 
year. Due to rationalisation of the 
inventory by our distributor, our 
primary sales growth for the year  
has been lower. As the rationalisation 
is completed now, we are confident 
of accelerating growth in Africa.
The US Generics
The US Generics recorded 16% 
growth for the year and contributed 
23% to total sales. This growth was 
on the back of softening of price 
erosions, shortages and ease in 
API price. We have 44 products on 
the shelf and 22 ANDAs are awaiting 
approvals. During the year, we filed 
7 ANDAs, received 6 final approvals 
and launched 4 products.
Africa Institutional
This business consists of antimalarial 
products being distributed through 
multilateral aid agencies, which 
saw growth of 31% and contributed 
6% to total sales. As this business 
is dependent on the availability of 
funds with agencies, there is a high 
level of uncertainty and we remain 
neutral on this vertical.

Operational and Financial Performance
During FY 2024, we significantly enhanced capital allocation to the Branded Generics business with accelerated 
product filing and enhanced ground presence. 
We have scaled up our margins on the back of the enhanced contribution of Branded Generics business and 
normalisation of freight costs. This has added surety, scalability, and sustainability to the business.

Revenue from Operations
Revenue from operations stood at 
H 4,209 cr. in FY 2024 against H 3,743 
cr. in FY 2023, registering a growth 
of 12%. 
Material Costs
Material cost moved to 25% in 
FY 2024 from 28% in FY 2023, an 
improvement of 300 basis points on 
the back of ease in API prices.
Employee Expenses
Personnel expenses accounted for 
21% of the revenue from operations 
in FY 2024 and previous year. Total 
cost stood at H 900 cr. in FY 2024 
against H 785 cr. in FY 2023.
Other Expenses
Other expenses stood at H 1,070 cr. 
in FY 2024 (25% of revenue from 
operations) against H 1,124 cr. 
in FY 2023 (31% of revenue from 
operations), a 600 basis point 
decrease over the previous year. 
We have been able to build 
excellent operational efficiencies 
across functions during the year, 
with clear focus on getting more 
from the existing base. Our efforts 
in this direction bore good fruits 
with international logistics cost 
going down by about H 103 cr., in 
spite of improving on deliveries. 
Similarly, R&D cost came down to 
H 208 cr. in FY 2024 against H 237 cr. 
in FY 2023, though the output from 
R&D saw a good increase in terms 
of product filings.
With our continued focus on 
Branded Generics business, we 
have allocated higher resources 
on product registrations, 
promotions, and the launch of 
new products, resulting in higher 
marketing expenses.
Operating Profit Margin
EBITDA in FY 2024 stood at H 1,172 
cr. against H 783 cr. in FY 2023, a 
growth of 50% over the previous 
year. This positive performance was 
attributed to the combined benefits 
of reduction in API prices, reduced 
logistics cost and stabilisation in 
US price erosion. EBITDA as % to 
revenue stood at 28%, which is 
among the best in the industry. 
We expect this to now remain at 
this level or see small improvement 
in coming years.
Other Income
Other Income stood at H 85 cr. in 
FY 2024 against H 99 cr. in FY 2023. 
Major component in both the years 
was the forex gain.
Net Profit Margin
Profit After Tax was at H 816 cr. in 
FY 2024 against H 588 cr. in FY 2023. 
PAT margins stood at 19% in FY 2024 
against 16% in FY 2023.
Return on Net Worth
Return on Net Worth improved to 
23% in FY 2024 against 18% in the 
previous year.

at 31% in FY 2024 compared to 22% 
in FY 2023.

The non-current assets have gone 
up to H 1,907 cr. in FY 2024 from 
H 1,845 cr. in FY 2023. Our CAPEX 
was H 160 cr. for the year which was 
mostly the maintenance CAPEX. 
The CAPEX including maintenance 
CAPEX for FY 2025 is estimated to be 
about H 250 cr.
Current Assets

cr. in FY 2024 against H 2,834 
cr. in FY 2023. Receivables days 
slightly increased to 109 days from 
104 in FY 2023 due to increase in 
businesses across verticals. The 
absolute amount stood at H 1,247 cr. 
against H 1,057 cr. in FY 2023.
Inventory in terms of the number 
of days to sales has improved to 
73 days in FY 2024 from 80 days in 
FY 2023 due to the easing of the 
supply chain. In absolute amounts, it 
has marginally increased to H 828 cr. 
in FY 2024 from H 816 cr. in FY 2023. 
Current Ratio for FY 2024 stood at

Ajanta Pharma Limited
Solid Foundation. Crafting the Future.
The Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) system at our manufacturing 
facilities has enabled workers and 
employees to operate in a safe and 
healthy working environment.
The professional objectives for 
employees and teams across 
levels are directly linked with the 
organisation’s objectives and 
philosophy. This conveys and 
provides a sense of purpose and 
direction to all employees. The 
key areas for driving HR initiatives 
include a strong emphasis on 
building a culture of inclusion and 
respect, ensuring a safe work 
environment, focusing on building 
capabilities and careers and 
protecting human rights.
The Company continues to support 
the capabilities of differently-
abled employees. We ensure 
strict adherence to our internal 
codes and have a clearly defined 
zero-tolerance policy towards 
discrimination of any kind. 
Risk Management
We operate in over 30 highly 
regulated countries with their 
own specific complex operating 
environments. In addition, this 
business landscape is dynamic and 
constantly evolving. This brings to 
the fore a multitude of risks which 
are closely monitored, mapped, 
and mitigated through our robust 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework. By effectively identifying, 
assessing, and mitigating risks we 
strive to enhance our resilience, drive 
sustainable growth, and maximise 
value creation.
The ERM involves engaging with 
all functional heads to identify 
internal and external events that 
may have an adverse impact on 
the achievement of the Company’s 
objectives. It also entails periodic 
monitoring of changes in both the 
internal and external environment 
leading to the emergence of a new 
threat/risk. The major risks identified 
are regulatory, competition, supply 
chain disruption, cyber & data 
security, economic & political, 
and Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG). A review of 
the risk management policy is 
carried out annually by the Risk 
Management Committee. Our ERM 
framework plays a significant role 
in safeguarding the interests of our 
Company, our shareholders, and 
our stakeholders.
Internal Controls and Adequacy
Your Company has a robust 
and reliable system of internal 
controls as we believe that it is the 
prerequisite of good governance. 
The control framework is designed to 
continuously assess the adequacy, 
effectiveness, and efficiency of 
internal controls. The management is 
committed and ensures an effective 
internal controls environment, 
commensurate with the size and 
complexity of the business. This 
assures compliance with internal 
policies, applicable laws, regulations, 
the accuracy of records, operational 
efficiency, protection of resources & 
assets, and overall risk minimisation. 
These controls have been designed 
to provide reasonable assurance 
over time.
The current system of Internal 
Financial Controls (IFC) is aligned 
with the requirement of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and is in line 
with the globally accepted risk-
based framework. The Internal Audit 
(IA) function of the Company reports 
to the Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee, thereby maintaining its 
objectivity. Our dedicated internal 
audit team supported by external 
audit firms help to enhance and 
protect organisational value by 
providing risk-based objective 
assurance, advice and insight. The 
annual internal audit plan is carved 
out from a comprehensively defined 
Audit Universe that encompasses 
all businesses, functions, risks, 
compliance requirements, and 
maturity of controls. The internal 
audit plan is approved by the 
Audit Committee at the beginning 
of every year. Each quarter, the 
Audit Committee is presented with 
key control issues and the actions 
Management Discussion and Analysis
taken on issues highlighted in the 
previous reports. 
The Audit Committee deliberates 
with the management, considers 
the systems as laid down, and meets 
the internal auditors and statutory 
auditors to ascertain their views on 
the internal control framework.
The Company recognises the fact 
that any internal control framework 
would have some inherent limitations 
and hence has inculcated a 
process of periodic audits and 
reviews to ensure that such systems 
and controls are updated at 
regular intervals.

foreign exchange earnings. It uses forward 
exchange contracts and/or options to hedge 
against its net foreign currency exposures as

Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report
During the year, we have made 
significant strides in this direction 
toward achieving our targets and 
upholding our responsibilities. You will 
be happy to know that we have taken 
a major step in renewable energy 
generation by installing additional 
8.8 MW solar unit this year. This addition 
contributed significantly to reduce CO2 
emission by approximately 7,066 Mt per 
annum, furthering our commitment to 
sustainable energy practices.
Statement by Managing Director
Dear Valued Partners,
I am delighted to share with you our 
progress and achievements in the 
long-term Sustainability, including 
Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) initiatives and business 
responsibility practices. 
In the evolving ESG landscape, we are committed to 
continuous improvement and innovation across all aspects 
of our operations. Through our initiatives such as waste 
reduction, energy efficiency improvements, renewable 
energy projects and water conservation, we aim to minimise 
our environmental footprint and mitigate climate change. 
The ESG Committee, comprising key functional heads, meets 
regularly to review progress and make informed decisions on 
sustainability initiatives.
At Dahej and Guwahati locations, we upgraded Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs) with advanced UF and RO systems 
to recycle RO permeate for cooling tower usage. Proactive 
measures led to a commendable 30% reduction in 
wastewater generation at Dahej plant. 
Projects like condensate recovery systems have enabled 
to recycle around 40 KLD of condensate, thereby reducing 
boiler fuel consumption and consequent CO2 emission.
The health and safety of our employees are of paramount 
concern. We have comprehensive OH&S management 
systems in place, including regular risk assessments, safety 
training, and emergency preparedness measures, to ensure 
a safe work environment for all. We have got ISO 14001 
and ISO 45001 certifications for two of our major sites and 
two more sites have been recommended for the same, 
awaiting certification.
Our robust Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior 
Management underscores our commitment to fostering 
ethical business conduct. We recognise the importance of 
our suppliers in our journey towards sustainability. Through 
our Value Chain Assessment and engagement initiatives, 
we ensure that our suppliers adhere to ESG principles and 
promote sustainable practices. 
We actively engage with our Stakeholders to identify and 
address their needs and concerns, prioritising sustainability 
issues based on their impact on both our strategic objectives 
and stakeholder interests. Through our community welfare 
programmes, we contribute to the well-being of local 
communities and promote inclusive growth.
We have implemented projects to 
collect and recycle solvent waste 
generated from Quality Control 
(QC) at our Paithan and Chitegaon 
sites. Moreover, hazardous waste 
generated from our Guwahati 
& Dahej plants now undergoes 
processing in the cement industry, 
thereby significantly reducing 
exposure of these sites from landfills.
Our CSR initiatives include providing 
healthcare services, supporting 
education and rural & tribal area 
development. Our support for 
sports persons, including Olympic 
and Paralympic athletes, highlights 
our dedication to promoting talent 
and excellence.
Ajanta remains steadfast in its commitment to ESG principles 
and responsible business practices. We are deeply grateful 
for your continued support and partnership as we strive to 
build a sustainable future for all stakeholders.
Thank you for being a part of this journey.
Warm regards,
Yogesh Agrawal

a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, the company places utmost emphasis on Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) management. Following 
are the objectives and commitments:
	
	
[	
Provide safe and healthy working conditions for the prevention of work-related injury and ill health.
	
	
[	
Eliminate hazards and reduce OH&S risks.
	
	
[	
Continual improvement of the EHS management system.
	
	
[

All work-related risks & their causes in the work environment are identified. To mitigate the same, personal 
protective equipment are provided & awareness training related to SOPs and best practices is provided to 
the employees and workers.
	
	
Each site is supervised by the EHS team and the site management who conduct workplace inspections 
& hazard identifications which are then notified to the EHS head. Safety & Environmental audits are also 
conducted through external agencies to identify the gaps and to establish compliances. Central Safety 
Committee and emergency response team are also formed who periodically conduct workplace & work zone 
monitoring at the sites. As a safety measure, signages including general safety instructions, (also in vernacular 
languages), Life Safety Rules etc. are placed in all the factories. Process Safety Risk Assessment & Material 
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) are also kept at all sites.
	
	
Health insurance & compensation, Occupational health center, first aid at points, firefighting systems (smoke 
detectors, fire alarm systems, fire extinguishers), SOPs to operate plant activities in emergencies, ambulance, 
Government approved on site Emergency plan are provided at all the sites. Further, Safety Risk Assessment & 
Safety Audit is done by regulatory bodies. In order to ensure that the suppliers comply with EHS regulations, 
the Company assesses their data on various Health and Safety parameters and certifications of their sites.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-
routine basis by the entity?
	
	
We firmly believe that risk assessments are integral to ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of everyone 
in the workplace. At our company, risk assessment is conducted through the Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) method, which comprises of 3 steps:
	
	
1.	
Spot the Hazard (Hazard Identification).
	
	
2.	
Assess the Risk (Risk Assessment).
	
	
3.	
Make the Changes (Risk Control).
	
	
By following HIRA methodology, we ensure systematic identification of hazards, evaluate associated risks and 
implement necessary controls. In addition, periodic internal audits and leadership rounds are conducted to 
identify unsafe acts/conditions, further aiding in the improvement and optimisation of risk levels. Corrective 
Actions and Preventive Actions (CAPA) are implemented based on the incident and its cause. Furthermore, 
follow-up on the implementation of CAPA is performed to reassess the process if necessary. 
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks? (Yes/ No)
	
	
We are committed to fostering a safe work environment by proactively identifying and mitigating potential 
hazards. Here are some key highlights of our approach:
	
	
Hazard Identification and Risk Management:
 
 
Standardised Procedures: We have established robust Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that guide the 
timely identification and mitigation of work-related hazards and risks. These SOPs ensure a consistent and 
comprehensive approach to workplace safety across all our facilities.
	
 
Comprehensive Training: We provide all employees with occupational health and safety training. These 
training modules equip employees with the knowledge and skills to identify potential hazards, evaluate 
associated risks, and implement appropriate control measures.
 
 
Emergency Preparedness: Employees receive hands-on training during safety and emergency evacuation 
drills. This training covers the proper use of emergency equipment, such as fire hydrants, fire-fighting systems, 
leak and spill control methods, and safety alarms. Additionally, we regularly assess staff competency in 
handling emergency situations.
	
	
Employee Engagement and Hazard Reporting:
	
 
Multiple Reporting Channels: We have implemented various systems to encourage employees to report work-
related hazards. These include readily accessible safety suggestion boxes at each site, allowing employees 
to anonymously report concerns and details of identified hazards.
	
	
By prioritising these initiatives, we cultivate a culture of safety where employees are empowered to identify and 
report hazards, and management is committed to taking effective corrective actions. This ongoing process 
safeguards our workforce and fosters a safe and healthy work environment.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare 
services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes. There is a Group Mediclaim policy for employees and workers.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy  
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes  
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
We have waste management systems in place at all our facilities. Plastic waste generated from factory gets 
recycled through authorised recyclers & for handling post-consumer plastic waste we have engaged with PWP & 
all post-consumer 100% plastic waste get co-processed through cement industry. The spent solvent generated 
from our API is recycled through government authorised recyclers. E-waste & non-hazardous waste such as glass 
bottles, MS/SS scarp and paper waste are sent to authorised recyclers. 
	
We reduce waste through technological interventions and ongoing initiatives including sustainable packaging, 
waste source segregation, process optimisation etc. For example, we have reduced plastic packaging box size 
for one of our major products thereby substantially reducing use of plastic.

Outcome of the initiative
We are committed to responsible manufacturing practices 
and continuously seek innovative solutions to reduce 
emissions, effluents, and waste generation.
Advanced Effluent Treatment: Upgraded Effluent Treatment 
Plants (ETPs) at Dahej and Guwahati with advanced, fully 
automatic Ultrafiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
systems.
This allows us to recycle RO permeate for cooling towers, 
significantly reducing our freshwater consumption.
Wastewater Reduction at Source: Implemented project 
to identify and address the root causes of wastewater 
generation at our Dahej facility.
This proactive approach has resulted in a commendable 30% 
reduction in wastewater production.
Waste Reduction and Resource Recovery:
We are committed to paper reduction initiatives across all 
sites and are promoting digitisation 
Through process optimisation and digitalisation efforts, we have 
successfully eliminated approximately 7 million paper pages 
annually.
Condensate Recovery: Condensate recovery systems at two 
of our sites have yielded impressive results.
These systems recycle around 40,000 liters per day of 
condensate, reducing boiler fuel consumption and promoting 
resource efficiency.
Energy Recycling for Water Purification: Completed energy 
recycling project for the WFI (Water for Injection) water stream 
at Guwahati facility.
Further optimising resource utilisation.
Emission Reduction and Air Quality Management:
Implemented VOC sensor technology in solvent storage areas 
to proactively detect potential leaks.
This allows immediate response and minimises the risk of harmful 
chemical emissions.

Consolidated
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Ajanta Pharma Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements 
of Ajanta Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Holding Company” and its subsidiaries (Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which 
comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated statement 
of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, including material accounting policies 
and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of reports of the other auditors on 
separate financial statements of such subsidiaries as were 
audited by the other auditors. the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2024, of its 
consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash 
flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms 
of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the 
Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We believe 
that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to 
in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matter(s)
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other 
auditors on separate financial statements of components 
audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of 
the consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue Recognition
See Note 7.9 of accounting policies and to note 39 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
	
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group has numerous customers operating in multiple 
geographies and sales contracts with these customers have distinct 
terms and conditions relating to the recognition of revenue, the 
right of return and price adjustments. Contractual arrangements 
as well as regulatory requirements in various geographies result in 
adjustments to gross sales price. These adjustments arise from the 
Group’s obligations to customers towards chargebacks, rebates, 
product recalls, Medicaid, allowances, supply penalties and right 
of return (“variable consideration”). As stated in Note 38 to the 
consolidated financial statements, revenue from the sale of goods 
is measured after adjusting the effects of variable consideration. 
Adjustments are made with respect to variable components which 
requires judgement and estimation by the Group. These are based 
on contractual arrangements, market conditions and accumulated 
experience.
Accordingly we identified recognition of revenue from sale of 
products during the year and at the period end and accruals for 
variable consideration in revenue recognition as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures in respect of accruals for variable 
components of revenue recognition included the following:
•	
Assessing the Group’s accounting policies for revenue 
recognition including accounting for variable consideration by 
comparing with applicable accounting standards.
•	
Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the Company’s manual and automated controls designed 
to ensure recognition of valid revenue transactions in the 
correct period.
•	
Testing key internal controls with respect to accrual for variable 
consideration. These accruals are made using accumulated 
experience, 
contractual 
arrangements 
and 
volume 
of 
transactions with respective customers.
•	
Performing substantive testing of selected samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year as well as at year-
end. We used statistical sampling and verified contractual 
terms of sales invoices / contracts, shipping documents and 
acknowledged delivery receipts for those transactions.
The key audit matter
	
How the matter was addressed in our audit
•	
Perform substantive procedures to verify period end accruals 
for adjustment on account of variable consideration.
•	
Examining high risk journal entries and other adjustments that 
contain unusual combinations of credit to revenue with no 
associated debit to cash, debtors, or another revenue account
Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of 
Directors are responsible for the other information. The 
other information comprises the information included in the 
Holding Company’s annual report, but does not include 
the financial statements and auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed and based 
on the work done/audit reports of other auditors, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board 
of Directors are responsible for the preparation and 
presentation of these consolidated financial statements 
in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and 
fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash 
flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 
133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board 
of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of each company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
the selection and application of appropriate accounting 
policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements by 
the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for 
assessing the ability of each company to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, 
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,

forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of such entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audit of the financial information of such entities 
included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the 
other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by other auditors, 
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the audits carried out 
by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further 
described in paragraph (a) of the section titled “Other 
Matters” in this audit report.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause

Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 
31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the 
Holding Company , as of that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company, has, in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, 
based on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements criteria established by the Holding 
Company considering the essential components of such 
internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 
“Guidance Note”).
Management’s 
and 
Board 
of 
Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, 
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. 
Corporate Information
Ajanta Pharma Limited (“the Company”) is a public 
limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. 
Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange 
and National Stock Exchange. The registered 
office of Holding Company is located at Ajanta 
House, Charkop, Kandivali (West), Mumbai. These 
Consolidated Financial statements (“CFS”) comprises 
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries 
(referred to collectively as the “Group”).
The Group is primarily involved in development, 
manufacturing and marketing of speciality 
pharmaceutical finished dosages.
2. 
Basis of Preparation
	
Statement of Compliance:
These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) as per the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
from time to time, notified under Section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and other relevant 
provisions of the Act. These consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual 
basis and under the historical cost basis, except 
otherwise stated.
These Consolidated Financial Statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2024 have been reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and subsequently approved by the 
Board of Directors at its meeting held on 02 May 2024.
	
Use Of Estimates and Judgements:
The preparation of consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on the date of the financial statements. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and under 
lying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
	
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is included in the following notes.
 
Classification of Lease as per Ind AS 116:
Ind AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the 
lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. 
The Group makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby 
assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any 
options to extend or terminate the contract will be 
exercised. In evaluating the lease term, The Group 
considers factors such as any significant leasehold 
improvements undertaken over the lease term, 
costs relating to the termination of lease and the 
importance of the underlying lease to The Group’s 
operations taking into account the location of the 
underlying asset and the availability of the suitable 
alternatives. The lease term in future periods is 
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the 
current economic circumstances. The discount rate 
is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate 
specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio 
of leases with similar characteristics.
	
Estimates:
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year is included in the following notes:
	
Recognition of Current and Deferred Tax 
Assets:
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the 
sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. 
The calculation of The Group’s total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a 
formal legal process. The final resolution of some of 
these items may give rise to material profits/losses 
and/or cash flows.
The complexity of The Group’s structure makes the 
degree of estimation more challenging. The resolution 
of issues is not always within the control of The Group 
and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legal 
processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which 
The Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take 
many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting 
period result from payments on account and on the 
final resolution of open items. As a result there can 
be substantial differences between the tax charge in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss and tax payments.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon 
whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and 
suitable taxable profits will be available in the future 
against which the reversal of temporary differences 
can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available 
profit forecasts. Where the temporary differences 
are related to losses, relevant tax law is considered 
to determine the availability of the losses to offset 
against the future taxable profits.
	
Chargebacks, Rebates and Discount:
Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts, other 
deductions and Medicaid payments are estimated 
and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as 
reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim 
made by the wholesaler for the difference between 
the price at which the product is initially invoiced to 
the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed 
to be procured from the Group. Provisions for such 
chargebacks, rebates and discounts are accrued and 
estimated based on historical average rate actually 
claimed over a period of time, current contract prices 
with wholesalers/other customers and estimated 
inventory holding by the wholesaler.
	
Property, Plant and Equipment:
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life 
prescribed in Schedule II of the Act. In cases, where 
the useful lives are different from that prescribed in 
Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 
asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties 
and maintenance support.
 
Recognition and Measurement of Defined 
Benefit Obligations:
The obligation arising from the defined benefit plan 
is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and vested future benefits and 
life expectancy. The discount rate is determined with 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on the government bonds. The period to 
maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to 
the probable maturity of the post-employment 
benefit obligations.
	
Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets majorly consist software licences 
which are amortised over licence period which 
equates the economic useful life ranging between 
2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of 
its economic useful life.
	
Allowance for Uncollected Accounts 
Receivable and Advances:
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are stated at their normal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Individual trade receivables are written 
off when management seems them not collectible. 
Impairment is made using expected credit loss model.
The impairment provisions for financial assets 
are based on assumption about risk of default 
and expected loss rates. Judgement in making 
these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the 
impairment calculation are based on past history, 
existing market condition as well as forward-looking 
estimates at the end of each reporting period.
	
Allowances for Inventories:
Management reviews the inventory age listing on 
a periodic basis. The review involves comparison of 
the carrying value of the aged inventory items. The 
purpose is to ascertain whether an allowance is 
required to be made in the financial statement for 
any obsolete and slow-moving items. Management 
is satisfied that adequate allowance for obsolete 
and slow-moving inventories has been made in the 
group’s financial statements.
Management also reviews net realisable value for all 
its inventory and is satisfied that adequate allowance 
has been made in the financial statements.
	
Contingencies:
Management judgement is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Group as 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.
	
Impairment Reviews:
An impairment exists when the carrying value of 
an asset or cash generating unit (‘CGU’) exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is 
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. The value in use calculation is based 
on a discounted cash flow model. In calculating the

value in use, certain assumptions are required to be 
made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including 
management’s expectations of growth in EBITDA, 
long-term growth rates; and the selection of discount 
rates to reflect the risks involved.
	
Determination of Functional Currency:
Each entity in the group determines its own functional 
currency (the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates) and 
items included in the financial statements of each 
entity are measured using that functional currency. 
Ind AS 21, “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates” prescribes the factors to be considered for 
the purpose of determination of functional currency. 
Management uses its judgement to determine the 
functional currency that most faithfully represents 
the economic effects of the underlying transactions, 
events and conditions.
	
Provision for Anticipated Sales Return:
In determining the provision for anticipated sales 
returns, estimates for probable saleable and 
non-saleable returns of goods from the customers 
are made on scientific basis after factoring in the 
historical data of such returns and its trend.
3. 
Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements comprise 
the financial statement of the Company and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity 
over which the Group has control. Control is achieved 
when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an 
investee if and only if the Group has:
•	 Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give 
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities 
of the investee)
•	 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
•	 The ability to use its power over the investee to 
affect its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority 
of voting rights result in control. To support this 
presumption and when the Group has less than 
a majority of the voting or similar rights of an 
investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over 
an investee, including:
•	 The contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee
•	 Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
•	 The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
•	 The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights 
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings 
of the other voting rights holders.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls 
an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using 
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and 
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of 
the Group uses accounting policies other than those 
adopted in the consolidated financial statements for 
like transactions and events in similar circumstances, 
appropriate adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s financial statements in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements to ensure 
conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.
	
Consolidation Procedure:
	
(i)	
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the 
Group. The Group controls an entity when it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date on which 
control commences until the date on which 
control ceases.
Items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cashflows of the parents with 
those of its subsidiaries are combined like to 
like basis. For this purpose, income & expenses 
of the subsidiaries are based on the assets and 
liabilities recognised in consolidated financial 
statements at acquisition date.
	
(ii)	 Non-Controlling Interests (NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the 
date of acquisition.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets 
(excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries 
are identified separately from the Group’s equity. 
NCI are measured at their proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets at the 
date of acquisition. Subsequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests 
is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to 
non-controlling interests even if it results in the 
non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
	
(iii)	 Loss of Control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the assets and liabilities of 
the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other 
components of equity. Any interest retained in 
the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at 
the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or 
loss is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(iv)	 Transaction’s Eliminated on Consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and 
any unrealised income and expenses arising 
from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way 
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that 
there is no evidence of impairment.
4. 
Functional and Presentation Currency
Group’s consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional 
currency of the Holding Company. For each entity the 
Group determines the functional currency and items 
included in the financial statements of each entity are 
measured using that functional currency.
	
Initial recognition: 
Currency transactions are recorded by the Group’s 
entities at their respective functional currency, 
by applying to the foreign currency amount the 
exchange rate between the functional currency and 
foreign currency at the date of the transaction.
	
Conversion:
Foreign currency monetary items are reported at 
functional currency spot rate of exchange at reporting 
date. ‘Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of 
the initial transactions.
	
Group Companies:
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign 
operations are translated into Indian rupees at the 
rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date 
and their statements of profit or loss are translated 
at average exchange rates.
For practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate 
to translate income and expense items, if the average 
rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions. The exchange differences arising 
on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is 
recognised in profit or loss.
5. 
Rounding of Amounts
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and 
notes have been rounded off to the nearest Crore.
6. 
Current/Non-Current Classification
An entity shall classify an asset as current when-
(a)	
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell 
or consume it, in its normal operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
(d)	
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the 
asset is restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current.
An entity shall classify a liability as current when-
(a)	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal 
operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
(d)	
it does not have an unconditional right to 
defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period. 
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of 
the counterparty, result in its settlement by 
the issue of equity instruments do not affect 
its classification.

An entity shall classify all other liabilities as 
non-current.
	
Operating Cycle:
An operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
or cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of products/activities of the group 
and the normal time between acquisition of assets 
and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the 
group has determined its operating cycle as twelve 
months for the purpose of classification of its assets 
and liabilities as current and non-current.
7. 
Material Accounting Policies
7.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
	
Recognition and measurement:
Items of PPE are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The 
cost of an item of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and other non-refundable 
taxes or levies and any directly to the attributable 
cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for 
its intended use and any trade discount and rebates 
are deducted in arriving at purchase price. Cost 
of the assets also includes interest on borrowings 
attributable to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets 
up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use 
incurred up to that date.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of 
the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for 
long-term construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and 
equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, 
the Group depreciates these components separately 
based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a 
major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in 
the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Cost of Items of Property, plant and equipment not 
ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date, 
is disclosed as capital work-in-progress. Advances 
given towards acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each balance sheet 
date are disclosed as Capital Advance under Other 
non-current assets.
All identifiable revenue expenses including interest 
incurred in respect of various projects/expansion, 
net of income earned during the project development 
stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-
operative expenses and disclosed under Capital 
Work-in-Progress.
Capital expenditure on Property, plant and 
equipment for research and development is 
classified under property, plant and equipment and 
is depreciated on the same basis as other property, 
plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised 
either on disposal or when the asset retires from 
active use. Losses arising in the case of the retirement 
of property, plant and equipment and gains or 
losses arising from disposal of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss in the year of occurrence.
	
Transition to Ind AS:
The cost property, plant and equipment at 01 April 
2016, the Companies date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), 
as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
Subsequent Expenditure:
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
	
Depreciation:
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the 
depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives 
as prescribed under Schedule II to the Act or as per 
technical assessment. The residual values, useful lives 
and method of depreciation of PPE is reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
Depreciation on additions/disposals is provided on 
a pro-rata basis i.e. from/up to the date on which is 
asset is ready to use/disposed of. Freehold land is 
not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of Tangible assets are 
as follows
PPE
Useful Life
Buildings*
5 Years to 60 Years
Plant and Equipment*
3 Years to 25 Years
Furniture and Fixtures*
10 Years
Vehicles
8 Years to 10 Years
Office Equipments*
3 Years to 5 Years
* For these class of assets, the useful life of assets is different than 
the prescribed life as per Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. The different useful life is based on internal technical 
evaluation by the Company and historical usage of assets.
Dies & Punches having useful life of 3 years as per 
technical evaluation and management estimate and 
Solar Plants having useful life of 25 years.
Property, plant and equipment which are added/
disposed off during the year, depreciation is provided 
on pro-rata basis.
Building constructed on leasehold land are 
depreciated based on the useful life specified in 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, where the 
lease period of the land is beyond the life of the 
building. In other cases, building constructed on 
leasehold land are amortised over the primary lease 
period of the land.
	
Depreciation for Subsidiaries:
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment has 
been provided at the rates required/permissible 
by the GAAPs of the respective countries. The 
management believes that these estimated useful 
lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of 
the period over which the assets are likely to be used.
Vehicles acquired on finance leases are depreciated 
over the period of lease agreement or the useful life, 
whichever is shorter.
7.2 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
assets can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Internally 
generated intangibles, excluding development 
costs as defined in Ind AS, are not capitalised and 
the related expenditure is reflected in Statement of 
profit and loss in the period in which the expenditure 
is incurred.
Software is amortised over their estimated useful life 
on straight-line basis from the date they are available 
for intended use or the period of the license as 
applicable, subject to impairment test.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible assets with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the assets 
are derecognised.
	
Research and Development:
Revenue expenditure on research is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability 
can reasonably be regarded as assured. Any 
expenditure carried forward is amortised over the 
period of expected future sales from the related 
project. The carrying value of development costs is 
reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is 
not yet in use, and otherwise when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
	
Investment Property:
Investment property is property held either to earn 
rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, 
but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use 
in the production or supply of goods or services or for 
administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an 
investment property is measured at cost, including 
related transaction cost. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment property is measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
The group depreciates investment property using the 
following useful lives from the date of original purchase.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property 
is recognised in profit or loss.
The fair values of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes. Fair values are determined on the basis of 
valuation done by registered valuer.
	
Impairment on non-financial assets:
The group’s non-financial assets other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows (i.e. corporate assets) are 
grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its 
value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value 
in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated 
recoverable amount. Impairment loss recognised 
in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU (or group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, 
the Company reviews at each reporting date whether 
there is any indication that the loss has decreased or 
no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
The following intangible assets are tested for 
impairment each financial year even if there is no 
indication that the asset is impaired:
i)	
An intangible asset that is not yet available for 
use; and
ii)	
An intangible asset that is amortised over a 
period exceeding ten years from the date when 
the asset is available for use.
7.3 Non-current assets classified as held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale and stated at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell if the asset is available for immediate sale and its 
sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets 
are presented separately in the Balance Sheet as 
“Assets Classified as Held for Sale”. Once classified as 
held for sale, intangible assets, investment property 
and property, plant and equipment are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
7.4 Financial Instruments
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are 
initially recognised when they originate. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognised when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without 
a significant financing component) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for 
an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade 
receivable without a significant financing component 
is initially measured at the transaction price.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
	
Financial Assets:
	
Classification:
The Group classifies financial assets as subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or 
loss, on the basis of its business model for managing 
the financial assets and the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial asset.
	
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial assets excluding trade receivable 
(not measured subsequently at fair value through 
profit or loss) are recognised initially at fair value 
plus transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset.
	
Subsequent measurement:
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in two broad categories: 
•	 Financial assets at fair value (FVTPL / FVTOCI)
•	 Financial assets at amortised cost.
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and 
losses are either recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), 
or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
	
Financial Assets measured at amortised cost (net of 
write down for impairment, if any):
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost 
when asset is held within a business model, whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows and contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest. Such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method less 
impairment, if any. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the Statement of profit and loss.
	
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value, when asset is held within a business model, 
whose objective is to hold assets for both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognised in the other 
comprehensive income.
	
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value 
with all changes recognised in profit or loss.
	
Investment in Subsidiary:
Investment in equity instruments of Subsidiaries 
are measured at cost. In the financial statements, 
investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost. The 
carrying amount is reduced to recognise any 
impairment in the value of investment.
	
Investment in Equity Instruments:
Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. Fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
Investment in Debt Instruments:
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost 
or at FVTOCI. Any debt instrument, which does not 
meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised 
cost or as FVOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Debt 
instruments included within the FVTPL category are 
measured at fair value with all changes recognised 
in the Statement of profit and loss.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
A financial asset is primarily derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired or the Group has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset.
	
Impairment of Financial Assets:
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets 
that are debt instruments and trade receivables.
	
Financial Liabilities:
	
Classification:
The Group classifies all financial liabilities as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
	
Initial recognition and measurement:
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and 
derivative financial instruments.
	
Subsequent measurement:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at fair value through profit or loss. Interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is 
included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities:
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially

different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Derivative Financial Instrument:
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such 
as forward currency contracts to mitigate its foreign 
currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments 
are initially recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives 
are carried as financial assets when the fair value 
is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair 
value is negative. Any changes therein are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
7.5 Inventories
Raw materials and packing materials are valued at 
lower of cost (on moving weighted average basis) 
and the net realisable value, cost of which includes 
duties and taxes (net off CENVAT and Goods and 
Service Tax wherever applicable). Cost of imported 
raw materials and packing materials lying in bonded 
warehouse includes the amount of customs duty. 
Finished products including traded goods and 
work-in-progress are valued at lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress have 
been computed to include all cost of purchases, cost 
of conversion, appropriate share of fixed production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity and 
other related cost incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and selling expenses necessary 
to make the sale.
Slow and non-moving material, products nearing 
expiry, defective inventory are fully provided for and 
valued at net realisable value.
Goods and materials in transit are valued at actual 
cost incurred up to the date of balance sheet. 
Materials and other items held for use in production 
of inventories are not written down, if the finished 
products in which they will be used are expected to 
be sold at or above cost.
Consumables and other materials procured for R&D 
purpose are charged off when acquired.
The comparison of cost and Net realisable value is 
made on an item-by-item basis.
7.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on 
hand and cash at bank including fixed deposit/highly 
liquid investments with original maturity period of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, as they are considered 
an integral part of the group’s cash management.
7.7 Cash Flow Statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash 
receipts or payments and item of income or expenses 
associated with investing or financing cash flows. The 
cash flow from operating, investing and financing 
activities of the Group are segregated.
7.8 Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the Company’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured based on 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. 
Foreign currency exchange differences are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on translating monetary items 
at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or 
in previous Financial Statements are recognised in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which they arise. When a gain or loss on a 
non-monetary item is recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income, any exchange component of 
that gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-
monetary item is recognised in Standalone Statement 
of Profit and Loss, any exchange component of that 
gain or loss is recognised in Standalone Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
In case of foreign operations whose functional 
currency is different from the parent company’s 
functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such 
foreign operations, The income and expenses of such 
foreign operations are translated to the reporting 
currency at the monthly average exchange rates 
prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency 
differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income/(loss) and presented within equity as part 
of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, 
in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is 
reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss as a part of gain or loss on disposal.
7.9 Revenue Recognition
	
Sale of Goods:
Revenue is measured based on the transaction 
price adjusted for discounts, rebates, chargebacks, 
medicaids, product recalls & supply penalties, which 
is specified in a contract with customer. Revenue 
are net of estimated returns and taxes collected 
from customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at point 
in time when control is transferred to the customer 
and it is probable that consideration will be collected. 
Control of goods is transferred upon the shipment of 
the goods to the customer or when goods is made 
available to the customer as per terms agreed.
The transaction price is documented on the sales 
invoice and payment is generally due as per agreed 
credit terms with customer.
The consideration can be fixed or variable. Variable 
consideration is only recognised when it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Sales return is variable consideration that is recognised 
and recorded based on historical experience, market 
conditions and provided for in the year of sale as 
reduction from revenue. The methodology and 
assumptions used to estimate returns are monitored 
and adjusted regularly in line with trade practices, 
historical trends, past experience and projected 
market conditions.
	
Interest income:
Interest income is recognised with reference to the 
Effective Interest Rate method.
	
Dividend income:
Dividend from investment is recognised as revenue 
when right to receive is established.
	
Income from Export Benefits and Other Incentives:
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes 
are accrued as revenue in the year in which the goods 
are exported and/or services are rendered only when 
their reasonable assurance that the conditions 
attached to them will be complied with, and the 
amounts will be received. Export benefit receivables 
are carried at net realisable value.
7.10 Employee Benefits
	
In case of Holding Company:
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering service are classified as short-
term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, 
wages, short-term compensated absences, 
performance incentives etc., and the expected cost 
of bonus, ex-gratia are recognised during the period 
in which the employee renders related service.
	
(i)	
Defined benefit plans
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) 
covering eligible employees. The Gratuity 
Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation 
or termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee’s salary and 
the tenure of employment with the Company.
Liabilities with regard to Gratuity Plan are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by 
an independent actuary, at each balance sheet 
date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained 
liabilities to the Ajanta Pharma Limited Group 
Gratuity Trust (the Trust). Trustees administer 
contributions made to the Trust and contributions 
are invested in a scheme with Life Insurance 
Corporation of India as permitted by laws 
of India.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised 
in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.

Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited 
to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
The Company recognises the net obligation of 
a defined benefit plan in its balance sheet as 
an asset or liability. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the other comprehensive 
income for the period in which they occur. The 
effect of any plan amendments are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(ii)	 Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expense when employees have 
rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Company pays provident fund contributions 
to publicly administered provident funds as per 
local regulations. The Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are 
accounted for as defined contribution plans and 
the contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the 
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available.
	
(iii)	 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated 
absences which are both accumulating and 
non-accumulating in nature. The expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences 
is determined by actuarial valuation performed 
by an independent actuary at each balance 
sheet date using projected unit credit method 
on the additional amount expected to be paid/
availed within twelve months as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected 
to occur within twelve months after the end of 
the period in which the employee renders the 
related services are recognised as a liability 
at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur.
	
(iv)	 Share-based compensation
Employees Stock Options Plans (“ESOPs”): 
The grant date fair value of options granted 
to employees is recognised as an employee 
expense, over the period that the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The expense is recorded for each separately 
vesting portion of the award as if the award 
was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase 
in equity recognised in connection with share-
based payment transaction is presented as a 
separate component in equity under “Employee 
Stock Options Outstanding Reserve”. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of stock options that vest. 
The options granted to employees of subsidiary 
is recognised as an equity investment.
The Company recognises compensation 
expense relating to share-based payments in 
net profit using fair-value in accordance with Ind 
AS 102, Share-Based Payment.
	
In case of Subsidiary at Mauritius:
For employees who are not covered by a pension 
plan, the net present value of severance allowances 
payable under the Employment Rights Act, 2008 is 
provided for. The obligations arising under this item 
are not funded.
	
In case of Subsidiary at Philippines:
	
Short-term benefits:
The Company recognises a liability net of amounts 
already paid and an expense for services rendered 
by employees during the accounting period. Short-
term benefits given by the Company to its employees 
include salaries and wages, social security 
contributions, short-term compensated absences, 
bonuses and other non-monetary benefits.
	
Post-employment benefits:
The Company does not have a formal retirement 
benefit plan. However, the Company is subject to the 
provisions of Republic Act No. 7641, retirement law.
	
Compensated Absences:
Compensated absences are recognised for the 
number of paid leave days remaining at the end 
of the reporting period. Those are included in the 
salaries and wages account and are recognised 
when availed of by the employees.
	
In case of Subsidiary at USA:
	
Short-term benefits:
The Company recognises a liability net of amounts 
already paid and an expense for services rendered 
by employees during the accounting period. 
Short-term benefits given by the Company to its 
employees include salaries and wages, social 
security contributions, Medicare contributions, and 
other non-monetary benefits. A liability is recognised 
for the amount expected to be paid, if the Company 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay 
this amount as a result of past service provided by 
the employee, and the amount of obligation can be 
estimated reliably
	
Post-employment benefits:
The Company provides a 401(k) retirement programme 
for full-time employees who are 21 years of age or 
older. Eligible employees are entitled to participate 
in the Company offered plan with an option to 
contribute up to maximum 3% of annual base salary. 
For employees with an annual base salary above the 
annual compensation limits, as determined by the 
Federal Internal Revenue Service (Federal), the annual 
APUI contribution will be capped at 3% of the Federal 
allowed annual compensation limits. All contributions 
are 100% vested immediately to the employee.
7.11 Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an asset 
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing 
costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment 
to the borrowing costs.
7.12 Leases
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Group assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves 
the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) 
the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Group recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements 
in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term 
of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 
value leases. For these short-term and low value 
leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as 
an operating expense on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-
in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets. 
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments. The lease payments are discounted using 
the generally accepted interest rate. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to 
the related right of use asset if the Company changes 
its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension 
or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a 
finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified 
as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
In respect of assets given on operating lease, lease 
rentals are accounted in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, on accrual basis in accordance with the 
respective lease agreements.
7.13 Government Grants
Government grants are initially recognised as deferred 
income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Company will 
comply with the conditions associated with the grant;
•	 In case of capital grants, they are then recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss as other income on 
a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
•	 In case of grants that compensate the Company 
for expenses incurred are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis in the 
periods in which the expenses are recognised.
7.14 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed 
by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of equity shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per equity share and also the weighted 
average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are 
adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity 
shares been actually issued at fair value. Dilutive 
potential equity shares are deemed converted as of 
the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later 
date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined 
independently for each period presented.
7.15 Income Taxes
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred 
income tax.
Current tax is recognised in statement of profit or loss, 
except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, 
in which case, the current tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively. Current income tax for current and prior 
periods is recognised at the amount expected to be 
paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using 
the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured using tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary 
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities is recognised as 
income or expense in the period that includes the 
enactment or the substantive enactment date. A 
deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and tax losses can be utilised. The Group 
offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, 
where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and where it intends either to 
settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the 
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where it is 
expected that the earnings of the subsidiary will not 
be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
7.16 Dividends to Shareholders
Annual dividend distribution to the shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the shareholders. Any 
interim dividend paid is recognised on approval by 
Board of Directors. Dividend payable is recognised 
directly in equity.
7.17 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, Contingent 
Assets and Commitments
	
General:
Provisions (legal and constructive) are recognised 
when the Group has a present obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made.
Provisions (excluding retirement benefits and 
compensated absences) are not discounted to its 
present value and are determined based on best 
estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimates.
If there is any expectation that some or all of the 
provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any virtually certain reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risk specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.
Contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
•	 A present obligation arising from past events, when 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation;
•	 A present obligation arising from past events, when 
no reliable estimates is possible;
•	 A possible obligation arising from past events, 
unless the probability of outflow of resources 
is remote.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
Financial Statements.
Commitments include the amount of purchase order 
(net of advances) issued to parties for completion of 
assets and Non-cancellable operating lease.
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets 
and commitments are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
7.18 Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with Ind AS 113.
Financials Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the following material 
items in the statement of financial position:
•	 Derivative financial instruments (mainly forward 
currency contracts) are measured at fair value 
received from Bank.
•	 Mutual Funds are measured at fair values as per 
Net Asset Value (NAV).
•	 Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) at fair values 
as per Black Scholes option pricing model.
Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or settle a liability in an ordinary 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
•	 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
•	 Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
7.19 Recent accounting pronouncements
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standard or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules as issued from time to time. For the year 
ended 31 March 2024, MCA has not notified any new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
applicable to the Group.

48. Capital Management
Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. Management monitors the return (EBIT) on capital, as well as the level of 
dividends to equity shareholders. The Group’s objective for capital management is to maximise shareholder value, 
safeguard business continuity and support the growth of the Group. The Group determines the capital requirement 
based on annual operating plans and long-term and other strategic investment plans. 
Group monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘adjusted equity’. For this purpose, adjusted net debt is 
defined as debt less cash and cash equivalents and current investments. Adjusted equity comprises all components 
of equity. 
Group’s policy is to keep the Net Debt Equity ratio below 1.00 and its adjusted net debt to equity ratio at 31 March 
2024 was as follows.

Sensitivity Analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other 
assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation as shown below.

Although the analysis does not take in to account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide 
an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. The estimate of future increase in compensation levels, considered in 
the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such 
as supply and demand in the employment market.
51.3 Leave Encashment
The Holding Company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated 
and encashed as per the Company’s policies. The liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has been 
provided based on report of independent actuary using “Projected Unit Credit Method”.
Accordingly, H 33.07 Crore (31 March 2023 H 27.14 Crore) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences 
as per actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at Mauritius:
For employees who are not covered by a pension plan, the net present value of severance allowances payable is 
provided for aggregating H Nil (31 March 2023 H Nil).
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at Philippines:
Short-term benefits include salaries and wages and other government contributions which are due within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which employee renders the related service. The Company’s short-term employee benefits 
amounted to H Nil (31 March 2023 H Nil). The Company did not yet set up a retirement plan since it does not have more 
than ten employees who had served at least five years.
Employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at USA:
Short-term benefits include salaries and wages and other government contributions which are due within 12 months 
after the end of the period in which employee renders the related service. The Company’s short-term employee benefits 
amounted to H 2.96 Crore (31 March 2023 H 3.28 Crore).
52. Share-Based Payments 
The Holding Company has established “Employee Stock Options Scheme 2011” (‘ESOP-2011’) and “Share-based 
Incentive Plan 2019” as approved in earlier year by the shareholders of the Company and Compensation committee 
of Board of Directors for the key employees of the Company. The options issued under the above scheme vest in a 
phased manner.
During the year, the Company made the decision to withdraw the Employee Stock Options Scheme 2011 in the 
Nomination & Remuneration committee meeting held on 31 January 2024, with immediate effect.
During the year 91,350 option have been granted and 3,750 option cancelled by the Company under the aforesaid 
Share-based Incentive Plan 2019 to the employees (including KMP’s) of the Group.

Valuation of Stock Options
The fair value of stock options granted during the period has been measured using the Black–Scholes option pricing 
model at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, 
expected volatility, expected terms and risk-free interest rates. They key inputs and assumptions used are as follows:
Share price: The closing price on NSE as on the date of grant has been considered for valuing the options granted.
Exercise Price: Exercise Price is the market price or face value or such other price as determined by the Remuneration 
and Compensation Committee.
Expected Volatility: The historical volatility of the stock till the date of grant has been considered to calculate the fair 
value of the options.
Expected Option Life: Expected Life of option is the period for which the Company expects the options to be live. The 
minimum life of a stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the maximum 
life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.
Expected dividends: Expected dividend yield has been calculated as an average of dividend yields for four years 
preceding the date of the grant.
Risk free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate on the date of grant considered for the calculation is the interest 
rate applicable for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on the zero-coupon yield curve for 
Government Securities.
These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties 
based on market conditions generally outside of the Company’s control. As a result, if other assumptions had been 
used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if 
management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially 
impacted in future years. The Company has granted stock options to employees of a subsidiary, the estimated fair 
value of stock options issued are included in the carrying value of the investment in the said subsidiary on a straight-
line basis over the requisite service period of each separately vesting portion of the award.

Fair Value Hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments 
that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining 
fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.

Level 1 – Level 1 Hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes mutual funds that 
have declared buyback NAV. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2 – The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like Mark to Market Derivatives, 
and Non-convertible market link Debentures) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to 
fair value as instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3 – If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in 
level 3. 
Measurement of Fair Values:
Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs:
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 & Level 3 fair values, for financial instruments

Risk Management Framework
Group’s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk 
management framework. Management is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company’s risk management 
policies, under the guidance of Audit Committee.
Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by it, to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed

Credit Risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade 
receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and mutual funds, foreign exchange 
transactions and other financial instruments.

Trade Receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and 
control relating to customer credit risk management. Trade receivables, which are non-interest bearing, are mainly 
from stockists, distributors and customers and are generally on 14 days to 270 days credit term. Outstanding 
customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has no concentration of credit risk as the customer 
base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
As at 31 March 2024, Group had 76 customers (31 March 2023: 83 customers) that owed the Company more than 
H 0.50 Crore each and accounted for approximately 91% and 91% of the total outstanding as at 31 March 2024 
and 31 March 2023.
	
Expected Credit Loss Assessment
As per simplified approach, the Group makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivable using a 
provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payment and make appropriate provision at each reporting date 
wherever required. The trend of the bad debts is negligible.

Financial Instruments
Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities issued by mutual funds having a credit ranking 
of at least 3 and above from CRISIL or equivalent rating agency. Group monitors changes in credit risk by tracking 
published external credit ranking. Based on its on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Group adjusts its 
exposure to various counterparties.
ii.	
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations 
without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum levels of liquidity 
to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Group closely monitors its liquidity position and deploys a robust 
cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing including bilateral loans, debt and overdraft 
from banks at an optimised cost. Working capital requirements are adequately addressed by internally generated 
funds. Trade receivables are kept within manageable levels. 
Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments 
at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities over the next six months. The ratio of cash 
and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments to outflows is 0.55 at 31 March 2024 (1.18 at 
31 March 2023)

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 
prices – will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, and 
derivative financial instruments. 
Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange 
contracts to manage its exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations. All such transactions are carried out within 
the guidelines set by the risk management committee.

Sensitivity Analysis on Interest Rate
The Company’s fixed rate bank deposits and securities are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flow will 
fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.
	
Sensitivity Analysis on Equity Prices
The Group has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds. The value of investment in these 
mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Management Company 
on daily basis. The Company has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated 
fluctuations in their NAV as in management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture.
iv.	 Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, 
purchases and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the Group. The currencies 
in which these transactions are primarily denominated are US Dollars, Euro, Mauritian Rupee, Philippine Peso and 
Nigerian Naira.
At any point in time, the Group covers foreign currency risk by taking appropriate percentage of its foreign currency 
exposure, as approved by risk management committee in line with the laid down policy approved by the Board. 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year 
from the reporting date. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the 
Group’s policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies 
at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.

a)	 Interest Rate Risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily 
to the Group’s debt interest obligations. Further, the Group engages in financing activities at market linked rates, any 
changes in the interest rates environment may impact future rates of borrowing.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to management is as follows.

55. Disaggregation of Revenue
The operations of the Group are limited to only one segment viz. pharmaceuticals and related products. Revenue from 
contract with customers is from sale of manufactured goods. Sale of goods are made at a point in time and revenue 
is recognised upon satisfaction of the performance obligations which is typically upon dispatch/delivery. The Group 
has a credit evaluation policy based on which the credit limits for the trade receivables are established. There is no 
significant financing component as the credit period provided by the Group is not significant.

Standalone
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of 
Ajanta Pharma Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of 
Ajanta Pharma Limited (the “Company”) which comprise 
the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, and 
the standalone statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), standalone statement of 
changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows 
for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone 
financial statements, including material accounting 
policies and other explanatory information
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of 
the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2024, 
and its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in 
equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for 
the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India together with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of 
the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matter(s)
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue Recognition
See Note 6.10 of accounting policies and note 36 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter
	
How the matter was addressed in our audit
As stated in Note 6.10 to the standalone financial statements, 
revenue from sale of products is recognised at a point in time when 
control of the products is transferred to the customer. Revenue 
from the sale of goods is measured based on the transaction price 
adjusted for discounts and rebates, which is specified in contract 
with customers.
The actual point in time when revenue is recognised varies 
depending on the specific terms and conditions of the sales 
contracts entered into with customers. The Company has a large 
number of customers operating in various geographies and sales 
contracts with these customers have distinct terms and conditions 
relating to the recognition of revenue and right of return.
Revenue is a key performance indicator for the Company. 
Accordingly, there could be pressure to meet the expectations of 
investors / other stakeholders and / or to meet revenue targets 
stipulated in performance incentive schemes for a reporting 
period. We have considered that there is a risk of fraud related to 
revenue being overstated by recognition in the wrong period or 
before control has passed to a valid customer.
Accordingly, we identified recognition of revenue from sale of 
products during the year and at the period end as a key audit 
matter.
Our procedures in respect of recognition of revenue included the 
following:
•	
Verifying the accounting policies adopted by the Company 
with respect to recognition of revenue by comparing with the 
applicable accounting standards.
•	
Testing 
the 
design, 
implementation 
and 
operating 
effectiveness of the Company’s manual and automated 
controls designed to ensure recognition of valid revenue 
transactions in the correct period.
•	
Performing substantive testing of selected samples of revenue 
transactions recorded during the year as well as at year-
end. We used statistical sampling and verified contractual 
terms of sales invoices / contracts, shipping documents and 
acknowledged delivery receipts for those transactions.
•	
Analysing and testing high risk journal entries that contain 
unusual combinations of credit to revenue with no associated 
debit to cash, debtors or another revenue account.
Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s 
annual report, but does not include the financial 
statements and auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Management’s 
and 
Board 
of 
Directors 
Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company 
and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of standalone financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the

Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

on the Standalone Financial Statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
(Referred to in paragraph 1 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even 
date)
(i)	
(a)	
(A)	 The Company has maintained proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative details and situation of 
Property, Plant and Equipment.
	
	
(B)	 The Company has maintained proper 
records showing full particulars of 
intangible assets.
	
(b)	
According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination 
of the records of the Company, the Company 
has a regular programme of physical verification 
of its Property, Plant and Equipment by which 
all property, plant and equipment are verified 
in a phased manner over a period of 3 years. 
In accordance with this programme, certain 
property, plant and equipment were verified 
during the year. In our opinion, this periodicity of 
physical verification is reasonable having regard 
to the size of the Company and the nature of its 
assets. No material discrepancies were noticed 
on such verification.
	
(c)	
According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination 
of the records of the Company, the title deeds 
of immovable properties (other than immovable 
properties where the Company is the lessee 
and the leases agreements are duly executed in 
favour of the lessee) disclosed in the standalone 
financial statements are held in the name of 
the Company.

The inventory, except goods-in-transit and 
stocks lying with third parties, has been physically 
verified by the management during the year.For 
stocks lying with third parties at the year-end, 
written confirmations have been obtained 
and for goods-in-transit subsequent evidence 
of receipts has been linked with inventory 
records. In our opinion, the frequency of such 
verification is reasonable and procedures and 
coverage as followed by management were 
appropriate. No discrepancies were noticed on 
verification between the physical stocks and the 
book records that were more than 10% in the 
aggregate of each class of inventory.
	
(b)	
According to the information and explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination

the Company.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
on the standalone financial statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause 
(i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of 
even date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements of Ajanta Pharma Limited 
(“the Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements and such internal financial controls 
were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s 
and 
Board 
of 
Directors’ 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements were established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error 
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Basis of Preparation
	
Statement of Compliance:
These standalone financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind AS’) as per the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
from time to time, notified under Section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and other relevant 
provisions of the Act. These standalone financial 
statements have been prepared on an accrual 
basis and under the historical cost basis, except 
otherwise stated.
The standalone financial statements for the year 
ended 31 March 2024 have been reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and subsequently approved by the 
Board of Directors at its meeting held on 02 May 2024.
	
Use of Estimates and Judgements:
The preparation of standalone financial statements 
in conformity with Ind AS requires management to 
make judgements , estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on the date of the financial statements. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and under 
lying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively in current and future periods.
	
Judgements:
Information about judgements made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most significant 
effects on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements is included in the following notes
 
Classification of Lease as per Ind AS 116:
Ind AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the 
lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease 
adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the 
lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. 
The Company makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby 
assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any 
options to extend or terminate the contract will be 
exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company 
considers factors such as any significant leasehold 
improvements undertaken over the lease term, 
costs relating to the termination of lease and the 
importance of the underlying lease to the Company’s 
operations taking into account the location of the 
underlying asset and the availability of the suitable 
alternatives. The lease term in future periods is 
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the 
current economic circumstances. The discount rate 
is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate 
specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio 
of leases with similar characteristics.
	
Estimates:
Information about assumptions and estimation 
uncertainties at the reporting date that have a 
significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year is included in the following notes.
	
Recognition of Current and Deferred tax 
assets:
The Company’s tax charge on ordinary activities is 
the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. 
The calculation of the Company’s total tax charge 
necessarily involves a degree of estimation in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally 
determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a 
formal legal process. The final resolution of some of 
these items may give rise to material profits/losses 
and/or cash flows.
The complexity of the Company’s structure makes 
the degree of estimation more challenging. The 
resolution of issues is not always within the control 
of the Company and it is often dependent on the 
efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant taxing 
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Issues 
can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting 
period result from payments on account and on the 
final resolution of open items. As a result there can 
be substantial differences between the tax charge in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss and tax payments.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon 
whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and 
suitable taxable profits will be available in the future 
against which the reversal of temporary differences 
can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available 
profit forecasts. Where the temporary differences 
are related to losses, relevant tax law is considered 
to determine the availability of the losses to offset 
against the future taxable profits.
	
Property, Plant and Equipment:
Useful lives of tangible assets are based on the life 
prescribed in Schedule II of the Act. In cases, where 
the useful lives are different from that prescribed in 
Schedule II, they are based on technical advice, taking 
into account the nature of the asset, the estimated 
usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the 
asset, past history of replacement, anticipated 
technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties 
and maintenance support.
	
Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets majorly consist software licences 
which are amortised over licence period which 
equates the economic useful life ranging between 
2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of 
its economic useful life.
 
Recognition and Measurement of Defined 
Benefit Obligations:
The obligation arising from the defined benefit plan 
is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation. Key 
actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends 
in salary escalation and vested future benefits and 
life expectancy. The discount rate is determined with 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting 
period on the government bonds. The period to 
maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to 
the probable maturity of the post-employment 
benefit obligations.
	
Allowance for Uncollected Accounts 
Receivable and Advances:
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are stated at their normal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. Individual trade receivables are written 
off when management seems them not collectible. 
Impairment is made using expected credit loss model.
The impairment provisions for financial assets are 
based on assumption about risk of default and 
expected loss rates. Judgement in making these 
assumption and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation are based on past history, existing market 
condition as well as forward-looking estimates at the 
end of each reporting period.
	
Allowances for inventories:
Management reviews the inventory age listing on 
a periodic basis. The review involves comparison 
of the carrying value of the aged inventory items. 
The purpose is to ascertain whether an allowance 
is required to be made in the standalone financial 
statement for any obsolete and slow-moving items. 
Management is satisfied that adequate allowance 
for obsolete and slow-moving inventories has been 
made in the financial statements.
Management also reviews net realisable value for all 
its inventory and is satisfied that adequate allowance 
has been made in the financial statements.
	
Contingencies:
Management judgement is required for estimating 
the possible outflow of resources, if any, in respect of 
contingencies/claim/litigations against the Company 
as it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending 
matters with accuracy.
	
Impairment Reviews:
An impairment exists when the carrying value of 
an asset or cash generating unit (‘CGU’) exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is 
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its 
value in use. The value in use calculation is based 
on a discounted cash flow model. In calculating the 
value in use, certain assumptions are required to be 
made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including 
management’s expectations of growth in EBITDA, 
long-term growth rates; and the selection of discount 
rates to reflect the risks involved.
	
Provision for Anticipated Sales Return:
In determining the provision for anticipated sales 
returns, estimates for probable saleable and non-
saleable returns of goods from the customers 
are made on scientific basis after factoring in the 
historical data of such returns and its trend.

Current/non-current classification
An entity shall classify an asset as current when-
(a)	
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell 
or consume it, in its normal operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
it expects to realise the asset within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
(d)	
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the 
asset is restricted from being exchanged or used 
to settle a liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period.
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current.
An entity shall classify a liability as current when-
(a)	
it expects to settle the liability in its normal 
operating cycle;
(b)	
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose 
of trading;
(c)	
the liability is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
(d)	
it does not have an unconditional right to 
defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period. 
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of 
the counterparty, result in its settlement by 
the issue of equity instruments do not affect 
its classification.
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as 
non-current.
	
Operating Cycle:
An operating cycle is the time between the acquisition 
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash 
or cash equivalents.
Based on the nature of products/activities of the 
Company and the normal time between acquisition of 
assets and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, 
the Company has determined its operating cycle as 
twelve months for the purpose of classification of its 
assets and liabilities as current and non-current.
6. 
Material Accounting Policies
6.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
	
Recognition and measurement:
Items of PPE are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The 
cost of an item of PPE comprises its purchase price, 
including import duties and other non-refundable 
taxes or levies and any directly to the attributable 
cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for 
its intended use and any trade discount and rebates 
are deducted in arriving at purchase price. Cost 
of the assets also includes interest on borrowings 
attributable to acquisition of qualifying fixed assets 
up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use 
incurred up to that date.
Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the 
plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-
term construction projects if the recognition criteria are 
met. When significant parts of plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company 
depreciates these components separately based 
on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major 
inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a 
replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Cost of Items of Property, plant and equipment not 
ready for intended use as on the balance sheet date, 
is disclosed as capital work-in-progress. Advances 
given towards acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date 
are disclosed as Capital Advance under Other non-
current assets.
All identifiable revenue expenses including interest 
incurred in respect of various projects/expansion, 
net of income earned during the project development 
stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-
operative expenses and disclosed under Capital 
Work in Progress.
Capital expenditure on Property, plant and 
equipment for research and development is 
classified under property, plant and equipment and 
is depreciated on the same basis as other property, 
plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment are derecognised 
either on disposal or when the asset retires from 
active use. Losses arising in the case of the retirement 
of property, plant and equipment and gains or 
losses arising from disposal of property, plant and 
equipment are recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss in the year of occurrence.
	
Transition to Ind AS:
The cost of property, plant and equipment as at 1 
April 2016, the Companies date of transition to Ind AS, 
was determined with reference to its carrying value 
recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), 
as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
	
Subsequent expenditure:
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits associated 
with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
	
Depreciation:
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the 
depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives 
as prescribed under Schedule II to the Act or as per 
technical assessment. The residual values, useful lives 
and method of depreciation of PPE is reviewed at 
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
Depreciation on additions/disposals is provided on 
a pro-rata basis i.e. from/up to the date on which is 
asset is ready to use/disposed off. Freehold land is 
not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of Tangible assets are 
as follows
PPE
Useful Life
Buildings*
5 Years to 60 Years
Plant and Equipment*
3 Years to 25 Years
Furniture and Fixtures*
10 Years
Vehicles
8 Years to 10 Years
Office Equipments*
3 Years to 5 Years
* For these class of assets, the useful life of assets is different than 
the prescribed life as per Part C of Schedule II of the Companies 
Act, 2013. The different useful life is based on internal technical 
evaluation by the Company and historical usage of assets.
Dies & Punches having useful life of 3 years as per 
technical evaluation and management estimate and 
Solar Plants having useful life of 25 years.
Property, plant and equipment which are added/
disposed off during the year, depreciation is provided 
on pro-rata basis.
Building constructed on leasehold land are 
depreciated based on the useful life specified in 
Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, where the 
lease period of the land is beyond the life of the 
building. In other cases, building constructed on 
leasehold land are amortised over the primary lease 
period of the land.
6.2 Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised when it is probable 
that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the assets will flow to the Company and the cost of 
the assets can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Internally 
generated intangibles, excluding development 
costs as defined in Ind AS, are not capitalised and 
the related expenditure is reflected in Statement of 
profit and loss in the period in which the expenditure 
is incurred.
Software is amortised over their estimated useful life 
on straight-line basis from the date they are available 
for intended use or the period of the license as 
applicable, subject to impairment test.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible assets with a finite useful life are 
reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected 
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset are considered to modify the 
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
intangible asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss when the assets 
are derecognised.
	
Research and Development:
Revenue expenditure on research is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss in the period in which it 
is incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability 
can reasonably be regarded as assured. Any 
expenditure carried forward is amortised over the 
period of expected future sales from the related 
project. The carrying value of development costs is 
reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is

6.3 Investment Property
Investment property is property held either to earn 
rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, 
but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use 
in the production or supply of goods or services or for 
administrative purposes. Upon initial recognition, an 
investment property is measured at cost, including 
related transaction cost. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, investment property is measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
The Company depreciates investment property 
using the following useful lives from the date of 
original purchase.

Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property 
is recognised in profit or loss.
The fair values of investment property is disclosed in 
the notes. Fair values are determined on the basis of 
valuation done by registered valuer.
	
Impairment on non-financial assets:
The Company’s non-financial assets other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, 
then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For impairment testing, assets that do not generate 
independent cash inflows (i.e. corporate assets) are 
grouped together into cash-generating units (CGUs). 
Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its 
value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value 
in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated 
recoverable amount. Impairment loss recognised 
in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU (or group 
of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of assets for which 
impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, 
the Company reviews at each reporting date whether 
there is any indication that the loss has decreased or 
no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. Such a reversal is made only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
The following intangible assets are tested for 
impairment each financial year even if there is no 
indication that the asset is impaired:
i)	
An intangible asset that is not yet available for 
use; and
ii)	
An intangible asset that is amortised over a 
period exceeding ten years from the date when 
the asset is available for use.
6.4 Non-current Assets Classified as Held for Sale
Assets are classified as held for sale and stated at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to 
sell if the asset is available for immediate sale and its 
sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets 
are presented separately in the Balance Sheet as 
“Assets Classified as Held for Sale”. Once classified as 
held for sale, intangible assets, investment property 
and property, plant and equipment are no longer 
amortised or depreciated.
6.5 Financial Instruments
Trade receivables and debt securities issued are 
initially recognised when they originate. All other 
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognised when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without 
a significant financing component) or financial liability 
is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for 
an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade 
receivable without a significant financing component 
is initially measured at the transaction price.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity.
	
Financial Assets:
	
Classification:
The Company classifies financial assets as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income or fair value 
through profit or loss, on the basis of its business model 
for managing the financial assets and the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
	
Initial Recognition and Measurement:
All financial assets excluding trade receivable(not 
measured subsequently at fair value through 
profit or loss) are recognised initially at fair value 
plus transaction costs that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial asset.
	
Subsequent Measurement:
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial 
assets are classified in two broad categories:
•	 Financial assets at fair value (FVTPL /FVTOCI)
•	 Financial assets at amortised cost
When assets are measured at fair value, gains and 
losses are either recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss (i.e. fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)), 
or recognised in other comprehensive income (i.e. fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)).
	
Financial Assets measured at amortised cost (net of 
write down for impairment, if any):
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost 
when asset is held within a business model, whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows and contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest. Such financial 
assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method less 
impairment, if any. The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the Statement of profit and loss.
	
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Other Comprehensive Income (“FVTOCI”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value, when asset is held within a business model, 
whose objective is to hold assets for both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
Fair value movements are recognised in the other 
comprehensive income.
	
Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through 
Profit or Loss (“FVTPL”):
Financial assets under this category are measured 
initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value 
with all changes recognised in profit or loss.
	
Investment in Subsidiary:
Investment in equity instruments of Subsidiaries 
are measured at cost. In the financial statements, 
investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost. The 
carrying amount is reduced to recognise any 
impairment in the value of investment.
	
Investment in Equity Instruments:
Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. Fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in 
profit or loss.
	
Investment in Debt Instruments:
A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost 
or at FVTOCI. Any debt instrument, which does not 
meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised 
cost or as FVOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. Debt 
instruments included within the FVTPL category are 
measured at fair value with all changes recognised 
in the Statement of profit and loss.
	
Derecognition of Financial Assets:
A financial asset is primarily derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired or the Company has transferred its rights to 
receive cash flows from the asset.
	
Impairment of Financial Assets:
In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the financial assets 
that are debt instruments and trade receivables.
	
Financial Liabilities:
	
Classification:
The Company classifies all financial liabilities as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTPL.
	
Initial Recognition and Measurement:
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2024
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and 
derivative financial instruments.
	
Subsequent Measurement:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at fair value through profit or loss. Interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is 
included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
	
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities:
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 
by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
Derivative Financial Instrument:
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, 
such as forward currency contracts to mitigate 
its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when 
the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative. Any changes therein 
are generally recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss.
6.6 Inventories
Raw materials and packing materials are valued at 
lower of cost (on moving weighted average basis) 
and the net realisable value, cost of which includes 
duties and taxes (net off CENVAT and Goods and 
Service Tax wherever applicable). Cost of imported 
raw materials and packing materials lying in bonded 
warehouse includes the amount of customs duty. 
Finished products including traded goods and 
work-in-progress are valued at lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress have 
been computed to include all cost of purchases, cost 
of conversion, appropriate share of fixed production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity and 
other related cost incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in 
the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and selling expenses necessary 
to make the sale.
Slow and non-moving material, products nearing 
expiry, defective inventory are fully provided for and 
valued at net realisable value.
Goods and materials in transit are valued at actual 
cost incurred up to the date of balance sheet. 
Materials and other items held for use in production 
of inventories are not written down, if the finished 
products in which they will be used are expected to 
be sold at or above cost.
Consumables and other materials procured for R&D 
purpose are charged off when acquired.
The comparison of cost and Net realisable value is 
made on an item-by-item basis.
6.7 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on 
hand and cash at bank including fixed deposit/highly 
liquid investments with original maturity period of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, as they are considered 
an integral part of the Company’s cash management.
6.8 Cash Flow Statement
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash 
receipts or payments and item of income or expenses 
associated with investing or financing cash flows. The 
cash flow from operating, investing and financing 
activities of the Company are segregated.
6.9 Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into 
the Company’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured based on 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated. 
Foreign currency exchange differences are generally 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on translating monetary items 
at rates different from those at which they were 
translated on initial recognition during the period or 
in previous Financial Statements are recognised in 
the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which they arise. When a gain or loss on a 
non-monetary item is recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income, any exchange component of 
that gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-
monetary item is recognised in Standalone Statement 
of Profit and Loss, any exchange component of that 
gain or loss is recognised in Standalone Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
6.10 Revenue Recognition
	
Sale of Goods:
Revenue is measured based on the transaction 
price adjusted for discounts and rebates, which 
is specified in a contract with customer. Revenue 
are net of estimated returns and taxes collected 
from customers.
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at point 
in time when control is transferred to the customer 
and it is probable that consideration will be collected. 
Control of goods is transferred upon the shipment of 
the goods to the customer or when goods is made 
available to the customer as per terms agreed.
The transaction price is documented on the sales 
invoice and payment is generally due as per agreed 
credit terms with customer.
The consideration can be fixed or variable. Variable 
consideration is only recognised when it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Sales return is variable consideration that is recognised 
and recorded based on historical experience, market 
conditions and provided for in the year of sale as 
reduction from revenue. The methodology and 
assumptions used to estimate returns are monitored 
and adjusted regularly in line with trade practices, 
historical trends, past experience and projected 
market conditions.
Interest income: Interest income is recognised with 
reference to the Effective Interest Rate method.
Dividend income: Dividend from investment is 
recognised as revenue when right to receive 
is established.
	
Income from Export Benefits and Other Incentives
Export benefits available under prevalent schemes 
are accrued as revenue in the year in which the goods 
are exported and/or services are rendered only when 
their reasonable assurance that the conditions 
attached to them will be complied with, and the 
amounts will be received. Export benefit receivables 
are carried at net realisable value.
6.11 Employee Benefits
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering service are classified as short-
term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, 
wages, short-term compensated absences, 
performance incentives etc., and the expected cost 
of bonus, ex-gratia are recognised during the period 
in which the employee renders related service.
	
(i)	
Defined benefit plans
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) 
covering eligible employees. The Gratuity 
Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation 
or termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee’s salary and 
the tenure of employment with the Company.
Liabilities with regard to Gratuity Plan are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by 
an independent actuary, at each balance sheet 
date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained 
liabilities to the Ajanta Pharma Limited Group 
Gratuity Trust (the Trust). Trustees administer 
contributions made to the Trust and contributions 
are invested in a scheme with Life Insurance

The retirement benefit obligations recognised 
in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any 
asset resulting from this calculation is limited 
to the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
The Company recognises the net obligation of 
a defined benefit plan in its balance sheet as 
an asset or liability. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the other comprehensive 
income for the period in which they occur. The 
effect of any plan amendments are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
	
(ii)	 Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised as expense when employees have 
rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Company pays provident fund contributions 
to publicly administered provident funds as per 
local regulations. The Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are 
accounted for as defined contribution plans and 
the contributions are recognised as employee 
benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the 
extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available.
	
(iii)	 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated 
absences which are both accumulating and 
non-accumulating in nature. The expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences 
is determined by actuarial valuation performed 
by an independent actuary at each balance 
sheet date using projected unit credit method 
on the additional amount expected to be paid/
availed within twelve months as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected 
to occur within twelve months after the end of 
the period in which the employee renders the 
related services are recognised as a liability 
at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognised in the period in which 
the absences occur.
	
(iv)	 Share-based compensation
Employees Stock Options Plans (“ESOPs”): 
The grant date fair value of options granted 
to employees is recognised as an employee 
expense, over the period that the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The expense is recorded for each separately 
vesting portion of the award as if the award 
was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase 
in equity recognised in connection with share-
based payment transaction is presented as a 
separate component in equity under “Employee 
Stock Options Outstanding Reserve”. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of stock options that vest. 
The options granted to employees of subsidiary 
is recognised as an equity investment.
The Company recognises compensation 
expense relating to share-based payments in 
net profit using fair-value in accordance with Ind 
AS 102, Share-Based Payment.
6.12 Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of an asset 
that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing 
costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange 
differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment 
to the borrowing costs.
6.13 Leases
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of 
leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of 
a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves 
the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from use of 
the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the 
Company recognises a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) 
and a corresponding lease liability for all lease 
arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for 
leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-
term and low value leases, the Company recognises 
the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to 
extend or terminate the lease before the end of the 
lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes 
these options when it is reasonably certain that they 
will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognised at 
cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the 
commencement date on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the 
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-
in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis 
unless the asset does not generate cash flows that 
are largely independent of those from other assets. 
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortised 
cost at the present value of the future lease 
payments. The lease payments are discounted using 
the generally accepted interest rate. Lease liabilities 
are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to 
the related right of use asset if the Company changes 
its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension 
or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately 
presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments 
have been classified as financing cash flows.
Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified 
as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is 
classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
In respect of assets given on operating lease, lease 
rentals are accounted in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss, on accrual basis in accordance with the 
respective lease agreements.
6.14 Government Grants
Government grants are initially recognised as deferred 
income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Company will 
comply with the conditions associated with the grant;
•	 In case of capital grants, they are then recognised 
in Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss as other 
income on a systematic basis over the useful life 
of the asset.
•	 In case of grants that compensate the Company 
for expenses incurred are recognised in Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis 
in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
6.15 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed 
by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of equity shares considered for deriving basic 
earnings per equity share and also the weighted 
average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential 
equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are 
adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity 
shares been actually issued at fair value. Dilutive 
potential equity shares are deemed converted as of 
the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later 
date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined

respectively. Current income tax for current and prior 
periods is recognised at the amount expected to be 
paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using 
the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 
by the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised for all temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured using tax rates and tax laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary 
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income 
tax assets and liabilities is recognised as income or 
expense in the period that includes the enactment 
or the substantive enactment date. A deferred 
income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences 
and tax losses can be utilised. The Company offsets 
current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where 
it has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts and where it intends either to 
settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
6.17 Dividends to Shareholders
Annual dividend distribution to the shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the shareholders. Any 
interim dividend paid is recognised on approval by 
Board of Directors. Dividend payable is recognised 
directly in equity.
6.18 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, Contingent 
Assets and Commitments
	
General:
Provisions (legal and constructive) are recognised 
when the Company has a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable 
estimate can be made.
Provisions (excluding retirement benefits and 
compensated absences) are not discounted to its 
present value and are determined based on best 
estimate required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimates.
If there is any expectation that some or all of the 
provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating 
to a provision is presented in the statement of profit 
and loss net of any virtually certain reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, when appropriate, the risk specific to the 
liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.
Contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
•	 A present obligation arising from past events, when 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation;
•	 A present obligation arising from past events, when 
no reliable estimates is possible;
•	 A possible obligation arising from past events, 
unless the probability of outflow of resources 
is remote.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed 
in the standalone financial statements. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
financial statements.
Commitments include the amount of purchase order 
(net of advances) issued to parties for completion of 
assets and Non-cancellable operating lease.
Provisions, contingent liabilities, contingent assets 
and commitments are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date.
6.19 Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures financial instruments, such 
as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet 
date in accordance with Ind AS 113.
Financials Statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for the following material 
items in the statement of financial position:
•	 Derivative financial instruments (mainly forward 
currency contracts) are measured at fair value 
received from Bank.
•	 Mutual Funds are measured at fair values as per 
Net Asset Value (NAV).
•	 Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) at fair values 
as per Black Scholes option pricing model.
Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or settle a liability in an ordinary 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured 
using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its 
highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are 
appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is 
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
•	 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
•	 Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company 
determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company 
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on 
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.

Although the analysis does not take into account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide 
an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. The estimate of future increase in compensation levels, considered in 
the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such 
as supply and demand in the employment market.
47.3 Leave Encashment
The Company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated and encashed 
as per the Company’s policies. The liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has been provided based 
on report of independent actuary using “Projected Unit Credit Method”.
Accordingly, H 33.07 Crore (Previous Year H 27.14 Crore) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences as 
per actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.
48. Share-Based Payments
Company has established “Employee Stock Options Scheme 2011” (‘ESOP-2011’) and “Share-based Incentive Plan 2019” 
as approved in earlier year by the shareholders of the Company and Compensation committee of Board of Directors 
for key Employees of the Group. The options issued under the above scheme vest in a phased manner.

Valuation of Stock Options
The fair value of stock options granted during the period has been measured using the Black–Scholes option pricing 
model at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, 
expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. They key inputs and assumptions used are as follows:
Share price: The closing price on NSE as on the date of grant has been considered for valuing the options granted.
Exercise Price: Exercise Price is the market price or face value or such other price as determined by the Remuneration 
and Compensation Committee.
Expected Volatility: The historical volatility of the stock till the date of grant has been considered to calculate the fair 
value of the options.
Expected Option Life: Expected Life of option is the period for which the Company expects the options to be live. The 
minimum life of a stock option is the minimum period before which the options cannot be exercised and the maximum 
life is the period after which the options cannot be exercised.
Expected dividends: Expected dividend yield has been calculated as an average of dividend yields for four years 
preceding the date of the grant.
Risk free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate on the date of grant considered for the calculation is the interest 
rate applicable for a maturity equal to the expected life of the options based on the zero-coupon yield curve for 
Government Securities.
These assumptions reflect management’s best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties 
based on market conditions generally outside of the Company’s control. As a result, if other assumptions had been 
used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if 
management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially 
impacted in future years. The Company has granted stock options to employees of a subsidiary, the estimated fair 
value of stock options issued are included in the carrying value of the investment in the said subsidiary on a straight-
line basis over the requisite service period of each separately vesting portion of the award.

Fair Value Hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments 
that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining 
fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.

Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes mutual funds that 
have declared buyback NAV. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like Mark to market derivatives and 
Non-convertible market link debenture) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable 
market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value as 
instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in 
level 3. 
Measurement of Fair Values:
Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs:
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 & Level 3 fair values, for financial instruments

Risk Management Framework
Company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk 
management framework. Management is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company’s risk management 
policies, under the guidance of Audit Committee.
Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by it, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. Company, through its training and 
procedures aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand 
their roles and obligations.
Company’s Audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk management 
policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced 
by the Company. The Audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both 
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the 
Audit committee. 
i.	
Credit Risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily 
trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and mutual funds, foreign 
exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

a)	
Trade Receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures 
and control relating to customer credit risk management. Trade receivables, which are non-interest bearing, are 
mainly from stockists, distributors and customers and are generally on 14 days to 270 days credit term excluding 
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company has no 
concentration of credit risk as the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically.
As at 31 March 2024, Company had 32 customers, excluding wholly-owned subsidiaries (31 March 2023: 37 
customers) that owed the Company more than H 0.50 Crore each and accounted for approximately 27% and 26% 
respectively of the total outstanding as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.
	
Expected Credit Loss Assessment
As per simplified approach, the Company makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivable using a 
provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payment and make appropriate provision at each reporting date 
wherever required. The trend of the bad debts is negligible.

b)	
Financial Instruments
Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in liquid securities issued by mutual funds having a credit 
ranking of at least 3 and above from CRISIL or equivalent rating agency. Company monitors changes in credit risk 
by tracking published external credit ranking. Based on its on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company 
adjusts its exposure to various counterparties.
ii.	
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral 
obligations without incurring unacceptable losses. The Company’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum 
levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements. The Company closely monitors its liquidity position 
and deploys a robust cash management system. It maintains adequate sources of financing including bilateral 
loans, debt, and overdraft from banks at an optimised cost. Working capital requirements are adequately 
addressed by internally generated funds. Trade receivables are kept within manageable levels.
Company aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments 
at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities over the next six months. The ratio of cash 
and cash equivalents and other highly marketable debt investments to outflows is 0.62 at 31 March 2024 (0.86 at 
31 March 2023).
	
Exposure to liquidity Risk
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are

iii.	
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices 
– will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, and 
derivative financial instruments.
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange 
contracts to manage its exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations. All such transactions are carried out within 
the guidelines set by the risk management committee.
	
Sensitivity Analysis on Interest rate
The Company’s fixed rate bank deposits and securities are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flow will 
fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.

Sensitivity Analysis on Equity prices
The Company has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds. The value of investment in these 
mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the Asset Management Company 
on daily basis. The Company has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated 
fluctuations in their NAV as in management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture.
iv.	 Currency Risk
Company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, 
purchases and borrowings are denominated and the functional currency of Company. The currencies in which 
these transactions are primarily denominated are US dollars, Australian dollars, Great Britain Pound and Euro.
At any point in time, Company covers foreign currency risk by taking appropriate percentage of its foreign currency 
exposure, as approved by risk management committee in line with the laid down policy approved by the Board. 
Company uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one 
year from the reporting date. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, 
the Company’s policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign 
currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.

from contract with customers is from sale of manufactured goods. Sale of goods are made at a point in time and revenue 
is recognised upon satisfaction of the performance obligations which is typically upon dispatch/delivery. The Company 
has a credit evaluation policy based on which the credit limits for the trade receivables are established. There is no 
significant financing component as the credit period provided by the Company is not significant.
