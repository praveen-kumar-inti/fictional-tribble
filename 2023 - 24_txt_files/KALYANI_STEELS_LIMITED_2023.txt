Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage 
and implementation.	
	
Yes, the Company acknowledges the importance of effective water resource management both inside and outside 
of its operational sites. The Company is committed to improving water use efficiency while ensuring that water is 
available to all stakeholders. The Company, at its plant at Hospet, operates a Wastewater Treatment System which 
treats 100% of waste water into re-usable water. The treated wastewater is then used to reduce the consumption 
of freshwater and also used in various areas of the Plant like recreational garden. As a result the company operates 
on Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD).
