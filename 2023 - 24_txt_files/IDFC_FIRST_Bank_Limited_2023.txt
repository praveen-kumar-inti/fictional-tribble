definition of worker.
	
Also, a core tenet of the Bank’s people policy is the equal treatment of its employees, and zero discrimination based 
on gender, religion or social background. This is also extended to employee compensation, rewards and benefits.
	
Over the past two years, the Bank has progressively increased women participation in its workforce, and this metric is 
stronger for the younger workforce and for new hires. The Bank has stringent policies, processes and initiatives that it 
has rolled out, to ensure a truly diverse and inclusive workplace.

22.	 Turnover rate for permanent employees:
The Bank took many initiatives during the year, including technical training, managerial effectiveness improvement 
training, better onboarding of new joiners, skill building, cross functional mobility, feedback mechanism from employees, 
recognition programs, working on collaborative aspects of culture and calendarized employee connect programs for 
engagement. The Bank provided career progression, growth opportunities, compensation correction and recognition 
to employees. The Bank also delivered over 20 lakh learning hours during the year. 
Considering the breakup of our staff composition, 29% of the Bank staff are in rural locations. The Bank does not 
outsource business, collections, operations or servicing in rural locations, so that better control is ensured. The Bank 
was short in Priority Sector Lending and had to expand Rural Banking to meet its PSL franchise. 
28% of the Bank’s staff are in Branch Banking and are largely focused on servicing customers, relationship management 
and in building the deposit franchise.  
6% of the staff are engaged in providing service to customers like contact centers. 5% of our staff is in underwriting, 
5% in collections and 4% in operations. This constitutes 77% of the overall headcount in the Bank.
These divisions largely have people in Account Opening and basic servicing roles and the median age is 28.7 years. 
These age groups usually have higher attrition because of fungibility of skills across industries such as sales roles in 
retail chains, telecom, platform companies, BPOs in the booming Indian service industries. 
Attrition reduces with seniority and has meaningfully reduced over the last year FY 24 because of dedicated action at 
the Bank’s end. The attrition in Junior Management roles reduced from 30.6% in FY 23 to 22.2% in FY 24. In Middle 
Management it has reduced from 18.6% in FY 23 to 12% in FY 24. In Senior Management attrition reduced from 10.7% 
in FY 23 to 9% in FY 24.
In new age skills, such as engineering, data science, data analytics and technology, attrition is low at 10% as the Bank 
is becoming a preferred place for working with new technologies. Attrition is also low in Corporate Functions and Risk 
Management Divisions.

very highly and intends that the Board of Directors

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices

Being a financial services company, waste generation is very limited. The Bank has taken adequate steps to minimise 
the disposal waste quantum through its operations. All recyclable waste collected at branches is separated (dry and 
wet waste). The waste is then handed over to an authorised waste processor. Digitisation and automation have helped 
implement paperless processes, reduced consumption of paper through e-statements and e-receipts to customers 
and reduced paper procurements. The Bank has empaneled certified vendors for managing its e-waste. The Bank has 
also adopted a strategy to radically reduce plastic consumables across its offices by eliminating plastic consumables 
and switching to reusable or sustainably sourced alternatives wherever possible.
