1
Climate 
Change 
(Environment)
R
Risk: Climate change, mainly caused 
by human activities, continues to impact 
the environment and the construction 
sector. As a company involved in project 
management and construction, NBCC’s 
operations contribute to greenhouse 
gas emissions, which add to these 
challenges. Climate change can affect 
the performance and durability of 
buildings, leading to higher maintenance 
needs and risks for occupants. It also 
brings 
changing 
weather 
patterns, 
which create challenges in energy use, 
building design, and planning.
NBCC implements energy management 
practices, 
including 
regular 
energy 
audits and the use of renewable energy, 
to reduce the risk of exceeding projected 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Tree 
plantation initiatives are undertaken in 
line with relevant statutory requirements 
to support environmental sustainability 
and contribute to ecological balance.
Air pollution monitoring is carried out at 
all project sites to ensure compliance 
with legal standards and to improve 
ambient 
air 
quality. 
NBCC 
also 
monitors and reports GHG emissions 
regularly to evaluate progress and 
identify opportunities for continuous 
improvement.
Negative financial 
implication
2
Waste 
Management 
(Environment)
O / R
Opportunity: 
Waste 
management 
presents a valuable opportunity for 
NBCC, offering environmental benefits 
such as reduced pollution, resource 
conservation, and potential for recycling 
and waste-to-energy initiatives. It also 
brings economic gains through cost 
savings, regulatory compliance, and 
job 
creation. 
Strengthening 
waste 
management practices supports public 
health and encourages innovation in 
climate action. As NBCC is in the early 
stages of assessing its waste inputs 
and outputs, there is a clear opportunity 
to 
enhance 
existing 
systems 
and 
implement more sustainable waste 
solutions.
Risk: At the same time, improper waste 
management 
poses 
environmental 
and health risks, including pollution, 
contamination of natural resources, 
and contribution to climate change. 
Addressing these risks is essential 
to 
safeguard 
ecosystems, 
ensure 
regulatory compliance, and protect 
community well-being.
NBCC adopts solid waste management 
(SWM) practices to effectively handle 
waste generated across its operations. 
Emphasis 
is 
placed 
on 
waste 
segregation at the source, supported 
by regular monitoring and accurate 
record-keeping to ensure compliance, 
traceability, 
and 
improved 
waste 
handling efficiency.

Water 
Management 
(Environment)
O / R
Opportunity: 
Embracing 
water 
management 
practices 
allows 
construction companies like NBCC to 
differentiate themselves in the market, 
attract 
environmentally 
conscious 
clients, and demonstrate a commitment 
to innovation and sustainability. It 
also strengthens business resilience 
by improving water efficiency across 
project sites and supports adaptation 
to the challenges posed by climate 
change, especially in water-stressed 
regions where NBCC operates.
Risk: Construction activities such as site 
development, excavation, and material 
use can significantly impact local water 
resources and ecosystems, highlighting 
the need for effective environmental and 
water management strategies. Without 
proper controls, these impacts can lead 
to resource depletion, pollution, and 
non-compliance 
with 
environmental 
regulations.
NBCC 
recognises 
the 
importance 
of using water wisely, especially in 
construction activities where demand 
can be high. The Company is working 
towards adopting more sustainable 
practices and water-saving technologies 
at its project sites. It also keeps track 
of water consumption and withdrawals, 
and 
wherever 
possible, 
looks 
for 
practical ways to reduce usage, as well 
as to reuse and recycle water. These 
efforts help lower the impact on local 
water resources and support long-term 
environmental sustainability.
Positive/ 
Negative financial 
implication.
4
Health & Safety 
(Social)
R
Risk: At NBCC, ensuring the health and 
safety of the workforce is a core priority. 
While comprehensive safety guidelines 
are already in place to maintain a safe 
working environment, there is a need to 
enhance and update existing systems 
and practices to address evolving risks 
more effectively. Strengthening these 
areas is important to prevent potential 
health and safety incidents and to 
maintain a safe, reliable workplace 
for 
everyone 
involved 
in 
NBCC’s 
operations.
NBCC has initiated the implementation 
of ISO 45001: Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System, which will 
help strengthen the safety framework 
across its operations and keep safety-
related risks under control. In addition, 
efforts are being made to enhance 
existing systems by establishing a 
formal grievance mechanism, supported 
by dedicated grievance policies and 
standard 
operating 
procedures, 
to 
ensure that health and safety concerns 
are addressed in a structured and timely 
manner.
Negative financial

5
Employee 
Engagement 
& Well-Being 
(Social)
O
Opportunity: NBCC provides employee 
benefits 
in 
line 
with 
applicable 
government norms. However, there 
is an opportunity to further enhance 
employee support through additional 
training and awareness programs. By 
focusing on key topics aligned with the 
National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles, 
NBCC aims to empower its workforce 
and strengthen its commitment to 
responsible 
and 
ethical 
business 
practices.

Positive financial

Community 
Development 
(Social)
O
Opportunity: NBCC has the potential 
to 
strengthen 
its 
corporate 
social 
responsibility by actively engaging in 
initiatives that benefit local communities. 
Such involvement can lead to meaningful 
stakeholder 
engagement, 
including 
building 
relationships 
with 
local 
authorities, nonprofit organizations, and 
community members. These connections 
can 
support 
regulatory 
compliance, 
enhance reputation, help attract and 
retain talent, open doors to new markets 
and clients, and encourage collaboration 
and innovation in project execution.

Opportunity: 
Prioritizing

It helps reduce risks, attract top talent, 
and build lasting customer trust. Ethical 
conduct also strengthens stakeholder

practices, NBCC can establish a strong 
foundation for long-term growth and

Risk: 
Implementing

that 
NBCC 
must address. These include supplier

NBCC (India) Limited’s POSH Policy ensures a safe and respectful workplace for women by preventing and addressing 
sexual harassment. The policy applies to all employees, including temporary and contract workers, and covers incidents

reliefs such as transferring the aggrieved woman or the respondent to another workplace within the organization to 
ensure a safe environment. The aggrieved woman may also be granted a leave of absence of up to three months, in

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
NBCC (India) Limited uses a dual grievance redressal system comprising its internal Grievance Redressal SOP and 
the government’s CPGRAMS platform. The internal SOP outlines a transparent and structured process for addressing 
grievances from both internal stakeholders (employees, senior management) and external stakeholders (contractors, 
vendors, customers). It defines reporting channels, escalation levels, and timelines, ensuring accountability and 
proper documentation. Internal grievances can be reported verbally, in writing, or via email, escalating up to the Chief 
Grievance Redressal Officer (CGRO) if unresolved. External grievances follow a similar process through written 
communication or email.
	
In parallel, NBCC also addresses public grievances through CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and 
Monitoring System), a government portal used to receive, track, and act on complaints from the general public and 
communities. Relevant departments review each case and take appropriate action, supporting transparency and 
responsiveness.
