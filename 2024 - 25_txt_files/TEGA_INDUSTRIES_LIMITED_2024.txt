prevention strategies, could make 
Tega vulnerable to potential IT 
system failures and the ever-evolving 
cyber threat landscape.
 Opportunity
As Tega advances its 
digital transformation and 
global operations, the 
cyber threat landscape 
is evolving rapidly. 
Despite robust security 
measures, emerging 
threats with advanced 
capabilities require a 
shift from reactive to 
proactive, intelligence-
led risk management. To 
protect digital systems 
and safeguard business 
continuity, Tega must 
continuously enhance its 
cybersecurity posture, 
ensuring it remains 
resilient, adaptive, and 
aligned with strategic 
goals.

consequences. Tega’s 
growing operations 
across multiple

exposure to varying data 
protection laws asks for a 
strategic approach.

Transitioning to renewable and low-carbon energy sources by scaling up renewable energy i.e. solar power 
installation upto 1 MWp by 2027 
 
 
Pursuing a net-zero emissions trajectory and targeting reduction of absolute GHG emission (Scope 1 & 
Scope 2) upto 20% by FY’30 from the FY’24
 
 
Exploring and enhancing material circularity by increasing the proportion of recycled material content 
in our raw material input and reducing throwaway from the end of life products
TIL is steadfast in its dedication to fostering sustainable development, closely aligning with TIL’s overarching 
vision of contributing meaningfully to nation-building through our initiative SAVE – Sustainably Adding Value 
through Engineering. 
Reflecting our focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) imperatives, TIL has instituted a 
comprehensive ESG Framework characterized by clearly articulated goals and performance indicators. 
We maintain rigorous review and oversight of our progress against these objectives to ensure sustained 
accountability and the fulfilment of our long-term commitments.
TIL has proactively identified a wide array of material risks and opportunities, in consultation with both internal 
and external stakeholders. In continuation to the Stakeholder engagement exercise, TIL is in the process of 
crafting clearly defined commitments, forward-looking strategic goals, and quantifiable targets across the ESG 
spectrum. These objectives are being shaped through an inclusive stakeholder engagement process, ensuring 
that our sustainability roadmap reflects both stakeholder priorities and National/International best practices.

TIL has appropriate processes and procedures that have been established to receive and redress grievances from employees 
(permanent & non-permanent) and workers (permanent & non-permanent). Currently at TIL the mechanism to capture grievances 
of the employees comprises of whistle-blower mechanism and the POSH, both of which have board approved policies and 
procedures implemented. 
	
The mechanism of whistle-blower comprises of lodging of complaints by the employee within 30 days after becoming aware of 
the incident, which is then investigated by the vigilance officer followed by submission of the same to the vigilance committee. The 
committee then conducts an internal audit, wherein if unethical & improper act is concluded by the committee, then the audit 
committee enforces disciplinary or corrective action. 
	
The mechanism of POSH comprises of lodging of detailed complain along with documentary evidence, if available. Post receipt of 
the complaint and prior to initiating the inquiry, the committee take steps to conciliate the complaint between the complainant and 
the respondent. During inquiry all the proceedings are documented, and the committee interviews the respondent separately and 
impartially. Committee states exactly what the allegation is and who has made the allegation. The respondent is given full opportunity 
to respond and provide any evidence, etc. Detailed notes of the meetings are prepared which may be shared with the respondent and 
Tega Industries Limited

complainant upon request. Any witnesses produced by the respondent are also interviewed & statements are taken. Post the inquiry 
the committee submits its report containing the findings and recommendations to the employer, within 10 days of completion of the 
inquiry. Appropriate steps are taken depending on whether the complaint is unsubstantiated or substantiated. 
	
To receive and redress the grievances of workers currently there are two mechanisms – the first mechanism comprises of the 
workers registering complaints directly with the plant HR or departmental supervisor or the plant head, which is then subsequently 
investigated and addressed. The second mechanism comprises of suggestion boxes which are available at all the manufacturing 
facilities. Each month the suggestions submitted in the boxes are reviewed by the internal committee of the plants and appropriate 
measures are taken to address the concerns/suggestions submitted by the workers

1.	 Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the board on economic, 
environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such 
consultations provided to the board.
	
As a step forward in sustainability journey, Tega identified and reached out to multiple stakeholders and conducted a fairly 
comprehensive materiality assessment exercise in FY 2024-2025 to identify its focus areas. With a long-term plan on sustainability 
and non-financial reporting, Tega applies a Double Materiality assessment approach to systematically identify and prioritize its material 
matters based on concerns and expectations identified through engagement and consultation with the stakeholders. The process for 
consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics is the Stakeholder Engagement 
& Consultation and Sustainability based Materiality Assessment Framework (SEC & SMAF). The process comprises of 
the following stages –
 
 
Identification of Key stakeholder groups (internal and external) through appropriate weightage in terms of economic, social and 
environmental impacts considering both impact of the stakeholder on business and the impact of the business on the stakeholder.
 
 
Development and circulation of appropriate questionnaires amongst key stakeholder groups identified to identify issues/
concerns material to the business, from stakeholder’s perspective.
 
 
Identification of material KPI’s through Sustainability based Materiality Assessment framework (SMAF).
 
 
Communication of the material KPIs identified, and feedback received from the stakeholders to the Board.
	
TIL has a Stakeholder Engagement committee to consult with stakeholders and receive feedback from them and the feedback 
received is further communicated to the board. 
2.	 Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management 
of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how 
the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and 
activities of the entity.
	
Stakeholder consultation is also one of the important tool in facilitating the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics. The materiality assessment process is adopted for identification of environmental, social and governance topics that 
are matters of concern/expectations to stakeholders and the business. In accordance with identified topics the management and 
the Board at TIL incorporates components in policy statements and procedures to address the concerns raised and accordingly 
formulates pathways for mitigation/adaptation of the concerns raised and or for capitalizing the opportunities identified.
3.	 Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns 
of vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
Tega actively engages in consultations with vulnerable and marginalized segments of society as an integral component of its Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Constructive feedback from these target groups is systematically gathered and incorporated 
into the design, planning, and execution of CSR programs, ensuring that the interventions are tailored to effectively address the 
specific needs and aspirations of the intended beneficiaries.

TIL has instituted a suite of internal policies and procedural frameworks aimed at upholding and addressing issues related to human 
rights. Among these are well-established mechanisms such as the Whistleblower Policy and the Policy on Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH), which serve as primary tools for grievance redressal and safeguarding employee dignity. In addition to these 
foundational policies, supplementary standards and frameworks have been adopted to ensure a comprehensive approach to human 
rights due diligence and protection. Key elements of these initiatives are outlined below:
	
(a)	 Whistleblower policy
	
	
TIL is steadfast in its commitment to conducting its operations with utmost fairness, transparency, and ethical integrity. Adhering 
to the highest standards of professionalism and honesty, the Whistleblower Policy provides a formal avenue for employees and 
stakeholders to confidentially report any instance of unethical conduct, suspected fraud, or violations of the TIL’s Code of 
Conduct. While this policy is a statutory requirement, it also reflects the organization’s proactive stance in fostering a culture 
of accountability and ethical behaviour.\
	
(b)	 POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) policy
	
	
TIL is deeply committed to cultivating a work environment across all its locations that promotes mutual respect, safety, and 
harmonious professional relationships. TIL unequivocally upholds the dignity of all individuals, irrespective of gender, role, or 
hierarchical position, and expects all employees to demonstrate responsible and respectful conduct. In alignment with the

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for zero liquid discharge? If yes, provide details of 
its coverage and implementation.
	
The company has undertaken a proactive and strategic approach toward achieving Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) status across 
its operations. A series of targeted projects and technological interventions have been initiated with the objective of minimizing 
wastewater discharge and maximizing water reuse. Notably, the Dahej facility is already equipped with treatment facilities required 
for a fully functional ZLD system, demonstrating the TIL’s commitment to sustainable water management. The Dahej unit is having 
Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) systems, enabling end-to-end treatment and reuse of industrial and 
domestic wastewater streams. 
	
As part of the broader implementation strategy, all sites wherein ZLD is legally, technically and operationally applicable have been 
comprehensively identified and brought under the purview of these sustainability-driven initiatives.  
	
In parallel, the Samali facility has also been equipped with state-of-the-art, package-type STPs with a treatment capacity of 16 KLD 
(kilolitres per day). These systems are fully operational and facilitate the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable purposes such 
as landscaping and utility cleaning. This integrated approach not only ensures regulatory compliance but also exemplifies the TIL’s 
broader commitment to responsible water stewardship and sustainable resource utilization.

Principle 9: Businesses Should Engage with and Provide Value to Their Consumers 
in a Responsible Manner.
1.	 Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and 
feedback: 
	
In the event of a product-related issue, the respective Branch or Product Manufacturing Group (PMG) initiates a Product Problem 
Report (PPR) within the Tega Apps system on behalf of the customer. This serves to escalate the concern by submitting a structured 
report, containing detailed information, to the Customer Complaints Manager (CCM). Upon receipt of the PPR, a preliminary 
evaluation is conducted to determine whether a Free Replacement Order (FRO) is warranted. If deemed necessary, the FRO is 
promptly approved and actioned by the relevant department. 
	
Subsequently, documentation from various functional units including PMG, Technical Sales Services (TSS), Drafting and Design, 
Manufacturing, Quality Assurance, and the Branch (particularly in installation-related cases) is consolidated to facilitate a 
comprehensive case review. A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is then conducted in collaboration with all concerned departments to 
identify the underlying cause of the issue. 
	
Following the RCA, suitable and effective corrective and containment measures are identified and uploaded into the system, clearly 
assigning responsibility to the respective department. This marks the conclusion of the Customer Complaints Management (CCM) 
phase of the Product Problem Report (PPR) process. 
	
To ensure long-term resolution and continuous improvement, the CCM team subsequently reviews and audits the implementation 
and effectiveness of the Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA), thereby evaluating the sustainability of the corrective 
measures adopted.
