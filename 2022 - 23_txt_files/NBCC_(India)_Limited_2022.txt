Climate Change 
(Environment)
R
Risk - Scientific consensus confirms 
that climate change is primarily caused 
by human activities and has significant 
implications. The construction sector, 
including 
the 
NBCC’s 
activities, 
contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, 
which 
exacerbate 
climate 
change. 
Climate change can directly impact 
building performance, increasing risks 
to occupants and maintenance costs. 
Additionally, changing microclimates 
pose challenges to building design and 
energy consumption.
- Adopting energy 
management 
strategies 
to mitigate 
exceeding risk of 
GHG emissions 
(Energy audits, 
renewable energy, 
etc.)
- Tree Plantation 
initiatives as 
per applicable 
statutes.

Risk-
Information Technology (IT) security is 
a critical aspect of any organization's 
operations. Failing to adequately protect 
digital assets and data can result in various 
risks and potential consequences. There may 
be some key risks in IT security such as Data 
breaches, cyber attacks, Outdated software 
and patch management, Inadequate Access 
controls, Lack of Encryption, Data loss etc. 
which can be prevented by Robust Internal 
Controls and Audits.
By taking adequate

establishing robust 
internal controls 
and timely audit 
processes, IT 
Security related risks 
may be prevented.

NBCC primarily engages in the construction and infrastructure development 
sector, undertaking a wide range of projects, including residential complexes, 
office buildings, hospitals, educational institutions, and infrastructure 
projects. NBCC aims to propel all its operations with evolving sustainability 
standards and implement them effectively to contribute to a greener and 
more eco-friendly built environment. This includes adopting green building

strengthen our operations, we have embraced ISO 27001 certification. Moving 
forward, we aspire to enhance and reinforce our governance and social 
pillars through the implementation of a series of ISO standards. Through our

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
The grievance redressal mechanism of POSH for NBCC (India) Limited involves a structured process for addressing 
complaints of sexual harassment. Any person who experiences or witnesses sexual harassment can file a written 
complaint with the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). An investigation is then conducted, ensuring confidentiality 
and protection for all parties involved. Additionally, the Company has a well-established Central Grievance Committee to 
handle the grievances of employees including Human Rights issues. The committee is independent in nature and handle 
grievances as expeditiously as possible.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complaints in discrimination and harassment cases.  
 
To prevent any adverse consequences for complainants in discrimination and harassment cases at our office in India, 
we take several proactive measures. First and foremost, we have established clear and comprehensive policies against 
discrimination and harassment, which are communicated to all employees. We believe in fostering awareness among 
our team, so we conduct regular training sessions to educate everyone about what constitutes unacceptable behavior 
and the importance of treating each other with respect. To ensure a fair and unbiased process, we have set up an 
Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) comprising well-trained members who handle such cases with sensitivity and 
confidentiality. Additionally, we provide an anonymous reporting mechanism, allowing employees to come forward 
without fear of reprisal.
