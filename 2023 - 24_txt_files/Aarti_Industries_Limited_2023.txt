Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
As a responsible chemical 
manufacturing company, 
we are cognisant of our 
responsibility to safeguard 
the health and safety of 
individuals. AIL strives to 
prevent injury by sustaining 
an injury-free workplace with 
a mindset of zero tolerance 
towards any incident or 
injury.
Health impact or injury 
during working may lead to 
financial implications and 
reputation loss to AIL. Any 
accident may also impact 
the morale of the workers 
leading to production 
losses. Non adherence to 
OHS requirement may also 
lead to fines and penalties
We have developed and adopted 
a robust, comprehensive, and 
reliable Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System under 
Aarti Management System. All our 
employees, contract employees 
and visitors are covered under our 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System. Process safety 
and risk management, Emergency 
mitigation system.
In addition we have implemented 
following safety interventions across 
our manufacturing locations:
•	
Plant-level initiatives such as 
daily toolbox talk, monthly 
awareness sessions, etc.
•	
Process safety is managed 
through process management 
guidelines. Risk assessment 
is carried out through HAZOP, 
HIRA, QRA and chemical 
exposure study. JCC is also 
done to check the adherence to 
SOP, other than these regular 
third party audit through external 
auditor (expert in the field) is 
done to identify process risks

Waste 
management
Risk
Waste generated from 
our operations consists 
of hazardous as well as 
non-hazardous waste. 
Environmental Impact due 
to improper disposal of 
these waste is a compliance 
as well as regulatory risk. 
It may lead to fines and 
penalties from regulatory 
authorities
Our waste management approach 
is systematically divided into three 
priorities depending upon the various 
operating conditions and type of 
waste generated.
Primary pollution, waste prevention 
and our priority to reduce hazardous 
wastes are:
•	
Change 
industrial 
process 
to 
eliminate 
use 
of 
harmful chemicals
•	
Use less of a harmful / product
•	
Reduce packaging materials 
in products
•	
Change industrial processes to 
reduce or eliminate hazardous 
waste production
Secondary pollution and waste 
prevention and second priority to 
reduce Hazardous or Non-Hazardous 
wastes are:
•	
Reuse
•	
Recovery
•	
Recycle
•	
Repair
•	
Buy reusable and 
recyclable products
Last Priority – Treatment & disposal 
of all our waste:
•	
Treating waste to reduce toxicity
•	
Incinerate waste
•	
Waste in landfills

Climate 
change and 
Governance
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
There are risks associated 
with climate change such 
as manufacturing losses 
due to climate events, 
restrictions due to existing 
and emerging regulations 
leading to reputational 
damage.
Opportunity:
Reduction of carbon 
emissions by the 
deployment of technologies, 
collaboration with other 
peers and industries, etc
We are in the process of embedding 
climate action governance across 
the firm and defining the roles and 
responsibilities of individuals in 
assessing and managing climate-
related risks and opportunities. We 
also plan to integrate the process of 
addressing climate-related issues 
when reviewing and guiding strategy, 
risk management policies, annual 
budgets, monitoring implementation 
and performance, and overseeing 
major capital expenditures, 
acquisitions, and divestitures.

make efforts to build a satisfactory 
work culture that nurtures employee 
growth and increases employee 
satisfaction. We provide training 
and awareness programmes to our 
employees to ensure capacity building 
and skill upgradation across all levels. 
We also provide medical and non-

Positive
5
Human Rights
Risk
Human rights impact the 
business internally and 
externally from procurement 
of raw materials to 
distribution and disposal. 
It may also impact the 
reputation of the company 
and lead to regulatory non- 
compliances making this 
topic significant for AIL.
We have developed a comprehensive 
Human Rights due diligence 
framework for a systematic 
assessing of our operations. We have 
undertaken human right vulnerability 
assessment at our operation location 
for addressing human rights risks, 
mitigating impacts, and monitoring 
and reporting performance to 
substantiate our commitment to 
respect to Human rights in all our 
business operations. Responsibility 
of respecting human rights is also 
extended to our business partners in 
the form of their alignment with our 
policies, contract agreements.
Negative

Ethics and 
compliance
Risk
Negative brand reputation 
due to non-compliance 
with regulatory and legal 
requirements.
We have in place stringent and 
comprehensive Code of Conduct and 
policies to ensure ethical behaviour

IT security and 
data privacy
Risk
Enterprise risks associated 
with IT and cybersecurity 
such as Operational costs 
related to dealing with cyber 
crime, theft of sensitive 
information, non-compliance 
and fines and penalties.
We are building cybersecurity 
architecture through a layered defense 
approach. We are also undertaking 
Vulnerability Assessment and 
Penetration Testing (VAPT) of its IT 
Systems and Network Infrastructure 
with an intent of providing a safe and 
secure environment to its customers. 
We have taken several measures to 
protect its IT security systems and 
adhere to regulatory guidelines. We 
reported zero cases of data breaches 
and IT-related issues.
AIL has also obtained ISO 27001 
Information security management 
system certification for it R&D 
facility in Navi Mumbai, R&D office at 
Vadodara and the pilot plant at Vapi 
and we are in process of obtaining 
the same for various manufacturing 
locations this will reduce IT related 
risk of AIL.
Negative
8
Water and 
effluent
Risk
Water supply is important 
for our manufacturing 
locations, water scarcity 
can affect our operations 
leading to impact on 
revenue generation. 
Additionally, the probability 
of polluting a water resource 
and nearby habitat as a 
result of improper treatment 
or failure of technologies 
also poses a risk.
We have taken measures to ensure 
availability of water for our operations 
as well as the local communities 
through CSR initiatives. 11 out of 16 
of our locations are ZLD ready. We are 
in the process of reducing the amount 
of water being discharged from other 
locations. At the same time, we are 
also making process improvements 
such as recycling back condensate, 
RO permeate to reduce the volume 
effluent generated to decrease the 
requirement of freshwater as well 
as decrease the load on our effluent 
treatment plants
Negative

Energy 
Management
Opportunity
Leveraging renewable 
energy sources, adopting 
energy efficient solutions 
and reducing dependency 
on non-renewable sources 
for energy consumption 
will assist us in reducing 
the GHG emissions, 
improve resource efficiency, 
cost saving, cleaner 
environment etc.
We have adopted an IT-based Energy 
Management System (EnMS) 
for controlling, managing and 
conserving energy.
AIL has started receiving 13.2 MW of 
hybrid renewable energy.
We have regularized usage of 
Biomass for replacing coal gradually 
in order to reduce carbon emissions.
Based on our energy efficiency 
initiatives, we have saved approx. 6.3 
million KWH of energy in 2023-24.

Yes, we have developed and adopted a robust and comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System. All our employees, contract employees and visitors are covered under our Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System.
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
 
With commitment of Zero harm to our people and the environment, it becomes very essential that the hazards at the 
workplace are effectively assessed and managed. This also ensures reliability of our operations.
 
We have developed several tools to regularly evaluate potential workplace-related health and safety hazards and their 
risks. We deploy Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), a qualitative risk assessment tool for our routine 
activities.
 
Additionally, for non-routine tasks, we conduct Job Safety Analysis to identify and analyze job-related hazards. We then 
implement control measures to minimize risks. Safety audits are being conducted internally by deploying external 
subject matter experts to verify our control measures. These audits are documented, tracked, and reviewed regularly 
at various governance platforms.The concept of TACIT Knowledge for learning and development is introduced which 
enables safety capability building. To ensure inherent safe design and operation, we conduct process safety studies 
for existing and new projects, including Thermal Safety Studies (DSC, TSu, RC1e) and Powder Safety studies & also to 
ensure continual Risk reduction, process parameters validation, Criticality Class Study, SIL, QRA, and HAC studies are 
conducted.
 
Implementation of Risk based process safety through risk register & barrier management plant-wise top risk identified 
to monitor the healthiness of existing barriers.
 
External assessments and certifications further validate our commitment to excellence. At AIL, our unwavering 
dedication to health and safety assessment guarantees the wellbeing and protection of our valued employees and 
other relevant stakeholders.
 
The risk assessment process has helped us identify significant risks and ensure adequate control measures for 
managing them effectively.
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Yes/No)
 
Yes, To create a safe and supportive work environment, we have processes in place for workers to report work-related 
hazards and hazardous situations. We actively encourage incident reporting and investigation, allowing and recognising 
anyone in the plant to report unsafe conditions and unsafe acts for prompt action.

AIL fosters a culture of safety, accountability, and transparency, ultimately creating a safer and more productive work 
environment for all employees. We have established and implemented a clearly defined process for incident reporting 
and investigation of occupational injuries and illness. A well-defined incident investigation process helps to identify the 
critical factors that are involved in an incident. It also helps to take appropriate corrective actions to avoid such recurrence. 
The investigation is being carried out through the ‘5 Whys technique’ in which for each identified cause, the team asks 
“why” repeatedly to identify the root cause of the incident. It helps to cover the causes involving organizational, procedural, 
and systemic factors that may have contributed to the incident. We follow a hierarchy of controls to determine appropriate 
corrective measures.. The learnings from the incident investigation are shared with other locations for horizontal deployment.

The team of scientists studied the entire 
process to convert aromatic chlorides to the 
corresponding aromatic fluorides and the 
chemistry proposed the changes and validated 
its pilot plant before commercializing to convert 
the batch process to semi continuous.
The change has lead us to significant positive 
impact of product performance as wells as

Ammonolysis
Ammonolysis is one of the high-pressure 
reactions that is carried out in which one of the 
hazardous chemicals ammonia is used. We 
needed to reduce the batch cycle time (BCT) 
and its exposure.
The hydrodynamic/mixing study and kinetics 
study were conducted with the help of CFD 
software, alongside several pilot trials, aimed at 
reducing BCT.
These studies were conducted for this process 
using a unique software. Based on these 
studies several DOEs were proposed for Lab 
Trials at LCTM ensuring the alignment with 
the Process safety via systematic ARC & TSU 
studies. The proposed DOEs have changes 
in operating parameters like Temperature, 
mixing, Concentrations, etc & validated in the 
Pilot plant.
Through the power of process 
intensification studies, we were able 
to achieve a remarkable over 50% 
reduction in batch cycle time.

Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or 
adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.
 
As our raw materials are sources from oil and gas value chains which are highly energy intensive operations, we are cautious 
of the environmental impact arising from our value chain. In order to better understand the emission hotspot, we have 
conducted PCF studies for 80% of our goods and performed LCA for our 56.53% product by spending. Additionally, we have 
undertaken various initiatives to reduce emissions across our value chain and promote the use of a diverse energy mix.
