Risk
New laws related 
to environment 
(specifically climate 
related), CSR activities 
are being created and 
enforced. Adherence to 
these new laws poses 
challenge. 
Our EHS team understands the regulatory 
requirements to be complied with for the different 
legal requirements. They also seek help from 
the Compliance team to understand any specific 
compliance requirements that may be applicable. 
These areas are covered under the internal audit 
program from a compliance point of view as well. 
As part of sustainability reporting, independent 
assessments conducted (by external consultants/
experts) also help in addressing gaps if any in this 
area.

Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with 
regulatory requirements 
can manifest in financial 
and reputational 
consequences for an 
organisation and erode 
stakeholder trust.
The Company has a robust set of environmental, 
social and governance-related policies to foster 
a culture of compliance within the organisation. 
Disciplinary measures and reinforcement mechanisms 
have been defined as well.  The ESG organogram 
further highlights the importance of overall 
compliance by positioning the CS in a key role, 
ensuring overall corporate governance in all three 
verticals (ESG).  In addition, Legal and functional 
teams also monitor the regulatory compliances across 
businesses at defined frequencies. 
Negative Implications
3
Scarcity Of 
Water
Risk
Water is a shared 
resource, making it 
important for businesses 
to use it responsibly. 
Ensuring responsible 
consumption is key 
to the business’ social 
license to operate and 
a sustainable planet 
for all.
Mumbai and its suburban areas/adjoining districts 
receive good rainfall every year and ground 
water table is recharged.  The turbidity of water 
and the sulphate and iron content in water used 
for construction may pose a threat to quality of 
construction (corrosion etc). The cost of treatment 
of GW, procuring water and non-supply of municipal 
water will become a high-risk event in the future. 
KRL and its subsidiaries continues to adopt water 
conservation strategies across all of the existing 
project sites and also supplement internal water 
generation by procuring water from outside agencies.
Negative Implications
Water being an 
important resource in 
construction industry 
its scarcity may lead to 
disruptions in operations 
and delay timelines of 
project completion.  
Rainwater harvesting system has been implemented 
at few facilities which helps in increasing the ground 
level water. This results in release of sub soil water 
from recharge pits, and this reduces the dependency 
on external agencies.
The Company has instituted an EHS Policy that 
highlights the importance of Resource Conservation, 
this serves as a guiding principle to reduce consumption 
of water and other resources. The EHS team runs 
awareness campaigns to ensure that all personnel are 
aware of the risk related to water shortage.

Human Rights 
such as child 
labor, forced/
compulsory 
labor, health 
and safety, 
discrimination 
and freedom 
of association 
and collective 
bargaining 
including anti-
harassment
Risk
Upholding human 
rights is essential to 
protecting organization’s 
communities, 
employees and other 
stakeholders.
The Company has constituted a standing forum, both 
at the Group Level as well as at individual entity level, 
that aids and advises the management in its approach 
towards building sustainable Human Rights. Group 
HR is responsible to ensure that any issue or impact 
related to human rights are addressed in the defined 
manner within the stipulated timeline.  The Company 
has a robust contractor management system which 
ensures human rights practices are adhered to (as 
per ILO) by the contractors supplying man-power to 
the Company.  We have very stringent norms for child 
labor, anti-discrimination, forced labor or bonded 
labor, anti- harassment, workers health and safety and 
other human rights issues at all project sites.
Negative Implications
5
Economic 
Performance 
Opportunity
Ensuring business 
profitability and strong 
economic performance 
helps deliver value to 
investors and reinvest 
in the growth of the 
business, employees, 
communities and other 
stakeholders.
The Company thrives to deliver strong economic 
performance through our operational practices and 
risk mitigation strategies that supports the nation 
building and create a value for all the stakeholders.

advocacy and sensitization–thereby influencing behavioral change. Reduce- 
Reuse- Recycle will be our mantra for waste management. 
Steel: Unused steel is being sent for recycling through identified and internally 
approved vendors by Procurement in Head Office 
Plastic waste: Non-biodegradable plastic waste generated within our 
establishments is sorted out safely and discarded to designated vendors for 
recycling/reuse. 
E-waste: All electronic waste generated within Company premises is discarded 
within 180 days in accordance with e-waste management rules and is handed 
over to vendors approved by State Pollution Control Board for recycling. 
Hazardous waste: All hazardous waste is disposed through the SPCB-authorized 
vendor as per the regulatory requirements. 
Other waste: Biodegradable food waste and dry waste from labor camps is being 
disposed by BMC.  Construction debris is sent for landfill through BMC.

procedures in place for 
sustainable sourcing? 
(Yes/No)
No
We are in the process of aligning our procurement practices with the organization’s 
sustainability focus, the green infrastructure imperatives, and the organization-
wide application of sustainability. This implies green procurement, with its 
screeners based not only on quality and cost but also on the environmental 
impacts of purchase and usage over long term horizons. 
Some of KRL’s completed and existing projects are certified under CII’s Green 
building IGBC certification scheme and achieved silver rating.  KRL aims to 
achieve IGBC certification for all its upcoming projects and aims for gold rating 
as and where possible, which will propel us further to apply green procurement 
objectives to our overall procurement strategy.  KRL’s procurement team is 
involved actively in identifying and generating green alternatives to traditional 
purchasing. We plan to actively engage with and influence our supplier ecosystem 
towards better sustainability in the years to come. We believe in helping our 
supply chain partners to inculcate sustainable practices and processes in their 
operations too. Going forward, we are stepping up our efforts in influencing this 
task in a more tangible way. 
KRL plans to create a supplier code of conduct in the future. We are in the process 
of modifying our PO to include the normative clauses on EES parameters such 
as labor (child labor, forced or compulsory labor), working conditions at supplier 
sites, health and safety and protection of the environment. This outlines our 
commitment to make our supply chain more responsible and sustainable. For 
all purchases, we plan to specifically incorporate sustainable guidelines as part 
of Purchase Order terms.

We are an organization born inclusive in nature and purpose. Since our inception, we have included diverse 
segments of people in our talent pool, contributed to social causes even in tough business climates, treated 
suppliers like our partners and our customers with dedicated commitment, all along driven by our inclusive 
values and principles. They indicate how KRL extended its inclusivity to larger stakeholders from the beginning 
with its insistence on stakeholder identification and engagement. 
KRL has identified and prioritized its key stakeholder segments based on their impact on the organization and 
the organization’s impact on them. 
Sustainability framework is bringing a formal process to the philosophy already being practiced at KRL. 
Stakeholder consultation on sustainability aspects although has not been an integral part this year, we intend 
to make it a key part of the materiality exercise in the next couple of years. We will then also be in a position 
to determine methods for engaging with our key stakeholders.  The wide range of engagement platforms 
designed will help us in staying connected to stakeholder concerns and expectations from KRL.
These platforms will also work as a source of critical stakeholder feedback for us.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
The key initiatives contributing to the reduction in Green House Gas emission as part of our IGBSC certification 
for Green Buildings are:
We are making sustained efforts to Enhance Energy Performance by increasing the percentage of energy 
efficiency in all our projects by utilizing a combination of different building products, retrofits and designing 
our homes to ensure maximum day light savings, increased fresh air ventilation, reduced solar heat gain co-
efficient and optimizing the “u” value.
Some of the building materials being used and promoted at our sites include: Solid Cement blocks, SGU glass, 
VRF and Roof with 75 mm insulation.  We also have Integrated Energy Monitoring System. 
In the from of Energy Metering for end uses like common area, exterior area, treated waste water pumping and 
BMS for HVAC, lighting, elevator, renewable energy.  
Further, 
1. 	
We encourage green commuters by providing cycle stands and EV charging points at some our residential 
projects.
2. 	
We continue to encourage the use of clean energy to reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy 
sources. To achieve our objective, we are exploring various options and alternatives to non- renewable 
energy sources such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with our service providers, green tariff and 
solar plants. This shall be institutionalized in the coming FY23-24.
3. 	
We are also focusing on higher ratings for our upcoming residential buildings. All old and new projects 
owned by KRL are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. 
They have roof top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint.
4. 	
In FY 2022-23, projects were taken up to improve the energy efficiency in existing buildings as well 
through retrofits, use of sustainable building materials and other initiatives proposed as part of our green 
building partners.  Our forward-looking goals propel us to not only achieve higher standards of ratings but 
to also deliver our commitment to sustainable living to all our customers in the coming years.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
KRL We are committed to continually improving our Waste management practices at all our upcoming 
project sites. Our waste management philosophy is based on three principles – Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. 
Although we seek to uphold our ambition of zero waste to landfills through active minimization combined 
with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes, being in the construction 
industry the construction debris generated is in large quantities and therefore one of the options for disposal 
is largely landfill. With our efforts, we plan to contribute to a circular economy and convert waste to resources.
KRL, being an Construction Company, does not manufacture physical products and therefore does not use 
any hazardous or toxic chemicals in any of its processes. The Company has offices and facility operations, and 
the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. 
Based on the nature of services, KRL’s facilities mostly generate construction debris, inorganic, organic waste, 
and building materials (such as steel, MS scrap, wires, wooden scrap, tiles, cables, etc) and generate very 
less hazardous waste and do not use toxic chemicals. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as 
paint cans are generated by our contractors that are engaged for painting activities, these cans are disposed 
through SPCB approved recyclers as per regulations by the contractors as per our contractual requirements.  
The organic waste generated within our sites/labour camps are treated in an in-house organic waste 
composter and converted into manure. Sludge generated from STP is dried and blended with this compost. 
The manure is being used as fertilizer for landscaping.
The inorganic waste is segregated at source and is disposed of through authorized recyclers. Generated 
construction waste is disposed to landfill through BMC. 
In line with the Central & State Govt. (India) Directives, KRL plans to make  all its sites free from ‘Single use 
plastics’ through alternative arrangements in FY23_24. We are currently in the process of  avoiding single-
use food and drink containers and utensils in the cafeteria, meeting rooms, and utmost monitoring is done to 
minimize the generation of waste.

all the health & safety measures implemented on ground to ensure there is no 
deviations from the set process. To Identify hazards/risks within the premises, 
Hazard identification and risk assessment is done prior to each activity, and it 
is reviewed periodically. To mitigate the identified hazards/risks appropriate 
control measures are implemented. In addition to the risk assessment, we 
have established incident reporting process at our facilities.  The incidents are 
tracked, and correction & corrective actions are taken to ensure safe working 
place. Awareness on health and safety at work, safety during construction and 
emergency preparedness is given to employees periodically and trainings are 
conducted to partners as per the schedule to create awareness on health & 
safety. New work force entering the site is first inducted through class room 
training on health and safety at site and only then permitted to start work.
Our Safety Manual provides details on all activities from start of the project till 
completion and safety measure and operational controls for each activity to avoid 
any untoward incident or accident.  As part of our commitment to our value chain
