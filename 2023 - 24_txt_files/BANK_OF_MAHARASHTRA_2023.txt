1 
Data Privacy  
Risk  
The possibility of a data 
breach presents a 
significant risk to the 
exposure of our 
customers' Personally 
Identifiable Information 
(PII). This, in turn, could 
affect our business 
relationship with them, 
putting at stake the 
confidentiality, integrity, 
and security of sensitive 
customer data. Such a 
breach has the potential 
to erode trust and harm 
our reputation. 
BOM has a customer data privacy policy in 
place 
https://bankofmaharashtra.in/privacy-
policy .  Bank is ISO 27001:2013 certified as 
well. The ISO 27001 certification is an 
endorsement of the Bank’s achieving its 
commitment to protect and safeguard 
the critical information in order to ensure 
secure banking operations by building the 
processes complying with the highest 
International standards. Bank has tested 
certain critical aspects of cyber security on 
network security management mechanism, 
operational security of key information 
infrastructure, data and client information 
management, monitoring and emergency 
management through certain data drill 
conducted by the Management and 
scrutinised and comparing the required 
results. Bank has also assessed areas 
including password policies, security 
configuration, system interface controls 
over changes to applications and 
databases and that business users and 
controls to ensure that developers and 
production support did not have access to 
change applications, the operating systems 
or databases in the production 
Negative: in an 
unlikely case of a 
data breach, the 
Bank would suffer 
negative 
consequences on its 
business operations, 
such as service 
disruptions, financial 
losses, reputation 
damage, and a loss 
of customer trust. 
Furthermore, these 
incidents would 
heighten the risk of 
regulatory scrutiny 
and potential 
penalties from 
regulatory 
authorities.

environment to ensure proper segregation 
of duties is in place as per the SOP.  
2 
Business 
Continuity 
Risk 
The absence of business 
continuity or disaster 
management systems 
may lead to financial 
losses and disruptions in 
critical operations at the 
bank, including 
personnel, information, 
infrastructure, and 
facilities.  
BOM has assessed the requirement of the 
implementation of Business Continuity 
Plan and has Board approved BCP Policy in 
place. 
Negative: Failing to 
respond effectively 
to contingencies can 
lead to financial 
losses and negative 
impacts on 
workforce 
productivity, as well 
as hinder the 
company's long-
term growth plans. 
3 
Ethical 
Behaviour 
Risk 
The Bank is committed 
to upholding ethical 
standards, 
demonstrating its 
dedication to integrity in 
all transactions. By 
placing emphasis on 
ethical behaviour, the 
Bank not only seeks to 
retain its current 
clientele but also to 
draw in new customers. 
This commitment to 
ethical conduct builds 
trust, enhances 
relationships, and 
solidifies the Bank's 
image as a reputable 
and dependable 
financial entity. 
BOM's Code of Conduct sets forth the 
guiding principles on which the Bank shall 
operate and conduct its daily business with 
its multitudinous stakeholders, 
government and regulatory agencies, 
media and anyone else with whom it is 
connected. It recognises that the Bank is a 
trustee and custodian public money and in 
order to fulfil its fiduciary obligations and 
responsibilities, it has to maintain and 
continue to enjoy the trust and confidence 
of public at large. The Bank acknowledges 
the need to uphold the integrity of every 
transaction it enters into and believes that 
honesty and integrity in its internal 
conduct would be judged by its external 
behaviour. The Bank is conscious of the 
reputation it carries amongst its customers 
and public at large and shall endeavour to 
do all it can to sustain and improve upon 
the same in its discharge of obligations. 
The Bank shall continue to initiate policies, 
which are customer centric and which 
promote financial prudence.

a/documentlibrary/ddc1443e-f213-4cf7-
8f1d-9c289dd95b9e.pdf  
Negative: Unethical 
conduct has the 
potential to directly 
harm the bank's 
reputation and 
diminish employee 
morale and 
productivity, thus 
impacting overall 
growth. By 
maintaining ethical 
standards and 
treating both 
customers and 
employees with 
integrity and 
respect, the Bank 
fosters a positive 
workplace 
atmosphere and 
enhances customer 
relationships. 
4 
Systematic 
Risk 
Management 
Risk  
This guarantees financial 
stability, adherence to 
regulations, and 
safeguarding of 
stakeholders. It 
promotes uninterrupted 
business operations, 
reputation preservation, 
and enduring viability by 
proficiently identifying, 
evaluating, and 
addressing potential 
risks. These risks can 
originate from diverse 
factors such as financial, 
technological, or lending 
uncertainties. Such 
occurrences or series of 
events have the 
potential to compromise 
The Bank has put in place Risk 
Management Policies and Strategies which 
enables it to identify, measure, monitor 
and manage risk efficiently and establishes 
control systems in line with the Bank’s 
aggregate Risk Appetite. Bank has 
constituted Risk Management Committee 
at Board level to monitor the risk at Bank 
level in accordance with RBI Guidelines. 
Bank has also constituted sub-committees 
headed by Top Management of Bank. 
From a more operational perspective, it 
will also review the risk profile of the Bank 
and issue instructions/ guidelines to the 
concerned department (s) to better 
manage the risk. 
It also supervises and monitors the 
functioning of the Asset Liability 
Management (ALM) System in the Bank. 
The Bank is compliant to the RBI 
Negative: Neglecting 
to address any 
unchecked risk that 
could escalate into a 
systemic threat 
could severely 
impact the Bank's 
performance. These 
risks endanger the 
stability and 
trustworthiness of 
the financial system, 
potentially causing 
disruptions, financial 
setbacks and harm 
to the reputation.

Financial 
Inclusion 
Opportunity 
Broadening financial 
inclusion extends access 
to banking services to 
marginalized and 
underprivileged 
communities, generating 
a positive societal 
impact and fostering 
broader economic 
development and 
stability. Enhanced 
business lending results 
in increased turnover 
and broader outreach. 
Bank is committed to the national agenda 
of ensuring financial inclusion of all Indians 
across the country by providing them 
access to banking products and services at 
their doorstep. During the year, the Bank 
and its subsidiary – Maharashtra Gramin 
Bank opened 10.85 lakh new Pradhan 
Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts 
and met or exceeded all allocated targets. 
Bank is also diversifying its services by 
introducing additional business verticals of 
Corporate Direct Selling Agent, Corporate 
Business Correspondent and Recovery 
Agent services to be provided to Banks/ 
Financial Institution and will also give value 
addition in implementation of Govt. 
Security Schemes like PMJJBY, PMSBY, 
APY, SCSS, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna, etc. 
after the approval from the RBI. Bank has 
been declared ‘Runner up’ under award 
category ‘Digital Financial Inclusion’ on 
03.12.2022 during IBA Technology Awards 
2022. 
Positive: Financial 
inclusion enhances 
the bank's 
profitability through 
customer base 
expansion, deposit 
growth, and product 
diversification, 
concurrently 
bolstering its 
reputation. 
6 
Customer 
fairness and 
right-selling 
Risk 
The lack of customer-
centric product 
offerings, value-added 
services, or unethical 
behaviour can erode 
trust and tarnish the 
bank's reputation. This 
highlights the 
importance of aligning 
products and services 
with customer needs, 
while maintaining ethical 
standards to preserve 
trust and safeguard the 
bank's image with 
stakeholders. 
BOM has a code of conduct for direct 
selling agents-

a/documentlibrary/7fc5e915-e019-462f-
90bc-133ce7ef147a.pdf   
Negative: Mis-selling 
of products can 
detrimentally impact 
banks by causing 
reputational harm, 
legal repercussions, 
financial setbacks, 
customer loss, 
operational 
disturbances, and 
morale issues 
among employees.

Employee 
Benefits & 
Development 
Opportunity 
This increases efficiency, 
minimizes employee 
turnover, enhances 
capabilities and 
creativity within the 
bank, and promotes 
diversity, consequently 
enriching the customer 
experience. 
Defined Benefit Plans: All eligible 
employees are entitled to receive benefits 
under the Bank’s Gratuity, Pension & 
Privilege Leave schemes which are valued 
based on the principles laid down in AS -
15, Employees Benefit (Revised) issued by 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
Bank’s liabilities towards defined benefit 
schemes are determined by way of 
provisions and adjusted on the basis of an 
actuarial valuation report provided by the 
Actuaries appointed by the bank and 
made at the end of each quarter/financial 
year. Actuarial gains and losses are 
recognized in the Profit & Loss Account. 
Other Employee Benefits such as Leave 
Fare Concession, Silver jubilee Award, 
resettlement allowance, and retirement 
benefit are provided based on Actuarial 
valuation. 
Positive:  
A robust workforce 
characterized by 
heightened 
engagement, 
retention, and 
diversity brings forth 
fresh perspectives, 
varied experiences, 
and innovative ideas. 
This fosters 
performance 
enhancement and 
cultivates a positive 
organizational 
culture, showcasing 
the company's 
commitment to 
establishing an 
enabling work 
environment.

Regulatory & 
Legal 
Compliances 
Risk   
The risk of non-
compliance exposes the 
bank to legal penalties 
and financial losses 
stemming from its 
failure to adhere to 
industry laws and 
regulations. Banks that 
prioritize compliance 
typically experience 
enhanced performance 
and improved process 
efficiency. Compliance 
offers assurance and 
offers investors a deeper 
understanding of the 
bank's operations. 
The Code of Conduct for Board of 
Directors and Senior Management 
Personnel i.e., Core Management team 
comprising all General Managers of the 
Bank has been approved by the Board of 
Directors in compliance with SEBI (Listing

Regulations, 2015. The said Code of

a/documentlibrary/5f07ecf9-6579-43e1-
ba30-3c0d58290f9a.pdf. All the Board 
Members and Senior Management 
Personnel of Bank have affirmed the 
compliance of the code. 
Negative: Failure to 
comply would result 
in reputation 
damage, 
subsequently 
impacting business 
operations. Banks 
that adhere to 
regulatory laws have 
a greater capacity to 
manage risks and 
foster a culture of 
fairness and loyalty 
among employees.

GHG 
Emissions 
Management 
Opportunity 
Evaluating the 
environmental impact of 
the Bank's operations is 
a key priority. Effective 
management in this area 
enhances operations 
and profitability, attracts 
positive attention from 
stakeholders and 
investors and shapes the 
public perception of the 
bank. 
As part of our ongoing efforts to adopt 
renewable energy, we installed 
solar panels at the Bank’s Head Office and 
Bank-owned premises. The Bank 
undertook multiple tree plantation drives 
involving around 10500 trees planted 
across the country. 
Positive: Managing 
GHG emissions 
enables banks to 
invest in low-carbon 
systems, thereby 
promoting 
sustainability and 
distinguishing 
themselves in the 
market. 
10 
ESG Oversight 
Opportunity 
Establishing effective 
ESG oversight at the 
board level will enhance 
the overall ESG 
performance and 
demonstrate the bank's 
dedication to 
incorporating 
responsible business 
practices into its growth 
strategy. Integrating ESG 
principles into business 
operations would 
enhance risk 
management, 
governance, 
accountability reporting, 
and decision-making 
processes. This 
integration would 
enhance the bank's 
capacity to identify and 
address risks and 
opportunities associated 
with environmental and 
social impacts, fostering 
trust and transparency 
among investors and 
stakeholders. 
Since inception, Bank is committed to 
serving diverse sections of society, 
enhancing shareholders’ value and 
creating a positive societal impact. Bank’s 
management believes that long term 
success requires creating value for all 
stakeholders and is committed to invest in 
sustainable practices for the well-being of 
our customers and communities. In order 
to create value Bank has integrated ESG 
considerations into business practices. The 
Bank has made significant investments in 
renewal energy sources, including 
installation of solar panels at its Head 
Office and other premises owned by the 
Bank across the country thereby savings 
2,76,806 kWh during FY 2023-24. The Bank 
has undertaken various tree plantation 
drives across the country as a contribution 
towards making the environment cleaner 
and healthier. The Bank has planted 
around 10500 trees during the FY24.  
Bank has disposed off approx. 1,08,440 kg 
electronic waste (recycling 1,03,000 kg or 
approx. 95%) in FY24. Women constitute 
approx. 27% of Bank’s workforce. 
Furthermore, 53% of Bank’s branches are 
located in semi-urban and rural areas as 
on 31 March 2024 to reach out to reach to 
underserved communities, esp. women 
customers and bottom of the pyramid 
segments.  
Positive: Leadership 
oversight on the ESG 
strategy, action plan, 
and performance 
promotes a positive 
environmental and 
community impact. 
It also empowers the 
bank to strengthen 
monitoring 
mechanisms across 
ESG initiatives and 
business practices.

Describe the

Communities represent a significant stakeholder group, and the Bank's CSR team maintains regular 
communication with them to gather feedback on CSR projects. In numerous instances, NGO partners serve as 
intermediaries, addressing community grievances and relaying them to the Bank's CSR team 
 
The customer of the Bank can raise their complaint directly through Branches of the Bank. Besides this there is a 
Mahaseva Service of the Bank with designated toll free number for raising any complaint. Customers can also 
directly lodge their complaint on the Bank’s Website. 
 
To redress the complaint received from the customer, an escalation matric is in place wherein the complaint is 
first resolved at the Branch Level, then at Zonal Office Level and even if the complaint is still un-resolved, it is 
escalated to Bank’s Principal Nodal Officer at Head Office.  
 
Also, for redressing the grievances of the community we are having well designed portal for addressing the same. 
After receiving the complaint, Grievance Officers at different level are able to redress the grievances at the earliest.  
 
To enable the customers to voice their grievances or offer suggestions for improvement in customer service, 
“Customer Day” is observed at all the offices of the Bank covering branches, Zonal offices and Head office, on 
15th of every month (If 15th is holiday, then on preceding working day).
