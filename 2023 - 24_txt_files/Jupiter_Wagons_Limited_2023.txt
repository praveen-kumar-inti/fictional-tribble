1
GHG 
emissions 
and energy 
management
Risk
Climate change presents significant 
risks to wagon manufacturing 
companies and heavy industries, 
particularly concerning energy 
use and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. Manufacturing 
processes, including metal 
fabrication, welding, and painting, 
are energy-intensive and often 
reliant on fossil fuels, leading to 
GHG emissions that contribute 
to climate change. Regulatory 
pressures to reduce emissions, 
coupled with energy price volatility 
and supply chain disruptions from 
climate-related events, further 
compound these risks. Moreover, 
climate change can lead to extreme 
weather events such as flooding, 
hurricanes, and heatwaves, which 
can damage manufacturing 
facilities, disrupt supply chains, and 
cause production delays.
The company has outlined 
a clear approach to reduce 
GHG emission and energy 
efficiency:
1.	 JWL has developed 
BRSR policy and taken 
commitments on energy 
saving initiatives. 
2. 	 It has utilized the 
latest energy-efficient 
technologies such as 
advanced machineries 
and LED lighting to 
ensure optimal resource 
utilization.
3. 	 The Company has 
commenced GHG 
inventorization (scope 1, 
2 & 3) this year. 
This includes 
compliance costs, 
reputational damage, 
increased operating 
expenses, supply 
chain disruptions, 
and impacting 
profitability and 
shareholder value. 
2
Waste 
management 
& circular 
economy
Risk
Waste management and the shift 
toward a circular economy are 
crucial for wagon manufacturing 
companies. Manufacturing 
processes generate significant 
waste, posing environmental 
risks and regulatory challenges. 
Compliance with waste 
management regulations requires 
companies to reduce, reuse, and 
recycle materials, while also 
mitigating resource scarcity and 
cost pressures. 
The Company has adapted 
following measures for 
effective waste management 
practices: 
1.	 Utilizing of metal 
scraps and used sand in 
production process.
2.	 Onboarded authorized 
recyclers at plant level 
to dispose hazardous 
waste as per regulatory 
mandates. 
1.	Failure in meeting 
the compliance 
requirements may 
impose fines and 
penalties. 
2.	Improper handling 
of hazardous waste 
may increase the 
chances of health 
hazards, fire 
incidents etc. 
3
Employee 
wellbeing
Opportunity The Company is committed to 
provide attractive compensation, a 
conducive work atmosphere, and 
avenues for career development 
to its employees and workers and 
this will also help to attract top 
talent within the industry. This can 
enhance competitiveness among 
workforce, increase productivity, 
foster innovation and facilitating 
growth.
Not applicable 
This will reduce 
recruitment and 
training expenses. 
Additionally, this will 
increase productivity 
among workforce, 
leading to higher 
output and efficiency.

Human 
rights
Risk
Failure to comply with statutory 
norms or violations of human 
rights can lead to negative financial 
and reputational consequences. 
This could lead to diminished 
customer loyalty, business losses, 
and damaged brand image.
1.	 The company prohibits 
child and force labour at 
plant and corporate level. 
2.	 The Company has 
established Internal 
Complaints Committee 
to address sexual 
harassment and human 
rights related grievances. 
3.	 The Company ensures 
that all employees are 
treated fairly and with 
dignity, and that there 
is zero tolerance for 
discrimination. 
Companies that 
violate these laws 
can face fines, 
penalties, and legal 
actions.
5.
Community 
welfare
Opportunity Building trust and nurturing 
positive relationships with 
communities through initiatives 
that enhance economic 
empowerment and social well-
being is essential for maintaining 
uninterrupted business operations.
Not applicable
Through strategic 
investments 
in community 
welfare initiatives, 
the Company 
strengthens 
stakeholder 
relationships 
and fosters a 
resilient business 
environment. 
This approach 
drives long-term, 
inclusive growth 
and prosperity for 
all stakeholders, 
including community 
members.
6
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
OHS hazards present significant 
risks to both the operational 
integrity of JWL and the safety 
of its supply chain. Within JWL 
manufacturing facilities, employees 
and workers involved in tasks 
such as welding, metal fabrication, 
assembly, and painting are exposed 
to potential dangers such as heavy 
machinery accidents, chemical 
exposure, etc. Neglecting to 
adequately mitigate these OHS 
hazards could lead to workplace 
accidents, occupational illnesses, 
and even fatal injuries, posing a 
threat to employee well-being and 
operational continuity.
JWL has taken following 
measures for effective OHS 
management:
1.	 JWL has developed 
systems and procedures 
to identify potential health 
and safety hazards within 
its operations.
2.	 JWL provides safety 
training to all its 
employees and workers.
3.	 JWL has developed OHS 
poster and distributed the 
same among its workforce 
for awareness purpose. 
1.	Increased 
healthcare costs: 
Workplace injuries 
and illnesses can 
result in higher 
healthcare costs 
for the company, 
including medical 
treatment, 
rehabilitation, 
and workers' 
compensation.

2.	Lost productivity: 
Workplace injuries

can also lead 
to decreased 
productivity as 
employees are 
unable to work 
or must take time 
off for medical 
treatment or 
recovery. This 
can result in lost 
revenue and 
increased costs.
7.
Corporate 
governance 
& business 
ethics
Opportunities The Company's brands and 
reputation are invaluable assets, 
subject to constant scrutiny 
regarding their operations, societal 
contributions, and engagement 
with the world. Maintaining ethical 
practices is crucial for safeguarding 
the reputation and brands.
Not applicable
1.	Improved 
decision- Effective 
corporate 
governance 
ensures that 
a company's 
decision-making 
processes are 
transparent, 
accountable, and 
aligned with the 
interests of its 
stakeholders.
2.	Enhanced 
Goodwill:    
A strong corporate 
governance 
framework 
can enhance 
a company's 
reputation and 
build trust with 
stakeholders. 
8.
Risk 
management
Risk
Risk management is a critical 
aspect of operations for companies 
involved in manufacturing wagons 
and vehicle bodies. However, if 
not conducted with due diligence, 
it can introduce vulnerabilities. 
These risks encompass 
compromised product quality and 
safety, disruptions in the supply 
chain, interruptions to operations, 
regulatory non-compliance, 
financial ramifications, and damage 
to reputation.
The management and 
members of the Board review 
the business periodically 
to identify ongoing factors 
that affect the business and 
also changes in the external 
environment, which are likely 
to impact the Company. The 
management has foreseen 
certain risks and took steps to 
mitigate the risks
Neglecting 
comprehensive 
risk management 
protocols may result 
in adverse outcomes 
such as customer 
dissatisfaction, 
legal repercussions, 
financial strain, and 
erosion of brand 
credibility.
