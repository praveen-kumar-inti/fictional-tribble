10. Health and safety management system:  
 
a. 
Implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
 
  
Yes. The organization has implemented the Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001:2018) 
across all its operations. All integrated and grinding unit is certied under ISO 45001:2018, afrming the 
organization's unwavering commitment to health and safety. This system is seamlessly aligned with the Occupational 
Health and Safety (OH&S) Policy, the organization's Vision and Mission, and the Golden Safety Rules that apply to all 
employees, visitors, and business partners.
 
 
OHS risk assessment is carried out for all routine and non-routine activities.
 
 
All new employees, workers, and contractor personnel undergo comprehensive safety induction training. This essential 
training empowers them with a clear understanding of potential workplace hazards and risks. It equips them to 
proactively identify and mitigate dangers, playing a vital role in accident prevention, strengthening the safety culture, 
and ensuring readiness to respond swiftly and effectively in emergencies-ultimately safeguarding lives and
minimizing harm.
 
 
Visitors and value chain partners entering manufacturing sites are thoroughly informed about the OH&S Policy, Golden 
Rules, site-specic hazards, safety protocols, and emergency procedures through an engaging and informative 
animated video. This ensures every individual is fully aware of the safety expectations and potential risks they may 
encounter during their visit.
 
 
A digital, intuitive, and robust OH&S Management System has been successfully developed and rolled out across all 
units. Tailored to meet organizational needs, this system reinforces a proactive approach to risk prevention and 
supports the overarching goal of achieving and maintaining “Zero Harm.”
 
 
Every month begins with a Safety Mass Communication Meeting-widely known as the Safety Gate Meeting. These 
sessions feature a safety oath, a worker-led safety skit, safety talks by employees, and a safety address by the Unit Head, 
reinforcing a shared commitment to safety at every level.
 
 
Daily operations commence with a pre-job safety brieng-Tool Box Talk-followed by Permit to Work, LOTOTO 
procedures, on-the-job safety observations, and near-miss reporting. These are embedded as daily practices, reecting 
a deeply ingrained safety culture.
 
 
To ensure continual improvement, the organization conducts regular workplace safety inspections, inter-unit safety 
audits, third-party audits, workplace hygiene assessments, and pre- and post-occupational health check-ups. These 
ongoing efforts underscore the organization's dedication to maintaining a safe, healthy, and high-performing work 
environment.
 
b. 
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
 
 
Hazard Identication and Risk Management
 
 
The organization follows a highly structured and proactive approach to Hazard Identication and Risk Assessment 
(HIRA). Hazards-whether physical, chemical, ergonomic, or otherwise-are systematically identied, and risks are

evaluated using a standardized matrix based on likelihood and severity. Effective control measures, including 
engineering solutions, administrative controls, and PPE, are implemented without delay.
 
 
HIRA exercises are led by section heads in close coordination with cross-functional teams (CFTs) and with active 
involvement of frontline workers, ensuring a comprehensive and ground-level evaluation of risks.
 
 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) / Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)
 
 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is routinely conducted to identify task-specic hazards and establish control measures to 
prevent workplace injuries and incidents. This methodical approach ensures that every job is assessed with safety as the 
top priority.
 
 
Permit to Work (PTW) System
 
 
The Permit to Work (PTW) system is rmly embedded in our safety framework. It serves as a formal authorization tool 
for executing non-routine or high-risk activities such as hot work, conned space entry, and electrical isolation.
The PTW outlines the necessary precautions and ensures that tasks are carried out safely, with full awareness of 
associated risks.
 
 
Incident Reporting and Root Cause Analysis
 
 
Employees are encouraged and empowered to report near misses and incidents. All reported events are thoroughly 
investigated using root cause analysis, and the ndings are integrated into the risk assessment process to prevent 
recurrence and enhance learning.
 
 
Management of Change (MOC)
 
 
For non-routine situations such as the introduction of new equipment, material changes, or process modications, the 
Management of Change (MOC) process is rigorously followed. This includes evaluating potential risks and 
implementing appropriate controls before any change is executed, ensuring continued operational safety.
 
 
Safety Audits
 
 
Both internal and third-party safety audits are conducted regularly to facilitate systematic hazard identication, verify 
the effectiveness of existing controls, and ensure compliance with ISO 45001:2018 standards and statutory 
requirements.
 
 
Behavior-Based Safety and Pre-Job Risk Assessment
 
 
HIRA principles are applied during pre-job safety briengs, while Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) observations are carried 
out by shift engineers and supervisors during actual job execution. In addition, Critical Error Reduction Techniques 
(CERT) are employed to proactively manage human error and reinforce safe behaviors at every level of operation.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community. 
 
The CSR team visits communities on day-to-day basis and meet various stakeholders including beneciaries, panchayat 
representatives and others. The process of continuous engagement with the community is an ongoing process. The 
frequency of the engagement and interaction depends on nature of the stakeholder like project beneciaries in local 
communities do happen on daily and weekly basis whereas that of panchayats and government line departments do 
happen on fortnightly and monthly basis. These day-to-day interactions help the CSR team to gather feedbacks and 
complaints if any. The feedback is used to improve and modify CSR projects. This system is an informal one and has helped to 
resolve issues and response to the demands of stakeholders to their satisfaction. The Company also undertakes materiality 
analysis on time-to-time basis as a part of its sustainability reporting initiatives. Based on this respective departments
