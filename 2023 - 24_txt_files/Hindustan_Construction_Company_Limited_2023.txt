12.	 Describe the measures taken by the Entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As part of its comprehensive EHS management system, the Company initiates a project-specific plan at the commencement of 
each new project. This plan establishes the fundamental parameters for managing environmental, health, and safety aspects. 
It identifies hazardous operations, evaluates associated risks, and delineates integrated preventive measures (controls) to 
mitigate these risks effectively. To further bolster safety performance, the Company has implemented various initiatives over 
time. These include mandatory induction and training programs, regular toolbox talks to reinforce safety protocols, and practical 
demonstrations on the correct use of personal protective equipment. Moreover, the Company undertakes a rigorous approach 
to monitoring HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) performance. This involves ongoing evaluation and assessment to ensure 
compliance with established safety standards and to promptly address any identified issues. Both internal and external audits 
are conducted regularly to review and improve the effectiveness of the EHS management system.
	
Additionally, the implementation of the Proactive Safety Observation Programme (PSOP) and Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS) 
programme has led to a transformative shift in how safety practices are observed and managed across all project sites. These 
proactive measures underscore the Company’s commitment to maintaining a safe and secure working environment for its 
personnel.

potential impacts of its business on them and vice versa. In line with its business models, the Company has identified the 
following as key stakeholder groups:
Stakeholders
Basis of Identification
Customers / Clients:
Government owned enterprises (central and state) contribute to majority of the Company’s current 
orderbook, hence they are the largest clients for the businesses. In addition to providing the 
business, they also determine policies for various areas as well as determine the plans for various 
sectors.
Suppliers / 
Subcontractors:
EPC have significant dependence on supply chain partners for sourcing of key raw materials e.g., 
cement, aggregates, steel and other materials for construction projects and outsourcing activities 
such as low-end civil works in construction projects. To maintain sustainable growth, these 
partners are key elements in meeting the delivery and cost objectives for various contracts.
Employees & workforce:
Construction is a labour-intensive activity, and HCC employs over 12,000 workers in addition to 
>1,100 of its own employees. Hence, their skills development, health and well-being are important 
for the Company’s ongoing and future operations.
Investors and 
Shareholders:
Investors and shareholders make an important contribution to the growth of the Company by 
providing financial resources. They also play an important role through exercise of their voting 
rights with respect to important plans of the Company.
JV Partners:
Partnership development is a critical management approach in the strategic business sector, 
minimizing business risk during the bid and project execution.
Local Communities:
HCC helps catalyse socio-economic development of communities around its project sites at 
various locations across the country. Focus is on under-privileged and marginalized sections to 
enable them to bring them on-par with others.

Yes, Stakeholder consultation is actively utilized to support the identification and management of environmental and social 
topics. Specifically, structured consultation and participation processes are in place for both employees and workers. For 
workers, representatives regularly participate in monthly committee meetings where they present their concerns for discussion. 
Management addresses these issues directly, ensuring that workers’ voices are heard and acted upon. Additionally, suggestion 
boxes are strategically placed at various project sites, providing workers with an accessible platform to express their concerns. 
These suggestions are carefully reviewed during project meetings, and appropriate actions are taken to resolve any issues 
raised.
	
Similarly, regular meetings are held with employees to gather their input on environmental and social topics. These inputs 
are systematically documented and discussed by the project management team, who then implement relevant measures in 
response to the feedback received. This ongoing dialogue ensures that the policies and activities of the entity are continuously 
informed by the perspectives and concerns of its stakeholders.

As the founder member of the Disaster Resource Partnership (DRP) formed at the World Economic Forum in 2004, HCC 
ensures that the core strengths and existing capacities of the Infrastructure and Urban Development community are mobilized 
during and after crisis to reduce suffering and save lives. HCC became a co-founder and regional coordinator of the Disaster 
Resource Network India in November 2002. DRN India’s missions were to train private firm personnel in disaster relief, and to 
make plans and structures that could become operational in crises. When disaster strikes, we’re the first responders with heavy 
equipment and satellite communication systems availability. Before external help arrives, we know what infrastructure has 
broken down, how to repair it and what the requirements are. With trained personnel in disaster response, we offer help to local 
authorities in rescue and relief operations.
