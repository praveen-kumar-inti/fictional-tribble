10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes 
 
Waste generation being an inevitable part of manufacturing process, efforts have been taken to create value from waste. 
With an aim to divert a significant quantum of waste from going to the landfills, the Company has adopted systems and 
procedures that helps repurpose used material and reintroduce excess material into the production process. The 
legally prescribed procedures and applies environmentally sound disposal techniques for disposing hazardous waste 
whereas the non-hazardous waste is sold to authorized recyclers.
The company has implemented use of low air pressure system for painting operations which has reduced solvent and 
paint emissions. Furthermore, the company has transitioned to using low VOC paint instead of traditional paints in the 
process. Since VOCs evaporate, subsequently transferring harmful chemicals into the air, switching to low VOC paint 
will is better for improving air quality as these paints off-gas lesser than the traditional paints.
