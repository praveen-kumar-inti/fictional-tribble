Ethical 
Conduct of 
Clinical Trials 
and Animal 
Testing
Risk
Clinical 
Trials 
are 
integral part of product 
development 
in 
the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
There is a need to address 
risks 
associated 
with 
clinical trials and animal 
testing especially around 
the ethical and safety 
related concerns of trials 
on human subjects and 
animal testing. Adverse 
events reported during 
the animal testing or 
clinical trial can delay 
product 
development 
leading to increase in 
cost and loss of gaining 
business 
opportunity
•	
The Company complies with all 
relevant 
regulatory 
requirements 
governing clinical trials and animal 
testing. The Company has dedicated in-
house teams responsible for ensuring 
adherence to these regulations, which 
involve obtaining necessary approvals, 
permits, and maintaining thorough 
documentation. 
•	
The Company also undertakes post 
marketing surveillance studies to

Long-term 
safety 
studies 
are 
also undertaken for some of the 
innovative 
products 
in 
order 
to assess and measure safety 
parameters over a longer time 
horizon. 
Negative: 
Not 
following 
good clinical practices while 
conducting animal testing or 
clinical trials can have impact 
on the efficacy and safety 
of the products. It can also 
attract adverse regulatory /
legal action, lead to financial 
damages and reputation loss 
and have a negative impact on 
participant’s health and safety. 
Delays at any stage can also 
prolong the overall timeline for 
drug development, leading to 
increased costs.

Community 
Engagement 
and 
Development
Opportunity
Engagement with nearby 
community 
helps 
the 
Company 
to 
build 
confidence and gain trust 
of the community. The 
interest and well-being 
of the community should 
be kept in consideration 
while 
setting 
up 
the 
plants and conduct of 
business 
operations.

the risks of conflicts and 
creates positive image of 
the Company.
The Company has a mechanism in place 
to engage with the nearby community 
and works closely with them to address 
any issues faced by them. The Company 
also 
undertakes 
various 
activities 
for 
community 
engagement 
and 
development. 
Positive: 
Community 
engagement and development 
helps 
in 
building 
good 
perception about the Company 
among the local community 
members. 
The 
Company’s 
reputation can also increase by 
undertaking various initiatives 
for 
community's 
upliftment 
including 
focus 
on 
health, 
education, rural infrastructure 
development, 
sanitation 
and 
environment 
conservation 
among others. These efforts also 
help to promote positive social 
outcomes.
12
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
There are some materials 
for which the Company 
is dependent on single 
source of supply. Such 
suppliers 
can 
disrupt 
supplies and dictate their 
terms. 
The 
Company 
also imports some of the 
critical 
materials 
from 
outside 
India. 
During 
spread 
of 
any 
global 
pandemic supplies from 
outside may be affected. 
These factors can disrupt 
operations resulting in 
lower sales and negative 
impact on the Company’s 
profitability and reputation.
The Company has entered into long-
term supply agreements for key material 
having single source suppliers. The 
Company also maintains adequate 
inventories to take care of any temporary 
non-availability of imported materials.
The Company is also proactively working 
towards expanding its supplier base, 
adding alternative suppliers, in order to 
minimize any risk associated with supply 
chain interruptions.
Negative: Supply chain related 
risks can disrupt production 
activities, delay in supply of 
products to customers, loss of 
business contract, attraction of 
penalty to supply the products 
on time. All these can adversely 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
profitability and reputation as a 
reliable supplier.

Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting ESG 
related challenges, targets and achievements
The Company aims to become one of the leading biotechnology Company. We recognize 
the importance of conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner. We 
are implementing sustainability practices, accountability and transparency across our 
operations and value chain. As part of our efforts to integrate sustainability in our business 
we are developing a robust ESG framework, which is being built on the principles of 
operating responsibly and growing sustainably. 
Environmental Responsibility: To achieve our target of sustainable operations, we have 
implemented multiple initiatives like conducting detailed assessment of all our operations 
to identify emissions hotspots and develop decarbonization roadways to guide individual 
sites to bring down their carbon emissions over medium and long term. We also conducted 
water use assessments across all manufacturing facilities and potential to minimize fresh-
water usage were identified. We plan on conducting similar audits in the future to further 
reduce our fresh-water consumption. We have started the review of waste management 
practices at our facilities to achieve our goal of minimizing waste. The Company has also 
undertaken multiple training programs focused on ESG to increase awareness among its 
employees.
Social Responsibility: We understand that our success as a company is intricately linked 
to the well-being of our employees, communities and stakeholders. We have developed a 
culture of diversity and inclusion within our organization and currently we have more than 
1,000 employees from different cultures, demographics, gender and expertise. We provide 
our employees a safe, healthy and competitive environment to pursue innovation in their 
function. 
Governance and Ethical Practices: The Company follows the highest standard of corporate 
governance and ethical practices. The Company has a strong governance system to ensure 
regulatory compliance and internal compliances. The corporate governance system 
has a detailed set of practices, processes and regulations to meet the interests of all our 
stakeholders. The Company has a Board of Directors (‘Board’) that have leaders having 
a broad spectrum in terms of perspective, experience, expertise, gender, and culture, 
enriching our Company. Our Board members have rich experience of corporate functions 
and guide our efforts to achieve our business and sustainability goals. The Board has a sub-
committee viz. Risk Management Committee to identify the potential risks, suggest ways 
and strategies to mitigate these risks.
