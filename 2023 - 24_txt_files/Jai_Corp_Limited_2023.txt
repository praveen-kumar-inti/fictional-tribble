1.
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety (OHS)
Risk
Ensuring worker safety and health 
is crucial for employee well-being. 
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) is a top concern for the 
Company due to the potential 
impact of workplace accidents, 
injuries, 
and 
environmental 
issues 
on 
the 
employees. 
Ineffective management of health 
and safety practices can lead to 
a high number of safety related 
incidents. We recognize the 
importance of ensuring a safe 
and healthy work environment. 
By focusing on OHS, we aim to 
reduce risks and promote the 
sustainable growth of business.
The Company conducts regular 
health and safety assessments 
across all its plant locations to 
identify and evaluate potential 
risks 
and 
hazards. 
These 
assessments are integral to 
maintaining 
a 
safe 
working 
environment 
and 
minimizing 
occupational health and safety 
(OHS) risks. By systematically 
reviewing 
operations 
and 
facilities, the Company can 
proactively address any concerns 
that may compromise employee 
well-being or workplace safety.
The 
Company 
invests 
in 
training programs designed to 
educate and empower workers 
and employees about OHS 
practices and regulations. These 
training initiatives ensure that all 
personnel are knowledgeable 
about 
safety 
protocols 
and 
compliance requirements.

Community 
Engagement 
and Social 
Impact
Opportunity
The 
Company 
views 
social 
responsibility 
towards 
society 
as a strategic opportunity rather 
than just an obligation. By 
investing in community support 
initiatives, the Company aims to 
cultivate goodwill, and achieve a 
competitive edge. These efforts 
not only benefit the Company’s 
business 
but 
also 
positively 
impact the communities where 
the Company operates, fostering 
economic 
development 
and 
sustainability. Embracing social 
responsibility allows the Company 
to align its values with its actions, 
contributing to a more inclusive 
and sustainable future. Through 
proactive 
engagement 
and 
investment in social initiatives, the 
Company aims to create lasting 
positive outcomes.

3.
Energy 
Management
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Energy management represents 
both a significant risk and a 
compelling opportunity for the 
Company:
Risk: Inefficient energy use and 
reliance on fossil fuels expose 
the Company to operational and 
financial risks. Fluctuating energy 
prices can lead to increased 
production 
costs, 
impacting 
profit 
margins. 
Additionally, 
dependence on non-renewable 
energy sources contributes to 
carbon emissions, which may 
result in regulatory compliance 
challenges and reputational risks 
in an increasingly sustainability-
focused market.
Opportunity: 
Effective 
energy 
management 
presents 
a 
compelling opportunity for the 
Company 
to 
reduce 
costs, 
enhance competitiveness, and 
demonstrate 
environmental 
stewardship. 
Implementing 
energy-efficient technologies and 
practices can lead to significant 
cost 
savings 
over 
time 
by 
reducing energy consumption 
and 
operational 
expenses. 
Transitioning to renewable energy 
sources, such as solar or wind 
power, not only reduces carbon 
footprint 
but 
also 
enhances 
the 
Company’s 
sustainability 
credentials.
Recognizing 
the 
strategic 
importance 
of 
energy 
management, the Company is 
committed to developing and 
implementing a comprehensive 
energy management strategy.
The Company’s strategy shall 
be inclined towards optimizing 
energy 
usage, 
enhancing 
efficiency, and reducing costs 
while minimizing the overall 
environmental impact.
The Company has also installed 
solar power plants as a source 
of renewable energy. This will 
help the Company to reduce it 
dependency on fossil fuels and 
result in reduced environmental 
footprint.

Positive

Carbon 
Emissions
Opportunity
The 
Company 
views 
the 
reduction of carbon emissions 
as a strategic opportunity aligned 
with 
evolving 
environmental 
expectations. Recognizing the 
growing demand for sustainable 
solutions 
in 
manufacturing, 
the Company is committed to 
investing in and developing low-
carbon technologies and eco-
friendly processes.
Moreover, reducing emissions not 
only benefits the environment but 
also drives potential cost savings 
and 
operational 
efficiencies. 
Through 
the 
adoption 
of 
energy-efficient 
technologies, 
waste reduction, and process 
optimization, 
we 
anticipate 
significant financial gains. 
NA
Positive
5.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
The 
Company 
recognizes 
that 
effective 
supply 
chain 
management 
is 
critical 
for 
mitigating risks and ensuring 
operational resilience. Disruptions 
in 
raw 
material 
supply, 
transportation, or logistics can 
lead to productivity and revenue 
losses. 
Moreover, 
market 
uncertainties, political instability, 
and natural disasters further 
underscore the importance of 
robust supply chain strategies. 
High dependency on a limited 
number of suppliers or vendors 
increases 
procurement 
risks, 
potentially impacting business 
continuity and profitability. 
The Company has established 
long-standing 
relationships 
with multiple suppliers/vendors. 
Continuous 
discussions 
and 
communication are maintained 
with these suppliers/vendors to 
ensure uninterrupted production 
and 
timely 
availability 
of 
required supplies. The Company 
focuses on building resilience to 
disruptions, and proactive risk 
management.
Negative
6.
Risk 
Management 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
The Company is exposed to 
cyber-attacks, data breaches, 
and ransomware, which can 
result in financial loss, damage to 
reputation, and loss of customer 
trust.
The Company has established 
a 
comprehensive 
Risk 
Management Policy to effectively 
manage and mitigate risks. This 
policy provides a framework for 
addressing various risk-related 
issues. In addition, the Company 
has 
implemented 
a 
robust 
cybersecurity policy, prioritizing 
the identification and resolution 
of 
cybersecurity 
threats. 
Complemented by a well-defined 
IT policy, the Company takes 
proactive measures to prevent 
incidents and minimize potential 
damages.

Water 
Management
Opportunity
Water scarcity and pollution pose 
operational and environmental 
risks. 
The 
Company 
strives 
to 
develop 
innovative 
water 
management 
solutions, 
aiming to reduce overall water 
consumption, lower operating 
costs, and improve environmental 
performance. 
These 
efforts 
enable the Company to comply

competitiveness.

8.
Labor 
Practices and 
Human Rights
Risk
Ensuring fair labor practices, 
respecting 
human 
rights, 
and 
complying 
with 
labor 
laws are fundamental ethical 
considerations and critical for 
maintaining a motivated and 
productive 
workforce. 
Non-
compliance can lead to legal, 
reputational, 
and 
operational 
risks.
The Company prioritizes the 
protection 
of 
human 
rights 
through well-defined policies and 
practices, which are integral to the 
Company’s Code of Conduct. To 
ensure compliance, the Company 
provides 
comprehensive 
training programs to employees 
specifically 
covering 
human 
rights topics.

Product 
Quality and 
Safety
Risk 
and 
Opportunity
Ensuring product safety, adhering 
to quality standards, and providing 
transparent product information 
are essential for consumer trust, 
brand reputation, and regulatory 
compliance. Product defects or 
safety issues can lead to recalls, 
legal liabilities, and damage to 
brand reputation.
The 
Company 
implements 
rigorous 
quality 
control 
processes, adhere to safety 
standards, 
conduct 
product 
testing, 
and 
communicate 
transparently with consumers.
