Product 
Quality.
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Our customers expect us 
to maintain and improve upon 
the quality of our products. Any 
lapse on product quality would 
negatively impact our brand 
value and our market share. 
Opportunity: Upholding and 
improving upon our product 
will enable us to increase our 
market share as well as retain 
our existing customer base. 
Further, increasing use of paper 
products in the food industry is 
an emerging opportunity.
Continuous 
monitoring 
and 
improvement 
of 
product 
quality is required to ensure 
our products have a consistent 
quality and meet the customer's 
quality expectations.
Positive: 
Maintaining 
product quality would 
ensure that we remain 
competitive 
in 
our 
industry.

Raw Material:  
Wood 
Availability
Risk 
Risk: 
Wood 
is 
the 
major 
source of raw material for pulp 
manufacturing. Availability of 
required wood is an issue.
The Company has a well-defined 
Plantation Programme - Site 
specific clones are developed as 
per prevailing soil and climatic 
conditions. 
Convincing 
and 
motivating 
farmers to raise pulp wood 
plantations by development in 
farm forestry.   
Development 
of 
Partner 
nurseries for distribution of 
required clones.
Adding new species of wood for 
the pulping process.
Sourcing of wood from other 
states and development of farm 
forestry in neighbouring states.
Import of wood chips.        
Negative: 
Shortage 
of wood may lead to 
high cost of sourcing of 
wood.
3
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: With increasing scarcity of 
natural resources and increasing 
cost, 
efficient 
management 
of 
energy 
becomes 
critical 
for 
uninterrupted 
business 
operations.      
Opportunity: 
Improving 
production process for better 
management of energy would 
not only enable us to improve 
operating margin but also it 
would enable us to reduce 
carbon footprint. 
Our Company has improved 
the 
production 
process, 
adopted better energy efficient 
equipment to optimize the 
energy consumption. During 
the year, through various process 
improvements, the Company 
was able to save 81,111 GJ of 
energy as compared to last year. 
Negative: Increase in 
cost of production and 
not meeting carbon 
footprint requirement.

Human Rights 
Practices
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: 
Absence 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
Human 
Rights 
governance 
structure 
encompassing parameters such 
as working conditions, child/ 
forced labour, fair remuneration, 
gender 
diversity, 
prevention 
of sexual harassment, freedom 
of association and collective 
bargaining will adversely impact 
the Company’s smooth working 
& people development.
Opportunity: This will help 
the Company to create better 
working 
environment, 
with 
involvement and ownership of 
people working in Company.
The Company has in place 
policy on Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment in line with the 
requirements of The Sexual 
Harassment 
of 
Women 
at 
the 
Workplace 
(Prevention, 
Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 
2013. All employees (permanent, 
contractual, 
temporary 
and 
trainees) are covered under 
this policy. During the financial 
year 2024-25 no complaints 
regarding child labour, forced 
labour, involuntary labour, sexual 
harassment were received by the 
Company. 
The 
Company 
has 
Joint 
Negotiating 
committee 
represented by workmen to deal 
with employees related issues 
and Long Term Wage Settlement 
is signed periodically.
Positive: Better work 
environment helps to 
produce cost efficient 
quality 
product.

Environment 
Management
Risk 
Risk: Water is a critical input 
material 
in 
our 
production 
process. We have to also ensure 
that we meet air emission 
& 
water 
consumption 
and 
discharge norms.
Our Company has improved 
production 
process 
over 
the years to reduce water 
consumption. Further, it is our 
constant endeavour to increase 
the use of recycled water in 
operation. During the year, 
through various process and 
improvement, we were able to 
reduce the water consumption 
by 12% in 2024-25 as compared 
to 2023-24.   We have online 
monitoring system for Water & Air 
emission.  We need to conserve 
water using 3R principle.  For this 
new technology and equipment 
are being explored and used to 
meet Air & Water norms.
Negative: 
Non-
Compliance of norms 
may lead to closure of 
plant.
6
Coal - 
Availability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Availability of local coal 
is limited. Cost of sourcing 
imported coal is high.
Opportunity: 
To 
look 
for 
opportunity to reduce energy 
(Steam & Power) consumption 
to reduce cost. Also look for non-
fossil fuel energy sources.
We are continuously getting 
technical energy audit done 
and replacing energy inefficient 
equipment with energy efficient 
equipment & technology to 
reduce carbon footprint.
Negative: Increase in 
energy cost due to use 
of high cost imported 
coal.

6.
Performance 
of 
the 
Company 
against the specific commitments,

The Company was able to reduce its energy and water consumption 
during the year as a result of focus on continuous process improvement. 
Performance of the each of the principles is reviewed periodically by 
various Committees led by Management and Board of Directors. 
Achieved 
Environment:
1.	 150.02 lakhs Nos of seedling and saplings were planted against 
the target set for 150 lakhs in 2024-25 covering an area of around 
6841 hectares of Subabul, Casuarina and Eucalyptus plantations to 
improve wood resource availability.
2.	 Water consumption per ton of product has reduced from 52 KL pt 
in 2023-24 to 46 KL pt in 2024-25.
 3.	 Steam consumption per ton of product has reduced from 9.14 MT

4.	 The Company has put in place a waste management system wherein 
the focus is on recycling/ recovering of waste input material to the 
extent possible. Nearly 97% of the chemicals used in pulp cooking 
process are recovered back in the Chemical Recovery Complex and 
recycled. Further, around 25% water used in the process is recycled 
and reused. Fly ash is being used for making eco-bricks.  ETP sludge 
is being used for cardboards/egg tray manufacturing.
Social: 
More focus is being given on training, behaviour, health and safety 
aspect and to improve work environment by involving top to bottom 
personnel. Effective implementation of these programs has positively 
reflected in reduction in injuries among permanent workers and lead 
to zero fatal incidents in FY 2023-24 and FY2024-25.
Our organization continued to engage with communities and provide 
necessary support to marginalised and vulnerable communities
