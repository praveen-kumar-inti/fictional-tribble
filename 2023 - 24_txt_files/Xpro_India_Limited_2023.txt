Social responsibility 
towards society 
Opportunity 
Returning to society has been ingrained 
in the Company’s philosophy. The 
Company has a formalized process of 
earmarking a portion of annual profits 
to support projects fulfilling a social 
obligation.  
Having regard to the Company’s size 
and scope, small steps have been always 
taken at unit level for social and 
inclusive development in the local area; 
however, given the relatively small size 
and geographical spread, it has not 
been practical to undertake directly any 
significant project outside these. The 
Company thus adopts a policy of 
supporting external bodies including 
relevant bodies, NGOs or Government 
Relief Funds selected by the CSR 
Committee, including through 
financial contribution to them. 
Activities supported during the current 
year include promoting education/ 
special education, health-care, 
employment enhancing vocational skills 
especially among children, women and 
the differently abled.

efficiency improvement associated with 
Energy management; Increasing the 
percentage of renewable power is an 
important tool to reduce cost and 
emissions.

Supply Chain 
Management 
Risk and 
Opportunity

hiring the right people, positioning
