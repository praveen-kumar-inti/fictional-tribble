1.
Sustainable 
products 
and 
solutions
Opportunity
The Sustainability Value 
Commitment (SVC) presents 
a significant opportunity for 
3M to lead in the growing 
market for sustainable products 
and solutions. By integrating 
sustainability into every stage 
of our product pipeline, we 
can attract eco-conscious 
consumers, drive innovation, and 
achieve cost efficiencies through 
waste reduction and energy 
savings. This commitment also 
ensures regulatory compliance, 
mitigates legal risks, and 
enhances our brand reputation, 
building trust with stakeholders. 
Ultimately, the SVC aligns with 
3M's long-term sustainability 
goals, contributing to global 
environmental efforts while 
strengthening our market position 
and growth.
-
Positive 
Implications- 
The Sustainability 
Value Commitment 
(SVC) boosts 
3M’s finances 
by attracting 
eco-conscious 
customers, cutting 
production costs, 
ensuring regulatory 
compliance, and 
enhancing brand 
reputation, driving 
sustainable growth 
and profitability.
2.
Safety of 
products 
and services
Risk
Any health and safety incident 
related to our products poses 
a risk of injury or harm to our 
customers, which can lead to 
legal liabilities, damage to our 
brand reputation, and financial 
losses.
By continuously improving product 
safety standards, implementing 
rigorous testing protocols, and 
swiftly addressing any issues through 
transparent communication and prompt 
recalls if necessary, we can mitigate 
risks, protect customer trust, and 
reinforce our commitment to safety and 
quality.
3M provides a TDS (Technical Data 
Sheet) and an MSDS (Material Safety 
Data Sheet) for each of its products 
which carry information on product 
usage, hazard status, storage 
conditions, shelf life, and disposal 
methodologies.
Negative 
Implication – 
Health and safety 
incidents can 
decrease product 
demand, impact 
brand reputation, 
and lead to financial 
losses through legal 
expenses and trust-
building efforts.
Opportunity
However, such incidents 
also present an opportunity 
for us to demonstrate our 
commitment to customer 
safety and product quality, 
by proactively addressing the 
issue, implementing corrective 
actions, and showcasing our 
high-quality products that meet 
stringent safety standards, 
thereby enhancing customer 
trust, strengthening our brand 
reputation, and driving business 
growth.
Positive 
Implications 
- Effective 
management of 
health and safety 
incidents enhances 
customer trust and 
brand reputation, 
potentially leading 
to increased sales 
and market share.

Health and 
Safety of 
employees
Risk
Employee health and safety pose 
a risk to 3M due to potential 
accidents, health issues, 
increased costs, reduced 
productivity, and potential legal 
liabilities, impacting human 
resources and overall operational 
efficiency.
At 3M India, we prioritise employee 
health and safety with rigorous training, 
regular health screenings, and strict 
compliance with safety regulations. 
We foster a culture of awareness, 
utilise advanced technologies, and 
engage employees to ensure a safe and 
supportive workplace environment
Negative 
Implications - 
Employee health 
and safety incidents 
can have significant 
implications for 
the entity. These 
incidents can 
result in medical 
expenses, 
regulatory 
penalties, reduced 
productivity, 
and challenges in 
recruitment and 
retention. 
4.
Climate 
change 
and GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Failure to address climate change 
and reduce GHG emissions poses 
a risk to 3M India's operations, 
reputation, and financial 
performance.
3M India has undertaken projects to 
contribute to 3M Global goals towards 
reducing energy, water and waste 
management (Refer initiative details in 
Principle 6)
Negative 
Implication: 
- Increased 
operational costs 
- Regulatory fines 
- Exposure to 
climate-related risks 
and disruptions, 
potentially leading 
to financial losses
Opportunity
Reducing GHG emissions and 
investing in renewable energy 
enhance efficiency, mitigate 
regulatory risks, and lower long-
term costs. Our commitment to 
climate action strengthens brand 
reputation, and attracts eco-
conscious customers. Embracing 
climate resilience positions 
us as sustainability leaders, 
ensuring growth amidst climate 
challenges.
Positive 
Implications- 
Reducing GHG 
emissions, 
mitigates 
regulatory risks. 
This commitment 
strengthens brand 
reputation, attracts 
eco-conscious 
customers, and 
boosts investor 
confidence.
5.
Ethical and 
transparent 
business 
practices
Risk
Failure to uphold ethical standards 
and transparency at 3M India 
could lead to reputational 
damage, regulatory scrutiny, and 
legal liabilities.
The Company mitigates risks through 
robust compliance programmes, 
regular audits, comprehensive ethical 
training, fostering a culture of integrity, 
and transparent communication with 
stakeholders.
Negative 
Implication: 
Reputational 
impact, regulatory 
fines, and 
diminished investor 
confidence.
Opportunity
Implementing ethical and 
transparent business practices 
enhances trust, attracts 
stakeholders, and strengthens 
corporate governance at 3M 
India, driving sustainable 
growth and leadership in the 
marketplace.
Positive 
Implications 
- Ethical and 
transparent 
practices enhance 
brand reputation, 
attract loyal 
stakeholders,

6.
Community 
health, 
safety and 
well being
Risk
The impact of community health, 
safety, and well-being issues 
on 3M India includes potential 
regulatory scrutiny, operational 
disruptions, reputational 
damage, and legal liabilities, 
which can affect business 
continuity and stakeholder trust.
The Company’s community philosophy 
is enshrined in the CSR policy which 
states that it seeks to engage in 
outcome-based CSR programmes that 
will impact and enrich the communities 
around its areas of operation.
The interventions are mapped to the 
activities listed under Schedule VII of 
the Companies Act 2013 and to the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
broadly falling under the three focus 
themes of Education, Community & 
Environment.
Negative 
Implications - 
Community health, 
safety, and well-
being issues can 
increase regulatory 
costs, disrupt 
operations, lead 
to legal expenses, 
and impact brand  
reputation.
7.
Water 
usage and 
availability
Risk
Operating in a water-stressed 
area poses a significant risk to 
the Company’s operations due 
to the potential scarcity of a 
critical resource. Water stress 
can lead to restrictions on water 
usage, increased costs for 
water, and potential conflicts 
with local communities and 
other water users. It can also 
impact the Company’s ability to 
expand or maintain operations in 
the region.
3M’s 2023 global manufacturing 
locations were evaluated using the 
Aqueduct™ Water Risk Atlas stress-level 
screening tool, Aqueduct 3.0. 
To mitigate this risk, the Company 
has initiated a water conservation and 
management programme in Shirur 
Taluk where the entity’s manufacturing 
site is located (Ranjangaon) to develop 
sustainable water resources and 
infrastructure. This includes watershed 
interventions, rainwater harvesting, 
and community engagement to build 
local water management capabilities. 
By elevating water levels in aquifers and 
enhancing irrigation, the Company is 
working to secure its water supply and 
support the local community.
Negative 
Implications - If 
the risk is not 
adequately 
managed it could 
lead to increased 
operational costs, 
potential fines 
or penalties for 
overuse of water 
resources, and 
reputational 
damage.
Opportunity
The Company’s initiative to 
establish a multi-year water 
conservation and management 
programme in the water-
stressed Ranjangaon area 
presents an opportunity to 
address water scarcity and build 
sustainable water management 
practices. The project aims to 
conserve and harvest rainwater, 
elevate groundwater levels, and 
benefit the local community, 
which aligns with 3M’s goal of 
engaging with water-stressed 
communities on community-
wide water management 
approaches.
Positive 
Implications - The 
initiative can lead 
to cost savings 
in the long term 
through improved 
water efficiency 
and potentially 
lower water costs. 
Additionally, 
the Company 
may benefit 
from enhanced 
community 
relations and a 
stronger brand 
image.

The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework is under implementation within the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules and its subsequent amendments. Under this regime, it is the responsibility of entities to 
ensure the processing of their plastic packaging waste. This can be achieved through recycling or end-of-life 
disposal methods, which include co-processing, waste-to-energy conversion, plastic-to-oil transformation, 
utilisation in road construction, or industrial composting.
Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Annual Report 2023-24 | 125
Pre-consumer plastic packaging waste from each 3M India site is channelised to the Pollution Control Board 
approved plastic waste processors for end-of-life waste management activities such as recycling or coprocessing.
Post-consumer plastic packaging waste management is executed by registered Plastic Waste Processors (PWP) 
through tie-ups with urban local bodies, logistic partners for collecting and transporting plastic waste and a 
network of collection centers located across India.
In accordance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules & guidelines, starting in 2023, 3M India has been 
fulfilling its Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations for plastic packaging by acquiring EPR credits 
through the Centralised Extended Producers Responsibility Portal for Plastic Packaging, which is developed, 
governed, and maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board. The collection and processing of plastic waste 
on the ground is executed by plastic waste processors, that are authorised and monitored by the CPCB/SPCB.
Annually, 3M India meets the plastic packaging waste targets mandated by the Central Pollution Control Board, 
which is brand agnostic and geography neutral. These targets are segmented into three categories:
Category I, which pertains to rigid plastic packaging.
Category II, which includes flexible plastic packaging, single-layered or multi-layered (comprising more than 
one layer with various types of plastic), as well as plastic sheets or covers made of plastic sheet, carry bags, 
and sachets or pouches.
Category III, which involves multi-layered plastic packaging that contains at least one layer of plastic combined 
with one or more layers of material other than plastic. 
	
 (b) 	 E-waste
E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022 rules is applicable for every manufacturer, producer, consumer, bulk 
consumer, collection centers, dealers, e-retailer, refurbisher, dismantler and recycler involved in the 
manufacture, sale, transfer, purchase, collection, storage and processing of e-waste or electrical and electronic 
equipment listed in Schedule I, including their components, consumables, parts and spares which make the 
product operational.
The responsibility of disposal of e-waste has been assigned to producers of notified Electrical & Electronic 
Equipment (EEE) under the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Under the EPR regime, producers 
of EEE, are given annual e-waste collection and recycling targets based on the generation from the previously 
sold EEE.
For FY 23-24, the entity has an obligation to report for product categories like Variable Messaging Signs (VMS), 
Polishers, Dust extraction machines and a few medical products (Antivac, sterilisation machine, etc.) as per 
the guidelines outlined in Schedule 1.
  	
(c)	 Hazardous waste
Hazardous waste generated at the entity’s manufacturing locations are disposed as per the Hazardous and Other 
Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Amendment Rules, 2022 which is managed by the entity’s 
Environment Health & Safety Department.
Products sold by the entity are categorised as hazardous waste after their end of life based on the hazard, the 
nature and area of application. As a part of the regulatory assessment during new product introduction, every 
product before its launch is checked to see if it falls within the scope of these rules after the shelf life. Accordingly, 
the applicability is communicated to the end customer through Section 15 of 3M’s Material Safety Data Sheet 
(MSDS).
	
(d)  	 Other waste
The Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR), notified in 2022, replace the Battery (Management & Handling) 
Rules, 2001. These rules apply to producers, dealers, and consumers involved in the collection, segregation, 
transportation, refurbishing, and recycling of all types of batteries, regardless of their chemistry, shape, 
volume, weight, material composition, or use.
126 | 3M India Limited
As a producer, 3M India has registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to comply with the new 
BWMR. While the entity is not currently generating any battery waste, it has established processes to meet the 
collection and recycling targets outlined in Schedule II of the Extended Producer Responsibility rules.
Furthermore, 3M India will submit an Extended Producer Responsibility plan to the CPCB by June 30th each year. 
This plan will detail the quantity, weight, and dry weight of battery materials for the batteries manufactured in 
the preceding financial year, provided through the centralised portal.
4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No).
	
Yes.
	
If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards?
	
Yes, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for plastic packaging is applicable to 3M India. In accordance with the 
Plastic Waste Management Rules and its subsequent amendments, the entity’s waste management plan aligns with the 
EPR guidelines, adhering to the targets mandated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). 3M India is registered 
as a Brand Owner on the CPCB’s Centralised Extended Producers Responsibility Portal for Plastic Packaging, which 
also facilitates the EPR wallet credit exchange on the portal. The entity has fully met its EPR obligations for FY 23-24, 
by reporting its plastic packaging waste footprint on the EPR portal and has purchased corresponding plastic EPR 
credits equivalent to 1,569 metric tonnes from plastic waste processors authorised by the Pollution Control Board.
	
For FY 22-23, e-waste registration as a producer has been completed and EPR targets have been met. A new 
authorised recycler was onboarded by the entity to fulfil the EPR obligations for e-waste. The 4 metals viz., Gold, 
Iron, Aluminum and Copper were extracted from the E-waste generated. The below table shows the details of metals 
extracted from the e-waste.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No)
Yes.
	
	
If yes, the coverage of such a system?
3M continually strives to maintain the highest standards of safety across all workplaces to ensure that people, 
assets, and our businesses operate in the most efficient manner. All our manufacturing facilities are certified with 
ISO 45001, the international standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, reinforcing 
our commitment to leadership in safety and health. We utilise the Compliance & Audit Management & Metrics 
System (CAMMS) portal, customised to 3M’s requirements, to track and monitor all applicable EHS compliance 
and legal obligations.
Initiatives like the ‘SEE & ACT’ programme help strengthen the safety culture at our sites by involving workers on 
the shop floor and empowering them to take ownership of unsafe acts and problem-solve for improved safety.
ZERO Lost Time Injury is a key metric for upholding safety performance. All manufacturing sites were able to 
maintain ZERO Lost Time Injuries during the year due to a continuous focus on preventive actions.
The Company’s EHS Cultural Excellence programme outlines the execution model and manufacturing excellence 
principles to ensure a safe and healthy workforce. This framework includes sections on ergonomics, industrial 
hygiene, process hazard management (PHM), ventilation programmes, static management plans, combustible 
dust management, safety training, and health and wellness programmes.
Our progress against each of these parameters is assessed through regular audits.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
The entity proactively identifies risks and mitigates them through programmes like High Hazard Activity (HHA), 
Safety Hour and See & Act.
Our Process Hazard Management workbook identifies process safety risks and their mitigation plans. Risk 
Assessment for Machine (RAM) identifies machine safety risks. The Ergonomic Job Risk Analyzer tool addresses 
ergonomic risks and Job Safety Analysis assesses non-routine activities.
Each of these tools are specially curated to handle various types of risks. The actions arising from these risk 
assessments are tracked electronically in our ‘EHS 360’ tool for completion with proper evidence for closure.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks?
Yes.
The entity has an EHS cultural acceleration programme which engages employees to take initiative to create safe 
environments, understand and reduce the risks, adhere to safety practices and be comfortable raising concerns.
The ‘SEE & ACT’ programme empowers employees to identify unsafe acts and conditions and understand the 
root cause of their occurrence through dialogue.
Monthly focus themes are observed to drive improvements across each of the EHS categories.
Competencies are enhanced through trainings on various EHS topics like fire safety, process safety, behaviour 
based safety, use of PPEs, first aid, machine safety to name a few.
All these efforts translate into the EHS metrics being achieved. Notably, there has been ZERO Lost Time injuries 
at all three manufacturing sites.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Yes.
All our manufacturing facilities are equipped with fully functional Occupational Health centers that are available 
24x7 for employees and workers with both basic occupational and non-occupational healthcare support.

12. 	Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
We monitor our employees based on their potential exposure to chemical and physical hazards in the workplace. We 
screen for early signs of occupational illnesses to protect workers from further exposure, and we provide medical 
support. We look for trends in the health data of working populations to assure that potential hazards are well 
controlled. Certain employees working on the shop floor who are exposed to certain chemical / physical hazards 
undergo tests like Pulmonary function test (PFT), vision test, Audiogram, etc.
During the year, there were several initiatives introduced to empower employees to take care of occupational health 
related issues. At all the sites, vision tests were conducted for workers. At the Ranjangaon site, Audiogram in a 
calibrated audiometry booth for Noise Conservation areas was conducted. In addition, skin evaluation, complete 
eye test and chest X-rays were done to rule out instances of tuberculosis as a part of Pre-Employment Medical Check 
Up for new hires to the Microbiology Lab. A medical check up was also done for all food handlers and the emergency 
response team members. Employee cab drivers were also covered in the vision and hearing check up.

Our supply chain risk assessment process prioritises higher-risk suppliers while applying to all suppliers. It starts with 
a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) designed to evaluate supplier programmes and determine their compliance with 
our expectations. The SAQ emphasises our Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC) requirements. 3M may follow up with 
a virtual or on-site assessment. Any deficiencies identified are addressed through a Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC) 
Corrective Action Preventive Action (CAPA) process. Follow-up on CAPA may involve additional audits. If a supplier 
is unable or unwilling to resolve identified gaps, the CAPA process escalates to the Responsible Sourcing Supplier 
Issue Escalation process. Should the supplier still be unwilling or unable to address the issues within a reasonable 
timeframe, a cross-functional team will consider alternative actions to resolve the situation.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
We engage with both internal and external stakeholders on economic, environmental, and social topics. During Board 
meetings, business and departmental heads present various relevant topics to the board members, who then provide 
insights and recommend appropriate actions.
At the Board level, the Stakeholder Committee focuses on issues concerning shareholders and investors, while 
the CSR Committee periodically reviews CSR programmes and community investments. The Risk Management 
Committee addresses enterprise risk topics, including ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) issues.
Furthermore, we have established an India ESG Council at a management level dedicated exclusively to discussing 
and addressing ESG topics, ensuring focused and comprehensive oversight in this critical area.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental and 
social topics.
Yes.
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity.
Our plants operate close to rural communities. Our manufacturing teams have established good relations with local 
authorities to learn about local environmental and social challenges. We have developed some of our CSR programmes 
taking into consideration the needs of the local communities.
For instance, during the year under review, the entity initiated a pilot project to understand the water stress in the 
Shirur region through a hydrogeological study in Kendur village and Shirur taluk. The study included visits to the sites, 
interaction with local village authorities and farmers to understand the challenges in the region. A list of villages to 
prioritise was drawn up as per the findings of the study to undertake watershed management activities.
Another example of receiving input is the efforts around establishing the Wonder Tinkering Lab (STEM) initiative in 10 
schools in Shirur. The list of schools was received from the district education authorities and schools were selected 
based on interviews with school management and available facilities to set up the STEM labs.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalised stakeholder groups.
In addition to the examples provided against Q2, our partnership with the Smile Foundation supports the operations 
of 4 mobile health vans in aspirational districts and rural communities. These vans offer a comprehensive range of 
preventive, promotive and curative healthcare services to underserved populations. The villages covered by the 
aspirational districts are located in remote parts, often the nearest district hospital is about 15-30 kms away from the 
locations served by the van. In many instances, the vans act as an extension of healthcare services provided by the 
local Government health departments. The vans have developed good connections with the community and often 
become the first point of contact for medical services. Maternal and Child Healthcare services delivered for the 
community are typically through the Mobile Medical Units.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
3M strongly values human rights, which is a fundamental part of its corporate culture. The Company’s commitment 
to safeguarding and ensuring human rights within its operations is directed by the 3M Code of Conduct. This code 
explicitly supports the right of 3M employees to a workplace that is respectful and dignified.
To oversee these principles, 3M has established an Ethics and Compliance committee. This body is supported by 
extensive frameworks and procedures that are specifically designed to handle grievances effectively. The committee 
has the responsibility of maintaining oversight of Ethics, Compliance, and adherence to the 3M Code of Conduct.
For the purpose of recording, monitoring, and addressing various issues, 3M collaborates with a third-party platform 
called NAVEX. Furthermore, the Company provides its employees with a confidential avenue to report concerns 
through an online portal known as 3M-Ethics.com, where they can file complaints anonymously.
In line with the India POSH regulation, 3M India has taken proactive steps by setting up multiple internal committees 
across its facilities and offices. These committees are led by a designated Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) 
Chair and are bolstered by the support of an external organisation, in line with legal requirements.

3M maintains a strong anti-retaliation policy to protect employees reporting concerns or assisting in investigations. 
Oversight is provided by an Ethics and Compliance committee, ensuring adherence to the 3M Code of Conduct 
through comprehensive frameworks and processes. Utilising the NAVEX platform, issues are recorded, monitored, 
and addressed with transparency. Employees can anonymously log complaints via 3M-Ethics.com, ensuring 
confidentiality. Investigations prioritise anonymity and include measures for disclosed identities. Regular policy 
reviews ensure alignment with best practices and legal requirements, fostering a transparent and supportive workplace 
culture driven by leadership commitment to integrity and accountability.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes.
The entity adheres to 3M Global’s Supplier Responsibility Code (SRC), which sets forth the fundamental expectations 
3M has of its suppliers in key areas such as Management Systems, Labor, Health and Safety, Environment, and 
Ethics. These standards are crucial for the selection and ongoing engagement with all suppliers providing goods or 
services to 3M on a global scale. They lay the groundwork for what 3M deems essential for maintaining a safe and 
healthy work environment, upholding fair labor practices and human resource policies, and managing production 
and distribution processes in a way that reduces negative environmental impact.
Furthermore, 3M incorporates specific clauses in its contracts and purchase order terms that require suppliers to 
self-certify their compliance with all relevant local laws and regulations. Suppliers must also agree to implement 
policies that align with the 3M Supplier Responsibility Code. This includes explicit prohibitions against any form of 
forced labor and coercive practices, such as labor extracted through mental or physical force, physical punishment, 
slavery, or other oppressive labor conditions.

At its manufacturing site in Ranjangaon, Pune, the entity has expanded capacity of its on-site roof top solar plant by 
installing additional 575 kWp of solar panels raising the total capacity to 1,000 kWp. The plant now generates an 
annual power of 13,15,000 kW, reducing carbon emissions annually by 1,100 metric tonnes, contributing to 12% of 
the site’s overall energy. 
	
In 2022, Ranjangaon  site identified methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A  study was undertaken to assess 
vehicle emissions and  opportunities were identified like reduction through carpooling, electric vehicles, and logistics 
optimisation. The site also made an inventory of existing trees planted in the premises and its carbon capture potential. 
By planting more trees with high CO2 storage, the project aimed to enhance the facility’s natural ability to combat 
greenhouse gases. This comprehensive approach provided valuable data to guide future sustainability efforts at 3M 
India.
	
The Bengaluru manufacturing site has partnerships with local utilities to purchase solar power from the grid through

Multi-year water conservation 
and management programme
During FY 23-24, the Company 
undertook a series of watershed 
interventions to conserve 
and harvest rainwater during 
the monsoons. This involved 
putting in place infrastructure 
that would help the local 
communities build and manage 
their own water efforts in the 
future. The initiative focused 
on sustainable management 
and development of soil and 
water resources to contribute 
to tangible groundwater 
supply and prevent further soil 
degradation.
The outcome of the 
initiative is expected to 
influence agricultural 
production by developing 
enhanced irrigation due to 
water level elevation in the 
aquifers. The potential 
impact of this initiative is 
significant, with benefits 
projected to reach more 
than 1000 households 
and a population of 4800+ 
people residing in the 
area.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
Communities can communicate their concerns directly to the entity by sending an email or conveying their issues through

with local authorities and stakeholders, gaining first hand insights into the needs and concerns of the community. 
Additionally, there are field visits held by a third party monitoring and evaluation agency for the communities. 
In collaboration with our NGO partners, we carry out thorough needs assessments before initiating any community 
intervention. These assessments inform the development of tailored programmes, complete with multi-year 
implementation plans designed to monitor and measure progress over time.
We actively incorporate feedback from stakeholders at different stages of the programme implementation. To 
acknowledge significant milestones within our projects and to honor the contributions of community members 
participating in these initiatives, we organise community events and celebrations. These gatherings not only foster 
a sense of shared achievement but also reinforce the collaborative spirit of the interventions.
