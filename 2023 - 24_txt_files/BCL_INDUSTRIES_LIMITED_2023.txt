10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company 
to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such 
wastes.
	
BCL, policy primarily focus on utilizing food grains such as rice, wheat, and maize as raw materials. As a result, these food grains are fully 
utilized with minimal waste. Any small amount of waste generated is entirely biodegradable, ensuring an environmentally friendly production 
process. Our industry uses certain hazardous chemicals, but we always ensure to purchase these chemicals exclusively from licensed vendors. 
We have developed an internal mechanism to store these chemicals in an isolated manner, limiting access to authorized personnel only. 
Additionally, we are committed to minimizing the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our products and processes to ensure safety and 
environmental sustainability.
	
The Company places a strong emphasis on the preservation of natural resources and the       implementation of efficient waste management 
procedures. Its processes for managing plastic waste align with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines under the Plastic 
Waste Management (PWM) Rule 2016. Annually, the Company undertakes the collection, processing, and recycling of post-consumer multi-
layer and non-multilayer plastic packaging waste, in accordance with CPCB guidelines. The operations of the Company do not result in the 
generation of any hazardous waste. Any other waste produced by the Company remains within the permissible limits set by the CPCB/SPCB.

*Our company’s plant is strategically located in Bathinda, Punjab, an area that is well-connected with an extensive network of canals. According 
to recent reports, 80% of the water in this region is surface water, ensuring an abundant supply for our operations. This surface water is utilized 
effectively within our plant for various processes and is also used for irrigation purposes upon discharge, aligning with our commitment to 
sustainable and efficient water management practices.
	
Despite Bathinda receiving limited rainfall, the availability of surface water supports strong agricultural activities in the region. Our plant’s 
strategic location and efficient use of water resources underscore our commitment to sustainable practices and community support.
