Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
As we grow our business, we remain committed to create a positive impact on nature, promote societal wellbeing and 
operate in a transparent manner. We have always looked at intertwining our sustainability agenda into the Company’s 
business objectives and considered our focus on ESG to be a key driver of long term value creation for all our stakeholders. 
We endeavour to bring complete transparency in our disclosures. This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
(“BRSR”) is our third report which covers operations of Asian Paints Limited on a standalone basis. Along with mandatorily 
required BRSR core indicators to be assured, we have further added indicators as part of limited/reasonable assurance to

If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal 
of your products services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective Assessments (LCA) or through any other 
means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same. 
	
There are no significant social/environmental concerns and/or risks arising from the production or disposal of 
products/services. However, based on the LCA study, the Company is working to mitigate identified hotspots in regard 
to the environmental impact of the products. This has been discussed in detail in the Sustainable Operations section 
forming part of this Integrated Annual Report on page 44. The key initiatives are listed below:
	
A.	 Scope 3 emission: The majority of our emissions lie in scope 3 and hence multiple initiatives are being undertaken 
by the Company.
	
	
a.	
Emission reduction through formulation efficiency and process innovations. This results in emission reduction 
at the raw material stage as product life cycle which is a key contributor to Scope 3 emissions. During the year, 
the Company realized a reduction of 30,143 metric tCO2e.
	
	
b.	
Multimodal Transportation: In line with national logistics policies, the Company has adopted multimodal 
transport, using cleaner fuel-powered vehicles. Such initiatives help in reducing the emissions in our outbound 
logistics. These initiatives helped reduce more than 5,500 tCO2e of GHG emissions from  logistics footprint, 
while also optimizing freight costs.
	
B.	
Water Footprint: The Company continue to work extensively to reduce overall water footprint by driving 
water conservation activity within plants, harvesting and utilizing rainwater in process, and water recharge 
and conservation initiatives outside plants. During the year, the Company replenished 387% of freshwater 
consumption. The specific non-process water consumption has been reduced by 54% since 2013-14 to 0.44 KL/KL.
	
C.	
Sustainability Advantaged Products: Our Sustainably Advantaged Products are products that are more 
sustainable than the current norm for the industry and bring tangible sustainability benefits to our customers. 
These include products that provide resource efficiency benefits in use-phase by reducing surface temperature, 
offering longer-lasting performance, providing health and well-being benefits, etc.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 
	
In line with the Company’s Health and Safety Policy, there are various measures taken to ensure access to a safe and 
healthy work-place to all employees and workers. The Company invests in technologies and processes to avoid and 
minimise the manual interfaces with machines. The Company ensures that all statutorily required norms are complied 
with and get third party safety audits done for validation.
	
The Company endeavours to design any new facility by using latest technology and include all possible safety measure 
such that there is near zero risk to human health. At the existing facilities, newer mechanism, machines, and techniques 
are put in place.
	
Performing internal and external studies and surveys:
	
The Company performs various internal and external studies like ‘HIRA’, ‘HAZOP’, chemical risk assessment, fire risk 
assessment, manual material handling assessments, quantitative risk assessment for chemical storage tank and surveys 
relating to structural stability, noise survey, illumination survey, etc. to identify process safety hazards and controls.
	
Safety management systems:
	
The health and safety management system is based on ISO 45001 - the International Standard for Occupational 
Health and Safety and is also designed to cater to the ‘Five Star Integrated Audit’ by British Safety Council which is a 
leading global recognition in the field of Occupational Health and Safety Systems. This covers eight decorative paints 
manufacturing plants, one industrial paints plant, one chemical plant and Research and Technology Centre. It covers 
our workforce including contractor workmen, drivers, cleaners as well as visitors etc.
	
Training:
	
The Company encourages and works on building Behaviour Based Safety Management to encourage adherence to safe 
behaviour and promote safety culture. It provides periodic trainings to employees on the manner of performing such 
assessments/surveys, handling hazardous chemicals and equipment. All employees and workers are trained on safety 
aspects which includes First – aid, Fire – fighting, Onsite Emergency Plan, Work Permit System, HIRA, HAZOP, etc.
	
Use of technology and other safety measures:
	
Most of the paint manufacturing process are automated/semi-automated and are controlled through Distributed 
Control System (DCS) and Manufacturing Excellence System (MES). All the new plants are highly automated with 
conveyors and robotics palletisation to reduce manual material handling thereby, creating safer work environment. 
Moving parts of machineries are equipped with machine guarding mechanism like separately demarcated routes for 
vehicles and pedestrians, installation of convex mirrors at blind corners for Material Handling Equipment (MHE) trucks, 
monitoring speed of all vehicular movements, installation of safety alarms, interlocks to eliminate hazard related to 
moving parts, etc.
	
Over and above, it is ensured that fire protection equipment such as hydrant system, water monitors, foam 
monitors, fire extinguishers, fire detection and sprinkler fire system are provided as per relevant Indian Standards. 
Pre-employment and annual medical examinations are carried out for employees and contractor workmen as per 
Company’s Policy. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are identified for various activities and maintained in the form 
of PPE matrix for each section in the plants conforming to relevant Indian/International Standard as applicable.
	
Road safety initiatives:
	
We understand that road safety is paramount, extending beyond our office premises to the roads our employees 
travel on daily basis. Committed to fostering a culture of safety and responsibility, we have implemented several 
initiatives to create awareness like Touch on Safety (Video Series) - highlighting importance of road safety, Defensive 
Driving Training by Safe Drive India, Simulator Driving Workshop, Infra Changes for ease in travelling, etc.
	
Periodic equipment maintenance, review and testing:
	
There is a well-defined checklist basis which periodic safety inspections are carried out and actions are taken in a time 
bound manner. Regular inspections and maintenance are done by competent persons for various critical equipment, 
with necessary permits wherever needed, ensuring lockout tagout system is implemented.
23
	
Redressal and investigation mechanism:
	
There are Safety Committees constituted at locations to ensure that safe work practices are in place. The Committees 
promote the participation of employees and workers to participate in ensuring workplace safety and have a well laid 
out procedure of investigation for work – related incidents, review and investigation along with implementation of 
corrective and preventive actions.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and 
the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Waste generation is an inevitable part of our manufacturing process, efforts are put in to create value from our waste. 
With an aim to divert a significant quantum of waste from going to landfills, we have adopted systems and procedures 
that help us repurpose used material and reintroduce excess material into our production process. We follow the 
‘3R’ strategy of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle for our waste management. This has resulted in a significant decrease 
in both hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste disposal during the year. Our specific hazardous waste and non-
hazardous waste disposal has been decreased by 77% and 47% respectively from the baseline year of FY 2013-14, at 
our decorative paint manufacturing units.
	
We follow legally prescribed procedures and apply environmentally sound disposal techniques for disposing of 
hazardous waste whereas the non-hazardous waste is sent to authorised recyclers. A detailed description has been 
provided in the Sustainable Operations section forming part of this Integrated Annual Report on page no. 44.
	
Safety and environmental sustainability are integral parts of the product development processes established by the

we have not performed any procedures with respect to prior periods or any other elements included in the Integrated 
Annual Report, which includes the BRSR, other than those listed in Appendix 1 to this report and, therefore, do not express 
any opinion thereon.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information are as follows: 
In respect of the BRSR:

Assurance Report (Contd.)
in relation to the BRSR and the GRI Standards in relation to the sustainability information in the Integrated Annual Report 
which includes the BRSR.
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified Sustainability Information
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of 
different gases.

the ICAI, and the International Standard on Assurance Engagement (“ISAE”) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other 
than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and the ISAE 3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse 
Gas Statements” both issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (collectively referred to as “the 
Standards”). These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Identified Sustainability Information is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. A 
reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability 
Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures referred above, we:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures.
•	
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and /or measurements of 
the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
Made enquiries of Company’s Management, including the various teams such as Sustainability team, Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) team, etc., and those with responsibility for managing Company’s Annual Reporting.
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes, and controls for 
managing, recording and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information as per Appendix 1, including at the sites 
and corporate office visited. This did not include testing of the operating effectiveness of management systems and 
controls.
    43
•	
Based on above understanding, the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing, and extent of further procedures.
•	
Performed substantive testing on a sample basis of the Identified Sustainability Information within the standalone 
boundary to check that data had been appropriately measured with underlying documents recorded, collated, and 
reported. This included assessing records and performing testing, including recalculation of sample data to establish 
an assurance trail.
•	
Checked the consolidation for various sites and corporate office under the standalone reporting boundary (as 
mentioned in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes BRSR) for ensuring the completeness of data being 
reported.
•	
Assessed the level of adherence to GRI Standards and the BRSR followed in preparing the Integrated Annual Report.
•	
Assessed the Integrated Annual Report, which includes BRSR, for detecting, on a test basis, any major anomalies 
between the information reported in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes BRSR, on performance with 
respect to Identified Sustainability Information and the relevant source data/information.
•	
Where applicable for the Identified Sustainability Information in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes BRSR, 
we have relied on the information in the audited standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2024, which were audited by another firm of chartered accountants under the Companies Act, 2013 who, 
vide their report dated May 9, 2024, expressed an unmodified opinion on those financial statements.
•	
Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgments made by the Management 
in the preparation of the Identified Sustainable Information.
•	
Obtained representations from the Company’s Management.
Exclusions
Our reasonable assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix 1 to this report.
•	
Aspects of the Integrated Annual Report, including the BRSR, and data/ information (qualitative or quantitative) 
included in the Integrated Annual Report, including the BRSR, other than the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., the financial year ended March 31, 2024.
•	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intentions provided 
by the Company and testing or assessing any forward-looking assertions and/or data.
Opinion
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information 
and summarised in Appendix 1 to this report and included in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes BRSR, for the

Assurance Report
Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report on Identified Sustainability Information in 
Asian Paints Limited’s Integrated Annual Report, which includes the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report
To the Board of Directors of Asian Paints Limited
We have undertaken to perform a limited assurance engagement for Asian Paints Limited (the “Company”) vide our 
Engagement Letter, in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information referred in “Identified Sustainability Information” 
paragraph below (the “Identified Sustainability Information”) in accordance with the Criteria stated in the “Criteria” 
paragraph below. The Identified Sustainability Information is included in:
(a)	 the “GRI Content Index” section in the Integrated Annual Report of the Company for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024 (the “Integrated Annual Report”); and
(b)	 the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) section of the Integrated Annual Report, prepared by 
the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (the “LODR Regulations”).
This engagement was conducted by a team comprising of assurance practitioners and environment experts.
Identified Sustainability Information
The Identified Sustainability Information for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, is summarised in Appendix 1 to this 
report.
Our limited assurance engagement was with respect to the financial year ended March 31, 2024, information only and we 
have not performed any procedures with respect to prior periods or any other elements included in the Integrated 
Annual Report, which includes the BRSR, other than those listed in Appendix 1 to this report, and therefore, do not 
express any conclusion thereon.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information are as follows:
In respect of the selected BRSR Indicators summarised in Part A – BRSR Indicators in the Appendix 1 to this report and 
included in the BRSR, the criteria used is the set of Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) / metrics under Section A - General 
Disclosures/ Section C - Principle wise Performance Disclosures under the nine Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) principles, as specified by SEBI vide Annexure II to its circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 
July 12, 2023 (the “SEBI Circular”).
In respect of the Identified Sustainability Indicators in the GRI Content Index included in the Integrated Annual Report and 
summarised in Part B – GRI Indicators in the Appendix 1 to this report, the criteria used is the Global Reporting Initiative 
Standards, 2021 (the “GRI Standards”).
Management’s Responsibilities
The Company’s Management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified 
Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, related to reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation, and 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the Integrated Annual Report, 
which includes the BRSR, and measurement of the Identified Sustainability Information, which are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Identified Sustainability Information
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non- financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of 
incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of 
different gases.
48   
Assurance Report (Contd.)
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”) issued by the International Ethics Standard Board for 
Accountants, which is founded on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP (the “Firm”) applies Standard on Quality Control 1 “Quality Control for 
Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services 
Engagements”, the International Standard on Quality Management (“ISQM”) 1 “Quality Management for Firms that 
perform Audits or Reviews of Financials Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements” and ISQM 2 
“Engagement Quality reviews”, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the 
procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance 
Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information” and the Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (SAE) 3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements”, both issued by the Sustainability 
Reporting Standards Board of the ICAI, and the International Standard on Assurance Engagement (“ISAE”) 3000 (Revised) 
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and the ISAE 3410 “Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” both issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board 
(collectively referred to as “the Standards”). These Standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain 
limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of the Criteria 
as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of 
the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response 
to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures referred above, we:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures.
•	
Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and /or measurements of 
the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
Made enquiries of Company’s Management, including the various teams such as Sustainability team, Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) team, etc., and those with the responsibility for managing Company’s Annual Reporting.
•	
Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the key systems and processes for managing, recording, 
and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information as per Appendix 1, including at the sites and corporate office 
visited. This did not include testing of the design and operating effectiveness of management systems and controls.
•	
Based on above understanding, the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing, and extent of further procedures.
•	
Checked the consolidation for the standalone boundary (as mentioned in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes 
the BRSR) for ensuring the completeness of data being reported.
    49
•	
Performed limited substantive testing on a sample basis of the Identified Sustainability Information within the 
standalone boundary to check that data had been appropriately measured with underlying documents recorded, 
collated, and reported. This included assessing records and performing testing, including recalculation of sample data 
to establish an assurance trail.
•	
Assessed the level of adherence to GRI Standards and BRSR followed by the Company in preparing the Integrated 
Annual Report, which includes the BRSR.
•	
Assessed the Integrated Annual Report, which includes the BRSR, for detecting, on a test basis, any major anomalies 
between the information reported in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes the BRSR, on performance with 
respect to Identified Sustainability Information and relevant source data/information.
•	
Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgments made by the Management 
in the preparation of the Identified Sustainable Information.
•	
Obtained representations from the Company’s Management.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 
for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance 
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Identified Sustainability 
Information have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Exclusions
Our limited assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express a conclusion on the same:
•	
Operations of the Company other than the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix 1 to this report.
•	
Aspects of the Integrated Annual Report, including the BRSR, and data/ information (qualitative or quantitative) 
included in the Integrated Annual Report, including the BRSR, other than the Identified Sustainability Information.
•	
Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., the financial year ended March 31, 2024.
•	
The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided 
by the Company and testing or assessing any forward-looking assertions and/or data.
Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information and summarised in Appendix 1 to this report and included 
in the Integrated Annual Report, which includes the BRSR, for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
