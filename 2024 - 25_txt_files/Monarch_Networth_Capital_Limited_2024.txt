and grow its revenues. 
Poor employee well-
being can result in 
increased absenteeism, 
decreased productivity, 
and higher healthcare 
costs. Lack of diversity 
and inclusion in the 
workplace can lead to 
difficulty attracting and 
retaining top talent.

prioritizes robust 
people practices 
aimed at fostering 
overall employee 
growth. This includes 
health and wellbeing 
initiatives, adherence 
to fair pay norms, 
equal opportunity 
for all and 
extensive training 
programmes.
Positive:
By focusing on 
human capital 
development, the 
Company can

efficiency and drive 
innovation.
Negative: 
Neglecting human

As the Company is engaged primarily in financial services and does not manufacture physical goods or 
operate facilities with significant environmental impact, the requirements for standalone policies under 
Principle 2 and Principle 6 are of limited applicability. The Company nonetheless remains committed to 
ethical business conduct and broadly upholds principles of environmental responsibility in its operations. 
Should there be any material change in business activities resulting in increased relevance of these 
Principles, the Company will review and adopt appropriate policies as necessary.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation.
	
No, the entity has not implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge (‘ZLD’). As a financial services 
company, the entity’s operations are primarily office-based and do not involve significant industrial 
processes or activities that generate large volumes of process wastewater. Water usage is limited to 
domestic purposes such as sanitation, pantry services, and cleaning. Accordingly, liquid waste generated 
is comparable to typical municipal wastewater, which is managed in compliance with local municipal 
and building regulations. Due to minimal water consumption and the absence of industrial effluents, a 
ZLD system is not relevant to the entity’s operations. However, the company is committed to sustainable 
water management and believes in judicious use of water in line with environmental best practices and 
regulatory requirements.
