Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
It is my immense privilege to present 
Bandhan Bank’s Annual Report for the 
year ended March 31, 2024. Throughout 
the year, the Board has focussed on 
ensuring your Bank’s progress towards 
long-term strategic goals, including 
portfolio and geographical diversification, 
while building new capabilities to unlock 
further value-generating opportunities. 
Today, with a presence in 35 states and 
union territories in India, nearly 6,300 
banking outlets, and a loyal customer 
base of over 3.35 crore, your Bank is 
successfully executing its strategy and 
progressing on the path to becoming 
a stronger universal bank. Moreover, 
your Bank continues to have a positive 
and significant impact on its customers 
and the wider communities, reiterating 
its steadfast commitment to inclusive 
banking in line with your Bank’s 
philosophy of Aapka Bhala, Sabki Bhalai.
Indian Economic Review
Against the backdrop of global 
uncertainty, India continues to be an 
outlier in terms of GDP growth. In  
FY 23-24, the economy grew by a robust 
8.2%, driven primarily by strong growth 
in investments, manufacturing, and 
government spending. The growth in 
investments is particularly significant 
for the revival of the capital expenditure 
cycle, which supports long-term 
economic growth. Despite the challenges,  
Bandhan Bank has shown remarkable 
resilience and is well-positioned to 
navigate these uncertain times.
However, since mid-2022, investments 
and GDP growth have recovered much 
faster than consumption. This divergence 
is significant, as household consumption 
accounts for approximately 60% of 
nominal GDP. One of the primary reasons 
for muted household consumption has 
been the lagged impact of the pandemic 
across consumer segments, exacerbated 
by subsequent global uncertainties. 
However, it is heartening to witness 
that, of late, high-frequency indicators 
have started improving, including for 
the rural economy.
After a challenging fiscal deficit of 9.2% 
of GDP in FY 20-21 due to COVID-related 
expenditures, India’s fiscal landscape has 
shown remarkable resilience, with the 
deficit narrowing to 5.6% of GDP by  
FY 23-24, and is likely to be 4.9% in 
FY 24-25. India has also largely managed 
to steer its inflation trajectory well, with 
retail inflation staying within the Reserve 
Bank of India’s 2-6% target range since 
a spike in mid-2023, and the policy 
repo rate has remained unchanged 
at 6.5% since February 2023. Among 
other indicators of robust economic 
performance, the total gross GST 
collection during FY 23-24 surpassed 
the ₹20 lakh crore milestone, registering 
an 11.7% increase compared to 
the previous year.
One of the major drivers behind 
India’s resilient growth narrative is the 
digitalisation of the economy. Initiatives like 
Aadhaar, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), 
and widespread Internet penetration have 
helped formalise the economy and drive 
financial inclusion. Key initiatives such as 
the PM Jan Dhan Yojana, which has notably 
increased the percentage of women with 
bank accounts, along with the Skill India 
Mission, Start-Up India, and Stand-Up India, 
have also significantly impacted the socio-
economic landscape.
Indian Banking Sector’s  
Performance
The pressures on asset quality from the 
previous credit cycle are subsiding, creating 
a favourable business environment and 
bolstering the banking sector’s growth 
potential. Bank loans grew by 16.3% in  
FY 23-24, compared to 15% in the previous 
year. This growth figure excludes the impact 
of a major bank merger. The demand for 
credit in the past year was driven by a wide 
variety of sectors, such as agriculture and 
allied activities, industry, and services.
The lending patterns of banks witnessed 
some changes during the year. Lending to 
large companies recovered, with credit 
to industry growing by 8.5% compared 
to 5.6% in the previous year. However, 
the growth of personal loans moderated 
as unsecured loans slowed to 20.8% 
compared with 26.7% in the previous 
year. This lower growth rate followed 
As Bandhan Bank embarks on 
a new era of growth, a strong 
leadership team is critical for 
steering the next phase of this 
journey. In FY 22-23, the Bank 
announced the appointment  
of Ratan Kumar Kesh as 
the Chief Operating Officer. 
The Board was delighted to 
welcome Rajinder Kumar 
Babbar, Chief Business Officer, 
in the year in review.

Bandhan Bank Limited
the Reserve Bank of India’s decision 
to increase risk weights for unsecured 
consumer loans and credit cards. While 
these measures have led to higher capital 
costs for institutions and impeded the 
growth of such loans, they will ultimately 
create a more robust and transparent 
financial system.
Additionally, for the first time, the 
combined net profit of listed public and 
private sector banks exceeded ₹3.1 lakh 
crore, a 39% increase from ₹2.2 lakh 
crore in the previous year. Meanwhile, 
the GNPA ratio of scheduled commercial 
banks continued its downward trend, 
reducing to a 12-year low of 2.8% by the 
end of FY 23-24, from 3.9% a year earlier. 
This underscores the improvement in 
asset quality and the overall health of the 
banking sector.
Bandhan Bank’s Progress
Your Bank delivered a stable performance 
in FY 23-24, with deposits, gross 
advances, and net interest income 
recording good growth. While Profit 
after Tax (PAT) registered a relatively 
subdued growth during the year, it was 
due to technical write-offs and increased 
provisions made as a prudent measure. 
These technical write-offs primarily 
pertain to loans within the Emerging 
Entrepreneurs Business portfolio, which 
faced headwinds during the pandemic 
and have a long vintage. On an underlying 
basis, adjusting for these one-offs would 
make PAT growth considerably higher. 
The capital adequacy ratio reflects a 
well-capitalised balance sheet, ensuring 
financial stability and resilience.
One of the major highlights of the year 
was the successful transition to a new 
Core Banking System (CBS), aligning 
with the Bank’s near-term vision of 
transforming its IT capabilities. The Bank 
is also building a robust surround system 
to create a tech stack that will align well 
with the Bank’s focus on deposit-led 
assets growth, as also deepening the 
relationship with customers with focus 
on cross-sell initiatives leveraging data 
and analytics. 
Further strengthening portfolio quality 
remains a critical focus for the Bank. In 
line with this objective, the Bank plans to 
invest in dedicated credit and collections 
verticals, leverage data analytics and 
technology, and use early warning 
systems. Additionally, the Bank will 
continue to improve its portfolio quality 
by leveraging customer relationships. 
The Bank also aims to grow its asset book 
by improving the portfolio mix, with a 
greater emphasis on secured assets.
Strengthening the 
Leadership Team
As Bandhan Bank embarks on a new era 
of growth, a strong leadership team is 
critical for steering the next phase of this 
journey. In FY 22-23, the Bank announced 
the appointment of Ratan Kumar Kesh 
as the Chief Operating Officer. The Board 
was delighted to welcome Rajinder Kumar 
Babbar, Chief Business Officer, in the year 
in review. The Bank also appointed Rajeev 
Mantri as the new Chief Financial Officer. 
The core management team was further 
strengthened with the appointment 
of Gopalkrishnan Santosh, Head – 
Mortgages and Consumer Lending, 
and Satish Kumar – Head – Wholesale 
Banking. With this evolved leadership 
team bringing a wealth of experience 
and domain knowledge, the Bank is now 
on a stronger footing to drive its future 
strategic direction.
In April 2024, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, 
Managing Director & Chief Executive 
Officer, announced his decision to retire 
upon the completion of his tenure on  
July 9, 2024. His contribution as 
the founder of Bandhan Bank is 
immeasurable, having grown the 
organisation from a microfinance 
institution to a universal bank employing 
over 75,000 people and remaining 
steadfastly committed to financial 
inclusion. On behalf of the Board, 
management, and all the employees 
of the Bank, we extend our deepest 
thanks and appreciation to him for his 
exceptional leadership over the years. 
His passion and expertise have built 
Bandhan Bank into an organisation deeply 
rooted in values and one that truly brings 
transformational impact on the lives 
of many. We wish him the best for his 
future endeavours.
In line with the Bank’s Business Continuity 
Plan and Succession Plan, the Board 
has appointed a search firm to identify 
potential candidates for the role of 
Managing Director & Chief Executive 
Officer. In the interim, Ratan Kumar 
Kesh has assumed the responsibility 
of the MD & CEO.
Looking Ahead
Despite various global uncertainties, 
India’s macroeconomic parameters 
remain strong. The RBI projects GDP 
growth of 7.2% and CPI inflation of 4.5% 
for FY 24-25. Subsiding inflationary 
pressures, combined with the realisation 
of a likely normal monsoon, may open 
up the possibility of rate cuts by the RBI 
in the second half of FY 24-25. A normal 
monsoon is also expected to revive rural 
demand, leading to an increase in private 
consumption growth. Economic growth is 
further expected to be driven by a rise in 
private corporate investments.
Against this favourable backdrop, the 
Indian banking sector is well-positioned 
to sustain its growth momentum. While 
the anticipation of an RBI rate cut may 
result in some margin adjustments due to 
the possible re-pricing of advances, it also 
presents opportunities for more affordable 
borrowing. Although loan growth might 
experience moderation if deposit growth 
does not accelerate, the sector remains 
resilient. Additionally, by proactively 
addressing risks related to geopolitical 
tensions, fluctuating crude oil prices, and 
weather variations affecting agricultural 
output, the sector can continue to 
contribute positively to economic growth 
projections across various segments.
Looking forward, your Bank is well-
positioned to benefit from the unfolding 
economic growth due to its trusted 
customer relationships, extensive 
geographic reach, excellent product 
portfolio, digital transformation, 
strengthened leadership, and enduring 
commitments to financial inclusion, 
community impact, and business 
sustainability. The focus remains on 
providing accessible, simple, cost-effective, 
and innovative financial solutions to 
support the growth aspirations of our 
customers and India. In this journey, we 
thank you for your continued trust and 
belief in Bandhan Bank.
Warm regards, 
Dr. Anup Kumar Sinha

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present to you the Annual 
Report of your Bank for the financial 
year 2023-24. The year was a landmark 
year for your Bank, as we saw a surge in 
your Bank’s deposit-led assets growth. 
A key driving factor in this growth was 
the new technology stack that the Bank

as well. All of these, put together, ensured 
that the financial year ended on a

in review with respect to technology, 
people, and business transformation 
have made your Bank more resilient 
and future-ready, establishing a 
robust foundation for the next phase 
of its growth, and in the making of 
Bandhan Bank 2.0.
Operating Environment
Despite uncertainties in the global 
economic landscape, India has 
maintained steady momentum. Through 
timely and effective policy actions aimed 
at achieving macroeconomic stability, 
along with transformative scale-up 
in physical and digital infrastructure, 
India has successfully navigated both 
domestic and global challenges. This 
has ensured the continuation of a high 
growth trajectory, with the GDP growth 
rate at 8.2% for FY 23-24.
Against this positive economic backdrop, 
the performance of the Indian banking 
sector has been encouraging. Despite 
higher interest rates, bank credit has 
increased by 16% – the fastest growth in a 
decade. This expansion is driven by a strong 
post-pandemic recovery and sustained 
demand for retail loans, with corporate 
loan demand also on the rise due to private 
sector growth. While garnering deposits 
was a challenge for the industry for a 
good part of the year in review, in the last 
quarter, we saw deposits jump back. An 
indication of this is the lowering of the CD 
ratio of banks.
Performance Review
Your Bank’s strategic investments in people, 
technology, and distribution over recent 
years have significantly enhanced its ability 
to leverage the favourable operating 
environment. Additionally, during FY 23-24, 
your Bank implemented several measures 
to deepen the relationship with customers 
and drive preference and loyalty. These 
efforts were supported by digital and 
analytics initiatives aimed at boosting 
employee productivity.
Significant developments

MD & CEO’s Message
12
Bandhan Bank Limited
Customer’s trust in your Bank remains 
strong, as reflected by the addition 
of 0.36 crore customers in the year in 
review, marking an increase of 12% 
year-on-year. This growth has expanded 
the total customer base to 3.36 crore. 
Moreover, the total number of customer 
transactions has impressively grown by 
47% year-on-year. Similarly, in terms 
of transaction value, there has been a 
robust increase of 33% year-on-year, 
reflecting sustained and expanding 
customer engagement.
Once again outpacing industry growth 
of 14%, your Bank’s total deposits grew 
by 25.1% to reach ₹1,35,202 crore as of 
March 31, 2024. The Bank has continued 
to focus strongly on granular retail 
deposits, as evidenced by the share of 
retail deposits to total deposits, which 
stood at 69.4%. CASA deposits, standing 
at ₹50,151 crore as of March 31, 2024, 
have shown impressive growth of 18.1% 
year-on-year. Despite tight liquidity in the 
market, the CASA ratio remains healthy at 
37.1%. Of the total deposits of your Bank, 
microfinance customers contribute to 
only about 4% of the total deposits.
For the fiscal year, overall advances 
registered a growth of 14.3%, reaching 
₹1,24,721 crore as on March 31, 2024. 
This growth in the loan book reflects an 
uptick across different asset verticals, 
aligning with your Bank’s near-term vision 
of diversifying its asset book.
For the year in review, the Emerging 
Entrepreneurs Business (EEB) portfolio 
has demonstrated healthy growth. It 
added more than 21 lakh new borrowers 
and grew by 10.2% year-on-year. 
Consistent with your Bank’s diversification 
strategy, group loans now constitute 
about 32.7% of the overall loan portfolio, 
down from 59.4% as on March 31, 2021. 
The growth within retail and commercial 
banking has been particularly impressive; 
the retail loan book (excluding housing 
loans) surged by 0.6% year‑on‑year, and 
the commercial banking vertical grew 
by 33.6% year-on-year. Additionally, the 
housing finance book has registered a 
growth of 11.2%.
Aligning with your Bank’s medium-term 
strategic goals, and the focus on the 
secured portfolio, the proportion of 
secured assets in the total loan book 
stands at 42.6% in FY 23-24.
Your Bank’s overall collection efficiency 
(excluding NPA) has remained stable  for 
the year. There has been an improvement 
in asset quality, with Gross NPA and Net 
NPA for FY 23-24 at 3.84% and 1.11%, 
respectively, compared to 4.87% and 
1.17% in the previous year. I would like 
to highlight that for the loans disbursed 
post-2022, your Bank is showing strong 
performance, characterised by a good 
recovery rate and low slippage. To provide 
more context, the FY 23-24 loan book, 
consisting of all loans disbursed from 
April 2023, has demonstrated robust 
performance, with a reduction in gross 
NPA. This underlines a positive outlook  
for your Bank’s financial health.
The encouraging operational performance 
has translated into strong financial 
metrics for FY 23-24. The net profit 
stood at ₹2,230 crore, up by 1.6% from 
₹2,195 crore in the previous year. The Net 
Interest Income (NII) reached ₹10,326 
crore, compared to ₹9,259 crore in the 
previous year, registering a growth of 
11.5%. Total credit costs have remained 
stable at 3.39%, while delivering an RoA 
of 1.44% and ROEs of 10.65% for the year.
Geographic Diversification
As a pan-India bank, Bandhan Bank 
remains steadfast in its mission to 
expand its geographic footprint across 
the country. Your Bank also emphasises 
building a robust network spanning 
diverse market segments – from 
metropolitan areas and Tier 1 cities to 
small towns and rural hinterlands – driven 
by the objective of serving the needs of 
emerging India and being a bank for all. 
This expansion approach has enabled the 
Bank to cater to a broader customer base 
and solidify its position as a bank for all.
A landmark achievement in terms of 
geographical expansion was your Bank’s 
entry into the union territory of Ladakh 
with branches in Leh and Kargil. In the 
year in review, your Bank bolstered its 
distribution by adding 289 branches and 
9 banking units. As a result, it now has 
6,297 banking units across 35 states and 
union territories across the country. While 
the Bank continues to hold its strength in 
the East of the country, significant strides 
have also been made in alignment with 
the strategic objective of geographic 
diversification, with non-east regions 
now constituting 55% (including 10% 
in NE) of your Bank’s outlets, and rest 
45% is only East.
While the Bank continues to 
hold its strength in the East 
of the country, significant 
strides have also been 
made in alignment with 
the strategic objective of 
geographic diversification.

IT and Digital Transformation
Your Bank’s successful transition to a 
new Core Banking System (CBS) was 
among the biggest highlights of the 
year. A migration from one CBS to 
another at the scale that your Bank 
did, is unprecedented. I am happy to 
inform you that despite the challenges 
that the scale presented, your Bank was 
able to complete the migration without 
major disruption of banking services for 
customers. This migration represents the 
initial phase of your Bank’s technological 
transformation journey.
In conjunction with the CBS migration, 
your Bank also launched an all-new 
omni-channel online banking experience. 
The new Internet banking platform and 
mBandhan mobile app provide seamless 
banking experiences to customers. 
Leveraging the new CBS and surround 
systems, your Bank is positioned to 
become more agile, introduce innovative 
products and services, use data and 
analytics more effectively, and foster 
seamless banking experiences.
The strengthening of your Bank’s digital 
capabilities is evident in its improved 
digital banking performance. Presently, 
around 95% of the total general banking 
transactions occur digitally, with 
digital registrations recording a 21% 
year‑on‑year increase. Additionally, digital 
transaction volume has surged by 52% 
year-on-year, while UPI transactions 
have grown by an impressive 51%. The 
increasing transition to digital channels 
highlights customers’ trust in your 
Bank’s digital solutions and underscores 
your Bank’s steadfast commitment to 
delivering seamless banking experiences.
Further, your Bank’s advanced digital 
infrastructure has unlocked new growth 
opportunities. I am pleased to announce 
that your Bank has been empanelled for 
central and state government businesses. 
Additionally, the states of Assam and 
Meghalaya have authorised your Bank 
to integrate the Electronic Government 
Receipt Accounting System (e-GRAS), 
serving as a unified online collection 
medium for all tax and non-tax revenues. 
Your Bank has also received authorisation 
from the RBI for the disbursement 
of central civil pensions. All these 
developments help your Bank to reach 
out to more customers and strengthen its 
position as a bank for all.
People Initiatives
Your Bank enhanced its workforce 
throughout the year. The total number 
of employees crossed 75,000 during the 
year, making your Bank one of the largest 
employers in the country. The Bank also 
fulfilled some key leadership positions like 
the ED and Chief Business Officer, Head – 
Mortgage and Consumer Lending, Head – 
Commercial Banking, among others. Your 
Bank developed a new technology team 
structure to align with the Bank’s growth 
direction. To keenly focus on maintaining 
asset quality, your Bank also set up a 
recovery structure. New and dedicated 
verticals like customer experience and 
process quality were also established to 
focus on enhancing customer stickiness 
and efficiency of operations.
Your Bank has always focussed on training 
and development. Its endeavour is 
continual improvement of people and 
fulfilment of vacancies through in-house 
resources. In the year in review, the 
Bank conducted a total of 26.8 lakh 
man-hours of training. 8,709 employees 
got their grade promotions, giving 
them the opportunity to take on higher 
responsibilities within the Bank.
Societal Impact
Bandhan Bank’s journey is deeply rooted 
in its commitment to transforming lives 
and fostering community development. 
Each initiative aims to make a significant 
impact in areas such as education, 
healthcare, livelihood promotion, 
sustainable development, climate action, 
financial literacy, skill enhancement, 
and employment. Our strong focus on 
inclusive banking particularly aims to 
support the growth of small businesses 
and empower women entrepreneurs 
from villages and economically weaker 
sections. This approach creates a 
multiplier effect on employment 
generation, financial inclusion, and 
equitable development.
The strengthening 
of your Bank’s digital 
capabilities is evident in its 
improved digital banking 
performance. Presently, 
around 95% of the total 
general banking transactions 
occur digitally, with digital 
registrations recording a 
21% year‑on‑year increase. 
Additionally, digital 
transaction volume has 
surged by 52% year-on-year, 
while UPI transactions

During the year, your Bank’s CSR further 
expanded its impact to cover more than 
24 lakh beneficiaries across 14 states.
Business Outlook
Powered by investment and consumption, 
the Indian economy is expected to sustain 
and accelerate the growth trajectory over 
the next several years. Your Bank remains 
dedicated to supporting the growth 
momentum of our nation to achieve 
prosperity for all Indians.
While your Bank will continue to 
focus on retaining its strength in the 
microfinance market, it will ensure that 
the agenda of diversification of the 
asset book is on track. Your Bank will 
grow Housing Finance, Retail Assets 
and SME Lending to a larger share. The 
share of secured assets will continue to 
increase. Your Bank’s North Star of being 
a Bank for all will continue to guide it in 
its journey ahead.
Your Bank has expanded its reach 
significantly in the last three years. As 
I have mentioned earlier, the Bank has 
a new CBS, and surround systems are 
being implemented. These systems, along 
with a robust analytics model, coupled 
with the relevant control mechanisms 
will help in strengthening the quality of 
business further.
Your Bank is also on the brink of launching 
many new products and services, 
focussed on varied customer segments. 
The Bank is also in mature stages of 
strengthening the cross-sell mechanism 
with a digital loan origination system 
(LOS). The Bank’s payment system is 
being upgraded to ride the UPI wave and 
enhance customer convenience. Your 
Bank has already launched Bharat QR for 
payment ease for merchants. With the 
launch of trade finance solutions, your 
Bank can now offer an entire suite of 
solutions specifically imports, exports 
and trade remittances.
Your Bank has always focussed on 
cost efficiency. It is exploring Robotic 
Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) to drive greater 
efficiency, not only to optimise costs 
but also to deliver superior value to 
customers. While people are your 
Bank’s strength, to enhance productivity 
further, your Bank is exploring various 
digital solutions.
The Bank will soon enter its 10th year. 
This decade has been phenomenal  
and the Bank is privileged to have won 
the trust of all stakeholders. As the Bank 
moves into Bandhan Bank 2.0,  
I am sure that the 10th year of Bandhan 
Bank will be punctuated with significant 
developments with new products and 
solutions, digitalisation at scale and 
technology backbone to support the 
goals and vision of the Bank.
The Bank’s future is promising. With 
a capable leadership team, a robust 
franchise built on shared vision and 
values, and ongoing transformation, 
I am confident that your Bank 
will continue to progress steadily, 
enriching the lives of all stakeholders 
and delivering sustainable long-term 
value. Thank you for reposing your 
faith in the Bank.

of this, goals are established and Key 
Result Areas (KRAs) are uploaded at 
the time of employee onboarding itself. 
This approach provides employees 
with clear metrics and performance 
indices, ensuring they understand how 
to positively impact both the Bank and 
their own development journey. By 
integrating the performance appraisal 
process into the HRMS, the Bank 
aims to provide all employees with 
clear insights into their performance, 
assessments, and competencies.
 The Bank prioritises gender sensitivity 
and inclusiveness in its HR policy by 
identifying specific roles for women 
across various geographies and 
hierarchical levels. This commitment 
to diversity and equal opportunity has 
increased the female workforce by 
18%, fostering a more balanced and 
inclusive workplace.
 In addition to salary reviews, the 
Bank introduced performance-linked-
pay (PLP) to reward exceptional 
performance and contributions by the 
employees. This not only motivated 
the employees but also aligned their 
efforts with the Bank’s strategic 
goals. The PLP is over and above the 
appraisal based variable pay that 
eligible employees receive after the 
appraisal cycle.
 To promote employee well-being 
and work-life balance, the Bank has 
increased the total leave balance 
by 20% and introduced special 
occasion leaves.
 Numerous sessions with eminent 
doctors were organised to guide 
employees towards a healthier 
lifestyle. A Medical Extension Plan 
has also been introduced to address 
outpatient treatment for employees.

Risk Management
Springing Forward with Care
A robust risk management strategy aligned with 
industry’s best practices and proactive identification 
and mitigation of potential risks is a priority at 
your Bank. Taking a leap into the future, your 
Bank’s holistic approach towards managing risks 
will continue to differentiate it, empower decision-
making, protect stakeholder interest and win their 
trust and loyalty.
Risks managed by the Bank include credit risk, credit 
concentration risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk in banking book, operational risk, fraud risk, conduct 
risk, outsourcing risk, compliance and legal risk, information 
security (InfoSec) risk, reputational risk, strategic risk, 
business risk and their underlying interlinkages.
Do not judge me by my successes; judge me by how 
many times I fell down and got back up again.
- Nelson Mandela
Alignment of business strategy and risk appetite should minimise the firm’s exposure 
to large and unexpected losses. In addition, the firm’s risk management capabilities 
need to be commensurate with the risks it expects to take.
- Jerome Powell
RISK AND RESILIENCE
Risk management and resilience are closely intertwined. 
Effective risk management practices contribute to resilience 
by reducing the likelihood and severity of adverse events. 
	 In recent years, unexpected global events have disrupted 
businesses across different parts of the world. The 
confluence of a global pandemic, massive supply 
chain disruptions, and many other challenges have 
fuelled inflation, escalated cost of living, led to large-
scale cyberattacks, etc. As a response to such massive 
adversities, operational resilience has become more 
vital than ever.
	 Your Bank recognises the critical need for shaping up a 
resilient and robust organisation that can adapt quickly 
and take informed decisions and actions. Regular 
measures are therefore taken to assess the immediate 
and potential future effects and proactively map probable 
corrective actions.
	 Resilience testing, through various extreme but 
plausible scenarios, is done regularly to make the Bank 
ready for uncertainties, apart from testing for normal 
risk scenarios.
	 Your Bank prioritises streamlining core business 
processes which support critical services and products. A 
comprehensive crisis and Business Continuity Plan (BCP), 
developed with key stakeholders that can be quickly 
activated, has been put in place.
	 No business can exist without its employees. Recognising 
this, your Bank puts people first while preparing for any 
disruptions. By showing genuine care for employees 
and their families who may be affected by a crisis, the 
Bank continuously boosts employee morale. Driven by 
the belief that “We are all in this together”, your Bank’s 
commitment for its people goes beyond social media 
posts or other marketing content. A people-centric 
culture along with efforts that prioritise employee 
well-being creates the foundation for employee 
trust and loyalty, which extends well beyond the 
period of disruption.

The first step in the risk management process is to 
acknowledge the reality of risk. Denial is a common 
tactic that substitutes deliberate ignorance for 
thoughtful planning.

The key to risk management is never putting 
yourself in a position where you cannot live to 
fight another day.
- Richard S. Fuld, Jr
APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK GOVERNANCE
	 Your Bank’s Risk Management Framework describes its 
approach to risk management, and includes provisions 
for risk governance arrangements; appetite and limits for 
risk exposures; policies for the management of various 
risk types; risk culture standards; and risk reporting. The 
key arrangements and standards for risk management 
and internal controls that support your Bank’s compliance 
with statutory and regulatory requirements are also 
clearly defined under this framework.
	 Your Bank follows a dynamic way of setting the risk 
appetite, which is in sync with the evolving scenario. 
A testament to your Bank’s prudent approach, various 
additional scenarios over and above that mandated by 
the regulator are considered and analysed, to gauge the 
various stress levels that the Bank might face in a dynamic 
macro and micro economic scenario.
Banks need well-defined roles and responsibilities for 
managing risks, with robust mechanisms capable of holding 
individuals and teams accountable for their risk management 
decisions and actions. This includes establishing risk 
committees, risk appetite frameworks, and efficient 
escalation procedures to ensure that the risks are identified, 
assessed, and managed at all levels within the organisation.
	 The risk governance framework provides guidance 
on adopting a more holistic approach to manage risk, 
emphasising four related elements:
	
 Developing the corporate risk profile.
	
 Establishing a risk function that manages risk in an 
integrated manner.
	
 Practising integrated risk management; and
	
 Ensuring continuous risk monitoring.
	 Your Bank has a robust Risk Appetite Framework (‘RAF’) 
which is reviewed on an annual basis. RAF’s monitoring 
parameters are aligned with the Bank’s short-term 
as well as medium and long-term strategies and 
business plans.
	 Scenarios and measurement approaches for quantifying 
risk and capital demands are implemented across the 
material risk types. Continuous monitoring, stress 
testing tools and escalation processes safeguard the 
key capitals and liquidity levels. Systems, processes 
and policies are critical components of your Bank’s risk 
management capability.
	 Lessons learnt from the recent uncertainties 
helped your Bank to strengthen its Risk Assessment 
Framework further. The learnings were incorporated 
to regulate socio-political risks and conduct risk within 
the framework and take them into consideration 
while formulating the Bank’s strategy and business 
expansion plan.
	 Your Bank keeps risk appetite as a guiding document 
while planning for the growth strategy.
	 Your Bank follows three levels of Risk Governance 
Framework – Board, Committees of the Board, 
Management Committees.
	 The Bank’s Board, through the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (RMCB), is updated regularly 
and as necessary, on special developments in its risk 
situation, risk management and risk controlling.
	 The Risk Management Committee of the Board (RMCB) 
deliberates with the Management on the issues of 
aggregate risk disposition and risk strategy. It also 
supports the Board in monitoring the implementation 
of this strategy.
	 Various risk-related committees at Executive Level, such 
as Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), Credit 
Risk Management Committee (CRMC), Operational 
Risk Management Committee (ORMC), Market Risk 
Management Committee (MRMC), Business Continuity 
and Planning Management Committee (BCPMC), 
Information Security Committee (ISC), etc., serve as 
formalised decision-making forums, which enable the 
views of risk decision takers and risk managers to be 
taken into account.

	 The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is directly responsible for all the 
risk management functions, such as Credit Risk Management, 
Market Risk Management, Operational Risk Management, 
Liquidity Risk Control and Information Security. In addition, 
the CRO is also responsible for monitoring, analysing, and 
reporting risks on a comprehensive basis.
	 Independence of the CRO is ensured through a fixed 
tenure, reporting structure and periodic reviews by the 
Board and RMCB.
If you get the culture right, most of the other stuff

RISK CULTURE
Your Bank believes in the philosophy of “Setting the Tone from 
the Top”. The Board and Management fosters a strong risk 
culture within the organisation which influences the rest of the 
employees and drives strong risk resilience across all roles and 
levels, in turn safeguarding the key capitals and upholding your 
Bank’s reputation.
Risk culture at your Bank is nurtured through:
i.	 Regular and adequate risk management training of employees 
based on their profiles and roles in risk management. 
Every risk taken needs to be approved within the risk 
management framework.
ii. Issuing weekly/monthly newsletters and publications on 
various areas of risks.
iii. Issuing directions on measures required for strengthening of 
risk culture, formulation of policies and frameworks, whistle 
blower mechanism, risk appetite framework, etc.
iv. Placing emphasis on taking risks within the defined 
risk appetite. Also ensuring that the risk taken is 
adequately compensated in line with risk adjusted 
performance measures.

‘Tone from the top’
	 Decision-Making

RISK AWARENESS & COMMUNICATION
Your Bank believes that communication plays a pivotal role in 
building enhanced risk awareness amongst the stakeholders, 
especially in matters related to risk culture and cybersecurity, 
and that a risk aware employee and customer is in itself a way 
to mitigate undesired risks.
Your Bank periodically evaluates its current culture and risk awareness status by following a well-defined Risk Culture Management 
Process, which is depicted below:
If you don’t risk anything, you risk even more.
- Erica Jong 
RISK STRATEGY AND CAPITAL
Your Bank aims to maintain adequate capitalisation on an 
ongoing and forward-looking basis, i.e. internal capital supply to 
exceed internal capital demand. The Bank maintains compliance 
with the lCAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) 
as required under Pillar 2 of Basel III, through its robust risk 
management and governance framework, methodologies, 
processes and infrastructure.
The Bank employs a strategic planning process that aligns its 
risk strategy and appetite with its commercial objectives – a 
continuous monitoring process against approved risk, leverage 
and capital. Regular reporting of risk, leverage and capital to 
management; and a robust stress testing framework.
The ICAAP, Risk Appetite Framework, and Strategic 
Document are annually approved by the Board and reviewed 
on a periodic basis, ensuring alignment between risk, 
capital and strategy.
Your Bank runs regular awareness campaigns and adopts 
various modes to educate its employees regarding the various 
aspects of risk management. These include:
	 Periodic newsletters
	 Circulars
	 Floor level awareness sessions and workshops
	 Innovative messaging through desktop screensavers
	 Information security awareness for customers through 
multilingual text messages, emails and social media posts

Stories of Transformation
Prembati
Location: Mathura
Prembati and her family were struggling to make ends 
meet. Back then, their business was modest. Despite 
these hardships, they began crafting clay products 
with just two machines and two staff members, 
relying heavily on manual labour. Realising the need 
for financial support to grow their business, Prembati 
turned to Bandhan Bank.
Her first loan from Bandhan Bank, a sum of ₹10,000, 
marked the beginning of a transformative journey. With 
each subsequent loan, her business took significant 
leaps. They invested in more machines, expanded their 
product range, and increased production capacity. 
Today, they operate with five machines, and her family 
is actively involved in the business. The business also 
provides employment to five skilled craftsmen from 
the community, producing 2,500 to 3,000 units of clay 
products daily to meet the ever-growing demand.
Bandhan Bank has 
been our lifeline. 
From the very first 
loan, they believed 
in us and supported 
us through thick and 
thin. We will remain 
forever grateful for their 
unwavering support.
Looking ahead, Prembati plans to use the next loan from 
Bandhan Bank to acquire a dyeing machine, which will 
further enhance their production capabilities and expand 
their product range.
Their clay products are highly sought after and sold 
to wholesalers across Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Their 
product’s superior quality caused the demand to surge 
rapidly. With a substantial profit of around ₹80,000 per 
month, their financial stability has dramatically improved 
from their initial earnings of around ₹8,000 per month.
This transformation reaffirms that nothing is impossible 
with determination and hard work. And, with a little help 
from Bandhan Bank, Prembati has not only improved the 
family’s financial and lifestyle conditions but also created 
job opportunities for others in the community.

Soniya Duseja
Location: Surat
Soniya Duseja’s story began with a desire to start her 
own business. However, she faced the harsh reality of 
financial struggles, constantly battling to make ends 
meet. Limited finances and the daily grind of managing 
household expenses left her feeling constrained. 
Despite these significant challenges, Soniya’s spirit 
remained undaunted.
With limited funds, Soniya started small, selling goods 
from a simple table in a vacant room of her house. 
However, the meagre profits of ₹15,000 per month 
were insufficient to sustain her ambitions. Responding 
to customer demands, especially for cosmetics, Soniya 
envisioned expanding her business but lacked the 
necessary funds. Soniya’s fortunes changed in 2019 
when a neighbour introduced her to Bandhan Bank. 
Securing her first loan of ₹25,000, Soniya wasted no 
time investing in her business. With each loan, she 
diligently expanded her product range, rented a shop 
and reinvested the profits for further growth.
As her business flourished, Soniya’s shop underwent 
a remarkable transformation. With an increasing 
monthly sales exceeding ₹2.5 lakh and monthly profits 
reaching around ₹1 lakh, Soniya expanded the shop and 
renovated her home. Today, her fully furnished shop 
offers a diverse array of products for women, including 
cosmetics, bags, and dresses.
Soniya’s success story extends beyond business metrics. 
With her son and daughter-in-law joining the business, 
Bandhan Bank was a beacon of hope 
when all other doors were closed. 
Their faith in my potential allowed 
me to build my dream business from 
scratch. Today, I am proud of what 
I have achieved, and I owe it all to their 
incredible support.
Soniya’s enterprise has transformed into a collaborative 
family venture. The shop is now staffed by one employee 
to assist her with daily management.
Remarkably, Soniya’s shop, which initially had a stock 
value of just ₹40,000, now boasts inventory worth over 
₹10 lakh. Her current loan with Bandhan Bank stands 
at ₹4 lakh, a testament to the institution’s unwavering 
support in her journey. Reflecting on her journey, Soniya 
expresses profound gratitude towards Bandhan Bank, 
whose support proved instrumental when no other 
avenue seemed viable.

Jamimahrani Samuel
Location: Goa
Jamimahrani Samuel used to run a restaurant while 
her husband managed a wholesale vegetable shop. 
However, when the COVID-19 lockdown hit, the 
restaurant faced tough times, leading them to shut 
it down. During this challenging period, Jamimahrani 
found joy in the arrival of their baby boy and became 
a full-time mother. As their son grew, Jamimahrani’s 
entrepreneurial spirit reignited, urging her to reopen 
her restaurant. However, the lack of funds posed to be a 
hurdle for her.
Fortunately, fate smiled upon them when they 
discovered that Bandhan Bank’s banking outlet was 
conveniently located right above their vegetable shop. 
Seizing the opportunity, Jamimahrani approached the 
Bank’s staff, sharing their situation and requesting for a 
loan to help her restart the restaurant.
Things took a turn for Jamimahrani, when her 
association with Bandhan Bank began. By granting 
Jamimahrani her first loan of ₹2,00,000, the Bank not 
only provided financial assistance but also instilled 
confidence in her ability to succeed.
Bandhan Bank came 
into our lives at a time 
when we had lost all 
hope. Their support 
allowed us to revive my 
restaurant and thrive 
despite the pandemic. 
They have shown us 
that with the right 
support, we can achieve 
our dreams and more. 
We are deeply thankful.
With the financial support from Bandhan Bank, 
Jamimahrani reopened her restaurant, fondly named “777 
Eater’s Den”. She found a cosy space to lease and hired a 
team of three skilled cooks, two waiters, and a competent 
manager to bring her vision to life. As “777 Eater’s Den” 
opened its doors, it quickly gained popularity, with locals 
gathering in large numbers to enjoy their favourite 
dishes. Meanwhile, her husband continued to run the 
vegetable shop.
Today, Jamimahrani’s shop is thriving. With daily sales 
exceeding ₹70,000 and monthly profits surpassing 
₹2,00,000, their financial stability has dramatically 
improved, with a little help from Bandhan Bank.
Encouraged by their success, the couple expressed their 
desire to expand their businesses further, with plans to 
seek additional support from Bandhan Bank in the future. 
Jamimahrani’s journey is a testament to the transformative 
impact of the Bank’s support, not just in their lives but 
in the larger context of women empowerment and 
employment generation.

Aligned with the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goal 13 and 
the Paris Accord, the Climate Action 
Programme aims to combat climate 
change and its impacts. Recognising the 
interconnectedness of climate action with 
the broader 2030 Agenda and the 16 
Sustainable Development Goals.
Climate change is primarily driven by 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it 
is crucial to reduce these emissions and 
enhance carbon sequestration to mitigate 
its effects. Your Bank’s Climate Action 
Programme contributes to this goal 
through the following strategies:
Reducing Atmospheric Carbon
Climate Change Adaptation 
Carbon sequestration through 
plantation and agroforestry   
Building resilience to climate change 
and extreme weather conditions 
among vulnerable communities by 
addressing the interrelated SDGs
Reducing GHG emissions through 
clean development practices and 
technologies in energy, agriculture, 
and allied sectors
Mitigating climate change impacts
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) 2021 states that the 
agricultural sector in India faces high 
vulnerability to drastic weather events 
due to poor climate-resilient agricultural 
practices, inadequate water management, 
over-dependence on conventional energy 
sources, extensive chemical use harming 
soil health, loss of soil quality and topsoil, 
excessive groundwater dependence, 
biodiversity loss, and disruptions to 
ecosystem balance, contributing to high 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Considering these vulnerabilities in the 
agricultural sector, this year the Bank 
launched a new initiative on Climate 
Smart Villages (CSV) under the Climate 
Action Programme. The aim of this 
programme is to develop a holistic 
climate action approach for villages 
to enhance climate resilience. This 
includes ensuring water security and 
mitigating erratic rainfall patterns through 
water conservation to protect rain-fed 
agriculture and promoting the adoption 
of climate-resilient crop varieties.
The Climate Action Programme also 
maintains its commitment to carbon 
sequestration through afforestation, 
particularly mangrove plantation, and the 
greening of urban spaces.

Highlights of various business segments of your Bank during the FY 
under review are mentioned below:
Emerging Entrepreneurs Business
The Emerging Entrepreneurs Business (‘EEB’) of your Bank has been 
serving borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid with affordable 
and convenient loans to help them develop into entrepreneurs 
and transform their lives. Your Bank’s EEB strategy is guided by 
its long-held philosophy of financial inclusion and economic 
empowerment of the disadvantaged sections of the society. The 
endeavour of your Bank is to nurture these entrepreneurs and help 
them move up the socio-economic hierarchy. In their movement 
upwards, your Bank is by them to support with whichever financial 
service they may require in the journey.
Your Bank offers a wide array of loans through Banking Unit (‘BU’) 
outlets under EEB vertical to benefit small business owners in 
need of financial assistance. Your Bank operates its Group Loans 
and Small Business & Agri Loans (‘SBAL’) business channels from its 
BU outlets while Small Enterprise Loans (‘SEL’) are operated from 
the bank branches.
Each BU is linked to a bank branch for operational convenience. 
BUs are self-sufficient and empowered to open deposit accounts 
using TABs and also open loan accounts after necessary credit 
checks. The highlight of the BUs’ operations is the TABs that are 
connected to the Core Banking System (‘CBS’) through cellular 
data. Relationship Officers (‘RO’) carry these TABs to their group 
meetings, and the entire instalment reconciliation for the customer 
happens through these TABs on real-time basis. To ensure timely 
and effective support to the BUs in their day-to-day functioning, 
your Bank has a structure comprising Circles, Territories, Divisions, 
Areas and BU Catchments. A central operation team maintains 
oversight of the quality of the operations and adherence to 
prevalent guidelines at all times. Your Bank lays significant emphasis 
on processes and controls to help maintain uniform and consistent 
standards in transaction processing and service delivery, as well as 
compliance with regulatory and statutory guidelines.
During the FY under review, your Bank’s commitment towards 
financial inclusion is also reflected in the fact that it offered loans 
to 21,09,921 new borrowers under Group Loan and SBAL during 
the FY 2024. The portfolio for Group Loans stood at ₹40,745.31 
crore whereas SBAL and SEL portfolio stood at ₹21,501.74 crore 
and ₹5,671.83 crore, respectively, at the end of FY 2024, as your 
Bank worked towards bringing additional measures in credit 
control in order to improve the quality of its portfolio.

Small Enterprise Loan (‘SEL’)
In the current economic scenario, India is a country burgeoning 
with small businesses which are regularly in need of short to 
medium-term funding to maintain and grow their businesses. 
The SEL vertical of your Bank empowers these businesses to 
expand by extending them business loans tailored to suit their 
needs. As on March 31, 2024, the SEL book stands at ₹5,671.83 
crore, with over 1.22 lakh customers.
Your Bank’s SEL product is served through more than 1,400 
branches pan India, with presence in 29 states and union 
territories. With the COVID pandemic now firmly behind us, the 
SEL portfolio is now expected to grow at a much faster rate than 
in the recent past, thus making it all the more essential for your 
Bank to offer loans to these firms, and aid them in their pursuit 
of growth and expansion, in turn contributing to the overall 
betterment of the economy.
In an endeavor to understand its customers better, your Bank’s 
SEL vertical has constantly taken inputs from borrowers and 
with the help of these inputs, updated and added to the catalogue 
of offered products to remain at par with other leading banks in 
the country.
The following products are presently offered under SEL:

SEL Term Loans (₹1.01 lakh to ₹10 lakh)

and they are aimed towards financing working capital or 
asset creation needs of small businesses or other short-term 
business requirements. These loans range from ₹1.01 lakh to 
₹10 lakh.
• 	
SEL Max Loans (₹10.01 lakh to ₹25 lakh)
	
This is similar to SEL Term Loans, but it is targeted towards 
slightly larger enterprises in terms of revenue, which might 
need loans of value higher than ₹10 lakh. These loans range 
from ₹10.01 lakh to ₹25 lakh.
• 	
SEL Cash Credit (₹5 lakh to ₹25 lakh)
	
This is a revolving credit facility, whereby a limit will be set up 
in the customer’s loan account and the customer can avail 
of whatever amount is required and pay interest only on the 
utilised amount. The limit is subject to renewal on a yearly 
basis. These loans range from ₹5 lakh to ₹25 lakh.
• 	
SEL Secured Overdraft Loans (₹10.01 lakh to ₹25 lakh)
	
This overdraft product has been added to your Bank’s SEL 
product bouquet during FY 2023 with a vision to cater to the 
MSME borrowers who need working capital in the form of an 
overdraft and are willing to pledge security for the loan. The 
range for this product is from ₹10.01 lakh to ₹25 lakh and the 
overdraft limits are subject to renewal on a yearly basis.
During the FY under review, your Bank has taken the following 
initiatives:
•	
Your Bank has taken a new step towards digitising its business 
channels by upgrading to a new CBS in the FY 2024. This step 
strengthens your Bank’s commitment towards providing 
a quicker, better and hassle-free banking experience to all 
segments of its customers.
•	
Your Bank has taken several initiatives to strengthen the 
credit assessment process for Group Loans and SBAL, and 
other loans in order to have a better portfolio. Your Bank 
has further deployed a separate Loan Sanctioning team to 
manage the loan sanctioning process for Group Loans.
•	
Your Bank has also deployed a separate independent 
Recovery Team to improve recovery collections from 
delinquent customers where the business team will focus on 
collections from standard accounts to restrict slippages while 
the recovery team will have a focused approach to collection 
from NPA accounts.
•	
Your Bank has deployed several analytics-driven models 
to improve both, sourcing and recovery. Some of the key 
initiatives in this regard are: the identification of good 
borrowers for a higher ticket loan based on a data-driven 
renewal base, identification of potential borrowers for 
graduating to individual loan, categorisation of delinquent 
borrowers based on their propensity to repay and prioritising 
collections accordingly, etc.
•	
Awareness about using digital solutions, like smartphone-
based transactions and use of credit/ debit cards for online 
transactions are still persistent issues to the customers under 
the Banking Unit vertical. To overcome these challenges, 
your Bank is giving training to make the customers aware 
about the benefits of digital payments and various other 
aspects, such as seeding bank accounts with mobile number 
and Aadhaar. Your Bank has also taken initiative by informing 
the customers to pay through online transactions.
•	
Your Bank has always placed strong emphasis on training 
and development to upskill and reskill staff to ensure 
that they stay relevant to the fast-changing world across 
levels and locations. This includes online and classroom 
training sessions.

Agri-business Loans
Providing credit for agricultural activities not only helps increase 
crop production but also empowers farmers, and supports the 
backbone of the Indian economy - the agricultural sector. Your Bank 
recognises the importance of this sector and offers a wide range 
of credit facilities to provide financial support to all participants 
in the Agri value-chain system. Currently, the segment provides 
Kisan Cash Credit (‘KCC’) loans to borrowers engaged in farming 
activities, including animal husbandry, horticulture, pisciculture, 
etc., with competitive interest rates and minimal documentation.

By doing so, your Bank is making it easier for farmers to access 
credit and invest in their farms to increase productivity.
Currently, the segment is expanding its reach by offering 
(i) both fund-based and non-fund-based credit facilities to entities 
involved in agri-ancillary products and services, such as food and 
agri processors, agri input dealers, etc.; (ii) credit facilities to 
support development of agricultural infrastructure; (iii) financing 
to Corporate Agri customers, with a key focus to on-board quality 
customers, and (iv) commodity finance.
The Total Advances of the segment stood at ₹267.78 crore as on 
March 31, 2024 as compared to ₹126.52 crore as on March 31, 
2023, a growth of 112 per cent. during FY 2024.
Housing Finance
Your Bank has continued its focus on the long-term strategy 
for Housing finance. This business has seen a robust growth in 
the financial year in spite of the challenging macro-economic 
environment. In addition to the existing business channels, in the 
financial year, your Bank has introduced a Prime lending channel, 
which has impacted positively with a higher disbursement and 
portfolio growth along with a lowered delinquency risk.
During the FY under review, your Bank has expanded its home 
loan network to over 450 branches offering housing loans and 320 
Banking Units offering micro-home loans spread across 18 states

previous financial year while growing the portfolio to ₹29,915.65 
crore, a growth of around 11 per cent.
Although the Prime channel has been contributing significantly 
to the overall business, your Bank’s focus has still remained its 
affordable housing business, which is its primary strength. This is 
indicative by its sanctioning average ticket size of sub ₹20 lakh. 
During the FY, your Bank continued the special campaign “Junoon 
Rahe Barkaraar (JBR)” for higher ticket loans, offering attractive 
and competitive rates of interest to customers with good credit 
history and high credit scores. This campaign has continued to 
attract better credit-worthy customers.
The introduction of Direct Sales Agent (‘DSA’) in the previous FY 
has continued to gain traction and has been contributing to overall 
disbursement. The newly introduced prime channel has also seen 
steady traction since its introduction during the FY.
Your Bank continues to offer loans at floating rates linked to an 
External Benchmark Rate (‘EBR’), which has adopted the repo 
rate announced by RBI as the EBR rate. Your Bank has continued 
to offer the existing customers who are not on EBR, an option to 
convert their loans to EBR linked loans. As per the directive by 
RBI, your Bank has also provided an option to the customer to 
choose between “impact to EMI or term or both” based on their 
eligibility for their benchmark-linked loans at the time of change in 
benchmark rates during their loan tenure.

Climate Action Programme
The Climate Action Programme focuses on climate change 
adaptation and carbon sequestration. Major initiates are water 
conservation and afforestation, as mentioned below:
Water Conservation
The water conservation initiative aims at water security and 
drought-proofing in some of the high moisture-stressed regions of 
India, thereby providing a safety net to agriculture and livestock-
based livelihoods. These initiatives facilitate participatory 
watershed management by empowering the communities to 
participate in the planning and implementation of local water 
resource development. Measures such as building, reviving 
and maintaining water-harvesting structures, prioritisation 
and judicious use of water for every community member, crop 
planning and water-efficient farming, use of drought-resistant 
varieties, cultivation of high-value crops requiring less water, etc., 
create a multiplier effect in drought-proofing and climate change 
adaptation measures and higher income generation.
During the FY under review, 27 water harvesting structures, with 
a storage capacity of 13,500 kilolitres, in the form of farm ponds, 
were constructed in the farmers’ fields to provide them critical 
irrigation support.
Cumulatively, the programme has supported the construction of 
50 water harvesting structures with a storage capacity of over 
1,33,500 kilolitres of water in three states. These structures not 
only provide drinking water to over 1,500 families but also support 
participatory irrigation of various crops.
Afforestation
Your Bank’s afforestation initiatives have contributed towards the 
project of establishing a “Bio-shield” to save the mangroves in the

along with plantation of other medical plant species and fodder 
species, sequestering 2,248 tonnes of CO2 annually. The fodder 
bank was created to offset the biotic pressure from the mangrove 
area. The project created 4,629 person-days of employment and 
benefited 9,123 beneficiaries with additional income-generating 
avenues from fodder and medicinal plant harvesting.
Additionally, in this FY, the plantation under agroforestry and

in-house and external training.
The Compliance Function is one of the key elements in your Bank’s 
corporate governance structure. The compliance starts from the 
top, and the Board and the Senior Management play an important 
role in driving the compliance culture. Your Bank remains 
committed to adhere to the highest standards of compliance vis-à-
vis regulatory prescriptions and internal guidelines. Your Bank has 
a robust Compliance Policy, outlining the compliance philosophy, 
and roles and responsibilities of the CD.
The CD assists the Board and Top/ Senior Management in 
managing the compliance risk of your Bank. The CD ensures that 
overall business of your Bank is conducted in strict adherence 
to the guidelines issued by the RBI and other regulators, various 
statutory provisions, standards and codes prescribed by FEDAI, 
FIMMDA, etc., by evaluating the products/ processes, guiding 
business departments on the various regulatory guidelines with 
a special emphasis on better understanding of the perspective. 
It closely works with operational risk and internal audit functions 
and monitors various activities of your Bank with more emphasis 
on active risk management.
As the focal point of contact with the RBI and other regulatory 
entities, the CD evaluates the adequacy of internal controls and 
examines any systemic correction that is required, based on its 
analysis and interpretation of regulatory guidelines and deviations 
observed during monitoring and testing. Your Bank has a robust 
Anti Money Laundering (‘AML’) framework and tools to manage 
the AML risk. It periodically apprises Top/ Senior Management, 
the ACB and the Board on compliance levels, based on the 
changes in the external regulatory environment. The CD submits 
the compliance report to the ACB at regular intervals providing the 
compliance status with the laws/ rules and regulations applicable 
to your Bank.

independently carries out internal and concurrent audit of various 
functions in your Bank, primarily to assess the effectiveness of 
internal control in critical systems and processes, and compliance 
with regulatory guidelines. The IAD also maintains a strong 
oversight through Off-site Monitoring of various aspects for 
faster detection and resolution of anomalies, if any, identified. 
IAD further ensures that independent checks and balances are in 
place, and that laid down policies and procedures are followed and 
recommendations for improvements in processes and systems 
controls are suitably adhered to.
For review of effectiveness of controls, significant audit findings 
along with corrective and preventive action taken by your Bank 
are placed before the ACB periodically and directions, if any, 
given by the ACB are tracked closely for suitable closure in a time 
bound manner.
To maintain the independence of these departments, the 
performance evaluation of the Chief Compliance Officer (‘CCO’) 
and the Chief Audit Executive (‘CAE’) is carried out by the ACB.
Internal Financial Control
Your Bank also engages external firms to carry out independent 
review of internal controls, processes, reporting, etc. and 
accordingly recommendations, if any, are made by them to your 
Bank/ the ACB for improvement.
Considering the internal financial controls of the Bank, and the 
work performed by the auditors, including the audit of internal 
financial controls over financial reporting by the auditors and the 
reviews performed by management under the supervision of the 
ACB, the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the internal 
financial controls established and maintained by your Bank 
are adequate.

awareness at all levels. Your Bank’s view on risk is dynamic and 
it aims at constantly upgrading controls and security measures, 
including cyber security measures, to avoid or mitigate various 
risks. The ability to manage risk is strongly supported by a strong 
risk conduct and risk awareness culture.
Your Bank has an independent Risk Governance Structure, 
which is in line with international best practices, that has been 
put in place to separate duties and ensure the independence 
of Risk Measurement, Monitoring and Control functions. This 
framework visualises the empowerment of Business Units at the 
operating level, with technology being the key driver, enabling the 
identification and management of risk at the place of origination.
Risk Appetite
To address the various risks that your Bank faces in its business, it 
has established a risk appetite framework which defines the levels 
and types of risk that are acceptable, within risk capacity, in order 
to achieve strategic objectives and business plans. Furthermore, 
risk-specific policies, limits and triggers are implemented to 
operationalise the appetites for individual risk types.
The risk appetite framework is approved on an annual basis and 
is a pre-cursor to the strategy of your Bank. A comprehensive 
dashboard that shows all the risks that your Bank carries at any 
given time is provided by the Risk Profile, which is a component 
of the Risk Appetite Framework. It links goals and priorities to

Bandhan Bank Limited
The Board and Senior Management sets the “tone at the top” 
and has a trickle-down effect on all employees. Thus, it supports 
a strong culture, which is defined by your Bank’s expectations, 
thereby guiding how employees conduct themselves, work with 
colleagues, and make decisions. Your Bank has a well-defined 
Whistle Blower Policy in place.

to cover the Board members, employees, customers, and vendors 
of the Bank. Your Bank educates staff on risk management through 
periodic newsletters, circulars, floor-level awareness seminars, 
workshops, and innovative desktop screensavers.
Stress Testing
Your Bank recognises the importance of stress testing as an 
integral risk management tool. Your Bank’s Stress testing includes 
Scenario testing, which examines the impact of a hypothetical 
future state to define changes in risk factors as also Sensitivity 
testing, which examines the impact of an incremental change to 
one or more risk factors. In addition to standard stress scenarios, 
your Bank conducts stress testing based on various themes driven 
by climate, macroeconomic, etc. Your Bank carries out reverse 
stress testing, in order to identify circumstances that may lead to 
specific, defined outcomes.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’)
Your Bank conducts a comprehensive Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’) exercise on a yearly basis with 
respect to the adequacy of Capital under normal and stressed 
conditions. The examination of capital requirements under normal 
economic and adverse market conditions enables your Bank to 
determine whether its projected business performance meets 
internal and regulatory capital requirements. The assessment is 
to identify, assess, and manage all risks that could potentially have 
a significant negative impact on its business, financial position, or 
capital adequacy.
The ICAAP comprises of a point-in-time assessment of 
exposures and risks at the end of the financial year, along with 
a forward-looking stress capital assessment. Your Bank also 
conducts back-testing assessments as part of ICAAP process to 
assess its stress scenarios.
Risk Management Framework
Your Bank’s Risk Management Framework sets forth the core 
principles on how it seeks to manage and govern the risk. Your 
Bank’s comprehensive risk management is overseen by its Board 
of Directors who has the overall responsibility for your Bank‘s Risk 
Management, including culture and governance framework. The 
Risk Management Committee of the Board (‘RMCB’) assists the 
Board in discharging these responsibilities effectively. The RMCB 
annually reviews and approves the risk management framework. 
The RMCB plays a crucial role in guiding the development of 
policies, procedures, and systems, and continuously evaluates 
their suitability and relevance to the evolving business landscape. 
The RMCB also oversees the Risk Management Department 
(‘RMD’) and the Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’) reports functionally 
to the RMCB. The CRO has one-on-one meetings with the RMCB 
Committee members during the RMCB meeting in the absence of 
the Whole-time Directors including MD&CEO.
Major Risks
Your Bank’s risk management approach is to ensure that major 
risks and emerging risks, as they evolve, are identified, managed, 
and incorporated into its existing risk management assessment, 
measurement, monitoring and escalation processes. By adhering 
to these protocols, management can be sure that they will 
be planning as they grow the business and fulfil their ongoing 
responsibilities for risk supervision. The Board and senior 
management discuss top and emerging risks on a regular basis.
Asset/ Liability Management (ALM)
Asset/ Liability Management involves evaluating, monitoring, and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity, and funding. 
Your Bank has a well-defined Asset Liability Management policy 
that outlines the framework for liquidity and interest rate 
risk management. As a part of assurance towards sound Risk 
Management practices, your Bank regularly reviews its Internal 
Policies to adapt to changes in market conditions.
Your Bank’s Asset Liability Management Committee (‘ALCO’) 
monitors and manages Liquidity and Interest Rate risks. Your Bank 
actively assesses ALM Risk, which involves evaluating, monitoring, 
and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity, and funding, 
which potentially can have a significant earnings impact. Your 
Bank has implemented a robust mechanism to monitor critical 
ratios and has always maintained healthy Liquidity ratios; Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (‘LCR’), much above the regulatory minimum 
LCR requirement by having significant High Quality Liquid Assets 
(‘HQLA’) as also the Net Stable Funding Ratio (‘NSFR’), which is 
measured as the proportion of long-term assets that are funded 
by stable sources.
Climate-related Financial Risks
Your Bank has incorporated climate risk in its risk management 
framework. Your Bank has incorporated provision in its Credit 
Policy to support green financing and considering proposals 
from such segments to encourage green financing. As part of the 
stress testing policy, scenarios related to climate risk have been 
incorporated.
Credit Risk
Your Bank defines credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations 
with agreed upon terms). Your Bank has established robust 
credit appraisal and risk management frameworks for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, and controlling the risks in credit exposures.
Your Bank balances the risk and return by setting certain 
objectives, e.g., ensuring credit quality is not compromised for 
growth; mitigating credit risk in transactions, relationships and 
portfolios; using its credit risk rating and scoring systems or other 
approved credit risk assessment or rating methodologies, policies 
and tools; appropriate pricing based on credit risk taken; systems

and controls for detecting and preventing inappropriate credit risk; 
applying consistent credit risk exposure measurements; ongoing 
credit risk monitoring and administration; and avoiding activities 
that are inconsistent with its values, code of conduct or policies. 
Your Bank undertakes studies to identify trends in the movement 
of NPAs, etc., to keep track of the asset quality.
Information Security and Cyber Risks
Cyber security in banks has gained paramount importance as banks 
have IT platforms in the name of digitisation, competition from 
peers, customer experience, reduction of transaction cost, etc. 
Across banks in India, large amounts of confidential data reside in 
bank’s Data Centres and flows through bank’s servers and various 
networks and devices. To protect the IT systems, confidential data 
of your Bank as well as customers, either in rest or in motion, 
and to ensure continuity of business, your Bank has policies and 
frameworks in place for Information security and Cyber risks.
Banks are exposed and susceptible to various types of cybercrime. 
Cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated and organised and 
they are continuously carrying attacks in volume, frequency, and 
severity. Malware perpetrators are inventing and inflicting various 
types of malware attacks. Distributed Denial of Service (‘DDOS’) 
activity is ever-increasing and evolving as they are using Internet 
of Things (‘IOT’) devices as platform to conduct such attacks. Your 
Bank has not experienced any material loss relating to these or 
other types of cyber-attacks.
Cybersecurity risk is a priority for your Bank, and it continues 
to develop and enhance its controls, processes, and systems 
in order to protect its networks, computers, software, and data 
from attack, damage, or unauthorised access. Your Bank has its 
own independent 24x7 C-SOC (Cyber Security Operations Centre) 
for a state-of-art centralised and consolidated cybersecurity 
incident prevention, security event monitoring, detection, and 
response which is backed by data and tools for sound analytics. 
Your Bank is also ISO 27001:2013 certified, for its information 
security management. Your Bank is also proactively involved in 
industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, 
including its third-party service providers and governmental 
agencies, to continue to enhance defences and improve resiliency 
to cybersecurity threats.
Operational Risk
Your Bank actively manages the Operational risk, which is the 
risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems, or external events. Your Bank has a Board 
approved Operational Risk Management Policy, which outlines 
the governance structure and processes for managing operational 
risk. Your Bank has also put in place robust Fraud Risk, Outsourcing 
Risk and Legal Risk Frameworks within its Operational Risk 
Management.
Business Resilience
Your Bank is committed to provide uninterrupted service 
to customers. As such, it is essential to protect the critical 
infrastructure in your Bank from natural and manmade disasters/ 
events and ensure business continuity of the various operational 
units. Your Bank has a Business Continuity Management policy in 
place with the objective to recover critical activities and systems 
within defined timelines; safety of people and its assets; to 
communicate with stakeholders during emergency; to manage 
reputation risk, etc. Business continuity risks are reviewed 
and regular updates are given Operational Risk Management 
Committee (‘ORMC’) and RMCB.
Outsourcing Risk
Outsourcing risk refers to potential losses from relying on third-
party service providers for delivering banking operations for 
your Bank, which would be undertaken by it in future, with risk 
factors including service failures, data breaches, regulatory non-
compliance, and lack of control. Your Bank identifies these risks 
by evaluating outsourced functions and vendor reliability at the 
time of empanelment by assessing risk through due diligence 
and compliance reviews, and monitoring performance via regular 
reviews and audits. Your Bank has implemented a well-defined Risk 
evaluation and management framework that comprehensively 
deals with the processes and responsibilities for identification, 
measurement, mitigation, management, and reporting of risks 
associated with Outsourcing.
Market Risk
Your Bank’s market risk management consists of identifying and 
measuring risks, control measures, monitoring, and reporting 
systems. Your Bank actively manages Market risk, which is the risk 
of possible economic loss from adverse changes in market risk 
factors, such as, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss 
due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility 
risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. Value at Risk (VaR) is a 
tool for monitoring risk in your Bank’s trading portfolio and is used 
for estimating the potential loss from adverse movements in the 
financial markets.
Regulatory Risk
Your Bank recognises the utmost importance of regulatory risk. It 
closely monitors changes in the regulatory landscape and assesses 
how new regulations might affect its business and strategy. In 
order to take proactive steps to spot new sectors, your Bank 
regularly examines the regulatory environment.
Reputational Risk
Your Bank’s reputation is rooted in the perception of its stakeholders, 
and the trust and loyalty they place in it is core to its purpose as a 
financial services organisation. Any adverse stakeholder and public 
perception about your Bank may negatively impact its ability to 
attract and retain customers and may expose it to litigation and 
regulatory actions. In today’s world where communication is a key, 
your Bank maintains regular communication with its stakeholders 
through appropriate engagement mechanisms to address their 
expectations and address any concerns they may have.
The Reputational Risk Management Framework of your Bank 
is made up of interconnected characteristics that could have an 
impact on different stakeholders. Your Bank is also measuring and 
tracking the idiosyncratic risks related to stock price movement, 
74
Bandhan Bank Limited
as also social as well as traditional media sentiments, complaints, 
regulatory action, etc., on a periodic basis.
Strategic & Business Risk
Your Bank is monitoring the Strategic Risk by tracking its 
competitive environment as well as any emerging risks, which may 
derail the overall Strategic pursuit so that suitable risk mitigation 
measures are timely taken. As part of strategic risk assessments, 
your Bank conducts mid-year assessment to review the Business 
strategy on A/E (Actual vs. Estimated) basis and assessments 
are presented to RMCB. Your Bank has a robust Business Risk 
Management Framework in place, which involves monitoring 
actionable metrics, including various financial indicators, as well 
as your Bank’s competitive position in the industry.
Information Technology at the Bank

the influence of Information Technology. Recognising its paramount 
importance, your Bank has embarked on a transformative journey 
aimed at leveraging cutting-edge technology as a key differentiator 
in the rapidly evolving competitive financial services sector.

of their abilities, individually and collectively. The NRC ascertains 
the fit and proper status of the candidate for the office of director,

directors, and thereafter, recommends their appointment/ re-
appointment to the Board for approval. The Board also ensures

by the RBI and the adherence to the ‘fit and proper’ criteria by

Refund) Rules, 2016 (‘IEPF Rules’), any dividend declared by 
the Bank, which remains unclaimed or unpaid for a period of 
seven years from the date of transfer to the respective Unpaid 
Dividend Account of the Bank, is liable to be transferred to 
the Investor Education and Protection Fund (‘IEPF’).
	
Further, all the shares in respect of which dividend has not 
been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years or more 
shall also be transferred to the IEPF Authority. However, 
the said requirement does not apply to shares in respect 
of which there is a specific order of Court, Tribunal or 
Statutory Authority, restraining any transfer of such shares 
or where such shares are pledged or hypothecated under 
the provisions of the Depositories Act, 1996.
	
Your Bank was incorporated on December 23, 2014. Since 
inception, your Bank has declared dividend in its 4th, 5th, 7th 
and 9th AGMs held in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2023, respectively. 
Hence at present, your Bank is not required to transfer any 
unclaimed dividend amount to the IEPF Authority. However, 
GRUH Finance Limited (‘GRUH’) amalgamated into and with 
your Bank with effect from October 17, 2019, and in light 
of the aforesaid provisions, the equity shares issued by your 
Bank as against the equity shares held by the shareholders of 
erstwhile GRUH and unclaimed dividend pertaining to such 
equity shares not claimed for seven consecutive years were 
required to be transferred to the IEPF during the FY 2023-
24. Accordingly, the dividends that remained unclaimed for 
seven years, have been transferred to the IEPF during the 
FY 2023-24. Further, such equity shares, in respect of which 
dividend has not been claimed for seven consecutive years or 
more from the date of transfer to unpaid dividend account, 
have also been transferred to the demat account of the IEPF 
Authority.
	
The details of unclaimed dividends and shares transferred to 
IEPF Authority during FY 2023-24 are as follows:

same from the IEPF Authority by following the below-
mentioned process:

are requested to submit the original documents complete in all 
respects pertaining to the claim to the Bank or its RTA)

e-form IEPF-5. In case the original documents complete in 
all respect are not received by the Bank well within 30 days 
from the date of filing of web-based e-form IEPF-5, the Bank 
would be bound to file e-verification report for rejection of 
such claims. Upon submission of e-verification report by 
the Bank, the IEPF Authority shall verify the documents as 
submitted by such shareholder and may approve/ reject 
such claim.
	
In the interest of the shareholders, your Bank has sent 
reminders to the shareholders to claim their dividends/
equity shares, three months before the due date for transfer 
to IEPF Authority. Notices in this regard were also published 
in the newspapers and the details of unclaimed dividends

Management Discussion & Analysis Report
A. 	 Global and Indian Economic Scenario
	
Global economy – fared better than expected
	
Global economy had a better than expected year in 2023 as 
inflation peaked out for most of the economies while growth 
remained steady. Factors, such as, government and private 
spending, along with real disposable income gains, drove the 
upswing. Consumption was supported despite tight labour 
markets, as households continue to tap into pandemic-era 
savings along with robust gains in wages. Euro area, however, 
continued to witness soft growth on the back of weak 
consumer sentiment. Global growth, is projected to remain 
steady at 3.2 per cent. in both 2024 and 20251.
	
Monetary policy remained restrictive for most central banks 
primarily in order to combat higher inflation. Global headline 
inflation is expected to fall from an estimated 6.8 per cent. 
in 2023 (annual average) to 5.9 per cent. in 2024 and 4.5 per 
cent. in 20252.
	
With disinflation and steady growth, the likelihood of a 
recession is more or less ruled out and interest rates are 
expected to get lowered in the second half of 2024. Having 
said that, growth forecast for 2024 for most economies 
remains below the historical average as multi-year high 
interest rates are expected to slightly dampen growth 
prospects. Policymakers’ near-term challenge will be to 
intricately manage the final descent of inflationary forces 
while being cognizant of the fact that growth might need 
support in the latter half of the year. Potential risks to macro-
stability like commodity price upswing, geopolitical tensions 
and looming debt burden would need close monitoring.
	
Inflation easing faster than expected
	
Inflation rates have been declining at a faster pace than 
anticipated, as readings have approached the pre-pandemic 
average for both headline and core inflation, highlighting 
significant progress. This healthy progress on inflation can 
be attributed to higher interest rates induced demand 
moderation along with easing commodity prices. Resolution 
of pandemic-era supply chain issues has also helped 
in improving supply side bottlenecks and have aided in 
reducing cost pressures. Near-term inflation expectations 
have decreased across major economies, while long-term 
expectations have remained stable, indicating a level of 
anchored confidence in price stability.
	
Interest rates expected to come down in the second half of 
2024
	
Major central banks raised policy interest rates to restrictive 
levels in 2023. However, the policy decisions have been quite 
varied across various developing and developed economies. 
Annex - 5
United States Fed had raised rates 11 times between 
March 2022 to July 2023 and is now expected to ease 
rates in second half of 2024. On the other hand, countries 
such as Brazil and Chile, have seen declining inflation and 
subsequently reduced interest rates since the second half 
of 2023 in order to support faltering growth. Conversely, 
Japan have responded to persistent inflation by shifting to a 
more restrictive monetary policy stance for the first time 
since late 1990s.
	
But with easing of prices and steady growth levels, 
expectations of future policy rate reductions are very much 
in the horizon. However, the pace and direction of rate 
action would be varied across economies depending on the 
price-growth dynamics of the individual country.
	
Factors critical to future policy decisions
	
a)	
Geopolitical tensions:
	
	
The Ukraine war and renewed Middle East tensions, 
including Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, underscore the 
critical role of geopolitics in shaping the 2024 global 
economy. Beyond potential oil disruptions, the Red Sea 
attacks threaten to elevate freight insurance, lengthen 
trade routes, and exacerbate supply chain disruptions, 
potentially 
fuelling 
inflation 
and 
consequently 
disrupting livelihoods. Geopolitics continues to take 
a centre-stage in determining global policy stances 
around security, macro-economy and trade.
	
b)	
Climate disruptions:
	
	
Climate change threatens the stability of the global 
economy by disrupting key resources, causing extreme 
weather events, and creating uncertainty. Record-
breaking heat in 2023 and climate shocks like droughts 
and floods continue to threaten livelihood and food 
security. On the other hand, severe episodes of 
drought-induced depletion of water levels has reduced 
the count of transiting ships through the Panama Canal. 
These two examples indicate how climate change is 
quickly transitioning from a medium-term hazard to a 
near-term risk. Policy makers are increasingly baking 
in climate disruptions into their assumptions while 
devising policies.
	
c)	
China’s economic conundrum:
	
	
The world’s second largest economy is witnessing 
it’s one of the softest growth periods as a debt crisis 
in the property sector added to geopolitical tensions 
and weakening global demand. International Monetary 
Fund (‘IMF’) has projected Chinese growth to slow 
down to 3.5 per cent. by 2028 and also stated that 
1World Economic Outlook, April 2024l
2World Economic Outlook, April 2024
124
Bandhan Bank Limited
uncertainty surrounding the outlook is very high. 
Protracted slowdown in Chinese economy could pose 
contagion risks to the rest of the world through various 
economic and financial channels.
	
d)	
Rise in global debt:
	
	
Global debt has increased massively to hit a record of 
$307 trillion in 20233. Both advanced and developing 
economies are facing the pressure, with more than 
80 per cent. of the incremental debt build up in 2023 
coming from developed economies. This rise in global 
debt significantly reduces fiscal space for governments 
to incur targeted expenditures while creating 
considerable uncertainty regarding macro-financial 
stability.
	
Some other key themes, both short-term and long-term, 
that remain crucial to policymaking going forward are 
discussed below:
	
1)	
Upcoming elections critical to future policy course:
	
	
The continuation of existing policies, alongside 
necessary reforms and implementation of new 
initiatives, will be a critical factor in determining the 
trajectory of the global economic, social and political 
landscape.
	
2)	
Emergence of Artificial Intelligence (‘AI’):
	
	
AI has moved leaps and bounds in recent years and is 
poised to impact employment generation, job quality, 
and overall productivity of the global economy. In 
a latest study by IMF, almost 40 per cent. of global 
employment is exposed to AI and could potentially 
have significant impact on livelihood and income 
distribution4. Balanced and swift policies regarding AI 
remain crucial as rapid growth in this sector seems 
imminent in the next few years. This could unlock 
greater investment, enhanced productivity and 
accelerate convergence to higher income levels.
	
3)	
Divergence in demographics across nations:
	
	
Large economies like Japan and China are on the verge 
of a structural shift in terms of demographic mix as 
they transition to an ageing economy. United Nations 
(‘UN’) projections indicate an increase in number of 
countries experiencing annual population decline, from 
41 countries in 2022 to 88 countries in 2050. Since 
demographic trends are also relatively predictable, key 
stakeholders have a fairly wide window of opportunity 
to enact policies and encourage behaviours that shape 
future demographics and cushion potential adverse 
impacts of the demographic changes that do occur. 
However, this also provides opportunity for nations like 
India, who are endowed with large young labour force, 
to capitalise on global efforts to diversify supply chains 
and propel higher growth.
	
4)	
Inequality is still on the rise:
	
	
While extreme poverty in middle-income countries 
has decreased, poverty in the poorest countries and 
countries affected by conflicts still remains on the rise. 
The persistence of poverty in these countries makes 
key global development goals much harder to achieve5. 
In India, divergence of income growth between the 
super-rich and poor has also continued to widen - 
between 1961 and 2023, the top 1 per cent. wealth 
share increased threefold, from 13 per cent. to 39 per 
cent.6 This warrants timely and targeted policies to 
alleviate the deprived sections of the society in order 
to foster equitable and significant income growth.
Indian Economy – continues to shine
The Indian economic growth story in FY 2023-24 continued 
to maintain its momentum with growth prints exceeding 
expectations. The World Bank has highlighted that India will be a 
major contributor to Asia’s growth story and it is expected to see 
GDP growth of around 7 per cent. in FY 2024-25. Anticipations of 
a renewed wave of capital expenditure by the corporate sector 
are poised to be the leading driver of the forthcoming phase of 
economic expansion in FY 2024-25. On the other hand, inflation 
has started to ease from the peaks observed in November 2023 
and December 2023, while core inflation has reached its lowest 
level in several years. Moderation in inflation means that bulk 
of the policy rate hike is behind for India and RBI is very much 
expected to lower rates in the second half of FY 2024-25.
India has long held the promise of a young, aspirational population, 
backed by robust democratic and business frameworks. Following 
a prolific period of reform, increasing global influence, and rapid 
digitisation, investors are now directing their attention towards 
the impending inception of ‘India’s decade’. In 2023, India also 
hosted one of the most successful G20 summits and has shown its 
ability to generate consensus among a diverse group of countries. 
This pivotal juncture coincides with India’s status as the fastest-
growing major economy, amidst a polarised global landscape 
characterised by elevated debt levels, decelerating growth, and 
heightened uncertainty.
Economic indicators point to a robust domestic economy, aided by 
pro-active and growth positive policies. Below we discuss some of 
the macro-economic parameters indicating the Indian economic 
juggernaut.
•	
Government capex induced investment propelled domestic 
growth in FY 2023-24; private capex revival underway-
	
Capex growth, averaging 8.5 per cent. since June 2022, 
reached double digits at 10.6 per cent. in the December 
2023 quarter, compared to the pre-pandemic average of 7.3 
per cent. (2017-2019)7. Government-led capital spending 
has driven the recovery in capital expenditure since Covid. 
In FY 2024-25 interim budget, the Government has allotted

₹2.78 lakh crore for the road ministry, up about 2.8 per cent. 
compared to last year, while another ₹ 2.55 lakh crore will be 
given to the Indian Railways. This is the fourth consecutive 
increase in capital investment by the Government and this 
is expected to stimulate private capital expenditure, drive 
economic growth and propel higher consumption. Disparity 
in capital expenditure among states has come down, 
resulting in inclusive expansion of capital across the nation in 
the last few years. That bodes well for the long-term growth 
of India.
	
Private capital expenditure, which has been subdued over 
the past decade, is expected to turn a corner during the 
next few years primarily due to favourable interest rates 
and Government’s focus on infrastructure development, 
enhancing 
the 
investment 
climate 
and 
attracting 
private funds.
•	
Overall demand continues to be stable; recovery in rural 
demand ongoing-
	
Private Final Consumption Expenditure (‘PFCE’) growth 
remained stable at 4 per cent. during the quarter ended 
March 31, 2024 as compared to the quarter ended March 
31, 20238. Rural consumption remained a bit muted, 
primarily due to uneven monsoon. On the other hand, urban 
consumption has remained relatively strong. Consumption 
growth is expected to recover durably in FY 2024-25, led 
by the revival in rural consumption. Consumer sentiment 
has remained steady while demand indicators like non-
oil imports and two wheelers sales reflect consumption is 
gaining strength. Going forward, continued emphasis on 
capex, lower inflation, and improved monsoon forecasts are 
expected to alleviate rural demand distress.
•	
Sustained optimism in manufacturing and service sectors-
	
Propelled by new orders, upturn in inventories and higher 
job creation, India’s manufacturing activity hit a 16-year 
high of 59.1 in March 2024 as indicated by Purchasing 
Managers Index (‘PMI’). The latest PMI numbers showed 
that manufacturing output rose for the 33rd month running in 
March 2024, and to the greatest extent since October 2020.
	
Service sector continues to deliver robust growth as 
witnessed during FY 2022-23 despite global headwinds. 
Latest PMI print of service sector indicates that the sector 
has continued to be expansionary since August 20219.
	
There are structural tailwinds at play for the Indian economy, 
indicating that the Indian growth story could be a multi-
decadal phenomenon. The Indian story in the next few 
decades is likely to be driven by the broad themes of: - a) 
rapid digitisation, b) demographic dividend, c) increased and 
improved credit access, d) sustainability, and e) effective and 
transformative policy making.
	
a)	
Digital infrastructure development remains rampant:
	
	
•	
Digitalisation in India has been progressing 
steadily, first covering large urban areas, followed 
by smaller urban areas and rural areas.
	
	
•	
Digital growth in India is getting a further 
fillip now and would become a major factor 
in sustaining India’s long-term growth story. 
According to the State of India’s Digital Economy 
Report, 2024, by Indian Council for Research 
on International Economic Relations (‘ICRIER’), 
the state of digitalisation in India is better than 
some developed countries including the United 
Kingdom, Germany and Japan, compared by their 
aggregate level of digitalisation.
	
	
•	
The foundation of India’s digital transformation 
lies in building a democratic and efficient digital 
infrastructure to ensure ease of living. The Digital 
India initiative has been instrumental in achieving 
this goal, and it has been extended with a 
total budget of ₹14,903 crore from FY 2021-22 to 
FY 2025-2610.
	
	
•	
India’s foundational Digital Public Infrastructure 
(‘DPI’), called India Stack, has been harnessed 
to foster innovation and competition, expand 
markets, close gaps in financial inclusion, boost 
government revenue collection and improve 
public expenditure efficiency.
	
	
•	
Emerging technologies have played a key role 
in fuelling the growth of the Indian economy. 
Technologies like cloud computing and artificial 
intelligence have helped businesses in India 
become more efficient and productive.
	
b)	
Demographic dividend is expected to stimulate multi-
decadal domestic growth:
	
	
•	
As per the United Nations Population Fund’s 
(‘UNFPA’) State of World Population Report 
2023, India now is the most populous country 
in the world, with 68 per cent. of the population 
belonging to the working age category, i.e. 15-64 
age group.
	
	
•	
Government’s continued focus on building social 
infrastructure, 
including 
education, 
skilling, 
public health and nutrition, and drinking water 
and sanitation, will lead to a more productive 
and proficient workforce. This is crucial for the 
success story of India’s growth.

•	
Mismatch in skillsets availability and industry-
specific 
needs, 
along 
with 
low 
human 
development parameters are some of the 
challenges that holds the potential to derail 
India’s demographics driven growth momentum. 
Policy makers need to closely monitor these 
concerns and act accordingly to make the most 
use of this dividend.
	
c)	
Increased access to credit is crucial for long-term 
growth:
	
	
•	
India has witnessed a significant surge in credit 
penetration, which could be a very significant 
instance in the nation’s economic and social 
landscape. The latest data reveal a notable 
increase in the number of individuals and 
businesses accessing credit, a trend that is largely 
influenced by the concerted efforts towards 
financial inclusion.
	
	
•	
Financial inclusion has played a pivotal role in 
fostering the growth of credit penetration in 
India. Initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan 
Dhan Yojana (‘PMJDY’) have been instrumental 
in bringing a vast segment of the population into 
the formal banking system.
	
	
•	
In terms of the numbers for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2024, credit growth expanded by 
16 per cent. year-on-year (excluding HDFC 
merger impact), which is well-above last year’s 
print of 15 per cent.11 Personal loans continued 
to drive credit demand while bank credit 
growth outpaced deposit growth significantly in 
FY 2023-2412. The medium-term prospects look 
promising with sustained growth in personal 
loans along with the anticipated increase in capex 
spending, especially in the private sector.
	
	
•	
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (‘MSMEs’) 
credit drive: Credit supply to MSMEs grew by 
14 per cent. year-on-year during FY 2023-24, 
indicating robust lender confidence 13. Commercial 
credit lending still continues to maintain its 
overall growth post initial boost provided by 
ECLGS scheme (launched by Government of India 
to support credit to MSME sector).
	
	
•	
Improved credit access to women: Women 
borrowers in India have increased at a Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (‘CAGR’) of 15 per cent. over 
the last five years compared to a CAGR growth 
of 11 per cent. for male borrowers. The share 
of women borrowers has increased from 25 per 
cent. in 2017 to 28 per cent. in 202214.
	
	
•	
India’s credit growth is expected to remain 
buoyant over the next several years, driven by 
economic growth, pro-active policy making and a 
surge in retail lending through digital channels.
	
d)	
Sustainability driven inclusive growth is the way 
forward:
	
	
•	
Embracing renewable energy resources will 
play a crucial part in the development of India’s 
sustainable strategy. India currently stands as 
the world’s third-largest producer of renewable 
energy, with 42 per cent. of its installed capacity 
sourced from clean and sustainable options. 
India’s goal of producing 500 GW of renewable 
energy capacity by 2030 will unlock 80 per cent. 
of power capacity additions from renewable 
sources15.
	
	
•	
As of February 2024, renewable energy sources, 
including large hydropower, have a combined 
installed capacity of 183.49 GW. India will witness 
more than 83 per cent. increase in investments 
in renewable energy projects to around $6.5 
billion in 2024 as the country focuses on energy 
transition to reduce carbon emissions16.
	
	
•	
The National Green Hydrogen Mission is aimed at 
making India a global hub for manufacturing this 
clean source of energy and is expected to lead to 
the development of 5 million metric tonnes per 
annum of green hydrogen production capacity by 
2030. The Union Cabinet approved the National 
Green Hydrogen Mission with a total initial outlay 
of ₹19,744 crore17.
B.	 Indian Banking Sector: Key Developments
	
Indian Banking Sector: Robust and healthy
	
During FY 2023-24, credit offtake grew at a robust 20.2 per 
cent. year-on-year (including HDFC merger) and 16.3 per 
cent. year-on-year (excluding HDFC merger)18, outpacing 
deposit growth which grew by 13.5 per cent. (including 
HDFC merger) and 12.9 per cent. (excluding HDFC merger)18. 
As a result, the credit-to-deposit (‘CD’) ratio has increased to 
around 80.3 per cent. for all Scheduled Commercial Banks 
(‘SCBs’), with a significantly higher ratio for private sector 
banks as compared to public sector banks19.

of SCBs fell to an twelve-year low of 2.8 per cent. in 
March 2024 whereas the Net Non-Performing Assets 
(‘NNPA’) improved to a record low of 0.6 per cent. in 
March 2024.
	
f.	
The FSR also highlights that the Indian banking sector 
would be able to withstand severe stress conditions 
in credit, as per extensive macro stress tests. This 
underscores India’s banking sector strength with 
respect to any significant spill-overs from a possible 
banking crisis in the developed economies.
	
g.	
Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) has continued to 
emphasise that sustained focus must be on a customer-
centric approach to strengthen the confidence of 
people in the banking system. The apex body has also 
exhorted banks to further strengthen governance and 
assurance functions, which is crucial for the economic 
and financial stability of India.

According to a latest report by PwC and Association of 
Microfinance Institutions of India, global Microfinance 
Institutions (‘MFI’) industry is expected to grow at 
a compound annual growth rate of 11.6 per cent.24 
MFIs, which have acted as a financial support system to 
low-income households by offering credit access, will 
continue to play a leading role in the growth process 
of India. Following data indicates the continued growth 
and widening scale of MFI in India25 :

– Microfinance Institutions (‘NBFC-MFIs’) share 
at 40 per cent. followed by banks at 33 per cent., 
Small Finance Banks (‘SFB’) at 17 per cent. and 
NBFCs at 9 per cent. 
	
	
•	
The portfolio growth has been pronounced for 
SFBs (28 per cent. year-on-year) and NBFCs 
(38 per cent. year-on-year). Portfolio for banks 
rose by 21 per cent. while for NBFC-MFIs the 
growth came in at 24 per cent.

With strong and ever-improving public and financial 
institutions in place, India stands at an opportune 
moment to ride the next cycle of growth in the coming 
decades.
	
Potential threats
	
•	
The impediment to the Indian growth story mainly 
stems from the external sector:– significant slowdown 
in overseas demand and persisting global inflation may 
temper growth outlook for India.
	
•	
Another risk to growth could be from worsening 
supply-chain 
bottlenecks 
(due 
to 
increased 
geopolitical tensions). This may result in lower trade 
volumes, uncertainty in policy making and pick-up of 
inflation primarily due to volatile commodity prices, 
resulting in tempering of overall growth expectations.
	
•	
Rapid technological disruption may require traditional 
enterprises to rejig their business model quicker 
than expected. This could also result in a skill-jobs 
mismatch resulting in below-expected employment 
growth, which would significantly hinder the optimal 
use of India’s favourable demographics. Policy makers, 
businesses and employees would need to be prepared 
and act accordingly. 
	
•	
Corporations and policymakers would continue to 
remain cognizant of risks from adverse climatic 
changes. One such risk could be food supply shock 
due to unfavourable monsoon conditions in 2024. This 
could entail risks to domestic food security along with 
aiding the resurgence of inflationary pressures.

Dear Shareholders,
It gives me immense pleasure to present the Business Sustainability and Responsibility Report (‘BRSR’) of your Bank for the Financial 
Year 2023-24. Since its inception, your Bank has carved a unique position in serving society through its inclusive banking as envisioned 
in its mission and vision statements. The statement ‘Apka Bhala, sabki bhalai’ sums up your Bank’s purpose. With 75.30 per cent. of 36.6 
million customers belonging to Emerging Entrepreneurs Business and 70 per cent. of its 6,735 banking outlets, being in semi-urban and 
rural areas, is evident enough to demonstrate your Bank’s commitment to serving the unbanked and the underbanked section of society.
The trust of the consumers, is key to exceptional growth both in terms of deposits and advances, exceeding the 1 lakh crore mark. 
The total deposits stood at `1.35 lakh crore, with over 25 per cent. YoY growth whereas, advances (Net) reached 1.21 lakh crore, with 
over 15.6 per cent. YoY growth.
Your Bank has relentlessly demonstrated strong governance since its inception with a majority of independent directors, including the 
Chairman and the position of the Chairman, has separate offices for the non-executive chairman and MD&CEO, ensuring the highest 
governance standards. Under the leadership of your Bank’s core management team, 75,748 employees are committed to bringing the 
best practices in providing banking services to all its stakeholders with the highest integrity, compliance, accountability and ensuring a 
‘High-tech and High-touch’ model of customer services.

through its CSR initiatives reached out to more than 24.47 lakh families and has helped them improve their lives through programmes like 
Targeting Hard-core Poor, health, education, skill development, financial literacy, business incubation and Climate Action Programme that

has contracted 50 water harvesting structures for water conservation. These initiatives have led to the sequestration of CO2 and rainwater 
harvesting that partially offsets the carbon footprint and water consumption of your Bank.

26. Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
 
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social matters 
that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or mitigate the risk, 
along with its financial implications, as per the following format:
	
Materiality assessment is the process of determining topics (issues) that can impact economic, environmental, social and governance 
attributes in banking operations. It has the potential to influence the decisions of stakeholders, who are willing to partner like 
customers, shareholders, lenders and investors. The preliminary step in materiality assessment is to identify and consult with the 
right set of stakeholders (or representatives) who can provide useful insights. The materiality assessment process includes –
a) 
Identification of sector-specific material topics: The process involves identifying relevant peer companies across the banking sector 
and mapping standards like the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (‘UN SDGs’), 
International Integrated Reporting Council (‘IIRC’) requirements, to understand the appropriate material topics.
b) 
Identification of external stakeholders: The Bank assesses the impact of its banking operations on its investors, customers, 
employees, community, regulatory bodies, value chain partners, media, civil and societies to evaluate ways to further improve 
stakeholder value creation.

c) 
External stakeholder consultation: The Bank liaisons with external stakeholders and seeks their perception and comments on the 
identified material topics. Such material topics are further prioritised basis of the importance they hold to each stakeholder group 
and their feedback.
d) 
Prioritisation of material topics relevant to the Bank: External stakeholder responses are first assessed and collated. The collated 
material topics are categorised into low, medium and high categories and finally, the materiality map is finalised post consultation 
with the decision-making committee and senior leadership team.
	
The Bank remains committed to implementing relevant policies to ensure responsible banking conduct and undertake required 
sustainability initiatives. Based on the prioritised material topics, the Bank has identified relevant risks and opportunities that are 
mentioned below. This report includes information, which is material to all stakeholders of the Bank, and it presents an overview of 
the Bank’s businesses and associated activities. The Bank discloses matters that substantially impact or affect the Bank’s ability to 
create value. To ensure effective mitigation of identified risks, the Bank carries out a materiality analysis, to identify topics material to 
the Bank and its stakeholders. The sensitivity of an issue to stakeholders and the Bank, in terms of importance, forms the basis of the 
materiality analysis, which in turn guides the processes for identifying, managing, and devising specific action plans for addressing 
these material aspects. Every material topic is taken into account, and the Bank has policies and procedures in place to address these 
topics in order to create sustainable growth and long-term value.

1.
Climate Change-
Related Risks
Risk
•	
Climate-related risks refer to the 
potential risks that may arise from 
climate change or from efforts to 
mitigate climate change, its impact 
and the economic and financial 
consequences.
•	
It can impact the financial sector 
through two broad channels - physical 
risks and transition risks.
•	
Physical Risk: The physical impacts 
from climate change will feed through 
to an economy in various ways, 
including damages to physical assets 
through extreme weather, reduced 
agricultural productivity, heat-related 
health and medical issues, and loss of 
biodiversity.
•	
Transition Risk: It refers to the 
risks arising from the process of 
adjustment towards a low-carbon 
economy. 
A 
range 
of 
factors 
influences this adjustment, including 
changes in climate-related policies 
and regulations, the emergence 
of 
newer 
technologies, 
shifting 
sentiments 
and 
behaviour 
of 
customers. The process of transition, 
i.e., reducing carbon emissions may 
have a significant impact on the 
economy.
•	
The uncertainty about the timing 
and severity of climate-related risks 
like physical risk and transition risk 
threatens the safety, soundness and 
resilience of regulated entities (REs) 
and in turn, it affects the overall 
stability of the financial system.
•	
Financial, reputational, regulatory 
and market risk implications are 
becoming increasingly prominent 
with increased threats of climate 
change such as but not limited to 
floods, droughts, erratic rainfall, 
supply chain disruptions, change in 
market perception and shift towards 
more 
environmentally 
friendly 
products and services.
•	
The Bank has a robust governance 
structure to develop climate-related risk 
mitigation strategies, ensure effective 
implementation of the identified levers 
and monitor performance against such 
risks at regular intervals.
•	
The Bank ensures that climate-related 
risks like floods, cyclones and external 
rating impact on industries with CO2 
emissions are properly reflected in 
the Bank's short-term and long-term 
capital planning under the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP)* through stress testing and 
impact analysis.
	
*(ICAAP under BASEL accord – a 
mechanism to ensure the institution's 
strategic focus, business plan and 
internal 
procedures 
for 
ensuring 
adequate possession of long-term 
capital resources to cover all material 
risks.)
•	
The Bank is deliberating to embark on 
a journey of advocating sustainability 
in its value chain, such as assessment 
of the GHG emission footprint of its 
lending portfolio, lender’s customer 
targets and commitments on ESG 
resource optimisation, evaluating the 
quantum of collateral positioned in 
high-risk flood/drought-prone areas, 
checking green building certifications of 
real estate portfolios, social inclusivity 
of corporates, SME & MSME customers.
•	
Within its operation, the Bank is 
considering greening the branches 
and data centres, eliminating the 
use of paper in the operations, 
introducing the option of e-receipts 
on registered mobile numbers at 
their ATMs, evaluating options of 
switching over to renewable energy for 
sourcing power gradually and future-
proofing operations against regulatory 
requirements.
Negative financial implications:
•	
Financial/Credit risk: Rising 
frequency and severity of 
extreme weather events 
can impair the value of 
assets held by the Banks’ 
customers, or impact supply 
chains affecting customers’ 
operations and profitability 
and leading to higher loan 
defaults and NPAs.
•	
Market 
risk: 
Increased 
volatility 
in 
investments 
because of shifts in investor 
preferences 
or 
climate-
induced 
adverse 
effects 
might lead to a decline in 
lending portfolio valuation.
•	
Reputational 
risk: 
Failure 
to 
address 
the 
challenging climate change 
vulnerabilities 
will 
affect 
stakeholders’ trust resulting 
in loss of customer base.

face 
expanding regulatory and reporting 
requirements to ensure transparency

and 
benchmarking themselves against 
the best practices in Corporate 
Governance.

penalties 
and

7.

are central to safeguard the reputation and 
business success of financial institutions.
•	
By adopting a strong ethical culture, 
the Bank maintains its reputation as a 
trusted financial institution.
•	
Effective governance practices help

10.
Financial Inclusion
Opportunity
•	
Financial 
inclusion 
and 
serving 
the underserved is a hallmark of 
the Bank. In terms of its banking 
operations and customer base, the 
Bank is highly invested in addressing 
financial inclusion.
•

high-touch approach enables much 
deeper last-mile doorstep delivery of 
banking services.

expand its banking operation across the 
country and has been diversifying its 
operations to non-east states.
•	
More than 75 per cent. (25.3 million) of 
the customers are EEB customers and 
the Bank has more than 70 per cent. 
Banking outlets are in rural in semi-
urban areas, which is in alignment with 
the Bank’s vision of catering for the

government schemes related to the 
agri sector, social security schemes etc.
•

financial 
products 
to 
individuals

traditional 
banking 
system 
will 
provide 
deeper 
market 
penetration and will unleash the 
Bank’s true growth potential.

The Bank has an anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy embedded in the Code of Conduct section of the HR Policy and is also 
available on the website as part of the Compendium of BRSR Policies. Every new joinee signed the hard copy and also digitally 
in the HRMS portal for the first time use. Subsequently, every year in the month of April all employees including KMP and senior 
management digitally undertake the annual code of conduct declaration, containing the anti-bribery and anti-corruption provisions 
of the Bank.
	
Additionally, the Bank has a Vigilance Policy and whistleblower Policy, which aim to effectively implement systems and procedures 
to prevent corruption, serving as a deterrent for any wrongdoing. The Bank has established a two-tier system, viz., (i) the Chief of 
Internal Vigilance (‘CIV’) and (ii) the Disciplinary Committee which bears the responsibility of (a) investigating any alleged or proven 
misconduct employees by an employee and (b) taking necessary punitive actions, respectively.
	
The Bank is extremely strict in taking measures against wrongdoings, misconduct and cases of bribery and corruption, adhering to 
its zero-tolerance practice. Furthermore, the CIV takes measures to prevent bribery by conducting periodic reviews and checks on 
high-value purchases made by the Bank, scrutinising assets held or declared by senior management and employees and probing 
into any reported cases of conflicts of interest involving employees. These measures ensure 100% compliance from all employees, 
as the Bank strives towards zero cases of non-compliance. The CIV apprises the MD&CEO about the monthly vigilance activities and 
submits the report to the Audit Committee of the Board.

The Bank is a service provider and a regulated entity and operates as per the Banking 
Regulations. Therefore, the scope of Capex to improve the environmental and social 
impacts of products and processes is not material to the Bank. However, the Bank has 
taken several environmental and social initiatives, as mentioned below.
Environmental – The Bank has transitioned effectively into a digital banking ecosystem. 
This has helped the Bank in reducing its usage of paper across its branches and operations. 
The Bank has also invested in various innovative technologies and IT transformations 
across all its branches.
The energy-efficient lighting system and water-saving technology have led to a reduction 
in power and water usage. The seamless transactions through mobile and net banking 
have led to a reduction in commuting time to the branches, thereby considerably reducing 
vehicular emissions and costs from commutation and energy consumption.
Social – The Bank has established EEB banking units catering to the underbanked rural 
and semi-urban areas leading to greater financial inclusion in the remote areas. The 
Bank has brought banking to the doorsteps of marginalised and economically backward 
communities through these Business Units. The Bank has taken several initiatives of 
financial literacy and financial empowerment amongst vulnerable groups such as rural 
housewives, and women entrepreneurs, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access for all 
sections of society, to banking services.
During the pandemic and post-pandemic restrictions, many of the customers of your 
Bank lost their livelihoods, which made them financially vulnerable. To strengthen the 
customers, your Bank came up with products specifically designed for these situations 
and ensured that the customers get the maximum financial assistance during the toughest 
time in their lives.
To overcome digital-based challenges, the Bank is providing training to enhance customer 
awareness of the benefits of digital payments and various other aspects, such as seeding 
bank accounts with mobile numbers and Aadhaar.
The Bank scaled up the first of its kind ‘Android PoS’, a testament to the commitment to 
providing innovative and customer-centric solutions to merchants and promoting digital 
payments in remote areas.
2. 
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/ No)
	
Owing to the nature of the banking products and services offered, sustainable sourcing may not be a significant material topic for 
the Bank. However, the Bank endeavours to integrate sustainability in the supply chain(s) for its products and services across its 
operations. Wherever feasible, the Bank tries to incorporate sustainable sourcing in its operations. For procurement of equipment, 
the Bank ensures that energy efficiency standards are considered during the purchase of electronic equipment such as computers, 
laptops, lighting devices, ACs amongst others.
	
The Bank’s supply chain includes outsourced agencies, third-party service providers, transporters, suppliers of materials and capital 
goods, franchisees, dealers and distributors. The Bank recognises the need to work closely with the suppliers to reduce waste, 
improve efficiency, reduce carbon footprint and continuously work towards ensuring greater integration of environmental factors in 
its procurement practices.
	
In line with the bank’s sustainability commitment, it has prioritised several key actions, as mentioned below:
	
Partnering for Good: The Bank actively seeks suppliers who demonstrate ethical labour practices, environmental responsibility, and 
high-quality standards. Transparency and minimising environmental impact are key factors in supplier selection.
Corporate 
Overview
Statutory 
Reports
Financial 
Statement

Sustainable Procurement Policies: Formalised procurement policies guide sourcing decisions, ensuring suppliers align with the 
bank’s values of environmental and social accountability.
	
Minimising Environmental Footprint: The Bank is mindful of the environmental impact of its procurement activities. We actively 
work to reduce waste, promote energy efficiency, and encourage the use of renewable resources throughout their operations and 
supply chain.
	
Social Impact: Beyond environmental considerations, the bank prioritises social impact. We choose suppliers who uphold human 
rights, provide safe working conditions, and contribute positively to their communities.
	
Continuous Improvement: The Bank remains dedicated to ongoing improvement in its sustainable sourcing practices. Regular 
reviews and updates to procurement policies ensure they incorporate emerging sustainability trends and best practices.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for:
	
(a) 
Plastics (including packaging),
 
(b) 
E-waste,
 
(c) 
Hazardous waste, and
 
(d) 
Other waste.
	
The Bank does not have a physical product offerings in its normal course of operations. Therefore, there is an insignificant footprint 
of waste generation for the reclamation for reusing and recycling of such wastes.
	
a)	
Plastics – The plastic usage in the products is minimal, hence, reclamation of plastics is not applicable. However, in its day-to-
day usage, there are plastic usage recycling bins for designated plastics like water bottles and other plastic containers. These 
are collected by a recycling service and processed according to local regulations.
	
b)	
E-waste - E-waste generated from the banking operations across all offices and branches is responsibly disposed of by third-
party service providers.
	
c)	
Hazardous Waste – Owing to the nature of the operations as a banking facility, there isn’t much scope for the generation of 
hazardous waste from the Bank’s branches and offices that are owned and controlled by third parties.
	
d)	
Other Waste – Paper waste is disposed of for recycling by third-party service providers.
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/ No). If yes, whether the waste 
collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, 
provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No. As the Bank does not have any physical product offering or has any major plastics usage in its products and services, the Bank 
does not qualify for any EPR obligation.

The Bank believes that promoting equal opportunity in the workplace based on merit and ability can create an environment 
conducive to higher engagement and productivity. The Bank has achieved this by communicating the coverage of the policy to 
all employees in an appropriate and meaningful manner. In line with the sustainable development ethos of non-discrimination, 
and inclusive growth, the hiring and performance evaluation, compensation, training and employee benefits, are devoid of any 
discrimination based on caste, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, ancestry, marital status or affiliation with 
a political, religious or union organisation or majority/minority group.

The HR policy of the Bank incorporates the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) for 
addressing issues related to sexual harassment. An Internal Committee (IC) consisting of one Presiding 
Officer and three members is constituted at the head office to enquire into and provide redressal of 
Sexual Harassment complaints. The composition of the IC consists of at least one external member 
and one-half of the total member are women officials. In addition to POSH, the Bank has also built an 
in-house grievance redressal system which is available in the HRMS portal of the Bank. The grievance 
redressal mechanism lays down guidelines that need to be followed by the organisation, which 
include the following:
Conflict Resolution
An employee who feels that he or she is being subjected to harassment should first, where possible, 
make his/ her disapproval clearly known to the individual(s) concerned and ask that the behaviour be 
stopped. If there is no apparent change in the behaviour of the respondent, the employee concerned 
can make use of either an informal or formal resolution process for redressing their complaint.
Freedom from Retaliation
A person who in good faith brings a complaint of harassment against another person, shall not 
be subjected to any form of retaliation. The Bank prohibits retaliation against anyone who files a 
complaint in good faith, and retaliation in itself constitutes misconduct subject to disciplinary action. 
Discriminating against an employee who has made a complaint of harassment or deleteriously 
affecting the terms and conditions of employment or work environment of the employee will be 
construed as retaliation.
Confidentiality
All employees who are aware of a harassment complaint, or involved in its resolution, must recognise 
the seriousness of the situation and respect the sensitivity and confidentiality that must be accorded 
to the matter. The employees must refrain from discussing the complaint amongst themselves or 
with anyone who does not have a ‘need to know.’ Every effort will be made to preserve the dignity 
and self-respect of the parties to the complaint.
Action against false complaints
False or malicious complaints can seriously damage a person’s reputation, career, and relationships. 
If anyone makes a false or malicious complaint of harassment and it is so established after a thorough 
and proper investigation, the complainant will face disciplinary action, depending on the situation.

1. 
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if 
consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
The Bank believes that an effective stakeholder engagement process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of inclusive 
growth. The Bank accordingly anchors its stakeholder engagement on the principles of the following features:

the organisation as well as its stakeholders.
	
•	
Completeness - understanding the stakeholders’ key concerns and expectations.
	
•	
Responsiveness - responding coherently and speedily to such issues and concerns.
	
The key stakeholder groups include the Central and State Governments, regulatory/ statutory agencies, media, shareholders, clients, 
employees, local communities, channel partners, and suppliers. Attributes including dependency, accountability, immediacy, and 
influence are used to identify stakeholders. The engagement strategy recognises the individuality and distinct set of priorities of 
each stakeholder group. Stakeholder engagement insights support the Bank’s performance and help to create fresh viewpoints.

business and operations of the Bank. In view of the Bank’s sustainability objectives, business strategies, operational policies, and 
global market trends, the responses and feedback gathered during stakeholder engagement are reviewed by top management to 
understand stakeholders’ perspectives. The Board and senior management are informed of the feedback from a wide variety of 
stakeholders in order to get their advice and take appropriate action. Through its various committees, the Board is provided regular

firmly embedded in its vision and mission to improve the quality of life of the communities. Having understood the prevailing social 
needs within the communities, interventions and strategies are formulated by the CSR&SCB. The CSR&SCB has carefully reviewed 
and recommended CSR programmes targeting societal development by conducting studies on CSR intervention area identification. 
Based on these studies, the curated CSR programmes are run by the CSR Project Implementing Agency (‘PIA’).

dignity of all its stakeholders, especially, the vulnerable and marginalised groups and promotes awareness and realisation of human 
rights across its network. The Bank believes in the Principle of Natural Justice and treats all employees equally with dignity.

Management System (HRMS) platform is available for employees to access the entire Employee Life Cycle Management on their 
own devices and at their own disposal which enables employees to get their grievances redressed. In a nutshell, with the grievance 
redressal mechanism incorporated into the HRMS, the employees have a one-stop solution for any queries or complaints.

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA):
Total NPA as at March 31, 2024: `4,784.88 crore 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2024: `3,437.27 crore
(Refer Schedule 9, 18.6 & 18.7 to the Financial Statements)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Identification of NPA and measurement of provision on account 
of NPA is made based on the assessment of various criteria 
stipulated in the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) guidelines on 
‘Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification 
and Provisioning pertaining to advances’ ('IRACP').
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine 
the identification and provision required against NPAs by applying 
quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification 
of NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in 
certain sectors.
The provision against advances is based on criteria such as past 
due status, out of order status etc. The provision in respect of 
such NPAs are made based on ageing and classification of NPAs, 
recovery estimates, value of security, nature of loan products and 
other qualitative factors and is subject to minimum provisioning 
levels prescribed by the RBI and approved policy of the bank in 
this regard. In addition to this, for restructured accounts, provision 
is made for erosion/ diminution in fair value of restructured loans, 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Further, NPA classification 
is made borrower wise whereby if one facility of the borrower 
becomes NPA then all facilities of such a borrower will be treated 
as NPA. 
We have identified 'Identification of NPA and Provisioning on 
Advances' as a key audit matter in view of the significant level 
of estimation involved, as well as the stringent compliances laid 
down by the RBI in this regard.
• 
Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls 
(including application controls) over approval, recording, 
monitoring, and recovery of loans, monitoring overdue/
stressed accounts, identification of NPA, provision for NPA, 
and valuation of security including collateral. Testing of 
Application controls includes testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.
• 
Evaluated the governance process and tested controls over 
calculations of provision on non-performing advances, basis 
of provisioning in accordance with the Board approved 
policy.
• 
Selected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative 
risk factors for their assessment of appropriate classification 
as NPA including computation of overdue ageing to assess its 
correct classification and provision amount as per the IRACP 
norms and Bank policy. 
Performed other substantive procedures including but not limited 
to the following:
 
Selected sample of performing loans and assessed them 
independently as to whether these should be classified as 
NPA;
 
For sample selected, examined the security valuation, 
financial statements and other qualitative information of the 
borrowers;
 
Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other 
Banks as Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central 
Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify 
stress;
 
Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to 
ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence 
of an event of default in a particular loan account or any 
product category which needs to be considered as NPA;
 
Assessed the appropriateness of asset classification and 
adequacy of related provisioning by performing procedures 
such as computation of overdue ageing, assessment of 
borrower level, NPA identification and verification of 
applicable provision rates as per IRACP norms and Bank's 
Policy on test check basis; and assessed the adequacy of 
disclosures against the relevant accounting standards and 
RBI requirements relating to NPAs.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank has a complex IT architecture to support its day-to-day 
business operations. High volume of transactions are processed 
and recorded on single or multiple applications. 
The reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in the 
business operations of the Bank. Since large volume of transactions 
are processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that 
applications process data as expected and that changes are made 
in an appropriate manner. 
Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are 
required to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the 
data, as required, completely, accurately  and consistently for 
reliable financial reporting. 
We have identified ‘IT systems and controls’ as key audit matter 
because of the high level automation, significant number of 
systems being used by the management and the complexity of the 
IT architecture and its impact on the financial reporting system.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we 
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of 
the IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We evaluated 
and tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT 
systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit 
of the financial statements and financial reporting process of 
the Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT 
general controls with respect to the following domains:
● 
Program change management, which includes that program 
changes are moved to the production environment as per 
defined procedures and relevant segregation of environment 
is ensured.
● 
User access management, which includes user access 
provisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation 
of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, 
operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
● 
Program development, which includes controls over IT 
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting. 
In addition, understood where relevant, changes made to 
the IT landscape during the audit period.
● 
IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring 
and backup and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key 
business process, which included testing automated controls, 
automated calculations/ accounting procedures, interfaces, 
segregation of duties and system generated reports, as applicable.
We communicated with those charged with governance and 
management and tested a combination of compensating controls 
or remediated controls and/or performed alternative audit 
procedures, where necessary.

our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with 
governance for the Financial Statements
6. 
The Bank’s Board of Directors are responsible for the matters 
stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the 
preparation and presentation of these Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the Bank in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Accounting Standards specified under Section

133 of the Act read with the Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2021, and the provisions of Section 
29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and circulars, 
guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India 
(“RBI”) from time to time. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets 
of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
7. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Board of Directors 
are responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management and Board of Director either 
intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has 
no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements
8. 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial 
Statements.
9. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Bank has internal financial 
controls with reference to the Financial Statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by management of the 
Bank. 
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to 
continue as a going concern. 
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
10. We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
11. We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
12. From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
13. In our opinion, the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss 
Account have been drawn up in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 
and Section 133 of the Act.

comply with the Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Act read with Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules 2021, to the extent they 
are not inconsistent with the guidelines prescribed by 
RBI;

appointed as a director in terms of Section 164(2) of 
the Act;

accounts and other matters connected therewith, 
reference is made to our remarks in paragraph 15(b) 
above on reporting under Section 143(3)(b) of the act 
and paragraph 15(h)(vi) below on reporting under Rule 
11(g) of the Rules;
 
(g) 
With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Financial Statements of the 
Bank and the operating effectiveness of such controls, 
refer to our separate report in “Annexure A”; and
 
(h) 
With respect to the other matters to be included 
in the Auditor’s Report in accordance with Rule 11 
of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 
(as amended), in our opinion and to the best of 
our information and according to the explanations 
given to us: 
 
i. 
The Bank has disclosed the impact of pending litigations 
on its financial position in its Financial Statements – 
Refer Schedule 12 & 18.17 to the Financial Statements;
 
ii. 
The Bank did not have any long term contract including

foreseeable losses; 
 
iii. 
There has been no delay in transferring amounts, 
required to be transferred, to the Investor Education 
and Protection Fund by the Bank, during the year 
ended March 31, 2024;
 
iv. 
(a) 
The management has represented that, to the 
best of its knowledge and belief, other than as 
disclosed in the Schedule 18.33 to the Financial 
Statements, no funds have been advanced 
or loaned or invested (either from borrowed 
funds or share premium or any other sources 
or kind of funds) by the Bank to or in any other 
person(s) or entity(ies), including foreign entities 
(“Intermediaries”), with the understanding, 
whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that 
the Intermediary shall, whether, directly or 
indirectly, lend or invest in other persons or 
entities identified in any manner whatsoever by 
or on behalf of the Bank (“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) 
or provide any guarantee, security or the like on 
behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries;
 
 
(b) 
The management has represented that, to the 
best of its knowledge and belief, other than as 
disclosed in the Schedule 18.33 to the Financial 
Statements, no funds have been received by the 
Bank from any person(s) or entity(ies), including 
foreign entities (“Funding Parties”), with the 
understanding, whether recorded in writing or

entities identified in any manner whatsoever 
by or on behalf of the Funding Party (“Ultimate 
Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security 
or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries;

(c) 
Based on such audit procedures that we 
considered reasonable and appropriate in

(b)

vi. 
Based on our examination, which included test checks, 
the Bank has used various accounting software

feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility, which 
have operated throughout the year for all relevant 
transactions recorded in the software, except;
 
 
(a) 
the audit trail feature was not enabled throughout

Based on our procedures performed, we did not notice 
any instance of the audit trail feature being tampered

tampered with, does not arise.
16. In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the provisions of 
Section 197 of the Act are not applicable to the Bank by virtue 
of Section 35B(2A) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Bandhan Bank Limited
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to Financial Statements under clause (i) of 
sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
1. 
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to Financial Statements of Bandhan Bank Limited 
(“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024, in conjunction with our 
audit of the financial statements of the Bank for the year 
ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial 
Controls
2. 
The Banks’s management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Bank considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance 
Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to Banks’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Banks's 
internal financial controls with reference to Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Financial 
Statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
4. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls system with reference to Financial Statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Financial Statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
5. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Banks’s internal financial controls system with 
reference to Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference 
to financial statements
6. 
A Banks's internal financial controls with reference to 
Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Banks's internal financial controls 
with reference to Financial Statements includes those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Bank are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Bank's assets that could have a material 
effect on the Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to financial statements
7. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference 
to Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference to 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
8. 
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls system with reference 
to financial statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Bank considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

Schedule 17 – Significant accounting policies forming 
part of the financial statements for the year ended 
March 31, 2024	
1.	
Background	
 
Bandhan Bank Limited (the ‘Bank’), incorporated on 
December 23, 2014 in India, is a banking company, governed 
by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
 
Pursuant to the Banking license received from Reserve Bank 
of India on June 17, 2015, the Bank has commenced its 
banking operations from August 23, 2015. 
2.	
Basis of preparation	
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and on the accrual 
basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and comply 
with the requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule 
(Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. 
The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank used in 
the preparation of these financial statements conform 
to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India 
('Indian GAAP'), the guidelines issued by RBI from time 
to time, the accounting standards notified under section 
133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with the 
Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 to the extent 
applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking 
industry in India. 
3.	
Use of Estimates	
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with the generally accepted accounting principles requires 
the Management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
(including contingent liabilities) as at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported income and expenses during 
the reporting period. The Management believes that the 
estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
shall be prudent and reasonable. Any revisions to the 
accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the 
current and future periods. Actual results could differ from 
estimates. 
4.	
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES	
4.1	 Revenue Recognition	
 
Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account 
on an accrual basis, except in the case of interest on 
non-performing assets, which is recognised as income 
on realisation, as per the income recognition and asset 
classification norms of RBI. Accrual of income shall also 
be suspended on certain other loans, including projects 
under implementation where the implementation has been 
significantly delayed and in the opinion of the management 
significant uncertainties exist as to the final financial closure 
and/ or date of completion of the project. 
 
The Bank shall not charge and take to income account interest 
on any NPA. This will apply to Government guaranteed 
accounts also. However, interest on advances against Term 
Deposits, National Savings Certificates (NSCs), Indira Vikas 
Patras (IVPs), Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and Life policies is 
taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate 
margin is available in the accounts. 
 
Profit or Loss on sale of investments is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. However, the profit on sale of investments 
in ‘Held to Maturity’ category is appropriated (net of 
applicable taxes and amount required to be transferred to 
statutory reserve) to ‘Capital Reserve Account’.

Company (SC)/Reconstruction Company (RC), the same 
is removed from the books.
 
ii.

(i.e., book value less provisions held), the shortfall 
is debited to the profit and loss account in the year

iii. 
If the sale is for a value higher than the NBV, the excess 
provision is reversed in the year the amounts are 
received, as permitted by the RBI.

4.2.  Investments	
	
A)	
Classification	
 
 
Investments are classified into three categories, viz. 
Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS) and 
Held for Trading (HFT) at the time of purchase. 
	
	
Basis of classification:	
 
 
Investments that the Bank intends to hold till maturity 
are classified as “Held to Maturity (HTM)”. 
 
 
Investments that are held principally for sale within 90 
days from the date of purchase are classified as “Held 
for Trading (HFT)”. 
 
 
Investments, which are not classified in any of the 
above two categories, are classified as “Available for 
Sale (AFS)” investments. 
 
 
However, for disclosure in the Balance Sheet, 
investments in India are classified under six categories 
Government Securities, Other approved securities, 
Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investment in 
Subsidiaries/ Joint Ventures and Others. 
 
 
An investment is classified as HTM, HFT or AFS at the 
time of its purchase and subsequent shifting amongst 
categories is done in conformity with regulatory 
guidelines. 
 
 
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates shall be classified as HTM. 
 
 
Investments are classified as performing or non-
performing as per RBI guidelines. Non performing 
investments are subjected to similar income recognition 
and provisioning norms as prescribed by RBI for non-
performing advances. 
	
B)	
Valuation	
 
 
Broken period interest and costs such as brokerage 
paid at the time of acquisition of the security are 
charged to Profit and Loss account. Cost of investments 
is computed on weighted average cost method. 
 
 
Investments marked as AFS and HFT are marked-
to-market on a periodic basis as per relevant RBI 
guidelines. The securities are valued scrip-wise and 
depreciation /appreciation is aggregated for each 
Schedules  
forming part of the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2024
198
Bandhan Bank Limited
category. Net appreciation in each category, if any, is 
ignored, while net depreciation is provided for. The 
book value of individual securities is not changed 
consequent to the periodic valuation of investments. 
 
 
‘Held to Maturity’ securities shall be carried at their 
acquisition cost or at amortized cost if acquired at a 
premium over the face value. Any premium over the 
face value of fixed rate and floating rate securities 
acquired is amortized over the remaining period to 
maturity on a constant yield basis and straight line basis 
respectively. Where in the opinion of the management, 
a diminution, other than temporary in the value of 
investments classified under HTM has taken place, 
suitable provisions are required to be made. 
 
 
Quoted investments are valued at traded/quoted price 
available from recognized stock exchanges, subsidiary 
general ledgers account transactions, price list of RBI, 
or prices declared by Primary Dealers Association of 
India (“PDAI”) jointly with Financial Benchmarks India 
Pvt. Limited (FBIL). The market/fair value of unquoted 
government securities which are in the nature of 
statutory liquidity ratio(SLR) securities included in the 
‘Available for Sale’ and ‘Held for trading’ categories is 
valued as per the rate published by the FBIL. 
 
 
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up 
value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at Re.1 
as per the RBI guidelines. 
 
 
Treasury bills being discounted instruments shall be 
valued at current cost. 
 
 
The units of Mutual Funds are valued at the latest 
repurchase price/ net asset value declared by the 
Mutual Fund. 
 
 
Transfer 
of 
securities 
between 
categories 
of 
investments is accounted as per the RBI Guidelines 
 
 
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are 
recorded under settlement date of accounting, 
except in the case of equity shares where trade date 
accounting is followed. 
 
 
Repurchase (‘repo’) and reverse repurchase (‘reverse 
repo’) transactions including liquidity adjustment 
facility (with RBI) are accounted for as borrowing and 
lending transactions. Accordingly, securities given as 
collateral under an agreement to repurchase them 
continue to be held under the investment account 
of the Bank and the Bank would continue to accrue 
the coupon/discount on the security during the repo 
period. Also, the Bank continues to value the securities 
sold under repo as per the investment classification of 
the security. The difference between the clean price 
of the first leg and clean price of the second leg is 
recognized as interest income/expense over the period 
of the transaction in the profit and loss account. 
4.3	 Loans /Advances and Provisions thereon	
 
Advances are classified into performing and non-performing 
advances (‘NPAs’) as per the RBI guidelines and Stressed 
Asset Management & Recovery (SAMR) policy of the bank 
and are stated net of specific provisions made towards NPAs. 
Further, NPAs are classified into sub-standard, doubtful 
and loss assets based on the criteria stipulated by the RBI. 
Provisions for NPAs are made for sub-standard and doubtful 
assets at rates as prescribed by the RBI.
 
The Bank has a policy of deferment of installments for micro 
(EEB) loan borrowers in case the group meetings have 
been suspended and the same has not been considered as 
overdue for the purpose of NPA classification. 
 
Amounts recovered against debts written off in earlier years 
are recognised in the profit and loss account as credit to 
Miscellaneous Income under the head ‘Other Income’ 
 
The Bank maintains general provision on standard advances 
as prescribed by RBI. In case of micro (EEB & SBAL) lending 
portfolio, general provision on standard advances will be 
maintained by Bank at 1% comprising 0.25% as per the 
minimum provisioning requirement by RBI and 0.75% as 
additional provision. Provision made against standard assets 
is included in "Other liabilities & provisions". 
 
In case of non-performing micro (EEB & SBAL) lending 
portfolio, where 30 days have elapsed from the completion 
of loan tenure, the Bank is making 100% provision. 
 
Non-performing loans, which have been fully provided for, 
are written off when the prospect of recovery is considered 
remote as per the management estimate in compliance with 
the stressed assets management and recovery policy of the 
Bank.	
 
Restructured assets are classified and provided for in 
accordance with the guidelines issued by RBI from time to 
time. 
 
For entities with Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure 
(‘UFCE’), provision is made in accordance with the guidelines 
issued by RBI, which requires to ascertain the amount of 
UFCE, estimate the extent of likely loss and estimate the 
riskiness of unhedged position. This provision is classified 
under Schedule 5 – Other Liabilities in the Balance Sheet.

borrower counter parties in the highest risk category, in line 
with stipulations by RBI.

assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment loss, if any. 
4.7	 Depreciation and Amortisation

the year of purchase. 
 
Assets purchased and sold during the year shall be 
depreciated on the basis of actual number of days the asset 
has been put to use. 
 
In case of revision in the estimated useful life of assets 
any unamortized depreciation shall be amortised over the 
remaining useful life of the assets. 
4.8	 Impairment	
 
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine if there is any indication 
of impairment based on internal/external factors. An 
impairment loss is recognised wherever the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount which is the 
greater of the asset's net selling price and value in use. In 
assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time 
value of money and risks specific to the asset. 
 
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful 
life. 
4.9	 Foreign Currency transactions	
 
All transactions in foreign currency are recognised at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
 
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are 
translated at the Balance Sheet date at the closing rates 
of exchange notified by the Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India (‘FEDAI’) and the resulting gains or losses 
are recognised in the Profit and Loss account. 
 
Non-monetary items which are measured in terms of 
historical cost denominated in a foreign currency, are 
reported using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. 
Non-monetary items, which are measured at fair value or 
others similar valuation denominated in a foreign currency, 
are translated using the exchange rate at the date when such 
value was determined. 
 
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on 
the date of the transaction. 
 
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts outstanding as 
at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued 
at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified 
by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim 
maturities. 
 
Contingent liabilities at the Balance Sheet date on account of 
outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts, guarantees, 
acceptances, 
endorsements 
and 
other 
obligations 
denominated in a foreign currency are stated at the closing 
rates of exchange notified by the FEDAI. 
4.10	 Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS)	
 
In case of Employee stock option plan, measurement and 
disclosure of the employee share based payment plans is 
done in accordance with Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 
2014 and the Guidance Note on Accounting for Employee 
Share-based Payments, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. The cost of equity-settled transactions 
is measured using the intrinsic value method and recognised, 
together with a corresponding increase in the ‘Stock options 
outstanding account’ in reserve. The cumulative expense 
recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting 
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the 
Schedules  
forming part of the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2024
200
Bandhan Bank Limited
vesting period has expired and the Bank’s best estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The expense or credit recognized in the statement of profit 
and loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that 
period and is recognized in employee benefits expense.
 
Pursuant to RBI clarification dated August 30, 2021, the cost 
of stock options granted after March 31, 2021 to Whole Time 
Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers 
and Control Function Staff is recognised based on fair value 
method. The cost of stock options granted up to March 31, 
2021 continues to be recognised on intrinsic value method. 
The Bank uses Black-Scholes model to fair value the options 
on the grant date and the inputs used in the valuation model 
include assumptions such as the expected life of the share 
option, volatility, risk free rate and dividend yield. 
 
ESOP cost is recognised in Profit and Loss Statement on the 
basis of number of days of vesting period. 
4.11	 Retirement and employee benefits	
 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined 
contribution scheme. The Bank has no obligation, other 
than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The 
Bank recognises contribution payable to the provident fund 
scheme as expenditure, when an employee renders the 
related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for 
service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the 
contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme 
is recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution 
already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for services received before the balance 
sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset. 
 
Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is provided 
for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on projected unit 
credit method made at the end of each financial year. 
 
The Bank provides for compensated absences based on 
actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary.
 
Actuarial gains/losses are immediately taken to the profit 
and loss account and are not deferred. 
4.12	 Income Taxes	
 
Tax expenses comprises current and deferred tax. Current 
income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid 
to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income Tax 
Act, 1961 and in compliance with AS 22 "Accounting for 
Taxation Income". Deferred income taxes reflects the impact 
of current year timing differences between taxable income 
and accounting income for the year and reversal of timing 
differences of earlier years. 
 
Deferred Tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax 
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future 
taxable income will be available against which such deferred 
tax assets can be realised. If the Bank has carried forward 
unabsorbed depreciation and tax losses, all deferred tax 
assets is recognised only to the extent that there is a virtual 
certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufficient 
taxable income will be available in future against which such 
deferred tax assets can be realised.
 
At each reporting date, the Bank re-assesses unrecognised 
deferred tax assets. It recognises unrecognised deferred tax 
assets to the extent that it has become reasonably certain 
or virtually certain, as the case may be, that sufficient future 
taxable income will be available against which such deferred 
tax assets can be realised.
 
Deferred Tax liability is created on amount transferred to 
special reserve under section 36(i)(viii) of the Income Tax 
Act, 1961 as per the RBI guidelines. 
 
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date. The Bank writes down the carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets to the extent that it is no longer 
reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be, 
that sufficient future taxable income will be available against 
which deferred tax asset can be realised. Any such write 
down is reversed to the extent that it becomes reasonably 
certain or virtually certain, as the case may be that sufficient 
future taxable income will be available.
4.13	 Non-banking assets	
 
Non-banking assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of claims 
are valued at the market value on a distress sale basis or 
value of loan, whichever is lower. Further, the Bank creates 
provision on these assets as per the extant RBI guidelines or 
specific RBI directions. 
4.14	 Earnings per Share	
 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net 
profit or loss after tax for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. 
 
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution 
that could occur if contracts to issue equity shares were 
exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per 
equity share is computed using the net profit or loss for the 
period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding during the period are 
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares.
4.15	 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
 
A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present 
obligation as a result of past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are 
not discounted to their present value and are determined 
based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation 
at the reporting date. These estimates are reviewed at each 
Schedules  
forming part of the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2024

reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimates. 
 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events beyond the control of the Bank or a present 
obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare 
cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Bank does not 
recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in 
the financial statements.
 
Contingent Assets are not recognised in the financial 
statements.
4.16 Leases	
 
Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all 
the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased items are 
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are 
recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account on a 
straight line basis over the lease term. 
4.17 Cash and Cash equivalent	
 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, balances 
with RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and 
short notice.
4.18 Share Issue Expenses	
 
Share issue expenses are adjusted against the Securities 
Premium Account in terms of Section 52(2) of the Companies 
Act, 2013.

Note -The Bank has assessed its obligations arising in the normal course of business, including pending litigations, proceedings pending 
with tax authorities and other contracts including derivative and long term contracts. In accordance with the provisions of AS 29 on 
‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’, the Bank recognises a provision for material foreseeable losses when it has a 
present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in 
respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. In cases where the available information indicates that the loss on the contingency is 
reasonably possible or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, a disclosure to this effect is made as contingent liabilities in 
the financial statements. The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a materially adverse effect on its financial 
results. 
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the movement in provision for legal and fraud cases, operational 
risk and other contingencies.

B)	
Information relating to the design and structure of remuneration processes and the key features and objectives of 
remuneration policy	
	
	
Objectives of the Remuneration Policy	
 
 
The Compensation Policy reflects the Bank’s objectives for good corporate governance as well as sustained and long-term 
value creation for stakeholders. The aims of the Bank’s remuneration framework are to: 
 
 
i) 
Attract, motivate and retain people with requisite skill, experience and ability to deliver the Bank’s strategy; 
 
 
ii) 
Create an alignment and balance between the rewards and risk exposure of shareholders and interests of employees;
 
 
iii) 
Link rewards to creation of long term sustainable shareholder value consistent with strategic goals and appropriate risk 
management; and
 
 
iv) 
Encourage behaviour consistent with the Bank’s values and principles. 
 
 
v) 
Support appropriate conduct and meritocratic culture through differentiated performance rewards 
 
 
To achieve the above objectives, the philosophy adopted by the Bank is as follows: 
 
 
i) 
Market referenced: offer employees competitive salary, achieved through benchmarking with peer groups. 
 
 
ii) 
Making fixed salary the main remuneration component. 
 
 
iii) 
Ensure that jobs of similar internal value are grouped and pegged within a range guided by market benchmarked jobs.
 
 
iv) 
Risk Adjusted: By integrating non-financial considerations relating to conduct in performance assessments, employing 
proper mix of compensation elements and aligning compensation incentives to risk outcomes and factoring the time 
horizon of risks 
 
 
v) 
Focus on ‘Total rewards’, all aspects of compensation, rewards and well defined benefits, including rewarding work 
environment and personal development. 
 
 
vi) 
The focus will be to ensure that the Bank is competitive in its overall salary offer to its employees without being excessively 
expensive for the Bank. 
 
 
The compensation structure for the MD & CEO also mirrors the Bank’s philosophy of aligning with the principles of sound 
compensation practices to ensure: 
 
 
i) 
Effective and independent governance of compensation. 
 
 
ii) 
Effective alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking. 
 
 
iii) 
Effective supervisory oversight and engagement by stakeholders. 
	
	
Design & Structure of Remuneration process	
 
 
The total compensation is a prudent mix of fixed remuneration and performance-based variable remuneration 
 
 
The key remuneration elements are: 
 
 
1) 
Fixed Pay
 
 
2) 
Discretionary Performance-based Variable Remuneration 
 
 
The Bank ensures that the fixed pay element is reasonable, taking into account the market rates and trends. The fixed pay is 
reviewed annually using market intelligence provided by a leading global performance/reward consulting and benchmarking 
firm for financial services industry to ensure that the Bank remains competitive in marketplace and that the Bank is able to 
attract and retain best talent. The level of fixed pay shall be sufficient enough in order to discourage inappropriate risk-taking.
 
 
Performance-based variable remuneration may comprise cash bonus, stock linked instruments, and is awarded by 
ensuring: 
Schedules  
forming part of the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2024
230
Bandhan Bank Limited
 
 
i) 
an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-based components; 
 
 
ii) 
that the fixed component represents a higher proportion of the total remuneration; 
 
 
iii) 
that the performance-based component reflects the risk underlying the achieved result; 
 
 
iv) 
that a substantial part of the performance-based component may be deferred; 
 
 
v) 
that no hedging of deferred shares takes place; 
 
 
Presently, the bank utilises only two form of performance based variable remuneration, viz.,cash bonus, ESOP, as referred in 
note no 18.29 is linked to continuous service with the Bank. 
 
 
The compensation policy of the Bank is reviewed by the NRC and approved by the Board of Directors. The NRC oversees the 
implementation of the policy and reviews the fixed pay increases, the organizational performance threshold for bonus to be 
paid, cash bonus and deferred variable remuneration. 
	
C)	
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration process	
 
 
The MD & CEO, employees in the grades of SVPs and above and employees engaged in the functions of Risk Control and 
Compliance are included in the policy of risk alignment of compensation. 
 
 
The alignment of compensation to prudent risk taking is ensured through the following: 
 
 
i) 
Structure of remuneration is such that a significant part of performance based variable remuneration is deferred. 
 
 
ii) 
Performance hurdles includes financial and non-financial parameters, ensuring compensation is aligned to both. 
 
 
iii) 
Fixed Salary is reasonable and sufficient, thereby discouraging inappropriate risk taking. 
 
 
iv) 
Annual Bonus Plan is managed with an independent governance framework. 
 
 
v) 
Variable remuneration awards are conditional, discretionary and contingent upon a sustainable and risk-adjusted 
performance. They are therefore capable of forfeiture or reduction at the Bank’s discretion. 
 
 
vi) 
For employees included in the policy of risk alignment of compensation, NRC has the discretion to apply malus and 
clawback – ex-post risk adjustment, allowing the Bank to adjust previously awarded remuneration to take account of 
subsequent performance and potential risk outcomes and thus enabling to recoup variable pay in the event of a negative 
contribution. 
	
	
Deferral of Variable Pay
 
 
To ensure that risk measures are not focused only on the achievement of short term goals, variable payout is deferred, if it 
exceeds 50% of the fixed pay. 
 
 
The Bank’s compensation policy aims to ensure that both ex-ante estimates and ex-post outcomes of risk affect payoffs; so that 
one or the other, can better address the various situations or risks. 
	
D)	
Description of ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance, during a performance measurement period with levels 
of remuneration.	
 
 
The Bank has a performance measurement framework in place to assess the achievements of the organization as a whole, its 
business lines and organizational units as well as individual employees. In order to maximise the incentive to deliver adequate 
performance and to take into account any risks of the business activities, the Bank seeks to closely link remuneration outcomes 
with performance and risk outcomes. Accordingly, the Bank’s performance management and compensation philosophy is 
designed in a manner to help achieve the Bank's business objectives. 
 
 
The performance management system in the Bank is aligned to the balanced scorecard approach. The goal setting process helps 
individuals to have clarity on their roles and align their profiles in line with the broad organization strategy. Both quantitative 
/ financial and qualitative / non-financial performance measures are considered. The qualitative or non-financial measures 
include customer service, adherence to risk and compliance standards, behaviour and values such as accountability, team 
work, etc., which builds a culture conducive to sustainable business performance. 
 
 
The performance appraisal process starts with the employee conducting self-appraisal followed by the assessment of the 
supervisor via appraisal feedback and discussion. 
 
 
Individual fixed pay increases and variable remuneration are based on the final performance ratings. In addition, the fixed 
pay increase is also influenced by an employee's position in the salary range and relevant market salaries. Performance 
related variable compensation is linked to corporate performance, business performance and individual performance. The 
performance ratings based bonus distribution matrix is reviewed by the NRC.

Statement
 
 
Employees engaged in all control functions including Compliance and Risk do not carry business profit targets in their goal 
sheets and hence are compensated based on their achievement of key result areas as per the balance score card. The aim is 
to ensure that the remuneration system and outcomes relating to such control functions maintain the independence of the 
function and Bank’s robust risk management framework. Accordingly, for the control functions, the variable pay is conservative 
to promote prudent risk management behaviour and the ‘pay mix’ is skewed towards fixed pay. 
 
 
In the case of performance evaluation of the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, factors such as financial 
performance measures, cost management initiatives, other strategic initiatives, prudential risk and compliance management, 
recognition and awards to the Bank, etc., is taken into account, which may vary from year to year depending on the Bank’s 
strategic priorities. Based on the inputs from NRC, the Board reviews the performance and recommends the rate of bonus to 
be paid, and the increments for the MD & CEO, for regulatory approval in terms of Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 (B.R. Act, 1949). 
	
E)	
Bank’s policy on deferral and vesting of variable remuneration and bank’s policy and criteria for adjusting deferred 
remuneration before vesting and after vesting.	
 
 
In terms of RBI guidelines, the Compensation Policy specifically addresses the following categories of employees: 
 
 
Category I : Managing Director &Chief Executive Officer / Whole Time Directors / Material Risk Takers 
 
 
Category II : Risk Control and Compliance Staff 
 
 
Category III: Other Categories of Staff (employees receiving share-linked variable pay) 
 
 
The following principles are applied for grant and deferral of performance-based variable remuneration for the above categories

relevant line of business and in material cases of detrimental conduct of individual or business. 
 
 
Negative contribution of the Bank and / or relevant line of business is defined as: 
	
	
Conduct related:

On July 26, 2017 the board of directors approved the Bandhan Bank Employee Stock Option Plan Series 1 for issue of stock options 
to eligible employees and directors of the Bank. 
 
The Shareholders of the Bank at the meeting held on November 23, 2017 has approved the Employee Stock Option Plan Series 1 
and the grant of Employee Stock Option to the employees of the Bank. The said approval accords the Board of Directors of the Bank 
or any Committee including the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which the Board has constituted, to create, offer, and 
grant at any time to permanent employees of the Bank, including any Director of the Bank, whether whole-time or otherwise but 
excluding Promoter(s), Independent Directors and Directors holding directly or indirectly more than 10% of the outstanding equity 
shares, employee stock options from time to time in one or more tranches. 
 
This plan was framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 
1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the stock options has been in 
accordance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 to the extent applicable. 
 
Employee Stock Option Plan Series 1 provides for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are granted. 
The closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading volume as of the working day 
preceding the date of grant set forth by the NRC at the time of grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot 
exceed five years from date of expiry of vesting period. However, if the participant’s employment terminates due to retirement 
(including pursuant to any early/ voluntary retirement scheme), the whole of the unvested options shall vest on the first vesting date 
relating to the said grant, immediately following the date of superannuation. During the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 
2023, no modifications were made to the terms and conditions of ESOPs as approved by the NRC.

Fair value methodology	
 
The weighted average fair value of stock option granted during the year was ` 126.91 . The fair value of options used to compute the 
proforma net profit and earnings per equity share have been estimated on the dates of each grant using the binomial option-pricing 
model. The Bank estimates the volatility based on the historical prices of its equity shares. The various assumptions considered in 
the pricing model for the ESOPs granted during the year ended March 31, 2024 are: 
Particulars
As at March 31, 2024
Dividend yield (%)
0-0.42%
Expected volatility (%)

Risk-free interest rate (%)
6.75%, 6.78%, 6.82%, 6.85%
Expected remaining life of the options (yrs)
0.47- 8.95 yrs
 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual 
outcome.
