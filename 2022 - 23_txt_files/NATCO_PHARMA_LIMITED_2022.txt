(i)	
Hazardous wastes are disposed to authorised disposal facilities:
•	 Organic Liquid and solid wastes spent carbon sent to authorised cement industries for co-processing.
•	 Dried ETP sludge and organic semi-solid residues are sent to authorised pre-processing facilities pre-processing 
followed by coprocessing in cement kilns.
•	 Inorganic solid wastes are sent to TSDF for secured landfilling.
•	 Waste oil/used oil sent to authorised re-processors.
•	 E-waste is sent to authorised recycling facilities.
•	 Used batteries are sent back to manufacturers on buy buy-back basis.
