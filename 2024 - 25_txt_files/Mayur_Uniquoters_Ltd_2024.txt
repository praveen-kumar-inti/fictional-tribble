The establishment of an Oxygen
Zone in Mayur offers a promising
opportunity. This initiative not only
contributes 
to 
environmental
sustainability but also brings about
long-term benefits for the ecosystem.
By undertaking this project, the
company can effectively enhance its
brand image, while fostering a deeper
sense of community engagement
and connection.
1. We 
have 
extraordinary
accomplishment In the Nidhi Van Phase
II of Gram Panchayat Dhoblai, 10386
fruit and shade trees were planted in
the Hariyalo Rajasthan - Ek Ped Maa
Ke Naam Intensive Tree Plantation
Block Level Program under the Chief
Minister’s Vriksharopan Maha Abhiyan
on 30 hectares pastureland. Through
this program, along with the income of
the Gram Panchayat, work of
environmental protection is also being
done.With the creation of such a forest,
thousands of birds, and small animals
along with passersby will get shelter
and protection. It is an excellent way
to make nature good and beautiful and
to return to it. These sites, conveniently
positioned within a radius of 1 km and
3 km near our Dhodsar factory, evoke
a sense of joy and fulfillment.
2. During this reporting period, a total of
10386 plants were established, and
we have successfully planted 33386
trees on 30 hectares of land so far.
Air quality poses various risks for
companies, including potential health
hazards for employees, decreased
productivity, increased absenteeism,
higher healthcare costs, and poten-
tial damage to the company’s reputa-
tion. Poor air quality can lead to res-
piratory issues, allergies, and other
health problems, which can result in
reduced employee performance and
efficiency. Moreover, high levels of
air pollution can lead to increased sick
leaves and healthcare expenses for
both employees and the Company.
Air Quality  Bag Filter was installed in
Thermopack unit as a technological
intervention to improve air quality. The site
plan highlights ten emission points, and
specific points of critical emissions have
been identified for monitoring purposes.
We have further improved the water quality
by inducing technological advancement
in our ETP process by installing oil
skimmer & tank for separating the oil &

India’s Poshan Abhiyaan, which aims
to eliminate malnutrition—including
Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and
Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)—
among children, pregnant women,
lactating mothers, and adolescent girls,

Sustainable
Products
Sustainable products can help
companies to meet the growing
demand for eco-friendly products,
differentiate 
themselves 
from
competitors, save money, improve
their public image, and comply with
regulations. A survey was conducted
by the Company from which we came
to know that approximately 73% of
consumers are willing to pay more for
sustainable products.
It also reduces the GHG Emissions of
the company.
1. Recycled Yarn and Bio PVC
Combinations
We have achieved notable progress
in developing materials that combine
Recycled Yarn with Bio-based PVC.
One of our key products, utilizing
Recycled Yarn and Regular PVC, has
successfully passed initial quality and
feasibility assessments. Building on
this success, we developed a product
incorporating Recycled Yarn and Bio
PVC. Although initial feedback
highlighted the need for an additional
bio filler component, our response was
swift and effective. We created a new
variant that includes Recycled Yarn,
Bio PVC, and Bio Filler. Preliminary
customer testing has yielded positive
results, and we are now preparing for
further emission testing and seat
development evaluations.

fabrics to recycled fabrics in our Bio
PVC products. For instance, our
product combining Bio PVC with
Regular Fabric has been upgraded to
use recycled fabric. This change
reflects our ongoing efforts to reduce
environmental impact by minimizing
the use of virgin materials. Several
innovative combinations of Bio PVC
with Recycled material Fabric and Bio
PVC with Bio Filler and Recycled
material Fabric have been developed
and tested. Test packages for these
advanced materials have been
dispatched, with feedback eagerly
anticipated. These developments
underscore 
our 
dedication 
to
incorporating recycled and bio-based
components into our products, aligning
with our sustainability goals.
3. Life 
Cycle 
Assessment 
and
Environmental 
Product
Declarations
As part of our commitment to
transparency and environmental
stewardship, we have conducted Life
Cycle Assessments (LCA) and
Environmental Product Declarations
(EPDs) for several of our products.
For example, the LCA project for
Regular PVC combined with Regular
Fabric has been completed, providing
valuable insights into the environmental
impact of our materials. Similarly, we
have completed an LCA project for
Bio PVC combined with Recycled
Fabric, further demonstrating our
commitment to evaluating and
improving the sustainability of our
products. Product data for combinations
of Regular Polyurethane (PUR) and
Regular Fabric have also been
submitted for LCA and EPD studies.
These initiatives highlight our proactive
approach to understanding and
mitigating the environmental footprint
of our products, ensuring that we
remain at the cutting edge of
sustainable manufacturing.

A. Collaborations with Mercedes
Our collaboration with Mercedes has
yielded significant progress in
sustainable product development.
While Mercedes initially approved a
product combining Recycled PES and
Regular 
PVC, 
subsequent
developments incorporating Recycled
PES and Bio PVC were met with
requests for Bio filler added material.
However, ongoing efforts have
resulted in the development of a product
combining Recycled PES, Bio PVC,
and Bio Filler, with positive preliminary
testing feedback. Mercedes’ completion
of LCA projects for products featuring
Regular PVC + Regular Fabric and
Bio PVC + Recycled Fabric further
underscores their commitment to
environmental 
stewardship 
and
innovative solutions
B. Collaborations with BMW
We have played a crucial role in
expanding our portfolio of sustainable
products. Notably, BMW’s standard
and light quality products have

commitment to incorporating eco-
friendly 
materials 
into
