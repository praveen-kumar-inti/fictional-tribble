Some of the specific areas that were identified by the Entity are:
1.    Digital Work Instruction Implementation: Manual work instructions were 
replaced with digital on-screen instructions, removing the risk of damage 
or loss associated with paper documents. This change enhanced clarity 
and operational control, contributing to the ongoing automation of the 
assembly line.
2.   Digital Graph Monitoring for Load & Stroke: A digital graph monitoring 
system was added to capture detailed data on load and stroke parameters. 
This improvement aimed at better product and process control through 
real-time data visualization. The system was developed via outsourced 
programing.
3.   Trend Monitoring of Process Parameters: A process improvement initiative 
focused on implementing trend monitoring and recording of product and 
process parameters. This allowed easier and more effective monitoring of 
process capability. The software was developed through an outsourced 
partner.
4.   Combi Tank Concept – (Fuel Tank + Urea Tank): The initiative introduced a 
combined plastic fuel and urea tank to optimize vehicle packaging, reduce 
components and weight, and enhance assembly efficiency. It addressed 
space constraints, cut costs, and simplified processes, demonstrating the 
value of integrated design in automotive systems.
5.   Degassing/Expansion Tank & CAC/Intercooler Duct: The initiative improved 
control over thread formation and cap retention, enhanced leak resistance 
and durability, and replaced metal with plastic to reduce cost, failure 
modes, and process steps—earning positive customer feedback for its 
unique, efficient design.

The Entity’s products are supplied directly to Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs), which limits its ability to retrieve them at the end of 
their life cycle. Nonetheless, the Entity actively engages in the Extended 
Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework for the plastics used across its 
products, packaging, and distribution processes. Recognizing that plastics 
may follow diverse disposal pathways, direct reclamation poses significant 
challenges. Through its participation in the EPR system, the Entity ensures 
that such materials are appropriately recycled, reused, or recovered at the 
end-of-life stage, thereby supporting responsible waste management and 
environmental sustainability.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report
a. 	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the 
entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
	
The Entity has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety Management System as an 
integral part of its operations, aimed at fostering a safe, healthy, and environmentally responsible 
workplace. It is certified under ISO 45001:2018 currently covering 85.19% of its plants.
	
Measures include PTW systems, monthly safety performance reviews, SAFE audits, accident 
investigations, regular medical check-ups, risk assessments, and monitoring of waste and carbon 
footprint. Specialized procedures are in place for equipment testing, contractor safety, fire equipment 
maintenance, and induction programs for new joiners.
	
Emergency response plans cover fire, explosions, accidents, hazardous spills, pollution control 
failures, food poisoning, and natural calamities. Regular training and drills are conducted to enhance 
preparedness. The Entity is committed to continuous improvement, legal compliance, waste reduction, 
and innovation to prevent pollution, injuries, and illnesses.
b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
	
The Entity employs a comprehensive approach to identifying work-related hazards and assessing risks for both routine and 
non-routine activities, in line with established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
	
1.	
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): HIRA is conducted and regularly reviewed to systematically 
evaluate the work environment and operational tasks. It identifies potential hazards that may affect employees, visitors, 
or the surrounding ecosystem. Each identified risk is assessed based on its likelihood and potential impact, and 
appropriate control measures are implemented to mitigate these risks.
	
2.	
Health and Safety Inspections: Regular inspections and audits are carried out to review the Entity’s environmental, 
health, and safety (EHS) policies and practices. These audits help identify areas for improvement, ensure compliance 
with regulatory standards, and inform the development of corrective action plans.
	
For routine activities, the Entity utilizes a comprehensive 188-point Safety Audit Checklist covering various operational 
aspects. For non-routine activities, such as work at heights or excavation, a Permit-to-Work (PTW) system and additional 
hazard identification methods are employed to ensure safe execution.
	
Additionally, employees actively participate in hazard identification by reporting risks during meetings and submitting 
suggestions. This participatory approach strengthens the overall effectiveness of the Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)
	
Yes, the Entity has established procedures that enable workers to report work-related hazards and exercise the right to 
safely withdraw from situations where they perceive a risk to their health or safety.
d.	
Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Entity provides employees and workers with access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

stakeholders 
and 
the 
Board 
on

provided to the Board.
	
Stakeholder consultations within the Entity are 
managed by designated personnel, business leaders, 
and key process heads. Feedback and concerns 
raised by stakeholders are systematically escalated 
to the Board of Directors through appropriate Board 
Committees, such as the Audit Committee, Nomination 
and 
Remuneration 
Committee, 
CSR

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
As part of its Life Skills Project, the Entity is committed to 
fostering foundational learning through the promotion 
of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and 
Mathematics) education among primary school students. 
This initiative provides young learners with experiential, 
hands-on exposure to key academic disciplines, aiming 
to strengthen their conceptual understanding and 
cultivate a spirit of curiosity-driven learning.
	
In addition, recognizing the growing health challenge 
posed by Type 1 diabetes among children in India—
where an estimated 95,600 children under the age of 
14 are affected and approximately 15,900 new cases 
are reported annually—the Entity has extended support 
to address this critical issue. Given the high cost of 
treatment and the lack of awareness, especially in 
underprivileged communities, the Entity provides access 
to essential treatment, care, and awareness programs 
for children living with juvenile diabetes. This initiative 
seeks to improve health outcomes and enhance the 
long-term quality of life for affected children.
	
To effectively address the concerns of vulnerable and 
marginalized stakeholder groups, the Entity initiates 
its CSR interventions by identifying target areas and 
conducting detailed assessments—through surveys, site 
visits, and evaluations—to determine the relevance and 
aspirations of the communities in relation to potential 
projects. A comprehensive Needs Assessment is then 
conducted to identify specific beneficiary groups that 
would derive the greatest impact from CSR programs.
	
Subsequently, the Entity collaborates closely with the 
local community to co-create and finalize CSR initiatives, 
ensuring they are aligned with the actual needs and 
aspirations identified. Tailored on-ground mobilization 
strategies are employed to engage stakeholders 
meaningfully and ensure active participation. This 
inclusive and participatory approach ensures that the 
Entity’s CSR efforts are impactful, sustainable, and 
effectively empower the most vulnerable sections of 
society.
