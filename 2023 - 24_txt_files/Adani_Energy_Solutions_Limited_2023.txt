any other grievances through the online grievance portal. The system is designed to redress the grievance within 
a defined timeline of 14 working days. The grievances are resolved in a fair and time bound manner maintaining

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Effective waste management practices are crucial for Indian companies.
	
We understand that it is important to segregate different waste streams for more efficient treatment and reuse. 
With our consistent efforts in reduction of waste generation, all our Grid division operations including the 
head office @ Ahmedabad have been certified as Zero Waste to Landfill sites by M/s. Intertek India Pvt. Ltd. & 
M/s. Bureau Veritas India has certified our Retail division operations in Mumbai & Dahanu since 2022. The company 
is also a certified Single Use Plastic (SUP) free company by M/s. Confederation of Indian Industries [CII].
	
Furthermore, minimizing freshwater withdrawal by maximizing the recycling and reuse of plant service 
wastewater and ash pond overflow is another sustainable practice. This not only reduces the plant's freshwater 
footprint but also lessens the impact on local water bodies.
	
We have adopted & implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system, we segregate waste streams, employed 
advanced treatment technologies, and maximizing water recycling are essential waste management practices 
for sustainable operations and environmental stewardship.
	
To reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals/substance in our processes for we have adopted a 
comprehensive strategy that encompasses the following key elements:
	
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA): Implementing a systematic approach to identify and analyze 
the physical, chemical, biological, and environmental hazards in the plant, analyzing potential & actual risks, 
classifying risks, and recommending corrective actions to minimize or eliminate hazards.
	
Regular Inspections and Preventive Measures: Conducting regular inspections and employing preventive 
measures such as water sprays, isolation from ignition sources, proper ventilation, and spark-proof electrical 
equipment. Ensuring the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as dust masks and safety 
guards on moving parts.
	
Training and Supervision: Providing thorough training and proper supervision to the workforce to handle 
hazardous chemicals/substances safely. This includes the use of safety belts, safety nets, helmets, protective 
suits where necessary.
	
Optimization of Water Consumption: Adopting waste management practices that aim for Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD), which involves treating and recycling wastewater for reuse in various process applications. This approach 
helps in preventing the discharge of effluents from power plants and thereby reducing the reliance on fresh water.
	
By integrating these strategies into our operations, Compliance with local regulations and standards is also 
ensured in the implementation of the above strategies that has helped us significantly reduced the use of 
hazardous and toxic chemicals/substances and manage waste more effectively, contributing to a safer and more 
sustainable environment.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas reported at Question 11 of Essential Indicators above, provide 
details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such areas along-with prevention 
and remediation activities.
	y
The Dahanu region, known for its ecological sensitivity, has following:
	
Potential Direct impacts include:
	y
Air pollution from emissions, notably sulfur dioxide, which can affect respiratory health in local wildlife 
and contribute to acid rain, further affecting soil and water quality.
	y
Thermal pollution leading to changes in local climate and water temperatures, potentially disrupting 
local ecosystems.
	y
Noise pollution, which can interfere with the natural behavior of wildlife.
	
Indirect impacts involve:
	y
Potential contamination of local water sources due to runoff and leaching of pollutants, affecting both 
terrestrial and aquatic life.
	y
Changes in local agriculture, as emissions from the power plant can affect crop yields and soil health, 
indirectly impacting food sources for local wildlife.
	y
Socioeconomic changes that may lead to overfishing or overharvesting of local resources as community 
dynamics shift.
	
No negative effects on the local biodiversity have been noted because of our plant's operations as certified 
by CII & IUCN team post Three season BIO-Diversity study conducted in 2022-2023. Indeed, the report of the 
biodiversity assessment study reveals the following:
	y
The Biodiversity Index Score of Adani DTPS, Dahanu is 66/100
	y
During the site assessment six important ecosystems/ habitats were enlisted and these are Greenbelt, scrub 
forest, grasslands, river & streams, mangroves and coastal area.
	y
225 floral and 144 faunal species were recorded.
	y
Total floral diversity of ADTPS after second assessment is 225 which includes 92 tree species, 28 shrub 
species, 57 herb species, 22 grass species and 26 climber species.
	y
Four nos. of mangrove species documented.
	y
A total of 90 species of birds belonging to 42 families have been documented from the Plant premises 
and study area.
	y
The mammalian diversity of Plant premises and study area was represented by 8 species. The Indian Fruit 
bat was the most common mammalian species recorded.
	y
Pugmark of Small Indian Civet (Viverricula indica) found.
	y

	y
7 Species of reptiles were recorded in the Plant premises and study area. It included 4 snake species, 2 
lizards & a gecko species.
	y
29 species of butterflies were recorded during the study.
	y
The most commonly recorded butterfly species are Common Grass Yellow (Eurema hecabe) and Common 
Emigrant (Catopsilia pomona).
	y
In ADTPS along with the floral and faunal diversity there is another kind of diversity reported which is the 
different types of floral habitat inside the ADTPS campus and this kind of diversity serves the healthy and 
rich biodiversity inside the campus.

(a) 	 Do you have a preferential procurement policy where you give preference to purchase from suppliers 
comprising marginalized /vulnerable groups? (Yes/No)
	
In line with AESL’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion policy & Supply chain Procurement policy, we provide equal 
opportunities for all, regardless of their background.
	
AESL is a Power sector company, and the sector is heavily regulated. A company like us needs to adhere to 
strict safety and quality standards. Therefore, have restricted ability to diversify our procurement practices.
	
The company primarily deals with procurement of raw materials (like coal, LDO etc.), machinery, and 
technology that are specific to power generation, Transmission, and distribution. These are usually 
procured from specialized suppliers, which generally are not necessarily owned or operated by marginalized 
or vulnerable groups. However, the company sources all good and services following non-discrimination 
approach and follows fair & Equal opportunity to all its suppliers / vendors partners.
	
The company often procures goods/services locally due to logistical reasons. If there's a lack of suppliers 
from marginalized/vulnerable groups in these areas, it might not be feasible for the company to procure from 
such groups.
 	
	
The company supports marginalized/vulnerable groups through hiring practices, community outreach 
programs, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The company promotes inclusivity and social 
responsibility in several ways through:
1.	
Diverse Hiring Practices: AESL ensures that the hiring practices are inclusive, providing equal opportunities 
for all, regardless of their background.
	
2.	
Supplier Diversity: While the nature of the power sector might limit the ability to procure from 
marginalized/vulnerable groups, AESL still strives for diversity in their procurement practices where 
possible.
	
	
3.	
Community Development: AESL operates near local communities at some sites. Hence, AESL contributes 
to the development of these communities through various initiatives, such as awareness, infrastructure 
development, education programs, sustainable livelihood, and healthcare facilities.
