Internal control systems and their adequacy
Your Company has a robust internal control mechanism 
in place commensurate with the size and nature of its 
business. The internal control systems comprising policies 
and procedures are designed to ensure that operations are 
efficiently managed and aligned with the strategic objectives 
of your Company and address various aspects of governance, 
compliance, audit, control and reporting. The internal 
controls are responsible for complying with the regulatory 
requirements, preventing fraud and errors, safeguarding your 
Company’s assets and finances, and preserving the accuracy 
and reliability of financial transactions and reporting. Your 
Company maintains an adequate internal control system, 
which provides, among other things, reasonable assurance 
of recording the transactions of its operations in all material 
aspects and of providing protection against significant 
misuse or loss of Company’s assets. Your Company’s 
internal audit committee periodically reviews the adequacy 
of the internal control systems. Key observations and 
recommendations are communicated to the management, 
who takes appropriate corrective measures as deemed 
fit to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
internal controls.
Cautionary statement
The Management Discussion and Analysis may contain some 
statements describing your Company’s objectives, plans, 
projections, outlook, estimates, expectations and others 
which may constitute ‘forward-looking statements’ within 
the meaning of applicable securities laws and regulations 
and are based on informed judgments and estimates. 
Actual results may differ materially from those expressed 
or implied due to external and internal factors beyond your 
Company’s control. Your Company does not undertake any 
obligation to publicly amend, modify or revise these forward-
looking statements based on subsequent developments, 
information or events.

Reporting boundary - Are the disclosures under 
this report made on a standalone basis (i.e. only for 
the entity) or on a consolidated basis (i.e. for the 
entity and all the entities which form a part of its 
consolidated financial statements, taken together).
The report is prepared on a consolidated basis. The

comparative year due to change in approach, methodology, 
re-computation of certain attributes and enhancement of 
boundary to align with consolidated reporting boundary.

Repair, Refurbish And Repurpose: Electronic items and wooden furniture are repaired or refurbished instead 
of discarded, and paper materials are reused when feasible (e.g., reusing envelopes).
	
7. 	
Recycling: Waste materials, including IT equipment, electrical items, and bulbs, are disposed of through local 
recycling vendors.
	
8.	
Spill Response Plans: Spill response plans are in place for stored diesel for DG sets, outlining procedures for 
containing and cleaning up spills to prevent environmental contamination. 
	
9. 	
Reduction of Single-Use Plastics: Single-use plastic items are minimized, and reusable alternatives such as 
glass bottles and stainless-steel utensils are utilized to decrease plastic waste generation.
	
10. 	 Refillable Soap Dispensers: Refillable soap single-use plastic bottles, reducing plastic packaging waste.
	
11. 	 Sanitary Waste Management: Separate bins are provided in bathrooms, clearly labelled to guide users.

In our opinion, the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information in “Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report” section of the Annual Report for the period 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, is 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and basis of 
preparation set out in Section A: General Disclosures 13 of “Business Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report” of Annual Report. 
 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our 
report. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). 
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
 
Other information 
Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core 
and assurance report thereon). The Company’s Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after 
the date of this assurance report. 
Our reasonable assurance on the BRSR Core does not cover the other information and we are not expressing 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our assurance on the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether other 
information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core, or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to Those Charged With Governance and describe actions under the applicable 
laws and regulations.

Inherent limitations  
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy 
footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty 
in the amounts and metrics.  
 
Our responsibilities 
We are responsible for: 
• 
Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability 
disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in 
accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above.  
• 
Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained, and 
• 
Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Tata Technologies Limited 
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion 
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.  
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information covered by reasonable assurance, 
whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through 
understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also 
obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by reasonable assurance in 
order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we: 
• 
assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable 
assurance;  
• 
evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the 
preparation of the information covered by reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates 
made by the Company; and  
• 
evaluated the overall presentation of the information covered by reasonable assurance.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
