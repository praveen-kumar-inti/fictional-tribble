15.	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / concerns arising from 
assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
NALCO has implemented numerous corrective safety measures across its operations to ensure the well-being of employees and prevent accidents. Safety 
initiatives such as mock drills, CCTV installations, ANPR camera installations and the NALCO Suraksha App for reporting unsafe conditions have been 
implemented. The company is actively involved in equipment replacement, implementing Industry 4.0, and conducting surveys for height work and road 
safety. These measures include creating new safe movement platforms and using fog cannons for dust suppression. Mobile vacuum cleaners and reverse 
back-up alarms have been implemented for equipment safety. Fire prevention measures include fire retardant polymer coatings and lightning arrestors. 
Various equipment-specific safety measures have been undertaken, such as alternative solutions for fire prevention. The company is also investing in 
safety equipment, including fall protection systems, boom lifts, eye wash showers, and fire trauma blankets.

3.	 Details of remuneration/salary/wages, in the following format: (in R)
*Non-permanent workers are not paid wages directly by the entity. However, it is ensured that contractors pay more than specified minimum wages without 
any discrimination.
4.	 Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? 
(Yes/No)
	
Yes
5.	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues. 
	
The grievance procedure for executives and non-executives can be found in the intranet of the HR manual under the CDA rules caption. Additionally, there 
is a policy in place across all units, including the corporate office, regarding the prevention, prohibition, and redressal of sexual harassment of women at 
the workplace, in compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013. Internal Complaints 
Committees have been established at the production units and corporate office to address complaints related to sexual harassment.
	
However, for non-permanent workers, specifically contractors' workers, there is no specifically defined grievance handling procedure. In such cases, 
grievances are typically received and addressed by the EIC (Contract Engineer-in-charge) or the Plant HRD (Human Resources Department) by intervening 
with the immediate employer, which is the contractor.

the identification, categorization, and responsibility assignment for their handling, collection, reception, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal.
	
•	
E-waste and battery waste are segregated and disposed of at authorized Collection Centers/Dismantlers/Recyclers. 
	
•	
Bio-medical waste generated at medical facilities in Angul and Damanjodi is treated at our own biomedical waste treatment plant facility in accordance 
with the authorization order issued by the State Pollution Control Board. 
	
•	
Details of other hazardous waste materials are specified, including their category, authorized quantity as per the Hazardous Waste Authorization 
granted by OSPCB (Odisha State Pollution Control Board), source of generation, method of storage, and method of disposal. 
	
•	
The carbon portion of Spent Potlining (SPL) is disposed of to authorized recyclers for detoxification of hazardous components and utilization of its 
energy value in an eco-friendly manner. Refractory and mixed fines of SPL are stored under a covered shed. Permission from OSPCB is awaited to 
dispose of them in CHWTSDF (Common Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility). 
	
•	
Aluminium Dross is cooled, crushed in an Autogenous mill of an additional bath handling system, where the metallic portion is recovered, and the 
remaining dross portion is mixed with bath and used in POTs for anode covering. Legacy stock of dross is disposed of to authorized recyclers. 
	
•	
Spent Anode Butts are 100% recycled for anode making. Carbon Area Hazardous waste, which includes floor sweeping waste, shot blasting waste, and 
rejected lining of furnaces, is disposed of at the common hazardous Waste Landfill (CHWTSDF). 
	
•	
Used oil generated during various processes and maintenance activities is kept in secured drums or barrels and stored under a covered shed, equipped 
with a facility for collecting spilled oil. Used oil is auctioned or sold to authorized reprocessors/recyclers approved by the Odisha State Pollution Control 
Board.
Non-Hazardous waste:
	
•	
Overburden generated at bauxite mines is 100% re-used in the reclamation of mined-out areas.
	
•	
Red mud and Lime Grit generated at the Alumina Refinery are disposed of in the red mud Pond.
	
•

slurry mode. Ash Pond-I is kept in an active stage and used for emergency disposal. Fly ash generated at the Alumina Refinery is used for filling low-
lying areas and brickmaking, among other purposes.
	
•	
CPP Coal mill rejects are stored in a dedicated reject handling yard for further disposal.
	
•	
Ferrous scrap is recycled, reused, or sold to outside agencies. Non-ferrous scrap with economic value is also recycled, reused, or sold to outside 
agencies.
	
•	
Used refractory bricks are used for hard surfacing and road construction inside the plant. Mixed debris is disposed of in low-lying areas.
	
•	
Food waste, such as canteen waste and horticulture waste, is converted to compost using a solid waste mechanical waste converter.
	
Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
The use of hazardous and toxic chemicals has been optimized through process control, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are implemented for their 
safe handling. Substitution of these chemicals is pursued whenever feasible.
	
During the process of anode making, several hazardous wastes are recycled back into the process. Aluminium dross, a byproduct, is processed to recover the 
metallic portion. The remaining portion of the dross is utilized in the bath material used in Potlines, contributing to the overall efficiency and sustainability 
of the anode making process.

The mined-out area is concurrently reclaimed and rehabilitated with overburden waste
The implementation of special additives in Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMMs) 
to reduce diesel consumption and enhance fuel efficiency demonstrates a commitment 
to sustainable practices and the optimization of machinery performance.
The treated wastewater from Mines canteen and vehicle wash area are 100% reused for 
dust suppression.
Biogas plants (3 no’s) have been installed to treat organic wastes from canteen
Red mud generated during the refining process is discharged into the Red Mud Pond. In 
the pond, the red mud settles, allowing the water to separate and decant. The decanted 
water is then pumped back to the refinery process area for reutilization.
The Ash slurry generated is discharged into the Ash Pond, where the ash particles settle 
down, and the decanted water is pumped back to the Ash Disposal Pump House in the 
Refinery plant for ash pulping. 
NALCO's Captive Power Plant (CPP) successfully implemented a project to dispose 
of ash using the lean slurry disposal method in abandoned mines to achieve 100% 
utilization of the ash generated and reuse the treated water. A Clariflocculator with a 
capacity of 3000 m3/hr has been installed to further reduce turbidity in the recycled 
water obtained from the Ash Pond and mine void. This treated water is used for reuse 
in various plant processes, including ash slurry preparation and other plant purposes.
Outcome of the initiative

Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be provided along-with summary)
At Mines, Rainwater harvesting ponds have been constructed for collection of rainwater 
and use for plantation, etc. with a total storage capacity of appx. 65880 cubic meters. An 
in-situ peripheral barrier has been constructed all around the mine pit which prevents 
any rainwater from going down below the valley. The entire runoff from the mining pit 
percolates into the ground thus recharging the ground water. At Alumina Refinery, four 
nos. of roof-top rainwater harvesting projects are operational.  
At the Captive Power Plant (CPP), a Rainwater Harvesting and Recycling system has 
been implemented. This system includes a pond with a capacity of 50,000 m3 and two 
pumps with a combined capacity of 500 m3. The harvested and recycled rainwater is 
utilized for replenishing the Fire hydrant Fore bay of RCPH-1 and for various plant 
purposes.
Further, roof-top rainwater harvesting systems have been installed at the CW pump 
house and RCPH. 
Treated water from the Ion-Exchange De-fluoridation plant is utilized for plantation 
and cooling of anodes in the Carbon area. Additionally, the treated water from the 
Emrion Nano De-fluoridation plant serves as makeup water for cooling purposes. 
Non-fluorinated surface run-off from various areas is collected in a Twin sump (Zero 
Discharge sump) is then recycled for horticulture use, vehicle washing, and civil 
construction, preventing any discharge of water. 
An important initiative has been undertaken to augment the capacity of the Emrion 
Nano De-Fluoridation Plant from 1.0 MLD (million liters per day) to 2.0 MLD. This 
initiative is the first of its kind in the world on such a large scale, featuring zero reject 
and negligible sludge generation.
