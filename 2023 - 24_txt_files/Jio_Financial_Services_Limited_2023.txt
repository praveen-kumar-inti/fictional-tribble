Financial 
Inclusion
Opportunity
JFSL 
recognises 
financial 
inclusion as a cornerstone for 
societal progress. By connecting 
underserved 
communities 
to 
essential financial services, JFSL 
empowers them to make informed 
choices and build a more secure 
future. This, in turn, contributes 
to alleviating income inequality 
and poverty by fostering broader 
financial access and participation.
Furthermore, JFSL views prioritising 
financial inclusion not just as an 
opportunity, but as a fundamental 
responsibility. By empowering all 
citizens through financial literacy 
and accessible products, JFSL 
contributes in fueling economic 
growth 
and 
thereby 
thriving 
communities. 
This 
commitment 
positions JFSL at the forefront of 
driving positive change and building 
a more inclusive and equitable 
society.

Digitalisation
Opportunity
JFSL is unwaveringly dedicated 
to harnessing technology and in-
tegrated data systems as pivotal 
tools to realise strategic objec-
tives. JFSL’s commitment extends 
to broadening the customer base 
through the effective utilisation of 
technology, thereby reaching new 
audiences and promoting financial 
inclusion, ultimately fostering sus-
tainable growth. 
In pursuit of operational excel-
lence and a culture of innovation, 
JFSL employs digital solutions to 
enhance efficiency, streamline pro-
cesses, curtail costs, and expedite

benefits for all stakeholders. Elevat-
ing the customer experience is at

Data Privacy 
and Security
Risk
JFSL understands the dynamic cy-
bersecurity landscape and priori-
tises robust defences to safeguard 
data and mitigate cyberattacks. 
These threats pose significant fi-
nancial, legal, and reputational 
risks, eroding stakeholders’ trust 
and potentially incurring substantial 
penalties for non-compliance with 
data protection regulations. As a re-
sponsible financial services provid-
er, JFSL is committed to upholding 
the highest security standards and 
building trust through comprehen-
sive cybersecurity measures.
JFSL prioritises data securi-
ty as a cornerstone of trust 
and compliance. Company 
implements industry-leading 
safeguards to protect sen-
sitive information, minimis-
ing legal and reputational 
risks associated with data 
breaches. JFSL’s unwavering 
commitment to data protec-
tion regulations and trans-
parency fosters an environ-
ment where its stakeholders 
can trust the Company with 
their financial information.
Negative
Opportunity
JFSL recognises the critical role of 
advanced security technologies in 
safeguarding data and maximising 
its inherent value. JFSL demon-
strate this commitment through 
strategic 
investments 
in 
cut-
ting-edge solutions, actively devel-
oping and adopting measures that 
fortify data protection. This includes 
robust security controls leveraging 
state-of-the-art encryption, threat 
detection, and access controls.
JFSL’s commitment extends be-
yond data security to encompass 
unwavering adherence to evolving 
regulations. By prioritising data gov-
ernance and maintaining a proac-
tive stance, the Company exceeds 
legal and regulatory requirements, 
fostering trust with stakeholders 
and mitigating compliance risks. 
This 
comprehensive 
approach 
ensures a secure and trustworthy 
environment for all, facilitating re-
sponsible data utilisation and un-
locking its full potential.

Governance 
and 
Transparency
Risk
JFSL 
understands 
that 
strong 
corporate governance is not only 
a regulatory requirement but also 
a critical foundation for sustainable 
success. Companies lacking robust 
governance 
structures 
face 
heightened vulnerability to fraud, 
mismanagement, 
and 
missed 
business 
opportunities. 
These 
factors can lead to financial losses, 
erode 
shareholder 
confidence, 
and ultimately hinder a company’s 
ability to thrive. Additionally, non-
adherence to ethical standards 
exposes financial institutions to 
legal ramifications and reputational 
damage, jeopardising the trust of 
stakeholders.
JFSL prioritises a robust 
governance framework with 
clearly defined roles, respon-
sibilities, and reporting lines 
for all stakeholders, includ-
ing board members, man-
agement, and employees. 
Dedicated committees spe-
cialising in audit, risk man-
agement, and ethics foster 
a culture of compliance and 
proactive 
risk 
mitigation. 
Regular assessments ensure 
continuous improvement and 
alignment with evolving reg-
ulations and industry best 
practices. 
Additionally, comprehensive 
training 
programs, 
clear 
communication, and consis-
tent policy enforcement cul-
tivate an environment where 
ethical behaviour is deeply 
ingrained. Robust internal 
controls further safeguard 
against potential fraud, mis-
management, and irregu-
larities. Proactive risk iden-
tification, assessment, and 
mitigation strategies guar-
antee the long-term success 
and sustainability of JFSL’s 
operations.
Negative
Opportunity
JFSL prioritises robust corporate 
governance and unwavering trans-
parency, recognising their critical 
contributions to building trust and 
achieving 
sustainable 
success. 
Adherence to rigorous governance 
practices fosters investor confi-
dence, ensuring access to capital 
and enhancing financial stability. 
JFSL further prioritises transpar-
ent communication and proactive 
stakeholder engagement, building 
trust and loyalty that strengthens 
brand reputation.
Moreover, the Company’s unwaver-
ing commitment to ethical leader-
ship and responsible decision-mak-
ing cultivates an environment that 
attracts and retains exceptional 
talent. This, in turn empowers to 
pursue long-term goals of the Com-
pany with a workforce aligned with 
JFSL’s values and dedicated to in-
tegrity and responsibility.

Climate 
Change
Risk
JFSL understands climate change 
poses significant risks to its as-
sets and operations through phys-
ical damage (extreme weather) and 
transition 
challenges 
(regulatory 
shifts, pricing changes, techno-
logical disruptions). These risks 
can lead to substantial losses. Vi-
olations can result in legal penal-
ties, including fines and exclusion, 
jeopardising market standing and 
relationships. Additionally, meet-
ing climate expectations is crucial 
to secure the trust and confidence 
of investors, regulators, and cus-
tomers who increasingly prioritise 
sustainability.
JFSL prioritises identifying 
assets vulnerable to ex-
treme weather (e.g., floods, 
droughts, wildfires) and in-
vests in infrastructure resil-
ience, relocation, and natural 
flood defences. Ensuring op-
erations continue after such 
events, 
staying 
informed 
about climate regulations, 
and adopting renewable en-
ergy and sustainable practic-
es are key. Tracking progress 
on emissions reduction and 
collaborating 
with 
policy-
makers, investors, and cus-
tomers for climate-friendly 
solutions is crucial. Proac-
tive communication of cli-
mate risks and mitigation 
strategies to stakeholders is 
a priority.
Negative
Opportunity
JFSL recognises the profound and 
enduring influence of sustainability 
on business and the world. To so-
lidify its leadership role, the Com-
pany plans to systematically em-
bed sustainability throughout its 
operations, encompassing product 
development, investment strate-
gies, resource management, and 
employee engagement. JFSL will 
significantly expand its portfolio 
of low-carbon financial products 
and services, catering to a broader 
range of eco-conscious individuals 
and businesses. As active leaders 
and participants in initiatives driving 
the low-carbon transition, JFSL will 
leverage its expertise in innovative 
financing and technology to make a 
tangible impact.
Additionally, JFSL will utilise its 
platform to advocate for impactful 
climate change policies and regula-
tions at all levels, collaborating with 
stakeholders to build a more sus-
tainable future. JFSL also remains 
committed to continuous learning 
and improvement, constantly reas-
sessing its strategies, and adopt-
ing best practices to maximise its 
positive environmental and social 
impact.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
JFSL envisions a future fuelled by 
diversity and inclusion, recognising 
its multifaceted benefits. JFSL 
believes attracting a wider talent 
pool through inclusive practices 
not only enriches the workforce but 
also fosters employee engagement, 
boosting efficiency and solidifying 
brand as an employer of choice. 
This translates to a customer-
centric approach, enabling JFSL 
to cater to diverse needs, increase 
satisfaction 
and 
loyalty, 
and 
ultimately drive revenue. 
Beyond 
talent 
acquisition, 
the 
Company’s commitment to inclu-
sion reflects a deep understanding 
of the markets they serve. This di-
verse representation allows JFSL to 
create products and services that 
resonate with a broader audience, 
delivering richer and more relevant 
experiences. Furthermore, a di-
verse and inclusive workforce fos-
ters innovation and creativity, the 
cornerstone of developing new of-
ferings and maximising profitability.
Moving forward, JFSL remains 
dedicated to harnessing the power 
of diversity and inclusion, building 
a future where it serves not just 
as a value, but as a catalyst for 
sustained organisational success 
and meaningful societal impact.

challenges, targets, and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Jio Financial Services Limited (JFSL) recognises the importance of responsible business practices and contributing 
to a sustainable future. JFSL views Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles as both essential for its 
long-term success and a core responsibility to its stakeholders. In FY24, JFSL has created robust framework towards 
its ESG journey. This included strengthening codes and policies, developing internal roadmaps and action plans, and 
conducting training for employees, Key Management Personnel’s (KMP’s), and the Board of Directors (BoD’s) on the 
topics covered under National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles.
Additionally, JFSL enhanced its understanding of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 & 2). The Company remains 
dedicated to a sustainable future by integrating environmental and social considerations into its procurement processes 
through a well-defined Supplier Code of Conduct. 
JFSL has developed ESG Policy that aligns with its core values. This Policy outlines a comprehensive approach to 
responsible business practices through its ESG commitments. This includes financial inclusion through accessible 
financial products and extending financial services to underserved communities and promoting financial literacy across 
India, environmental stewardship with sustainable practices, fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that promotes 
equal opportunities, open communication with stakeholders, proactive risk management, and integrating ESG factors 
into strategic decision-making for long-term sustainability. Additionally, JFSL emphasises the importance of integrity and 
transparency through well-defined policies and procedures. These areas will be prioritised to achieve the company’s 
goals and vision for a more responsible and inclusive future.
Governed by a dedicated board-level ESG Committee, JFSL takes pride in presenting its first Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR). This report marks the beginning of JFSL’s commitment to ongoing sustainability 
disclosures. Looking ahead, JFSL demonstrates its commitment to continually improving its ESG performance through 
transparency. To ensure transparency and responsible decision-making, JFSL prioritises good corporate governance.
