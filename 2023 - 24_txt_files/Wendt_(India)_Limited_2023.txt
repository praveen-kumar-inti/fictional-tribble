motivate and retain talent critical 
to business success. 
Technology is ever changing and 
plays a vital role in our operations 
from process automation and 
quality control to supply chain 
management and customer 
engagement. Failure to keep 
abreast with latest technological 
changes could pose a competitive 
disadvantage and impact 
Company's ability to meet 
customer demands. Further, in 
this digital world, threats like 
cyber attacks and data breaches 
could result in financial losses, 
reputational damages which 
could impact the brand 
reputation of the Company.
As the Company is an engineering, 
knowledge based Company, 
employee are its most precious 
assets. It places great emphasis on 
human capital for sustainable 
business operations. Therefore, 
the Company provides training 
and development programs to 
employees to enhance and 
develop their skills. Job rotation is 
practiced to ensure right person is 
in the right job. Employees are 
rewarded based on performance 
and recognition mechanism. Also, 
gaps found in performance 
appraisal is addressed by training 
programs.
Company invests in Research and 
Development to mitigate the 
technology related risks and has a 
DSIR approved R&D facility in 
house towards this. The R&D 
focusses on improving our 
processes and products and 
develop innovative solutions 
meeting the evolving needs of the 
customers. The Company is taking

Yes, as responsible organisation the Company gives importance to reduce, reuse and recycle water. This is achieved 
through installation of Effluent Treatment plant (ETPs) and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in line with the 
compliance norms in force. These systems enable the Company to resue and recycle water and utilise it again within 
the plant premises for process reuse, gardening and toilet flushing etc.
Water Recycle and Reuse: The Company has installed a RO plant to achieve Zero discharge of water waste. The 
Company treats its process effluents and reuses in its process. This facility has also been installed in the Company's 
manufacturing facility for electroplated products.
The Company's Green belt within its facility is fully maintained using Sewage recycled water. 
Water recharge: Water collected out of rain is harvested through a percolation pond carrying a storage capacity of 
1.2 Million liters.
The Company has installed rainwater harvesting in the CCSD Building with an Underground storage capacity of 0.6 
million liters and being directly used for Toilets and handwash purposes of CCSD and FG Stores since April 2020 
onwards.
Scrubbers has been built in the plating process for reducing the Odour and discharge of particulate matter.
We are a Zero discharge Company.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

10 a. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments.
Our Company follows the principle of "Reduce, Recycle and Reuse" to effectively manage waste. We use various 
initiative to reduce, recycle and reuse the waste .Some of the initiatives outlined below:
Energy:
The Company's Manufacturing processes are not power intensive. However, the Company takes continuous efforts 
to reduce energy consumption. The Integrated Management system policy of the Company focuses on Processes, 
Conservation of Natural resources, Protection of Environment, Prevention of Pollution towards Environment.
The Energy conservation measures include reforms such as installation of Energy savers in the lighting circuit to 
conserve energy through replacement of high voltage consumption lamps with LED lights, introduction of LDR-Light 
dependent resistance sensors that harnesses natural daylight for all outdoor lighting with automatic controls.
The Company has initiated discussion for Installation of Solar Energy in its facilities.
Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year:
Innovation and listening to the voices of customers has always been the Company's priority. Constantly adjusting our 
processes, methods and systems across the value chain in shortest possible time and designing our responses in 
terms of products, services and behavior ensures manufacturing excellence.
The Super Abrasive wheel (CBN / Diamond) provides an advantage of reduced risk of thermal damage to the 
workpiece. The reduced risk of thermal damage in CBN Grinding is at times attributed to the lower grinding 
specific Energies. This advantage can allow a marked increase in removal rate whilst maintaining surface quality 
of the component compared to grinding with conventional abrasives such as aluminum oxide.
Super Abrasive wheels extend bearing, spindle and overall machine life thereby reducing. The power draw and 
energy consumption for acceleration and deceleration in linear and rotary movement.
The Company offers an eco-friendly high-performance coolant along with its super abrasive wheels and 
machines to ensure there is optimum usage of super abrasive wheels and reduction in waste generated during 
grinding process.
b. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Company duly recognises the over-consumption results in unsustainable exploitation of the planet's resources. 
The business units in the Company are committed to promoting sustainable consumption, including recycling of 
resources. 
While setting the Environment, Health, Safety objectives and targets, considerations are given to reuse, recycle, 
reduction, handling and disposal of wastes. Measurable performance indicators include waste produced per unit of 
production. The Company has installed high tech pretreatment line in the place of conventional treatment to ensure 
clean production and reduction in hazardous waste generation. During the year, the Company has achieved a 
significant waste reduction in case of electroplating products. The Company has zero discharge facility for sewage, 
canteen, Electroplating process, paint booth, DM Water effluent and used coolant through RO Method. This treated 
water is reused for relevant manufacturing processes. The Company has been achieving reduction in waste 
generation year on year.
The Company has a secured landfill in line with the applicable guidelines for storage of hazardous waste. The 
Company has also created a vermicompost facility to convert all the garden/ green waste to manure.
During the year, the Company has carried out recycling of Aluminum scrap into castings. 23 tonners of Aluminum 
ingots has been converted from aluminum turnings.
