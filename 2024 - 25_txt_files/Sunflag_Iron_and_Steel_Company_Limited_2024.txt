Objective: This refers to facilities designed to collect and recycle scrap steel, often from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Recycling steel 
 
from scrap metal reduces the need for virgin iron ore, lowering energy consumption and CO2 emissions in steel production
 
 
Impact on GHGs: Steel recycling typically requires less energy compared to producing steel from raw materials. For example, 
recycling steel saves up to 60% of energy consumption and reduces CO2 emissions by around 58% compared to using new steel.
 
2. Consumption of Good Quality Coal, LDO, FO, LPG, LDO and HSD  etc.,
 
 
Objective: The use of high-quality fuels such as coal, light diesel oil (LDO), fuel oil (FO), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and high-
speed diesel (HSD) is focused on improving combustion efficiency and reducing emissions from combustion processes.
 
 
Impact on GHGs: Using high-quality fuels can help reduce pollutants like sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and 
particulate matter (PM). However, the key challenge lies in transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, such as 
renewables, to further reduce GHG emissions in the long term.

3. Coke Oven Plant for Producing Coke, Power, and Coke Oven Gas:
 
 
Objective: Coke ovens are essential in the steel-making process, where coal is heated in the absence of air to produce coke, which 
is then used in blast furnaces for iron production. The process also generates coke oven gas, which can be used as a fuel for power 
generation.
 
 
Impact on GHGs: While coke production is an energy-intensive process, the utilization of coke oven gas for power generation can 
help mitigate the environmental impact by displacing the need for additional fossil fuels. Moreover, advancements in coke oven 
technology focus on improving efficiency and capturing emissions such as carbon monoxide, which can be reused in other industrial 
processes.
 
4.  Replacement of Conventional Electricity (Grid) From Solar Electricity:
 
 
Objective: Solar electricity is considered as a renewable & green power which is absolutely emission free. 
 
 
Impact on GHGs: Replacement of fossil fuel based electricity with solar electricity is greatly help to mitigate the environment impact 
by reducing the burning of fossil fuel. It drastically reduces the CO2 emission by fossil fuel.
 
5.  Injection of biochar into Blast Furnace:
 
 
Objective: Biochar refers to organic matter from corps and forests residue, which can be used as fuel to produce energy and 
replace fossil fuel up to some extent. Bioenergy is being a carbon neutral energy. This is because the carbon released when 
biomass is burned is off-set by the carbon absorbed by the plants during their growth. 
 
 
Impact on GHGs: Replacement of fossil fuel with biochar helps to mitigate the environment impact by using of fossil fuel. It 
drastically reduces the CO2 emission.
 
Additional Considerations for Reducing GHGs:
 
 
Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS): Implementing CCUS technologies in coke ovens and other industrial plants 
can help capture CO2 emissions at the source and either store them underground or repurpose them for other uses, further 
reducing the carbon footprint.
 
 
Electrification of Industrial Processes: In the long term, switching from fossil fuels to electricity derived from renewable sources 
can significantly reduce GHG emissions.
 
 
Process Optimization: Continuous improvement in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy sources and digitalization (e.g., AI 
for predictive maintenance and optimization) can reduce overall emissions in steel plants.
 
 
Replacement of FO/LDO/LPG with Natural Gas: CO2 emission intensity of Natural Gas is much lower than FO/LDO/LPG. 
Replacement of these fossil fuels with Natural Gas reduce the GHG emissions.

disposed for roads construction and other end users. Slag will be generated from Stainless Steel Refining Converter also and it will be used 
same as in existing set up. 
Mill Scale (CCM & Rolling Mill): Mill scale is generated at CCM, BSM, ASM & Blooming mill Sections. The quantity of mill scale generated 
for year 2024-25 is about 10,597 MTA against consent quantity 32,050 MTA. Water used for cooling purposes of billets and rolled steel 
products, carries mill scale along with it and admitted in scale pit under gravity. From the scale pit, mill scale is removed periodically. The total 
rd
rd
mill scale constitutes 2/3  from CCM mill scale and about 1/3  from BSM/ASM Mill Scale. These scales are used for sinter manufacture.
Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets (Rolling Mill): Total generation of Iron/Steel Scrap/Rejected Billets from existing plant for year 2024 - 25 
is 23,190.76 MTA against consented quantity 32,050 MTA 
Iron/Steel Scrap 23,190.76 MTA is generated during cutting of steel bars at BSM, ASM & Blooming mill of Rolling Mill and also Steel Scrap is 
also generated from Bright Bar Section and Coiler. Rejected Billets. These solid wastes are recycled by melting in the steel manufacturing.
Grinder Waste (Rolling Mill): It is generated during removal of upper layer of steel bars at Bright Bar Section. Total quantity of grinder waste 
generation for year 2024-25 is about 143.717 MTA against consent quantity 240 MTA. This waste is recycled to SMS section for melting 
and reuse.
Coal Rejects: This waste is generated in the process of screening of crushed and wet coal .The stone and shells of the coal are separated at 
screening. It is estimated 84000 MTA at full production capacity, the generated stone & shells are used for landfill within the premises.
Granulated MBF Slag: Granulated MBF slag is taken from the bottom of MBF. The generation of MBF slag for year 2024 - 25 is 1,72,366

measure of phytoremediation.
4.7.2    Hazardous Waste
Used/Spent Oil (Schedule–1, Category No. 5.1): Lubrication & other oils used in machineries lose their properties after use for some 
days. Used oils removed from machineries, gear boxes, compressors etc are collected in drums and the well-packed drums are temporarily 
stored in specifically earmarked area within the premises. 
These oils will be used in furnaces/Boilers and also for anti-rust coating of rolled steel products and also sold to authorized reprocessors 
/recyclers. 
Acid Residue, Spent Bath Sludge and ETP Chemical Sludge (Category No. 12.1, 12.2 & 35.3): Spent acid, acid residue and spent bath 
sludge generated at Bright Bar Section and Coinage Plant is used at our sinter plant as a raw material. Similarly spent acid, acid residue, 
spent bath sludge and rinsing water generated from pickling plant, neutralize it, sent to Filter press,after neutralization, cakes generated 
from Filter press disposed of to our Sinter plant for Sinter manufacturing.
In effluent treatment plant, neutralization is carried out and after flocculation, suspended solids are separated out at clarifier & gravity sand 
filters. Suspended solids in the form of dried sludge separated at gravity sand filters is termed as Chemical Sludge and disposed off to Sinter 
plant.
At CPP, regeneration of DM Plant is carried out periodically by using acid and sodium hydroxide. Effluent of DM Plant is very small and after 
neutralization in underground pit, the overflow of the pit is mixed with other treated effluents for disposal. Underground Pit of the DM Plant 
section is cleaned once in six months and solids are sent filter press. These solids are termed chemical Sludge, used at our Sinter plant.
