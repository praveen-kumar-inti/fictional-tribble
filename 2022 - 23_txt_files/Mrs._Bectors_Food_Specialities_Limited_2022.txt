Material issue 
identified
Is it risk or 
opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk / 
opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of the 
risk or  opportunity  
(Indicate positive   
or negative  
implications)
1.
Food Safety  
and  
Quality for  
consumers
Risk and  
opportunity 
Risk:
Being a food product company, it is 
essential for MBFSL to maintain high 
standards of food quality and safety. 
If the standards are not met, there is 
health risk for the consumers leading to 
dissatisfaction, complaints and even legal 
actions against the company
Opportunity:
Having internationally recognized 
certifications to govern our food quality 
and safety would increase our brand 
value and make us a preferred company 
for our customers
Adoption of food safety and 
quality management systems 
and regular food safety and 
quality audits at each of 
the manufacturing  
units
Negative:
Breach of any safety standard 
would hamper the 
company’s reputation  
and finances 
Positive:
Compliance of proper 
regulations would   enable us to 
grow our business 
2.
Waste  
management
Risk and  
Opportunity 
Risk:
Rapidly changing regulations  around 
EPR in India and non-compliance risk of 
such regulations
Opportunity:
Reduced waste generation through more 
efficient resource use would enable us to 
achieve circular economy 
Adopt measures to collect 
waste and segregate it by 
waste type. Ensure that all 
types of waste is diverted 
from landfill by recycling or 
reusing the waste
Positive:
Innovative waste-
reduction solutions and the 
implementation of the 3R 
waste-management philosophy 
(Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) 
may result in resource 
optimization and cost savings.
Negative:
Any mismanagement 
of hazardous trash may 
endanger people’s health or 
result in noncompliance. The 
outcome may have a negative 
financial impact.
3.
Corporate  
Governance
Opportunity 
Strong and efficient senior management 
would enable us to achieve our goals 
promptly and swiftly
Setup of a committee to 
oversee sustainability initiatives 
and ensure the sustainability 
targets and goals are met
Positive:
Strong governance would lead 
us to excellence and expansion 
of our business
4.
Emissions  
and Energy
Risk and  
Opportunity
Risk:
Energy demand of MBFSL is mostly satisfied 
by grid power, diesel and gas. All these 
fuels emit significant GHG emissions. With 
increased regulations and national targets 
on reducing the emissions; the company 
will need to transition to renewable 
sources of energy and reduce its emissions 
from operations.
Opportunity:
To combat climate change, there is 
an opportunity to progress towards 
energy efficiency, the use of renewable 
energy, more efficient material use, and 
hybrid technologies.
Transitioning to solar energy, 
electric vehicles and other 
adoption of energy efficiency 
measures across the operations
Positive:
Investments in green energy 
technology and solutions 
are expanding in  
response to environmental and  
sustainability concerns, 
which are also cost  
effective and  long term.
Negative:
Given the government’s goal 
of achieving net zero GHG 
emissions by reducing GHG 
emissions, we are  
taking steps to reduce 
our reliance on fossil 
fuels. This necessitates 
further investments.
5.
Human 
rights & Fair 
Labor Practices
Risk
Responsibility for identifying and managing 
Human Rights risks in its operations and 
supply chain, as well as mitigating negative 
risks and resultant damages. Not only this 
but the changing human rights regulations 
pose a challenge.
Ensure that the workforce 
is trained in human rights, 
and the training is extended 
to value chain partners as 
well. Address any human 
rights issues arising through 
a grievance mechanism and 
conduct due diligence across 
operations in the near future
Negative:
Any breach can jeopardize 
the organization’s  
reputation and finances.
6.
Sustainable  
Agriculture &  
Sourcing
Risk and  
Opportunity
Risk:
Non availability of ethical and sustainable 
ingredients could lead to disruptions in 
the operations. Also, fluctuations in price 
and availability of raw materials is  a risk 
for the company
Opportunity:
Having internationally recognized 
certifications to govern our food quality 
and safety would increase our brand 
value and make us a preferred company 
for our customers
Increase the use of sustainable 
ingredients by investing in 
research and development. 
Initiate initiatives to sensitize 
the farmers on sustainable 
agriculture practices

stakeholders, and create a greener future. We believe in leading by example and

MBFSL creates working partnerships, establishes trust through productive interactions, and views internal and 
external stakeholders as important to its operations. Key stakeholders are defined based on their influence and 
impact on the company’s operations. MBFSL undertook a materiality assessment in consultation with external 
and internal stakeholders via surveys. The first phase in this procedure was to identify internal stakeholders as 
employees and external stakeholders as investors, analysts, biscuit and bakery suppliers, competitors, and biscuit, 
bakery and export customers. Furthermore, community groups were picked by the company to spend resources in 
the form of CSR projects to ensure community development.
