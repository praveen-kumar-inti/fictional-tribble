The Company has implemented a robust and well-structured Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management 
System, aligned with internationally recognised best practices. We are certified under ISO 45001:2018, the global 
benchmark standard for occupational health and safety management.
	
	
This certification affirms that the Company has established and maintains comprehensive systems to proactively 
enhance OH&S performance. It reflects our commitment to eliminating hazards, mitigating risks, leveraging 
opportunities for improvement, and systematically addressing any non-conformities related to health and safety 
across our operations.
	
B)	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
The organisation employs a systematic approach to identifying and assessing work-related hazards utilising tools such 
as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Safety Audits, and Daily Plant Inspections. HIRA is performed 
at regular intervals and additionally whenever new processes or equipment are introduced, enabling evaluation of 
risks based on their severity and probability. Safety audits facilitate the assessment of regulatory compliance and help 
detect potential hazards that may not be apparent during routine operations.
	
	
Furthermore, regular Safety Committee meetings are conducted to review safety performance and address employee 
concerns. The Safety Suggestion Scheme actively encourages workforce participation in enhancing workplace safety. 
These mechanisms collectively ensure comprehensive risk management coverage for both routine and non-routine 
activities, fostering a safe and proactive work environment.
