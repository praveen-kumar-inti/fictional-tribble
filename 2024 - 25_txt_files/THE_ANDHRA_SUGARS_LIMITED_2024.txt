As diversified enterprise, ASL continues of occasion a system-based approach to Business Risk Manage-
ment. The Management of risk is embedded in the corporate strategies of developing a portfolio of world-class
Businesses that best matches with organizational capability with market opportunities, focusing on building
distributed leadership and succession planning processes, nurturing talent and enhancing organizational
capabilities through timely developmental inputs.

of the risk or

(Indicatepositive

1
Renewable
Power
Opportunity
Reduction of pollu-
tion and protection
of the environment.
The company pro-
poses for sourcing
up of  renewable
energy  like Solar,
Green Hydrogen
etc. that will help in
reducing 
Gree
House 
Gases
(GHG) emissions.
Initially because
of higher Capex,
this will be nega-
tive but in medium
to long term it will
be positive.
2
Raw material
(Sugarcane
availability)
Risk
Continuous
drop in the availabil-
ity of Sugar Cane.
Sourcing of sugar-
cane 
produced
through sustainable
farming practices
viz., Mechanisation
of Plantation and
Harvesting, Timely
payment to farmers
and payment of
Cane price more
than the FRP fixed
by Govt.
Inspite of various
approaches to
mitigate this risk,
still plantation lev-
els are not en-
couraging. This
might be negative
in the Medium
Term/ Long Term.

Energy
Management
Risk &
Opportunity
Power being one of
the Major input for
Chlor Alkali and
other Segments.
Availability of Qual-
ity Power at rea-
sonable price is al-
ways a matter of
concern. The com-
pany has setup
Coal Based captive
Power Plant for
augmenting power
requirements for its
captive use.
To effectively manage
the risks associated
with energy manage-
ment, the company is
undertaking the follow-
ing approaches: 1.En-
ergy Efficiency efforts:
Implementing energy-
efficient technologies,
equipment upgrades,
and process optimiza-
tion to minimize energy
consumption.
2. To reduce reliance
on non-renewable en-
ergy sources.
3. Renewable Energy
Integration: Exploring
and investing in renew-
able energy sources,
such as solar and
Green Hydrogen to di-
versify the energy mix
and decrease depen-
dence on fossil fuels.
Risk:
Negative Financial
Implications: Inef-
ficient energy con-
sumption can lead
to higher energy
costs, impacting
the company's
profitability.
Op po rtun ity:
Adopting energy-
efficient practices
and integrating re-
newable energy
sources can re-
sult in cost sav-
ings over the long
term.
4
Volatile
Market
Trends
Risk
Prices of the Im-
ported Raw Materi-
als are highly vola-
tile. Further volatil-
ity in the segments
where 
the
Company's prod-
ucts are sold is al-
ways a matter of
concern.
To address the
risks associated
with volatile market
trends, the com-
pany is implement-
ing the following ap-
proach: i.e., Diversi-
fication of Customer
Base and to en-
hance supply chain
resilience and ex-
ploring various pos-
sibilities for reduc-
ing costs of Key el-
ements such as
power etc. and in-
vesting continu-
ously in Technology
advancement.

9.      Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your company to reduce us age of hazardous and  toxic chemicals in your products and
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
         We have adopted reduce, reuse, and recycle concepts in waste management.The waste generated in
our complex is broadly categorized into different types of wastes viz. solid waste and liquid waste.The
solid waste generated is further segregated into incinerable waste and land fill waste.Incinerable waste
like spent carbon is recycled to cement industries for co-processing / authorized recyclers.
       The other hazardous waste (land fillable) is sent to TSDF, Parawada.  Part of the land fillable waste is
being disposed in houses in the secured land fill facility. Waste oil and e-waste are disposed to authorized
recyclers.  Used lead acid batteries are disposed to the battery manufacturers on a buy back basis.
          Our Company is encouraging the usage of non-asbestos roof sheets in place of hazardous asbestos roof
sheets for the structural buildings.
       Depending on the nature of the liquid wastes, they are treated using different types ofpollution control
technologies, such as anaerobic and aerobic treatment systems, reverse osmosis and multiple effect
evaporation systems and making them zero liquid discharge where-ever possible.
