Yes. IGL being in the business of City Gas Distribution, Gas Sourcing is a significant component of the total procurement

emissions. Majority of the gas requirement for CNG(T) and PNG(D) segments is met through procurement of domestic gases 
viz Administered Priced Gas (APM/NAPM) , New Well Gas (NWG) and High Pressure/High Temperature (HP/HT) at government-
determined prices. The remaining gas requirement is catered by sourcing RLNG from various reputed suppliers under term 
contracts at competitive prices, linked to popular indices like Brent, Henry Hub, etc.
	
To ensure transparency and accountability, IGL has a well-documented Contract & Procurement Manual approved by its 
Board. This manual serves as a guide for the procurement of goods and services, outlining the necessary procedures and 
guidelines to be followed and enabling steady continuous and sustainable procurement.
	
In the fiscal year 2024-2025, IGL demonstrated its commitment to supporting the MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) 
sector by sourcing 41.42% of its total procurement from this sector. This emphasizes IGL’s efforts to promote inclusive growth 
and provide opportunities to smaller enterprises.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
IGL carries out GHG accounting of its annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission. Natural gas is the sole product of IGL which has 
methane as its prime component (>90%). Methane has a higher global warming potential and a lower emission rate during 
combustion. During the process of city distribution of Natural Gas transmission, some losses / leakages occur leading to 
certain amount of natural gas escaping into the atmosphere. 
	
IGL continuously strives to reduce the overall natural gas loss and leakage during transmission with the assistance to its 
industry partners to establish effective strategies to detect and reduce potential leaks.
	
IGL’s direct emission is primarily from system usage of Natural Gas in compression, venting, fuel consumption by IGL owned 
vehicles / patrolling vehicles, DG/GG gen sets. Natural Gas and LPG are also vent out in miniscule quantities in some processes 
causing methane emissions.
	
Electricity purchased for operational purposes including manufacturing and transmission contributes to Scope 2 emissions.

GA 
weblink: 
https://www.iglonline.

CBG_09.pdf
3800+9553=13,353 TONNES OF CUMULATIVE CBG has 
been procured so far since march 2022. Municipal Solid 
Waste, Press mud, cow-dung and spent wash are being 
used to generate CBG as a fuel and FOM as a carbon 
rich organic manure. Import of LNG has been reduced 
by this quantity, thereby reducing carbon footprints 
and preserving forex reserves. Also, it has led to local 
employment and use of CBG as a clean fuel.
IGL is also planning to set up 10 CBG plants with its 
own investment/JV mode. One plant is already under 
construction. Once commissioned, Approx. 80 TPD of 
gas shall be produced from these proposed CBG plants .

LNG plant at one of the existing CNG 
station to convert natural gas into LNG 
is under planning.
LNG Sale at Ajmer - approx. 2500 Kgs per day 
LCNG Sale at Ajmer - approx. 4500 Kgs per day 
Number of vehicles being catered - 15-20 LNG Trucks.
