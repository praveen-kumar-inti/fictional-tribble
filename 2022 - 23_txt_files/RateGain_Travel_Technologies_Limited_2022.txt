this reality, the clients 
have already integrated 
climate actions in their 
strategic 
roadmaps 
in 
the 
near, 
medium 
and 
long-term. 
These 
roadmaps require them 
to revisit their operations

Statement by director responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
Today, ESG is at the heart of the business across the industry. 
RateGain has taken this into complete cognizance and decided to 
take bold steps in that direction. With growing investor interest in 
ESG practices and heightened attention from regulatory authorities, 
we are viewing ESG as a strategic imperative. Our global presence 
across markets like the US, Europe, Middle-East and others means 
that we are expected to support a diverse set of client expectations 
depending on geographical mandates.
We are cognizant that the travel and tourism industry contributes 
significantly to global carbon footprint today. There are efforts 
underway at our clients’ end to reduce their overall footprint and 
we are aligned internally to support them along this journey.
Within our operations, we are in the middle of our transformation 
into an efficient-enterprise by optimizing our IT practices and 
products. Considering our clients are marquee names in the 
industry and have global operations, we need to ensure that our 
projects are not disruptive, to say the least. 
Our commitment to employee welfare, across the RateGain 
enterprise, continues to remain strong. We will be enhancing this 
further with a holistic employee engagement plan, embedding 
facets of sustainability into the engagement experience.
We have institutionalized governance mechanisms to ensure 
a rigorous and robust framework driving compliance, data 
management, 
ethical 
practices 
and 
stringent 
controls. 
Our implementation of RegTech system has only bolstered this 
further, ensuring a zero-slippage tolerance.
During FY 2023-24, we will be executing a holistic materiality 
assessment to identify the material ESG topics for our internal 
and external stakeholders. We believe this year will lay the strong 
foundation for us to implement and scale our sustainability 
strategy. Our management is strongly committed to make ESG 
integral to our activities across the enterprise.

Company ensures that all employees are eventually covered under the Company’s insurance policies.

RateGain prioritizes maintaining a healthy, fair, and inclusive work culture. 
To ensure that employees feel valued and heard, the company has a 
dedicated mechanism in place to receive and redress grievances promptly 
and effectively. This approach fosters an environment where employees 
can freely express their concerns, and the company is committed to 
addressing them with utmost attention and care.
RateGain’s Whistle Blower Policy outlines the procedure and channels for 
addressing grievances, ensuring transparency and accountability.
RateGain has an online ticketing system for employees to raise grievances 
on https://help.rategain.com which are then assigned to HR business 
partners for closure. In case employees face any form of harassment 
including sexual harassment, they can raise a complaint on icc.@rategain.
com and the same would be promptly forwarded to the POSH committee 
for review and investigation. Based on the outcome of the investigation, 
the action is taken as per the recommendations of the committee. 
The employee who has raised the complaint, is protected from backlash 
by either providing paid leave to the employee or by moving the employee 
another team in case a team member or supervisor of the employee who 
is accused of the harassment.
In the future, the company plans to further enhance the grievance 
reporting process by implementing an online ticketing tool. This upcoming 
tool will provide employees with an additional avenue to report any issues 
they may encounter. By offering multiple avenues for grievance redressal, 
RateGain reinforces its commitment to ensuring a fair and transparent 
workplace for all employees.
