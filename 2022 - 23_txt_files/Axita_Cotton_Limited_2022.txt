expectations of these interested parties, and devise their strategies accordingly to address 
them.

PRINCIPLE 5 : Businesses should respect and promote human rights 
 
➢ 
The principle is based on the concept that the human rights are inherent to every human being, is non-
negotiable, and not to be diluted in any manner for the sake of business. 
➢ 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights also consider the human rights as a 
responsibility of the business concerns and requires them to be responsible for any violation and take 
adequate steps to make sure that no human rights abuse happens because of their business operation. 
 
There are five core elements to this Principle as below: 
➢ 
The governing structure of the business should make sure that the human rights requirements in the 
Constitution of India and other laws prevailing in India along with the International Bill of Rights is 
communicated to its employees and collaborators, and if there is any potential for human rights 
impact, there should be relevant authority to handle them. 
➢ 
The governing system of the organisation should have policies, structure and procedure to identify 
and mitigate any possible human rights violations from its operation. 
➢ 
The organisation should adequately address mitigation of the human rights issues arising out of their 
operations and have effective corrective actions to avoid recurrence. 
➢ 
Have promotional programs and drives across the value chain to educate the employees and raise 
awareness about the human rights violations and how it can happen from their operations. 
➢ 
Effective grievance redressal mechanisms in place for all the affected groups and communities to 
raise their concerns to the organisation.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the 
environment 
 
➢ 
The equity, dignity, and quality of life for the employees are the crux of this Principle and are related 
to the UN SDG 8 for Decent Work and Economic Growth. 
➢ 
This covers all the people in the complete value chain, addressing all kinds of discrimination and 
encouraging diversity. The quality of life encompasses the whole family of the employee. There are 
ten core elements to the principle that covers both the organization and the entities in its value chain. 
Both entities must comply with the regulatory and statutory requirements, and further provide equal 
opportunity to all the employees during recruitment, promotions, appraisals, and exit from the 
organisation. 
➢ 
The core idea is to Encourage collective bargaining, unions and associations, and have appropriate 
systems for grievance redressal, prevent child labour and slave labour in all forms, Support work life 
balance for all employees, provide a safe and hygienic place of work with provisions for gender 
specific requirements, provide required training and skill upgradation for the employees with access 
to learning opportunities.

8. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the

Cotton seeds and cotton are our key raw material and our dependence on it is quite large owing to 
90% of products being made from cotton. We have well understood the environmental impact that 
might occur if it is produced in an irresponsible manner which comprises of unsustainable use of 
agro chemicals, water and soil. Cotton produced under such practices contaminates the freshwater 
systems, degrades the soil quality, impact the health of biodiversity, farmers and nearby 
population.  
 
Upon recognising this issue and the need to scale the uptake of sustainable cotton, we initiated our 
engagement with farmers to build their capacity for sustainable agricultural practices.  
 
Our material cotton seed is agriculture product and to protect soil and environment we are 
spreading awareness about organic farming and for that we conduct seminar and training programs 
for organic farming and also provide guidance and related education to farmers.

PRINCIPLE 9 :Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a 
responsible manner  
 
➢ 
As the core elements of Principle 9 include the company should minimize and mitigate any adverse 
impact of its goods and services on consumers, the natural environment and society at large, the

➢ 
This Principle is related to the concept that the primary purpose of the business enterprise is to create 
wealth by producing quality products, or delivering services to the targeted customer, and keeping 
them satisfied to mutually benefit both the parties. 
➢ 
The principle comprehends that the customer has a freedom of choice of the products and services, 
and hence the organisations will put their efforts to provide quality at affordable and reasonable 
process, that are easy to use and dispose of.

It also aligns with the UN SDG-12 for responsible consumption and production, when is expects the 
business organisations to educate, make information available to the customers about the impacts of 
excessive usage of the products to their well-being, and to the society or the planet. 
 
Following are elements for this principle as below: 
a. Organisations should put in their efforts to reduce the negative impacts of their products and 
services on consumers, natural environment, and society at large. 
b. When conceptualizing, designing, and marketing their products, the organisation should not, in 
any manner, prevent the freedom of choice and fair competition. 
c. The organisation should transparently and accurately disclose all kinds of adverse impacts to the 
user, planet, society, on the biodiversity from their products. This may be done by labelling, 
marketing, or by providing information on their social media platforms.
