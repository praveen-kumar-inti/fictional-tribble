Annexure VIII to the Directors’ Report
Responsible Business Impact Overview
At Voltamp Transformers Limited, sustainability is deeply woven into the fabric of our corporate ethos, driving us to create
long-term value not only for our business but also for society and the environment. As we navigate an evolving global
landscape marked by climate urgency, resource constraints and social inequiƟes, we recognize our responsibility to act with
foresight, integrity and purpose. Our sustainability framework is anchored in—Social Capital and Natural Capital—each
represenƟng a strategic commitment to inclusive growth, environmental regeneraƟon and operaƟonal resilience. From
empowering communiƟes and fostering workplace equity to advancing clean energy, circular economy pracƟces and water
neutrality, Voltamp conƟnues to embed sustainability into every aspect of its value chain. This impact statement reﬂects our
progress, principles and ongoing journey toward building a more equitable and sustainable future.
I.
Social Capital: Empowering People and CommuniƟes through Sustainable PracƟces
The Company believes that its long-term success is inherently linked to the prosperity, resilience and well-being of the
communiƟes in which it operates. By strategically invesƟng in people-centric policies, inclusive growth programs and
ethical stakeholder engagement, Voltamp has meaningfully strengthened its social capital—the trust, networks and
shared values between the Company and its internal and external stakeholders.
One of the cornerstone achievements has been the zero-accident mission, supported by the implementaƟon of a robust
OccupaƟonal Health & Safety Management System (ISO 45001:2018). Safety commiƩees and behaviour-based safety
programs have been insƟtuted across all manufacturing locaƟons, ensuring a culture of vigilance, safety ownership and
risk reducƟon. With safety KPIs monitored at the board level, Voltamp has consistently recorded minimal workplace
incidents, earning the conﬁdence of both employees and contract workers.
On the employee front, Voltamp has embedded fairness and inclusivity through its Equal Opportunity Policy, which
ensures merit-based hiring, career progression and representaƟon of diverse groups. The Company is working towards
achieving a 15% share of women in its workforce by 2027, reﬂecƟng the commitment to gender equity. Regular skill
development sessions, Code of Conduct training and health and wellness programs ensure that employees are not only
producƟve but also empowered.
In the community sphere, the Company’s CSR iniƟaƟves span skill development, vocaƟonal training, rural educaƟon and
prevenƟve healthcare. Through focused programs such as women’s entrepreneurship training and youth livelihood
iniƟaƟves, Voltamp conƟnues to upliŌ vulnerable and marginalized groups, generaƟng long-lasƟng social value.
These comprehensive acƟons have signiﬁcantly enhanced stakeholder trust, improved employee retenƟon, built goodwill
in surrounding communiƟes and reinforced Voltamp’s social license to operate—hallmarks of strong and resilient social
capital.
II.
Natural Capital: ProtecƟng and RegeneraƟng Environmental Systems
The Company is deeply commiƩed to safeguarding natural capital—the environmental resources and ecosystem services
that enable and support its business conƟnuity. In alignment with the SDGs, the Company has undertaken rigorous
measures to reduce its ecological footprint and contribute posiƟvely to planetary health.
Key among these is the transiƟon to renewable energy, with a target of sourcing 100% electricity from renewable sources
by FY 2026–27. RooŌop solar installaƟons have already begun to decarbonize operations and miƟgate climate risk. This
transiƟon, coupled with energy efficiency programs, directly supports Voltamp’s ambiƟon to achieve net-zero GHG emissions
(Scope 1 & 2) by 2030, signiﬁcantly contribuƟng to climate change miƟgaƟon and reduced dependency on ﬁnite natural
resources.
In addiƟon, the Company’s efforts to ensure net-zero waste to landfill by 2027 and promote recycling of all process waste,
including e-waste and hazardous materials, underscore its commitment to responsible consumpƟon and producƟon. All
waste is managed in accordance with the Environmental ProtecƟon Act, 1986 and routed to cerƟﬁed recyclers or TSDFs,
ensuring minimal environmental contaminaƟon.
Through these iniƟaƟves, Voltamp not only reduces its draw on ﬁnite natural capital (such as fossil fuels and raw
materials) but acƟvely regenerates the environment by promoƟng circularity, biodiversity and climate resilience.
71
As Water is one of the most essenƟal and stressed natural resources and Voltamp has positioned water stewardship as
a central pillar of its environmental strategy. The Company has commiƩed to achieving water neutrality across its
operaƟons through a mulƟ-dimensional approach encompassing conservaƟon, reuse, recharge and awareness.
At the operaƟonal level, advanced Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems have been deployed at key manufacturing units,
notably the Savli plant, where treated wastewater is fully recycled for horƟculture and auxiliary uses. The implementaƟon
of rainwater harvesƟng structures, complete with ﬁltraƟon and silt traps, supports groundwater replenishment and
reduces pressure on municipal water supplies.
The outcome of these focused intervenƟons has been a measurable reducƟon in speciﬁc water consumpƟon, near
eliminaƟon of wastewater discharge and enhanced water availability in adjoining areas. These eﬀorts reﬂect Voltamp’s
belief that water conservaƟon is not just an operaƟonal imperaƟve but a social responsibility, criƟcal to building
community resilience and long-term business conƟnuity.
Sustainability Policy Snapshot:
Voltamp’s sustainability strategy is governed by a formal Sustainability Policy, which integrates economic advancement,
environmental responsibility and social inclusion. Key direcƟves include:
Energy Management & Carbon Neutrality:
Improving energy eﬃciency and transiƟoning to low-carbon operaƟons.
Water Conservation:
Achieving water neutrality through conservaƟon, rainwater harvesƟng and recycling.
Waste and Circular Economy:

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.
Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighƟng ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed enƟty has ﬂexibility
regarding the placement of this disclosure) :
Voltamp’s Commitment to Sustainability and ESG IntegraƟon : At Voltamp, we believe that sustainability is not merely a business obligaƟon, but a strategic
advantage and a core principle that underpins every facet of our operaƟons. Our sustainability approach is rooted in the seamless integraƟon of economic growth,
social responsibility and environmental stewardship, all aimed at enhancing the quality of life for our stakeholders and the communiƟes we serve. We are commiƩed
to aligning our values and business operaƟons with the expectaƟons of customers, employees, value chain partners, investors, regulators and society at large.
Sustainability guides our decisions and acƟons, enabling us to build long-term resilience, trust and shared value.
Progress on the ESG Journey: Voltamp has taken signiﬁcant steps on its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) journey. We have launched targeted iniƟaƟves
to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Recognizing energy as a major operaƟonal cost, we have adopted energy-eﬃcient technologies and increased the
share of renewable energy, including rooŌop solar installations. In parallel, our porƞolio of energy-eﬃcient and environmentally responsible products empowers our
customers to opƟmize their energy use.
Environmental Stewardship: Environmental responsibility has been a part of Voltamp’s ethos long before ESG became mainstream. Our environmental prioriƟes
include climate acƟon, resource conservaƟon (energy and water) and eﬀecƟve waste management. We acƟvely measure Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and implement reduction strategies to lower our carbon footprint. As a Responsible Company, we are commiƩed to conƟnuous improvement in health,
safety and environmental outcomes across our product and operaƟonal lifecycles.
Social Responsibility and Community Engagement: On the social front, Voltamp is dedicated to creaƟng inclusive growth through education, healthcare and skill
development initiatives. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs focus on empowering communiƟes and ensuring equitable access to opportuniƟes. We
provide a safe, fair and healthy work environment for all employees and business partners and are commiƩed to upholding human rights, promoƟng diversity and
inclusion and fostering a culture of integrity and respect.
Governance and Ethical Conduct: Strong governance is central to our operaƟons. Voltamp adheres to high standards of corporate governance, transparency and
accountability. Our governance framework is reinforced through well-defined policies, including a Code of Conduct, Whistleblower Policy and PrevenƟon of Sexual
Harassment (POSH) Policy. We maintain robust systems that support ethical business pracƟces, stakeholder trust and long-term value creaƟon.
Challenges and ConƟnued Commitment: While we have made signiﬁcant progress, the ESG journey comes with challenges. These include transiƟoning legacy
infrastructure to sustainable alternaƟves, the cost implicaƟons of adopting advanced technologies, monitoring sustainability pracƟces across the supply chain and
ensuring robust ESG data collecƟon and reporƟng. Despite these complexities, Voltamp remains commiƩed to overcoming them through innovaƟon, strategic
partnerships and continuous improvement.
Over the past year, our tangible achievements—such as sourcing renewable electricity for key facilities, installing solar energy systems andrecharge well for rain
water harvesƟng—reﬂect our dedicaƟon to a more sustainable future. We recognize the road ahead is long, but our resolve to drive meaningful change remains
unwavering.

Standardized work procedures are established and hazard idenƟﬁcaƟon and risk assessments are conducted for both rouƟne and non-rouƟne acƟviƟes.
AcƟvity-based risk assessments are carried out for operaƟons presenting potenƟal HSE risks. Tools such as HSE checklists and near-miss reporƟng systems
are uƟlized to idenƟfy and monitor exposure-related acƟviƟes.
2.
Site InspecƟons, Reviews and Audits:
Regular site reviews, safety inspecƟons and internal audits are conducted to evaluate safety preparedness and ensure compliance with established safety
protocols.

4.
InducƟon Training for Employees and Contractors:
All employees and contractors personnel undergo structured inducƟon training upon onboarding, focusing on site-speciﬁc safety procedures, emergency
response protocols and hazard awareness.
To further strengthen safety governance, a dedicated Safety CommiƩee has been constituted at the factory premises. The commiƩee is responsible for
monitoring the effectiveness of safety measures and ensuring Ɵmely implementaƟon of correcƟve and prevenƟve acƟons as necessary.
c.
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related to hazards and to remove themselves from such risks? (Yes/No) Yes
The organization has established robust safety protocols and health measures to maintain a safe and producƟve work environment. Employees are encouraged
to acƟvely parƟcipate in safety initiaƟves, including the authority to report hazards and invoke Stop Work Authority in the event of imminent risk. AddiƟonally,
all work-related hazards, injuries, unsafe condiƟons and acts are reported through a deﬁned procedure at the factory premises, with near-miss incidents
documented and reviewed by a team of safety experts.
To further promote a strong safety culture, the Company has implemented a Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) program that fosters safe work pracƟces, idenƟﬁes
and corrects unsafe behaviors and maintains a record for conƟnual improvement. To reinforce compliance, a dual approach has been adopted—recogniƟon
programs reward individuals for exemplary safety pracƟces, while a consequence management system addresses breaches of safety protocols, ensuring
sustained focus on occupaƟonal health and safety across all levels.
d.
Do the employees/workers of the enƟty have access to non-occupaƟonal medical and healthcare services? (Yes/No): Yes
The organizaƟon is commiƩed to ensuring the health and well-being of its workforce through well-established medical and ﬁrst aid faciliƟes. On-site medical
centres are readily accessible to all employees and workers, providing immediate healthcare support in case of emergencies or unforeseen medical condiƟons.
First aid staƟons are strategically placed across the premises to oﬀer Ɵmely assistance when needed. These comprehensive healthcare measures reflect the
organizaƟon’s dedicaƟon to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for both permanent and contractual personnel.
Furthermore, a group medical insurance policy has been extended to all permanent staﬀ and, oﬀering the beneﬁt of cashless treatment at aﬃliated hospitals
or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred. This integrated approach to occupaƟonal health care reinforces the organizaƟon’s commitment to the overall
well-being of its workforce.
