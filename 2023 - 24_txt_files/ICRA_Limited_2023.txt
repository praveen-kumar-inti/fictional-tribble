To minimise the negative impact on the environment we utilise all 
energy sources to increase efficiency of systems to create a healthy 
impact on individuals and environment. We use LED lights in our 
common area to minimise the energy consumed and also to minimise 
the cost. Plastic bottles have been replaced with glass bottles as they 
can be reused, washed, and sterilised keeping in mind employee safety. 
Also, plants have been added to ensure that it improves air quality 
within office.
We are a service sector entity, hence the relevance of the above is largely restricted to capital expenditure on information 
technology. The Company intends to continue identifying and acting on opportunities to reduce its impact on the environment.
