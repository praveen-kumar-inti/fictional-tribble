(Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is the practice of companies disclosing information about their 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It goes beyond financial reporting to provide stakeholders with 
a comprehensive view of a company's non-financial impacts and contributions to sustainable development. BRSR covers 
topics such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices, aiming to promote transparency and 
accountability.)

Statement by director

placement of this disclosure)
Dear Valued Stakeholders,
I am delighted to connect with you and share some remarkable achievements and 
initiatives undertaken by Honasa over the past year.
This year marks our first year of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting 
(BRSR). We have collected and reported data from our locations all across the 
country, ensuring transparency and accountability. Our dedication to sustainability 
has been recognised through various certifications and awards, including Made Safe 
certification, Cruelty-Free certification by PETA, certified “Great place to work” for the 4th 
consecutive year and receiving the Best Blended Learning Strategy award by the Vision 
and Innovation Summit and Awards 2024.
We published our 1st Impact report this year, strengthening journey towards sustainability 
and social responsibility. We thank our dedicated team and esteemed NGO partners: 
Bhumi, SankalpTaru, Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR), and Sambhav Foundation.
We are proud to announce that our programmes now cover 14 states and 2 Union 
Territories, reaching a national presence across Assam, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, 
Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil 
Nadu, Telangana, Maharashtra, Sikkim, West Bengal, Delhi, and Puducherry.
Through our partnership with the SankalpTaru Foundation, we implemented the 
We Plant Goodness Initiative under the Mamaearth brand. This initiative promoted 
afforestation and enhanced farmer livelihoods, reflecting our commitment to fostering 
sustainable coexistence with nature. As part of the initiative, we have planted 6L+ trees 
covering 3,800+ acre of land.
Our efforts have led to the production of 12,000+ tonnes of fruit, generating an economic 
value of over ₹20 Cr. In terms of plastic recycling, we recycled 9,000+ tonnes of plastic 
waste since FY 2020-21, proudly recycling more plastic than we use.
Our collaboration with Bhumi NGO brought the Young Scientists Program to life under 
The Derma Co. brand. The programme has so far instilled a scientific understanding 
of climate change among 20,000+ school children, empowering them to become 
ambassadors of environmental sustainability.
The Water for All initiative, executed by WOTR under the Aqualogica brand provided 
clean water access to remote rural areas, benefiting over 500 families so far and 
significantly improving their quality of life.
In partnership with the Sambhav Foundation, we are running the BBlunt Shine Academy 
initiative. This programme has so far empowered over 10,000 women through vocational 
training in hairstyling, promoting skill development and financial independence.
Our hiring policy emphasises on equal opportunity to candidates with a focus on 
diversity, Women constitute more than 50% of our current workforce which includes our 
off-roll employees as well. We are equally committed to our team’s welfare, with over 
70% of our staff receiving skill development training and more than 75% undergoing 
performance reviews. We have also drafted a robust BRSR policy and established a 
strong governance system to guide our efforts.
Our journey is a testament to the collective effort of our team, partners, and stakeholders. 
We remain committed to driving positive change, fostering sustainability, and making 
a tangible impact on the communities we serve.
Thank you for your continued support and trust in our Company. Together, we will 
continue to build a better, more sustainable future.
Warm regards,
