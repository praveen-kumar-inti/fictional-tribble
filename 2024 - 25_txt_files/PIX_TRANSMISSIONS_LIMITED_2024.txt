7. As a Company, we have long harboured the notion that we must provide our customers with the 
following:
• Security of Supply – ensure adequate availability of product to meet the ever changing needs of our 
customers no matter the circumstances
• Security of Service – provide the necessary training to ensure that our customers receive seamless 
support from each and every employee/location/department
We have now added the following to the aforesaid list:
• Security of Sustainability -  take initiatives to manufacture products in an environmentally conscious 
manner that protects the interests of all concerned stakeholders 
We believe that if we can successfully achieve all three parameters, we will have an extremely 
compelling offering. 
We will shortly be embarking upon our solar power plant project which will further enhance our green 
credentials and go a long way in creating a sustainable source of energy for the times to come.

8. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.
The company has implemented a Whistle Blower Policy to prevent adverse consequences for 
complainants in discrimination and harassment cases. This policy incorporates key mechanisms to ensure 
a fair and confidential process. Complainants are required to submit their Protected Disclosures within 30 
days of becoming aware of the issue, emphasizing the importance of timely reporting. To maintain 
confidentiality, the company instructs complainants to submit their disclosures in a secured envelope or 
via email, clearly labelling them as "Protected disclosure under Vigil Mechanism / Whistle Blower policy.
Moreover, the Company has established proper channels for submitting disclosures. Complainants are 
advised to address their concerns to the designated Vigilance Officer. However, in exceptional cases 
involving complaints against the Vigilance Officer or the Chairman & Managing Director, alternative routes 
are specified. In such instances, complaints should be directed to the Chairman & Managing Director or the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, respectively, ensuring an unbiased review process.
These measures are implemented to create a safe environment for employees to raise concerns, promote 
transparency, and effectively address discrimination and harassment issues. The company remains 
committed to upholding the principles of fairness, confidentiality, and accountability in its Whistle Blower 
Policy.
