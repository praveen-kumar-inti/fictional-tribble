Note: Wonderla has devised a Board Diversity Policy. Consideration and selection of candidates for appointment to the Board 
are based on merit and includes a review of any candidate’s integrity, experience, educational background, industry or related 
experience and more general experience. Within that overriding emphasis on merit, the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) seeks to address Board vacancies by actively considering candidates that bring 
a diversity of background and opinion from amongst those candidates with the appropriate background and industry or 
related expertise and experience. The Committee’s considerations include achieving an appropriate level of diversity having 
regard to factors such as race, gender, age, nationality, cultural and educational background. The policy may be accessed

Energy 
Efficiency 
and Energy 
Management
Opportunity
The Amusement 
Park Industry is an 
energy intensive 
industry. Initiatives for 
energy management 
and efficiency help 
Wonderla better control 
and optimize its use 
of energy throughout 
its operations, which 
lowers operational 
costs (through less 
energy consumption), 
increases resilience 
in the event of 
energy disruptions, 
and improves the 
company’s capacity 
to meet regulatory 
requirements.
Actions are being undertaken to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by investing in reducing carbon 
footprints and increasing the share 
of renewable energy. At present, 
approximately 50 % of company’s 
power requirements are met by 
company owned and operated i.e. 
captive solar power plants with excess 
connected to grid or other power 
generated from PPA solar power 
generators. The Company has also 
developed an Environment, Social 
and Governance (ESG) Roadmap 
and has identified potentials projects 
for reducing carbon footprints in 
electricity. Wonderla has undertaken 
various projects on environmental 
sustainability such as:
(a)	 At Kochi, Wonderla has installed 
684 KW Solar Power Plant and 
Solar Water Heater System for 
utilities.
(b)	 At Bangalore, Wonderla has 
installed 50 KW Solar Power 
Plant Solar Water Heater System 
for utilities and Solar Water 
Heater System for Pools.
(c)	 At Hyderabad, Wonderla has 
installed 800 KW Solar Power 
Plant and Solar Water Heater 
System for utilities.
(d)	 At our Resort, Wonderla has 
installed a Solar Water Heater 
System for utilities and Solar 
Water Heater System for Pool.

Risk
Growing populations 
and erratic monsoons 
have resulted in

National groundwater 
assessments have 
classified numerous 
Indian cities as “critical” 
or “over-exploited.”
Wonderla is a water 
intensive company, the 
same being used for 
water rides.
The 4R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse 
& Replenish) method is used by 
Wonderla to ensure efficient water 
use and water conservation. Water 
recycling systems have been put 
in place at all the company’s sites 
to lower freshwater drawdown. All 
properties under management use 
rainwater harvesting to replenish 
groundwater. Additionally, as part of 
our sustainable water management 
practices, Wonderla has Rainwater 
harvesting ponds with a capacity of 
100MT/Day and the same are being 
utilized for our daily consumption 
needs.

Procurement 
and Supply 
Chain 
sustainability
Risk
Supply chain 
disruptions may result 
from inefficiencies 
in the system and a 
significant dependence 
on a small number of 
suppliers or vendors in 
the event of external 
shocks. By using 
good relationship 
management and 
encouraging ethical 
procurement/ sourcing 
techniques, it is 
possible to maintain 
strong, long-lasting 
relationships with 
suppliers and vendors.
Wonderla procures the products and 
supplies from reputed manufacturers 
and suppliers to maintain quality 
and 
consistency. 
The 
company 
undertakes adequate steps to ensure 
safety during transportation and 
optimizing the logistics to minimize 
environmental impact. We maintain a 
long-term relationship with suppliers 
and robust inventory management 
practices to ensure a steady supply 
of raw materials at a competitive 
cost. 
To 
achieve 
sustainability, 
we prefer local produce to reduce 
impacts from GHG emissions. We 
also practice Green Fuel-Electric 
vehicle whenever wherever possible.
Carpooling and Public transportation 
bus usage are encouraged offers 
up to 15% are given for the guests 
commuting through buses.
Negative
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Wonderla is primarily 
engaged in the 
business of amusement 
parks. The business’s 
nature considers health 
and safety a potential 
risk to the company’s 
bottom line. The health 
and safety of its 
employees, contractors, 
and customers is its 
top priority because 
Occupational Health 
and Safety (OHS) 
performance can have 
a negative impact on 
productivity.
Wonderla 
is 
committed 
to 
safeguarding the health and safety 
of all its employees, visitors and 
contractors. 
World 
class 
Health 
Safety Environment management 
system 
has 
been 
developed 
throughout all Parks -where “Plan, 
Do, Check and Act” has been 
implemented in identifying hazards, 
mitigation of Risks, training and 
empowering the people according to 
the gap analysis through gap audits, 
safety tours and consultation and 
participation of all.
To meet this commitment and comply 
with relevant OHS legislation, a 
Safety and Hygiene Plan (SHP) has 
been developed to manage the actual 
and potential hazards associated 
with normal park operations and 
any other activities relating to the 
operations of the functions and 
entertainment venues within the 
park precinct. The SHP is the heart 
of the Risk Management Policy of 
Wonderla. The Risk Management 
Policy can be accessed at: https://
