26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
The Company has a structured Materiality Assessment process to identify business conduct and sustainability 
issues pertaining to environmental and social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to the Company. The 
assessment was conducted in FY 2023-24 by external advisors, in line with global standards. As the outcome of the 
exercise, the material issues pertaining to environmental and social matters identified by the Company remains the 
same, covering both risks and opportunities.

Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG)
Emissions
Risk
Given the steel industry’s significant 
contribution 
to 
global 
carbon 
emissions, transitioning to a carbon-
neutral future demands clear targets 
and decisive measures.
VSSL’s GHG emissions are relatively 
low compared to the broader steel 
industry, as it employs electric 
arc furnace system. VSSL emits 
just 0.73 tons of carbon per ton 
of steel produced. Committed to 
sustainability, VSSL is intensifying 
its efforts to further reduce GHG 
emissions as part of its journey 
toward achieving net-zero.
VSSL aims to mitigate 
the risk by proactively 
adopting 
technologies 
and 
engage 
in 
continuous 
dialogue 
with policymakers.
In a continuous effort to 
implement 
sustainable 
business practices, VSSL 
will continue to employ 
relevant technologies to 
increase the efficiency of 
all their operations.
They 
have 
set 
clear 
and 
measurable 
decarbonization 
targets ensuring steady 
progress 
toward 
their 
sustainability goals.

(Indicate positive

Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions in response to the risks 
posed by climate change may result 
in additional regulatory compliance 
costs and risks e.g. Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism.

Energy 
Manage-
ment
Opportu-
nity
Steel production requires significant 
energy, primarily from the direct 
combustion of fossil fuel and 
energy purchased from the grid.
Not applicable
Positive Financial 
Implications
The focus is on VSSL’s ability to 
manage its energy efficiency and its 
ability to access alternative sources 
of energy. VSSL’s investment in 
solar power plant will meet 40% of 
its energy demand tentatively by Q3 
of FY’26, is a step in this direction.
VSSL’s action plan for transitioning 
to green steel involves leveraging 
renewable energy sources and 
advanced technologies.
3
Water Man-
agement
Risk
Steel 
production 
requires 
substantial volumes of water. VSSL 
is located in an industrial zone and 
mainly depends on ground water 
resources for its operations. Over 
the years, many residential areas 
have come up surrounding the 
Industrial area. This will result in 
increase in operational, regulatory 
and reputational risks associated 
with water scarcity, costs of water 
acquisition, and regulations on 
effluents or the amount of water 
used.
VSSL is increasing water 
efficiency with the help 
of new technologies, 
investing in rain-water 
harvesting 
pits 
to 
recharge the ground 
water	 resources, installed 
a Sewage Treatment 
Plant & planning to 
install Effluent Treatment 
Plant also.
Negative Financial 
Implications
4
Occu-
pational 
Health and 
Safety
Risk
Steel production processes present 
significant risks to employees and 
contractors working in the plants. 
High 
temperatures 
and 
heavy 
machinery involved, noise induced 
deafness, 
chemical 
exposure 
and electric hazards pose risk 
requiring a strong safety culture 
and comprehensive health and 
safety policies. Worker injuries and 
fatalities can result in regulatory 
penalties, negative publicity, low 
worker morale and productivity, 
and 
increased 
healthcare 
and 
compensation costs.
VSSL 
has 
a 
strong 
culture of safety and is 
committed to implement 
all 
safety 
compliance 
requirements in order 
to eliminate any health 
& safety issues to the 
extent possible.
VSSL regularly conducts 
internal & external audits 
on ISO 14001 & ISO 
45001.
VSSL has a dedicated 
Training 
Centre

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements.
	
Vice-Chairman’s Statement
	
We are pleased to present our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, which reflects Vardhman Special 
Steels Limited’s deep-rooted commitment to sustainability as a guiding force in our strategy, operations, and long-
term value creation. Sustainability at VSSL is not a standalone objective, but an integral part of how we grow—with 
care for people and planet with purpose. 
	
We have embraced decarbonisation not as an obligation but as a conscious strategic priority, aligned with our 
identity as a leading producer of Green Steel in the near future. We are making continuous efforts towards process 
optimisation, circular material flows, and have a determined shift towards cleaner energy sources. As we move 
forward, our focus remains on deepening our impact—from intent to execution—and building resilient systems 
across our value chain.
	
We continue to invest in our people, recognising that an engaged, skilled, and safe workforce is the bedrock of our 
success. Our safety-first culture, combined with strong leadership accountability is transforming our workplace into 
a model of trust, well-being, and continuous improvement.
	
Our environmental journey is evolving, with active measures in place to optimise energy usage, reduce emissions, 
and manage natural resources responsibly. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we are also 
enhancing water efficiency and adopting nature-based solutions, such as Miyawaki afforestation and rainwater 
harvesting.
	
At the same time, we are nurturing deeper bonds with our communities, ensuring that every action we take is 
guided by empathy and inclusivity. Our initiatives have empowered beneficiaries in education, supported individuals 
in accessing health services, and strengthened the resilience of households through environmental programs. In 
keeping with our thrust areas, we are especially proud to have restored mobility and dignity by providing artificial 
limbs to 17,500 persons with disabilities, and to have opened doors of opportunity through education sponsorships 
for 450 students, till date. These efforts reflect our conviction that true industrial growth is not measured by 
economic progress alone, but by the shared prosperity and sustainable development it creates for society at large. 
	
We recognise the path ahead is not without challenges—be it embedding circularity, decarbonising the supply 
chain, or scaling renewable energy adoption. But we view these as opportunities for innovation, partnerships, and 
leadership. At VSSL, we believe the future belongs to those who are committed to responsible growth. We are 
prepared—and inspired—to shape that future with resolve and responsibility.”

Yes, a grievance redressal mechanism is in place for employees and workers under the Grievance Redressal Policy. 
This policy defines a clear 3-tier process for addressing and resolving grievances:
	
Stage I: The employee or worker must submit their grievance in writing to their immediate supervisor. If the 
resolution is unsatisfactory, they can escalate the matter further.
	
Stage II: The grievance can be escalated in writing to the concerned Sectional Head. If the worker remains 
dissatisfied with the outcome, he/she may escalate the issue to the Head of Department and, if needed, to the 
Industrial Relations Department.
	
Stage III: If the grievance remains unresolved after Stage II, it can be referred to the Grievance Redressal Committee 
for a final resolution.
	
This structured approach ensures that all concerns are addressed fairly and promptly at each level.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has special facilities for managing hazardous waste, electronic waste, plastic waste, bio-medical 
waste and scrap materials. We make sure to follow all legal rules for handling these types of waste. Our main goal 
is to reduce waste and reuse whatever we can. We dispose of the rest responsibly. To manage waste effectively, 
we undertake the following key steps:
a.	
Waste reduction: We look for ways to produce less waste by improving our processes and finding better 
practices, aiming to reduce the total amount of waste generated. In the financial year 2024-25, we generated 
42,200.036 metric tonnes of waste, down from 45,776.95 metric tonnes in the previous financial year 2023-
24.
b.	
Recycling & Reuse: We try to adopt ways to reuse materials in our operations. In the financial year 2024-25, 
we recovered a total of 30,784 metric tonnes of waste through recycling.
c.	
Responsible disposal: We make sure to dispose of waste that can’t be reduced, recycled, or reused in a 
responsible manner. Hazardous and biomedical waste goes to Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities 
approved by the State Pollution Control Board. Non-hazardous waste and e-waste are given to vendors 
authorized by the State Pollution Control Board. This ensures that all waste disposal meets regulations and 
guidelines. In the financial year 2024-25, a total of 3,637.38 metric tonnes of FES dust was disposed off  
through landfilling.
