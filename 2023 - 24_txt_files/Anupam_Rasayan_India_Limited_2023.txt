3. Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community
Grievances can be written or verbal and can be expressed in local languages. They can be lodged by email, 
phone, through our community relations and development staff working locally, and other locally dedicated 
channels, as well as at corporate level. The grievances can be expressed anonymously, as well as on behalf 
of another individual. The channel is also open for our local suppliers. Each grievance is acknowledged 
once received, and the complainant is informed of the next steps. Once we receive a grievance, we assess 
its severity and assign to designate person, who will follow through to ensure that the issue is investigated 
by departments that are best suited to do so, and that the complainant is responded to in due course. 
Grievances with high severity levels are escalated to senior management levels. The grievance manager and 
the respective departments investigate the grievance and respond to the complainant informing them about 
the proposed resolution. In some cases, more information may be requested from the complainant to ensure 
a thorough investigation. We strive for our community grievance process to be based on dialogue where a 
resolution can be found together with the complainant. Remedies may be proposed on case-to-case basis. 
If the solution is refused, the complainant can appeal, in which case the grievance will be re-evaluated by 
alternate investigators. Once the complainant accepts the solution, the grievance is considered resolved. We 
aim to solve all grievances quickly. No such grievance has been received so far.

Information related to data breach 
 
 
Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our 
engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information 
included in the sustainability reporting, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on 
this information. It was not part of our engagement to review product- or service-related 
information, references to external information sources, expert opinions, and future-related 
statements in the Report. 
Responsibility of the Company 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the 
sustainability information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility 
includes in particular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability 
reporting, the collection and compilation of information and the making of appropriate 
assumptions or, where appropriate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the 
legal representatives are responsible for necessary internal controls to enable the 
preparation of a sustainability report that is free of material - intentional or unintentional - 
erroneous information. 
 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the 
verification methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 
17029 and ISAE 3000. 
The applied level of assurance was “limited assurance”. Because the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance, the engagement is lower than in a reasonable assurance 
engagement, the procedures the verification team performs in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable 
assurance engagement. 
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited 
as stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own 
judgment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement under 
materiality analysis to understand the reporting boundaries. 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for 
compiling, analyzing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal 
controls 
- 
Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, preparing and 
consolidating sustainability information and performing internal controls 
- 
Analytical procedures and inspection of sustainability information as reported at group 
level by all locations. 
- 
Assessment of local data collection and management procedures and control 
mechanisms through a sample survey at plant located in Surat units. 
Conclusion 
On the basis of the assessment procedures carried out from 23.08.2024 to 03.09.2024,

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the 
completeness with respect the Reporting Criteria. 
Limitations 
The assurance process was subject to the following limitations: 
- 
The subject matter information covered by the engagement are described in the “scope 
of the engagement”. Assurance of further information included in the sustainability 
reporting was not performed. Accordingly, TÜV SÜD do not express a conclusion on this 
information. 
- 
Financial data were only considered to the extent to check the compliance with the eco- 
nomic indicators provided by the GRI Standards and were drawn directly 
from 
independently audited financial accounts. TÜV SÜD did not perform any further 
assurance procedures on data, which were subject of the annual financial audit. 
- 
The assurance scope excluded forward-looking statements, product- or service-related 
in- formation, external information sources and expert opinions. 
Use of this Statement 
The Company must reproduce the TÜV SÜD statement and possible attachments in full 
and without omissions, changes, or additions. 
This statement is by the scope of the engagement solely intended to inform the Company 
as to the results of the mandated assessment. TÜV SÜD has not considered the interest of
