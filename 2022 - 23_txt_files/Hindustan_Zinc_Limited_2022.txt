BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
CEO STATEMENT
Sustainability has always been at the forefront of Hindustan Zinc's vision and mission. The global ramifications of climate 
change highlight the susceptibility of our planet to global warming. This, in turn, is encouraging organisations worldwide to 
focus consciously on implementing impactful climate actions.
In line with this global shift, we, at Hindustan Zinc, have dedicated ourselves to achieving long-term, sustainable business 
growth, while prioritising safety, minimal environmental impact, human rights and community benefits. We are actively pursuing 
an ambitious sustainability journey guided by our Sustainability Goals 2025, with a vision of 'Zero Harm, Zero Waste, Zero 
Discharge'. The goals we have consciously set for 2025 encompass the critical areas of climate change, water stewardship, 
circular economy, biodiversity conservation, zero harm, social impact, diversity in workforce, and responsible sourcing.
We firmly believe that these goals will enable us to meet the expectations of all our stakeholders and attain tangible outcomes. 
We are working continually on our long-term objective to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, in accordance with 
the business ambition for 1.5°C campaign led by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
It is our endeavour to ensure comprehensive coverage of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects across our 
business. For this purpose, we have established a three-tier sustainability governance framework, which allows us to set both 
short-term and long-term goals, and enables systematic monitoring of performance at all levels. The framework provides 
clear roadmaps to promote energy efficiency, minimise our carbon footprint, and ensure effective water management and 
biodiversity protection. It also aids our efforts in the areas of corporate social responsibility (CSR), supply chain, occupational 
health and safety, communications, and finance.
Our sustainability framework is built on four pillars: Responsible Stewardship, Strong Relationships, Value Creation, and 
Strategic Communications. With clear alignment to our sustainability goals, it is designed to drive our future growth while 
benefitting the communities and the environment beyond our operational boundaries.
Climate change being critical to our sustainability journey, we have identified renewable energy (RE) as an important area of 
focus at Hindustan Zinc. We are on the path to increase our renewable energy portfolio by signing power delivery agreement 
(PDA) for 450 MW of RE. At the same time, we are working towards reduction in emissions across our operations through the 
adoption of low carbon fuels, battery-operated electrical vehicles and by improving energy efficiency.
To support our green endeavours, we have decided to invest US$ 1 bn in the next few years to make our operations more 
environment-friendly. We are also working towards full compliance with the Global Industry Standards on Tailings Management 
(GISTM) by the fiscal year 2024-25.
Our investments in water conservation have emerged as another major engine of sustainable development at Hindustan Zinc. 
These investments have already helped us achieve a water-positive status of 2.41 times, and we are on track to become a 
5 times water-positive company.
In recent years, we have concertedly focussed our efforts towards achieving zero waste in the organisation by adopting 
a well-articulated '4R' strategy – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Reclaim. We believe this is essential to ensuring a cleaner 
environment not just for the organisation but also for the communities around our operations.
At Hindustan Zinc, we also remain invested in proactive management of our impact on biodiversity and strive to protect the 
ecosystems in which we operate. Our 3-year engagement with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is 
an important step in this direction.
Further, with the implementation of a sustainable sourcing policy, we have successfully expanded the ambit of our sustainable 
development framework to cover our business partners. We believe this will help foster a culture of responsible sourcing 
among all our stakeholders – a key imperative for inclusive sustainable future development.
Over the years, we have significantly augmented our CSR outreach in line with our strong thrust on driving a positive social 
impact among the communities surrounding our operations. Our CSR initiatives are in line with both the United Nations' 
Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and our national development objectives. We are working concertedly in the areas 
of education, sustainable livelihood, community asset creation, environmental and safety initiatives, women's empowerment, 
health, water and sanitation, as well as sports and culture. To ensure that our social initiatives are relevant and impactful, we 
periodically evaluate the needs of our communities and analyse the outcomes achieved. This helps us refine our future plans 
and strategies, and enables a more meaningful engagement with the communities.
In addition to our steadfast commitment to sustainability, we have taken significant steps to ensure transparency and 
accountability in our endeavours. To this end, we have published reports on the Task Force on Climate Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), Integrated Reports, and Sustainability Reports. These disclosures serve as a testament to our unwavering 
dedication to transparently communicate our sustainability efforts, responsible business practices, and progress.

Water 
Management
Risk
Our operational activities involve 
processes in which water is an 
indispensable input, both for 
extraction and processing & 
smelting.
Thus, it is even more important 
for us to strive to reduce water 
use and increase reutilisation 
throughout the value chain.
According to our climate 
change assessment, climate 
change may result in increase 
in extreme weather events and 
subsequent resource shortages. 
Our operations are located in 
Rajasthan, which is one of the 
designated water-stressed 
regions in the country based on 
WRI’s Aqueduct tool. There is a 
high probability of experiencing 
situations of drought and extreme 
heat waves. Since water is a critical 
input to our business, these factors 
have the potential to disrupt 
operations, to impact productivity 
of staff as well as our revenues and 
logistics.
Water conservation is particularly 
important for us as we operate in a 
water-stressed region. We are 2.41 
times water-positive and are well on 
the path to be 5 times Water Positive 
Company and reducing the water 
consumption by 25% by 2025 from base 
year 2020. Company has taken several 
initiatives to reduce its dependencies 
on fresh water and greater availability of 
water for the communities surrounding 
our sites:
•	
Increasing efficiency in water usage 
and exploring less water-intensive 
technologies
•	
Strengthening water recycling and 
installation of zero liquid discharge 
(ZLD) across all plants
•	
Using alternative water sources to 
reduce dependency on freshwater 
using treated water from sewage 
treatment plant
•	
Replenish water within local 
watersheds and rainwater 
harvesting
•	
Water risk assessment using 
WBCSD’s India Water Tool, WRI 
Aqueduct and GEMI local water 
tools

Tailings 
Management
Risk
The monitoring and management 
of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) 
plays a significant role in reducing 
environmental impact on our local 
stakeholders.
Tailings dam failure can lead to 
loss of life, injuries and damages 
to the environment, as well as can 
impact our Company’s reputation. 
It can also entail significant 
financial costs/losses and 
stoppages in production.
Failing of tailings dams can cause 
huge environmental impact. Hence, 
we accord top priority to managing 
them responsibly.
•	
All the Company’s tailings facilities 
are designed and constructed to 
the highest engineering standards 
and best-in-class benchmarked 
practices
•	
External and internal inspection 
and monitoring of the TSFs to 
review the integrity/stability of 
our TSF structures and their 
associated management practices

Risk
Failure to comply with emission 
norms could lead to negative/
inevitable long-term impact on 
the environment and society, 
with imposition of levies/fines, 
escalation in costs related to 
monitoring and reporting, among 
others.
Large-scale air emissions can cause 
serious impact on the environment

Climate 
Change & 
Decarbonisation
Risk
We are an energy-intensive 
industry due to the nature 
of our operational activities, 
logistics and transportation 
processes. That is why we seek 
new technologies and progress 
regarding sustainable energy 
generation. This can impact 
the overall market value of the 
products in the geographies with 
restrictions, thus impacting our 
revenues.
As a result, we keep track of all 
transition risks and changes in 
regional Climate Change Policy.
As per the physical risk 
assessment for the timeline 
2030 and 2050, Hindustan Zinc 
is likely to face natural disasters 
like droughts, heat waves and 
increase in extreme weather 
conditions. These would impose 
challenges to mining operations. 
Climate change may cause or 
result in increase in extreme 
weather events and subsequent 
resource shortages, impacting 
overall cost of acquisition of 
resources from alternative 
sources.
The rising challenges of climate 
change and resource scarcity have put 
us on a path of transformation to a low 
carbon economy. Our strategies for 
mitigating these risks include:
•	
Reducing fossil fuel-based energy 
use in our operations by using 
innovative energy-efficiency 
technologies and process 
optimisation
•	
Shifting to renewables and/or low-
carbon solutions where possible
•	
The Company has committed 
for net-zero carbon emissions by 
2050 or sooner and is planning 
to increase RE power portfolio by 
addition of 450 MW renewable 
energy by 2026
•	
Replace diesel-fuelled 
transportation vehicles 
with electric vehicles. We 
have introduced India’s first 
underground mining electric 
vehicle
•	
Introduced LNG-powered trucks 
and electric trucks for upstream 
and downstream transportation
•

Biodiversity & 
Ecosystems
Risk
Biodiversity provides many 
ecosystem services. If improperly 
managed, mining, smelting and 
exploration activities have the 
potential to negatively affect 
biodiversity and ecosystem 
services. Impact could be loss 
of protected species and habitat 
fragmentation. Such risks could 
affect our social licence to 
operate as well as our reputation.
We work to proactively manage our 
impact on biodiversity and strive to 
protect the ecosystems in which we 
operate.

•	
At Hindustan Zinc, we believe in 
Zero Waste and have designed 
a comprehensive approach in 
managing waste generated. 
We have aligned our waste 
management practices to ‘4R’ 
strategy – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle 
and Reclaim

People are our core assets and 
responsible for organisational 
success. By establishing a culture 
of safety, employee engagement 
and support for diverse groups 
in our workforce, we have been 
able to deliver in the top quartile 
of the business performance. 
We are an employer of choice 
and a company that continues to 
attract, develop and retain talent 
across all the levels.
Diversity is a business imperative 
for us and we firmly believe that 
healthy diversity mix is more likely 
to have financial returns above 
industry median. Strategically, we 
focus on having a strong 
representation of women across 
levels and women currently 
constitute 19.5% of the strength 
in the executive cadre.
Simultaneously, we have 
successfully onboarded 
Transgenders in front-end roles.
We have flagship programmes for 
identification and development 
of diverse workgroups such as 
V-Build, V-Lead, ACT-UP, She-
Leads, V-Aspire which focus on 
technical & behavioural aspects 
of individuals.
While we see opportunity in diverse 
workgroups, there are apparent risks. 
The workplace has to be inclusive, 
safe, secure, free of discrimination, 
harassment and bullying.

A high-quality talent pipeline 
paves the way for organisation 
excellence. Our talent 
management framework is 
conceptualised and implemented 
to maximise individual 
contribution by developing 
existing skills & experience. We 
believe in deploying best-in-class 
talent management practices that 
boost performance and help in 
building our brand to attract and 
retain talent.
We continuously work with a 
focussed approach to get the 
right people in the right jobs, 
developing them and creating a 
great work environment, which 
in turn will build the foundation 
for an exceptionally talented and 
successful organisation.
The core operations at Hindustan 
Zinc including mining, smelting & 
refinery require workforce with 
niche skills. Attrition in this talent 
pool is considered as a threat to 
the business deliverables.
Mitigation Plan: Talent 
identification platforms, high 
visibility role, well-defined career 
path, training & development, 
competitive remuneration, ring

Community 
Engagement 
and 
Development
Risk
Communities are identified as 
foremost stakeholder group. 
Stakeholders especially 
communities may get impacted at 
the socio-cultural and economic 
level due to our business 
operations. Deficit of trust and 
relationship with the earmarked 
stakeholders may not only impede 
the progress on initiatives for 
furthering our societal impact but 
may also lead to consequential loss 
of reputation, brand and business 
continuity.
Mismatch between expectations of 
community and actions deployed 
or lack of awareness or poor 
deployment of engagement 
initiatives may lead to discontented 
communities.
A proactive and sustained 
approach towards consultation 
with stakeholders including 
communities is critical to 
strengthen the engagement levels 
and sustained interactions and 
engagement platforms would lead 
to presenting our commitment to 
driving value for both communities 
and organisation.
We also are cognisant that each 
location has a different cultural 
and economic significance, which 
influences the expectations local 
communities have from us. Hence, 
community engagement for 
sustainable integrated land use 
planning, the training of community 
persons in specialised skills, 
importance to cultural values and 
its integration into the relationship, 
empowering and bringing women 
in leadership by focussing on 
equality, overall developing the 
assets within the community and 
intensely educating them thereby 
making self-sustained communities’ 
local employment, local sourcing is 
one of the most important aspect 
for us to build a trust and uplift their 
standard of living.

involvement of the functional 
leaders across Hindustan Zinc is 
key to monitoring the grievances

HINDUSTAN ZINC LIMITED
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
2.	 A.	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. The Company conducts business in a manner that improves welfare, health and safety of workers across our 
supply chain, ensures compliance with the law and adherence to ethical standards of governance and sustainability. 
To achieve this vision, we have put in place a Sustainable Sourcing policy that aligns our goals with our valued 
business partners and promote a culture of responsibility towards sustainability in all our stakeholders. The policy 
applies to all our immediate business partners including service and supply partners (“business partner/(s)”) based 
on fundamental requirement of adherence to the Supplier’s Code of Conduct, which embodies our commitment to 
internationally recognised standards on five core principles – Labour and Human Rights, Occupational Health and 
Safety, Environmental Sustainability, Business Integrity and Governance. We may require our business partners to 
provide information, complete training and perform other activities in connection with this policy before, during or 
after supply of goods or performance of services. We are committed to working with our business partners through 
collaborations and improvement in their process for responsible procurement based on global best practices.
	
	
To ensure responsible sourcing of minerals, including when sourcing from CAHRA (Conflict-Affected and High-Risk 
Area), Hindustan Zinc has established effective internal management of due diligence system to identify, assess and 
manage potential risks associated with our mineral supply chains. Through this, Hindustan Zinc identifies potential 
red flags, triggering enhanced due diligence in its mineral supply chains. Where red flags are identified, we undertake 
enhanced due diligence to map the factual circumstances of the presence of risks, including serious human rights 
abuses; risks associated with the contracting of public or private security forces; direct or indirect support to non-
state armed groups; money laundering; non-payment of taxes, fees and royalties due to governments; bribery; and 
fraudulent misrepresentation of the origin of the materials. We also map out risk management plans, including a 
feedback/grievance mechanism, to ensure prevention and quick mitigation of identified risks.
	
B.	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
70.45% of total supplies by value (total 235 nos. suppliers) have been assessed by a third party for sustainable 
sourcing and ESG criteria. The Company has plans to enhance the assessment and diligence process for GHG 
emissions and natural resources, water management practices, social practices, etc. in the upcoming year.
3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
The Company is in the business of mineral extraction and processing. Our final product – Lead, Zinc and Silver is used as 
a raw material for many industries and can be recycled and reused multiple times. The minerals are converted into ingot 
which are supplied to customers without any packaging. Company has recently started producing HZDA, a Die-Casting 
alloy which is a premix of Zn, Al, Mg/Cu in certain ratio to get best output of end product at customer’s side. Readily 
available premix saves the energy, time and cost to the customers. Thus, customer does not need to re-melt the zinc ingot 
to make an alloy, they can directly use the premix for their end product.
 	
However, the procedures are in place for managing all kinds of wastes generated during the manufacturing of finished 
goods. We are using technology and innovation to reduce-reuse-recycle waste and restore natural systems, including 
land rehabilitation through top-soil cultivation. Company also prioritises the repurposing of end-of-life mines as part of 
a broader remit to support local communities. Company is also exploring technologies to extract the valuable residual 
metals and minerals. New chemicals are enabling the Company to optimise the mining process, minimise wastage 
through the leaching process and significantly enhancing recoveries.
4.	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
No, it is not applicable for our product/product packaging. However, EPR is applicable for the plastic being received 
as packaging material for imported material goods. These materials are unwrapped in our stores and sent for further 
recycling, waste collection plan is in-line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Board.

2.	 If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your 
products/services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly 
describe the same along with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
Company conducted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study as per ISO 14040/44 standard, using the approach of “cradle to 
grave” for their Zinc, Lead and Silver products. The study established the baseline impact of ‘1 tonne of Zinc, Lead and 
Silver Production’ for facilities of Hindustan Zinc Limited. The system boundary for this study is a cradle to grave system.
	
As per the results there are no significant social/environmental concerns or risks arising from our manufacturing process. 
Following with the recommendations from the above study for which we have worked on:
	
•	
Identifying all potential areas for improvement and direct efforts so as to reduce the impact, or otherwise minimise 
as far as possible, getting the consequent environmental improvement and compare with the benchmark and best 
available technologies
	
•	
Optimisation and improvement of the production processes, end-of-life scenarios, etc.
	
•	
Stimulating the generation of information on the life cycle performance of materials to support both reductions 
in the footprint of the upstream activities to harvest the materials, as well as more sustainable applications of 
materials in products
	
•	
Objectively analysing different future scenarios and possible alternatives and their implications and impact 
on the life cycle
	
•	
Third party standards and rating schemes that are trying to improve the environmental footprint of product and 
building systems
	
A set of life cycle environmental impact indicators such as Abiotic Depletion of Fossil Elements, Acidification Potential, 
Eutrophication Potential, Global Warming Potential, Ozone Layer Depletion Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation 
Potential, Primary Energy Demand and Blue Water Consumption were considered. While comparing the results, it was 
found that Company's results are at par with the world average data.
	
Electricity consumption contributes to major environmental impact in the value chain of zinc. Company relies on captive 
thermal power plant, it is imperative to improve the captive power plant efficiency. Energy-efficiency projects such as 
revamping of all the turbines, improvement of cellhouse efficiency, other projects like installation of variable frequency 
drives across operations, switching from high-speed diesel to piped natural gas, have contributed to energy savings in 
our operations. We have signed power delivery agreements (PDAs) of 200 MW & 250 MW renewable energy. We are 
using biomass along with coal in our captive power plants. Electric vehicles have been introduced in our underground 
mining & smelter operations. With all these initiatives and supply of RE round-the-clock with these PDAs, we will be 
able to source about 50% of our electrical energy requirement from renewable energy and to reduce Global Warming 
Potential, Acidification Potential and Blue Water Potential significantly below world average data.
	
Water consumption was also identified as major environmental impact in the value chain of zinc. Company has 
commissioned India’s 1st dry tailing plant at Zawar mines which recirculates more than 80% of the process water present 
in tailings. We have zero liquid discharge (ZLD) plants at all smelters which recycles processed water, which is then reused 
in operations. We have also set out plans to commission the ZLD plants at all our units and remain committed to principles 
of water conservation and zero discharge. Rainwater harvesting facility has been introduced in Rampura Agucha mines. 
We have set Sustainability Goal to reduce fresh water consumption by 25% by 2025.

of Hindustan Zinc have their HIRA registers which are updated at regular intervals. We provide training to all our 
employees on risk assessment techniques. 
	
	
For all routine activities, proper risk assessment has been conducted and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are 
developed. These SOPs are reviewed periodically. All non-routine activities are covered under Permit to Work (PTW)
system which requires risk assessment prior to starting any job. Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Take 5 and controls are 
identified and placed before issuing any work permit for non-routine job.
	
	
We have identified 28 high risks activities and developed SOPs for all the identified risk for the effective management. 
Regular update and follow-up on implementation of these SOPs is being done. All the past incidents, near miss 
reported by the employees, work area inspection, contractor, field safety audits, etc. are evaluated and analysed for 
the root cause. Once identified as a risk, these are added into the HIRA register.
	
	
Governance:
	
	
Hindustan Zinc Corporate Safety Council which is the apex body of Company is responsible for implementing 
risk assessment of all routine & non-routine activities by conducting risk assessment {i.e., HAZOP study, 
PHA, Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA), etc.} for existing system and implementation of

Outcome of the initiative
1
STP at 
Udaipur
Company commissioned a 20 MLD STP in Udaipur in 2014 
under a public-private partnership, which is the first of its 
kind in Rajasthan. Further, Hindustan Zinc and Udaipur 
Smart City Limited signed an agreement in June 2017 to 
extend the sewage treatment capacity by another 40 MLD.
25 MLD has been commissioned in January 2019. Another 
15 MLD commissioned in FY 2020-21 taking the total to  
60 MLD.
The replacement of fresh water for 
operations by STP treated water has 
led to increased availability of fresh 
water for the community.
Nearly 36% of total water withdrawal 
was satisfied with treated sewage.
2
Dry Tailing 
Plant
India’s first Dry Tailing Plant was set up at the Zawar 
Mines in Rajasthan. The dry tailing technology is based on 
separating water from tailings slurry, which is generated 
in the beneficiation process. Company repurposes tailings 
materials and waste rock as backfill to stabilise our 
underground mining operations, while the remaining tailings 
are then placed in a specially-designed tailings storage to 
minimise the environmental, social and economic risks.
We externally review the integrity/stability of our dam 
structures and their associated management practices by 
global experts.
Key benefits of the dry tailing 
technology include recirculation 
of more than 80% of the process 
water present in tailings, a faster 
rehabilitation and restoration of 
storage site at mine closure and 
ensuring re-availability of water for 
further use.
3
Rainwater 
Harvesting 
Structure
Company executed groundwater recharge intervention 
project across Hurda, Shahpura, Kotri and Jahazpur blocks 
of Bhilwara district. We were able to complete the desilting 
of ponds, repairing, strengthening and increasing the 
height of damaged embankments and construction of 358 
recharge shafts for effective groundwater recharge, in 83 
ponds.
>8.7 MCM/annum total groundwater 
recharge potential created.
4
Paste fill
Instead of conventional hydraulic filling, Company chose 
to use the paste fill technology. This technology ensured 
fast filling and practically no bleeding water in the stopes. 
The other benefits of paste fill technology have been water 
conservation, better stope stability, surface integrity in 
mines and more recycling of tailings.
•	 Metal recovery from secondary 
stopes
•	 It reduces cement consumptions 
with increase in uses of fly ash
•	 It reduces water consumption as 
paste solids content is high (77-
79% solids)
•	 Nearly, 39% of tailings used 
in paste fill plant and this also 
helped in improving the stability 
of tailing dam
5
Ancillary 
Plant
It treats residues produced during smelting process leading 
to in-house production of few key consumables and by-
products, in collaboration with the Company’s central R&D 
team. Few projects were successfully executed including 
production of copper sulphate and zinc sulphate from PF 
cake as well as production of potassium antimony tartrate 
from antimony dust.
•	 It treats different kinds of 
residues, namely copper dross, 
purification waste cake, antimony 
dust/slag and raw zinc oxide
•	 This has also enabled in 
improvement of metal recoveries 
of lead, copper and silver

Efficiency
Company has been able to bring improvement in its metal 
recovery from beneficiation plant through digitalisation.
Advanced control opportunity for grinding and flotation 
circuit:
To address the difficulty in flotation process plants coming 
from the constantly changing feed characteristics, Advance 
Process Control (APC) system was introduced to maintain 
a stabilised circuit operation while optimising the process 
performance to maximise recovery. Three APCs were 
implemented for grinding & flotation operation (lead and 
zinc) in mills at Rampura Agucha and SK Mines.
•	 Pb recovery improved by 0.9% 
while also moving concentrate 
grade distribution on higher side
•	 Zn recovery improved by 0.9% 
while narrowing concentrate 
grade distribution around target
9
Fumer Plant
In the existing zinc hydro metallurgical process, Jarosite is 
generated which is treated with lime & cement and disposed 
in Jarofix Yard. In the proposed Fumer plant, a clean slag 
will be produced and utilised in cement manufacturing and 
goethite cake produced will be treated with lime & cement 
and disposed in captive secured landfill.
•	 Production of usable clean slag 
and elimination of Jarosite waste
•	 Elimination of recurring land for 
storage of Jarofix
•	 Power generation from waste 
heat recovery
•	 Increased recovery of Zinc, Lead, 
Silver, Copper and Sulphur
•	 Saving of Cement and Lime

Jarofix/
Jarosite 
Utilisation 
in Cement 
and Road 
construction
Jarosite is waste produced in the hydrometallurgy process 
of zinc extraction, necessitating additional investment for 
its stabilisation and disposal. In collaboration with IIT-R, 
Company conducted a feasibility study to utilise Jarosite 
in construction-related works, using Jarosite in concrete, 
mortar and paver blocks as 10% - 15% replacement of 
cement. The study showed positive results and encouraged 
us to conduct field trials.
Company has been granted permission by Rajasthan State 
Pollution Control Board for gainful utilisation of Jarofix waste 
for Road Construction/Highway Construction (embankment).
Company also partnered with few Government agencies 
like NCCBM, NEERI and CRRI for the utilisation of jarosite in 
cement and road construction.
