Employees and Workers: The Company has implemented a Whistle-blower and Grievance Redressal Policy accessible to 
all employees. Grievances can be escalated through formal channels including department leads or via email (grievancecell@
jkumar.com). The system ensures anonymity, protection from retaliation, and structured timelines for resolution.
	
•	
Customers (Clients): Clients may raise concerns through official communication channels, including the Company’s 
website contact form, email, or phone. All client interactions are monitored to ensure service responsiveness and 
ethical conduct.

Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available, provide

JKIL has implemented a formal Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy to uphold the highest standards of integrity, transparency, 
and ethical conduct in all its business dealings.
	
This policy is applicable across all levels of the organization, including employees, senior management, Board members, 
consultants, suppliers, contractors, and any third-party agents acting on behalf of the Company. The policy strictly prohibits 
any form of bribery, kickbacks, facilitation payments, or offering of improper advantages whether in cash or kind to influence 
business decisions or gain undue advantage. It also explicitly disallows acceptance of such benefits from external parties.
	
The policy outlines the framework for identifying and preventing corruption-related risks, along with procedures for monitoring 
compliance and addressing violations. Employees and stakeholders are encouraged to report suspected incidents of bribery 
or unethical conduct through the Company’s whistleblower mechanism, which ensures confidentiality, non-retaliation, and 
independent investigation of complaints.
	
As part of its implementation strategy, the Company conducts regular awareness programs, communicates its zero-tolerance 
stance across departments, and incorporates anti-bribery clauses in relevant contractual agreements. Any confirmed breach of 
this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment or business relationships, and may also lead 
to legal consequences under applicable anti-corruption laws. The Company’s approach to anti-bribery governance is overseen 
by the senior management and periodically reviewed to strengthen internal controls.

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/
No) If yes, provide details of the same. 
	
Yes. JKIL has formal processes in place to avoid and manage conflicts of interest involving members of the Board. The Company’s 
Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management outlines the expectations regarding ethical behavior, transparency, and 
disclosure of any personal, financial, or professional interest that may conflict with the interests of the Company.
	
Directors are required to disclose any direct or indirect interest in any contract or arrangement proposed to be entered into by 
the Company, in accordance with Section 184 of the Companies Act, 2013. Such disclosures are recorded in the Register of 
Contracts and Interests, which is periodically reviewed. Further, at the beginning of each financial year, Board members are 
required to submit a declaration of independence and interest, and also confirm that they are in compliance with the Company’s 
Code of Conduct.
	
In cases where a potential conflict arises during Board deliberations, the concerned Director is expected to recuse themselves 
from related discussions and voting. These practices are periodically reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee to ensure 
continued alignment with corporate governance norms and applicable legal requirements.

R&D
-
-
Though the Company has not allocated a separate R&D budget for 
environmental or social innovations, continuous improvements are 
undertaken through site-level experimentation and engineering-led 
adaptations. These include the introduction of GFRP rebars made 
from recycled plastic, piloting battery-operated locomotives for 
tunnel projects, and adopting alternative cementitious materials 
derived from industrial by-products — all of which contribute to 
reducing embedded carbon and promoting resource efficiency.
Capex
-
-
Capital expenditure was made towards enclosing batching plants 
with profile sheets and installing passive dust collectors to reduce air 
pollution at dense urban project sites; installing air quality monitoring 
systems for real-time emission tracking; and setting up transparent 
polycarbonate roofing at casting yards to reduce energy usage by 
maximizing natural daylight. These initiatives resulted in improved air 
quality, energy efficiency, and enhanced health and safety conditions 
for both workers and the surrounding communities

a. 	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. JKIL has procedures in place to promote sustainable sourcing across its procurement and construction activities. Though 
the Company does not operate under a formal “Sustainable Procurement Policy,” for now, it follows internal guidelines 
and project-level practices that emphasize the selection of materials and vendors based on technical specifications, 
environmental compliance, and alignment with regulatory norms.

Annual Report 2024-25
Corporate Overview

The Company encourages the use of low-impact and recycled construction inputs wherever feasible, such as fly ash, 
manufactured sand, and eco-friendly concrete mixtures. Vendor evaluation processes incorporate parameters such as 
statutory compliance, ethical conduct, quality assurance, and delivery sustainability, especially in government or metro 
infrastructure contracts where environmental safeguards are integrated into the project design. These practices reflect 
the Company’s intent to progressively align procurement decisions with sustainability principles, even in the absence of a 
separate, codified policy framework.
	
b. 	 If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
	
During the reporting period, the Company estimates that approximately 40% to 60% of its raw materials were sourced 
sustainably. This includes procurement from well-established vendors such as JSW Steel, Ultratech Cement, Tata Steel, 
and others, who are certified for social and environmental compliance. Additional vendors also undergo sustainability 
checks before onboarding. These practices reflect the Company’s operational commitment to sustainable sourcing, even 
as it works toward formalizing a structured procurement policy.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for: 
	
(a) Plastics- Not Applicable
	
(b) E-waste- Not Applicable
	
(c) Hazardous waste- Not Applicable
	
(d) Other waste- Not Applicable
	
As J. Kumar Infraprojects Limited does not manufacture consumer products, categories such as plastics, e-waste, hazardous 
waste, and other end-of-life product waste are not applicable. However, the Company follows responsible waste management 
practices at its project sites, guided by its publicly disclosed Waste Management Policy. This includes segregation, reuse of 
construction materials where feasible, and disposal through authorized agencies in compliance with environmental regulations. 
While product-level reclamation does not apply, the Company remains committed to minimizing environmental impact through 
site-level waste handling measures. The policy is available at https://www.jkumar.com/storage/reportFile/policies/health-safety-

waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same. 
	
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable to the operations of JKIL. As the Company is engaged in infrastructure 
development and does not manufacture, package, or distribute consumer products that fall under the categories notified for 
EPR—such as plastics, electronic goods, or batteries—it is not required to register under or submit an EPR plan to the Pollution 
Control Boards. Accordingly, there is no separate waste collection plan under EPR regulations. However, the Company continues 
to follow environmentally responsible practices for waste management at its construction sites in alignment with applicable 
environmental laws and project-specific conditions.

of-life product or packaging waste that would require reclamation in the form of reuse, recycling, or safe disposal under this 
disclosure requirement. Accordingly, there is no quantifiable data to report in terms of metric tonnes of products or packaging 
reclaimed at the end of product life. This disclosure is not applicable to the Company’s current operations.

accessible communication, and supportive workplace practices. It also defines the responsibilities of designated officers 
for policy implementation, grievance redressal, and periodic review of compliance. Displayed at prominent office locations 
and communicated across departments, the policy is a reflection of the Company’s broader effort to embed inclusivity in 
both infrastructure and workplace culture. The Equal Opportunity Policy is available on the Company’s official website at

Permanent employees
Yes. JKIL has well-established grievance redressal mechanisms applicable to all categories of employees and 
workers, including those engaged through contractors. These mechanisms are governed by formal policies such 
as the Grievance Redressal Policy, Whistleblower Policy, and Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy, each 
designed to ensure that concerns are addressed fairly, promptly, and confidentially.
The Grievance Redressal Policy is applicable to all employees, including probationers, trainees, interns, and 
workers deployed at project sites. Under this policy, an employee or worker may raise a grievance related 
to workplace issues, employment terms, welfare, interpersonal conduct, or any other concern affecting their 
work environment. The process begins with informal resolution at the reporting manager or supervisor level. 
If unresolved, the grievance may be escalated to the respective Head of Department or the Human Resources 
(HR) team. In cases requiring formal escalation, the employee can submit a written complaint to the Grievance 
Redressal Committee, either physically or via email to grievancecell@jkumar.com. The Company has defined 
timelines for acknowledging and resolving such grievances to ensure transparency and accountability. 
All complaints are handled with due confidentiality, and the policy strictly prohibits retaliation against any 
complainant.
In addition to the grievance mechanism, the Company has implemented a Whistleblower Policy, which allows 
any employee, vendor, or external stakeholder to report unethical behavior, fraud, misconduct, or violations of 
the Company’s Code of Conduct. This policy extends to senior management and ensures that whistleblowers 
can report concerns without fear of adverse consequences. Whistleblower complaints can be submitted through 
the internal reporting mechanism or escalated directly to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee in sensitive 
matters. All complaints are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate disciplinary or corrective action is taken 
based on findings.
Other than Permanent 
employees
For issues related specifically to gender-based misconduct or harassment at the workplace, the Company has 
established a Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) Policy in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at 
Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is constituted 
with members including senior female employees, legal or social experts, and an external representative from an 
NGO. Any woman employee, including temporary or contractual staff, may submit a complaint in writing to any 
ICC member. The ICC investigates all complaints independently, ensures confidentiality, and provides appropriate 
relief and resolution within the timelines defined under the law. The POSH framework also includes awareness 
and sensitization programs for employees to foster a respectful and inclusive workplace.
Collectively, these policies ensure that employees and workers across all levels have access to structured, legally 
compliant, and fair grievance redressal mechanisms. These mechanisms are displayed at office locations and 
communicated during onboarding and periodic training, reflecting the Company’s commitment to transparency, 
workplace justice, and employee well-being.

10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, 
the coverage such system? 
	
	
Yes. JKIL has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System across its operations 
to ensure the well-being of employees, contract workers, and site personnel. The system is structured around the 
internationally recognized Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) framework and is guided by the Company’s Corporate HSE Manual. 
It includes clearly defined health, safety, and environmental (HSE) objectives and targets, which are periodically reviewed 
and updated. The Company has adopted ISO 45001:2018 for occupational health and safety management and is also 
118

J. Kumar Infraprojects Limited
implementing ISO 14001:2025 for environmental management. Monthly HSE committee meetings are conducted to 
monitor compliance, assess risk areas, and drive continual improvement. The system covers all project sites and offices, 
and integrates safety protocols, risk assessments, incident tracking, training programs, and regulatory compliance reviews 
to foster a culture of safety and accountability throughout the organization.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity? 
	
	
JKIL follows a structured and proactive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and 
non-routine basis across its operational sites. The Company conducts Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) 
specifically for high-risk activities, enabling the implementation of appropriate control measures before work begins. 
Routine workplace inspections are carried out by the HSE team to monitor compliance and detect potential hazards. For 
task-specific risk analysis, Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Pre-Task Risk Assessments are conducted to evaluate risks associated 
with particular job functions or site conditions. Prior to execution of activities, toolbox talks and safety briefings are held to 
communicate safety instructions and precautions to workers. Each task is governed by a Method Statement outlining the 
step-by-step process, associated hazards, and control measures. In addition, regular internal safety audits are undertaken 
to assess the effectiveness of safety systems and ensure continual improvement. These processes collectively help the 
Company maintain a safe work environment by systematically identifying, evaluating, and mitigating occupational risks.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. 
(Y/N) 
	
	
Yes. JKIL has established clear processes that allow workers to report work-related hazards and, where necessary, remove 
themselves from potentially dangerous situations without fear of reprisal. Workers can report hazards through multiple 
channels, including dedicated hazard reporting processes, discussions during pre-start talks and daily toolbox meetings, 
and during the execution of Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises. Supervisors and HSE officers are 
trained to act promptly on such reports, and corrective measures are implemented to mitigate the identified risks. These 
mechanisms promote a culture of safety ownership and empower workers to actively participate in maintaining a safe 
work environment.
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No) 
	
	
Yes. JKIL provides its employees and site workers with access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services across 
all major project locations. The Company conducts pre-employment and routine medical check-ups to monitor the health 
and well-being of its workforce. Each active worksite is equipped with a medical centre and staffed with qualified 
doctors and nurses to address day-to-day health concerns. Permanent ambulances are stationed at all work sites to 
ensure emergency response readiness, and tie-ups are maintained with nearby hospitals for advanced medical care when 
needed. In addition, the Company regularly organizes health check-up programs to promote preventive healthcare and 
early diagnosis. These measures go beyond occupational requirements and reflect the Company’s commitment to holistic 
employee and worker welfare.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.  
	
JKIL adopts a comprehensive and structured approach to ensure a safe and healthy work environment across all its project 
sites and operational locations. The Company begins this process with a mandatory safety induction for all newly inducted 
employees and workers, aimed at familiarizing them with project-specific safety protocols, emergency procedures, and key 
risk areas. This is followed by periodic safety training sessions that focus on safe work practices, legal requirements, and site-

specific hazards. Daily toolbox talks are conducted at each work location to reinforce safety awareness among workers and to 
address any job-specific risks before work begins. In addition, the Company regularly conducts Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) for all high-risk tasks to proactively identify potential dangers and implement necessary control measures 
before execution.
	
To safeguard physical well-being, JKIL ensures the provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to all workers 
based on the nature of their tasks. Usage compliance is monitored by the site safety team to maintain a disciplined safety 
culture. On the health front, the Company conducts pre-employment medical check-ups to assess the physical fitness of each 
worker before deployment. Routine medical check-ups are conducted thereafter at regular intervals to monitor the ongoing 
health of workers and detect early signs of occupational or lifestyle-related illnesses.
	
Each active worksite is supported by an on-site medical centre equipped with essential first-aid facilities and staffed by trained 
doctors and nurses to provide immediate medical attention. Permanent ambulances are stationed at all major sites to ensure 
timely transportation in case of medical emergencies. To strengthen access to advanced care, the Company maintains tie-ups 
with reputed hospitals located near its work sites. Furthermore, the Company organizes regular health awareness and check-up 
camps for its employees and workers, focusing on general wellness, nutrition, and preventive care. These initiatives promote 
a culture of proactive health management across the organization.
	
In addition to workplace-focused measures, the Company also undertakes proactive public safety interventions. For instance, 
when construction activities are planned in close proximity to existing occupied buildings, JKIL coordinates the temporary 
relocation of affected occupants to ensure their safety and comfort during the construction period. This initiative reflects the 
Company’s sensitivity to community risks and reinforces its commitment to responsible and safe infrastructure development in 
urban areas.
	
Collectively, these measures demonstrate JKIL’s deep-rooted commitment to occupational safety and health. The integration of 
preventive systems, emergency preparedness, health infrastructure, and community-level safeguards ensures that the Company’s 
workplaces remain safe, compliant, and conducive to the physical and mental well-being of all individuals involved in or impacted 
by its operations.

JKIL ensures that 100% of its active project sites and offices are regularly assessed for compliance with health and safety 
practices as well as overall working conditions. These assessments are carried out through a combination of internal inspections 
and audits by safety teams, as well as periodic evaluations by statutory authorities wherever applicable. The Company follows 
a structured inspection and tagging system for all plant machinery, equipment, and power tools to ensure their operational 
safety and compliance with maintenance protocols. In addition, key workplace elements such as housekeeping, lighting, and 
ventilation are monitored routinely to maintain a safe and conducive working environment. At all project sites, safety features 
such as machine guards and emergency stop button systems have been implemented to prevent accidental injuries and facilitate 
quick response during emergencies. These measures are aligned with the Company’s internal safety management system and 
reflect its proactive approach to workplace safety and operational excellence.

1.	
Does the entity extend any life insurance or any compensatory package in the event of death of (A) Employees (Y/N) 
(B) Workers (Y/N)
	
(A) 	 Yes. JKIL extends life insurance coverage to all employees for work-related accidents as part of its commitment to employee 
welfare and financial protection. This coverage ensures that the employee’s family receives compensatory support in the 
unfortunate event of a fatal incident arising during the course of duty.
	
(B) 	 No. The Company does not directly extend life insurance or compensatory packages to site workers, as they are not on 
the Company’s payroll and are engaged through contractors. However, the Company ensures that its contractors comply 
with statutory provisions related to worker compensation, including coverage under the Employee Compensation Act, 
as applicable.
2.	
Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory dues have been deducted and deposited by 
the value chain partners. 
	
JKIL places high priority on ensuring that its value chain partners adhere to all applicable statutory requirements. The Company 
requires vendors and contractors to deduct and deposit statutory dues such as Provident Fund (PF), Goods and Services Tax (GST), 
and Employee State Insurance (ESI), as applicable, in a timely and accurate manner. To verify compliance, GST payments made 
by vendors are routinely cross-referenced through the GST portal. In addition, the Company monitors adherence to statutory 
labour compliances, including timely wage disbursement and PF contributions for workers engaged through contractors. These 
expectations are embedded within contractual agreements and are monitored by the commercial and site administration teams 
to ensure compliance throughout the project lifecycle.

standards and statutory requirements. While formal percentage-based assessments have not been quantitatively tracked, the 
Company conducts preliminary health and safety checks during the vendor onboarding process to ensure alignment with its 
compliance expectations. In addition, the Company is in the process of developing a structured vendor evaluation system—both 
online and offline—which will incorporate specific clauses related to health and safety practices and working conditions. This 
initiative is expected to enhance traceability and enable the Company to report vendor assessment coverage in measurable 
terms from the next reporting year onward.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
JKIL identifies its key stakeholder groups through a structured internal assessment process that considers the level of influence, 
impact, and interdependence each group has on the Company’s operations and long-term objectives. The process involves 
inputs from senior management, functional heads, and project teams to map stakeholders based on their relevance to business 
performance, regulatory compliance, and social responsibility. Stakeholders are broadly categorized into internal and external 
groups, including employees, contractors, suppliers, regulatory authorities, local communities, investors, and shareholders. The 
identification process is periodically reviewed to reflect changes in business operations, project geographies, and emerging 
material issues. This approach ensures that the Company remains responsive to the needs and expectations of all relevant 
stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.

1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
JKIL facilitates stakeholder consultation on economic, environmental, and social topics primarily through formal and informal 
communication channels established across departments. While direct consultations between stakeholders and the Board 
are limited, the feedback received from stakeholder groups—including employees, communities, suppliers, contractors, and 
government bodies—is gathered through regular interactions, site-level reviews, community meetings, and audit findings. 
These insights are consolidated by the senior management and functional heads and are then escalated to the Board or its 
relevant committees as part of periodic business reviews, ESG-related reporting, or risk assessments. The Board considers this 
feedback while reviewing strategic decisions, policy revisions, and ESG performance, ensuring that stakeholder perspectives 
are incorporated into high-level decision-making.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity. 
	
Yes. JKIL uses stakeholder consultation as a key input for identifying and managing material environmental and social topics. 
Regular engagements with employees, suppliers, project-affected communities, and regulatory authorities help the Company 
gather practical insights on emerging ESG concerns and operational challenges. For instance, feedback from communities has 
influenced the Company’s CSR focus areas, including local infrastructure support, health awareness drives, and employment-
linked skilling programs. Similarly, interactions with contractors and workers have helped refine health and safety protocols at 
project sites, resulting in stricter implementation of site-level medical facilities, safety training, and hazard control measures. 
These consultations help the Company remain responsive to stakeholder expectations while aligning its sustainability activities 
with practical ground-level needs.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups. 
	
JKIL actively engages with vulnerable and marginalized stakeholder groups, primarily comprising local communities near project 
sites and workers engaged through contractors. Through site-level community meetings and grievance channels, the Company 
receives inputs on issues such as access disruption, environmental concerns, and community well-being. In response, the 
Company has undertaken measures such as scheduling construction work to reduce inconvenience, maintaining clean and safe 
working surroundings, and organizing periodic medical check-ups and safety training for contract workers. Additionally, CSR 
interventions have been directed toward health camps, sanitation, and education support in underprivileged areas, reflecting 
the Company’s commitment to inclusive and responsible project execution. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach 
to understanding and addressing the concerns of marginalized groups connected to its operations.

JKIL monitors air emissions arising from its construction activities in alignment with applicable environmental regulations. While 
the Company does not operate industrial or manufacturing facilities that generate process-based emissions, construction 
activities such as earthworks, vehicular movement, and material handling may contribute to dust and particulate matter (PM) 
emissions. To manage this, the Company consistently collaborates with government-accredited third-party agencies to monitor 
air quality at project sites. These assessments are conducted as per the norms prescribed by local pollution control authorities. 
Based on the findings, the Company implements site-specific environmental control measures, including water sprinkling, 
barricading, use of dust suppression systems, and covering of construction materials. Additionally, efforts are made to use 
energy-efficient and low-emission machinery wherever feasible. This proactive approach ensures compliance with air quality 
standards and reflects the Company’s broader commitment to minimizing its environmental footprint.

8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details. 
	
Yes. JKIL has undertaken multiple environment-friendly projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and overall 
environmental impact during the execution of infrastructure works. These initiatives are implemented across construction sites, 
underground projects, and casting yards and involve the adoption of cleaner technologies, low-carbon materials, and nature-
sensitive practices.
	
A key initiative is the introduction of battery-operated locomotives in underground metro projects. These locomotives replace 
conventional diesel-powered units and are used for segment movement and personnel transport within tunnels. The switch to 
battery-powered machinery in confined underground settings significantly reduces direct GHG emissions, fuel consumption, 
and the build-up of exhaust fumes that affect both workers and air quality.
	
In line with this, the Company has also deployed electric-powered compressors and construction tools at various sites, further 
reducing reliance on fossil fuels. These machines are quieter, emission-free at point-of-use, and contribute to lower Scope 
1 emissions.
	
To reduce embodied carbon in construction, the Company sources low-carbon materials such as fly-ash-based cement substitutes 
from manufacturers like Jaycee Company. These materials are derived from industrial by-products and contribute to the circular 
economy while reducing the carbon footprint of concrete structures.
	
In addition, GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) rebars are being used at specific sites such as the Delhi Metro Project. These 
rebars are manufactured using recycled plastic waste, are lighter than steel, and non-corrosive—making them a sustainable 
alternative for non-structural applications. This practice helps reduce the environmental impact associated with steel production 
while contributing to plastic waste reduction.
	
Another noteworthy initiative includes the use of transparent polycarbonate roofing in casting yards to enhance natural lighting 
during work hours. This reduces the need for artificial lighting during the day, thus improving energy efficiency and lowering 
indirect emissions.

To further minimize air pollution and localized environmental impact, the Company has deployed air quality monitoring systems 
at construction sites. These allow for real-time tracking of pollutants and help initiate prompt mitigation measures. Additionally, 
anti-smog guns and water jet sprinklers are used to suppress dust and improve air quality around active construction zones.
	
In urban and dense work locations, the Company has also increased the height of barricades at construction perimeters. 
This practice helps contain airborne dust and emissions within the site boundary, minimizing the release of particulates into 
surrounding residential or commercial areas.
	
Importantly, JKIL integrates ecological sensitivity into project planning. Rather than cutting trees at project sites, the Company 
has taken the initiative to transplant trees to suitable alternate locations. This effort supports carbon sequestration, biodiversity 
preservation, and community goodwill while aligning with environmental clearance norms.
	
Together, these initiatives demonstrate the Company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, complying with environmental 
standards, and adopting sustainable construction practices that are both technology-driven and ecologically responsible.

Note- JKIL follows a structured and responsible approach to managing waste generated across its construction sites and office 
premises. Construction waste, primarily resulting from land excavation, is initially collected and stored in designated areas at 
the project site. An authorized third-party agency collects this waste every one to two days for safe disposal or repurposing. 
Excavated material is often repurposed for landfilling by the authorized agency, for which the Company also holds a valid 
waste recycling certificate. In addition, concrete waste, including washed cement-sand mixtures, is reclaimed and reused on-
site wherever feasible.
	
The Company also handles steel waste responsibly, with approximately 90% of scrap steel sent to certified scrap dealers for 
recycling. Smaller steel particles that remain on-site may become embedded in the soil. Waste oil generated from machinery 
is collected by registered dealers, who refine and reuse it in processes such as rust prevention for steel components. In terms 
of dry and packaging waste, items such as paper, cardboard, oil cans, and plastics are segregated and handed over to third-
party recyclers.
	
As part of its commitment to improving waste traceability and aligning with evolving sustainability reporting requirements, 
the Company is in the process of implementing a mechanism to record the quantity and type of waste generated at project 
sites. These practices collectively reflect JKIL’s ongoing effort to minimize its environmental impact and promote efficient 
resource utilization.
	
The Purchase Power Parity (PPP) rate used for calculation is 22.4.
	
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) If yes, 
name of the external agency.
	
No. JKIL did not conduct any independent assessment, evaluation, or external assurance of its Business Responsibility and

JKIL adopts systematic waste management practices across its construction sites and offices, as outlined in its Waste Management 
Policy. Construction-related waste such as excavated material, steel scrap, concrete residue, waste oil, and packaging waste is 
segregated at the source and handled responsibly. Excavated earth and debris are stored in designated areas and collected by 
authorized third-party agencies for repurposing, primarily for landfilling. Steel scrap is largely recycled through certified scrap 
dealers, and waste oil is collected and refined by approved vendors for partial reuse, such as in rust prevention processes. Non-
hazardous office waste including paper, plastic, and cardboard is sent for recycling through registered waste handlers. The 
Company is also in the process of instituting site-level mechanisms to quantify and track waste generated in alignment with 
emerging ESG reporting norms.
	
With regard to hazardous and toxic substances, the Company’s operations do not involve manufacturing processes that rely 
heavily on chemical inputs. Nonetheless, in its limited use of fuel, lubricants, and other construction-related materials, the 
Company ensures that all substances are handled in accordance with Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and applicable safety 
norms. Hazardous waste, if any, is stored securely and disposed of through Pollution Control Board-authorized vendors. The 
Company continually works toward minimizing the use of harmful substances by promoting safer alternatives and adhering 
strictly to environmental regulations. These measures are part of JKIL’s broader commitment to sustainable construction and 
environmental stewardship.

is designed to identify potential emergencies, reduce risks, and ensure rapid and coordinated responses to incidents such as 
fire, structural collapse, electrocution, natural disasters, and medical emergencies. Key components of the plan include defined 
emergency roles and responsibilities, internal and external communication protocols, evacuation procedures, availability of first-

the current year, the Company conducts preliminary safety and environmental checks during the vendor onboarding process. 
To strengthen its environmental due diligence, the Company is in the process of developing a structured online/offline vendor 
evaluation system that will incorporate specific clauses related to environmental performance and compliance. This initiative 
is expected to enable accurate measurement and reporting of the percentage of environmentally assessed vendors in future 
reporting periods.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
JKIL acknowledges the importance of maintaining open and responsive communication with the communities impacted by its 
infrastructure development activities. Although the Company does not have a community-specific grievance redressal policy, 
it has integrated mechanisms within its project execution framework to receive and address concerns raised by local residents, 
civic bodies, and affected stakeholders. Community grievances may be raised through multiple informal and formal channels, 
including site-level interactions, engagement with project representatives, written communication to designated contact points, 
and through the public grievance systems of municipal or government authorities supervising the projects. The Company 
maintains a proactive liaison with local administration, ensuring that public concerns particularly those related to construction 
inconvenience, access disruptions, noise, dust, or safety are recorded and addressed in a timely manner. Site-level engineers 
and project managers are responsible for coordinating immediate responses and initiating corrective actions where feasible. 
Escalated concerns are brought to the attention of senior project leadership and resolved in consultation with local authorities. 
This decentralized and responsive structure ensures that community feedback is acknowledged and integrated into on-ground 
decision-making, thereby minimizing conflict and maintaining stakeholder trust throughout the project lifecycle.

(b) 	 From which marginalized /vulnerable groups do you procure?
	
(c)	
What percentage of total procurement (by value) does it constitute?
	
JKIL does not have a formal preferential procurement policy that specifically mandates sourcing from suppliers belonging 
to marginalized or vulnerable groups. However, the Company’s ESG Policy, as published on its official website, outlines 
its commitment to ethical sourcing, inclusive growth, and responsible value chain practices. While this policy reflects the 
organization’s intent to operate equitably and sustainably, it does not explicitly prescribe procurement quotas or preferences for 
social groups based on caste, gender, minority status, or other vulnerability criteria. As such, there is no formal identification or 
tracking system currently in place to classify suppliers under these categories, and the Company does not maintain a specific 
percentage of procurement from such groups. The principle of non-discrimination and equitable opportunity remains embedded 
in the Company’s vendor engagement practices, and the possibility of formalizing a preferential sourcing framework may be 
considered as part of its ongoing ESG integration and value chain transparency initiatives. The ESG Policy is available publicly 
at https://www.jkumar.com/storage/reportFile/policies/ESG%20POLICY_JKIL.pdf

PRINCIPLE 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
JKIL primarily undertakes public infrastructure projects for government and institutional clients and does not operate in the 
conventional consumer product space. However, the Company recognizes the importance of providing structured channels 
for clients, customers, vendors, and other external stakeholders to raise grievances or share feedback. While the Company’s 
Grievance Redressal Policy is applicable to internal stakeholders such as employees, subcontractors, and consultants, the 
Whistleblower Policy extends its applicability to external parties, including clients, customers, vendors, and investors.
	
Under this policy, stakeholders can raise concerns related to unethical behavior, service quality, contractual performance, or 
policy violations through a designated email address or official correspondence. Complaints can be submitted via email to 
grievancecell@jkumar.com or through the contact information provided on the Company's website at https://www.jkumar.
com/contact.
	
Additionally, feedback or concerns may be raised during formal review meetings, progress assessments, or written communication 
through authorized project channels. Once received, grievances are recorded, reviewed by the relevant internal teams, and 
resolved in a time-bound manner, with escalation to senior management where necessary. This mechanism ensures that all 
stakeholder concerns whether contractual, ethical, or operational are addressed systematically and with accountability.

not manufacture or sell consumer products. However, the Company ensures that its engineering designs, 
construction practices, and material usage align with environmental and social standards as prescribed by 
clients, regulatory bodies, and sustainability frameworks applicable to public infrastructure projects.
Safe and responsible usage 
Not Applicable. The Company undertakes construction and development of metro lines, roads, flyovers, 
and related infrastructure for government and public sector clients. These projects are governed by detailed 
specifications and safety norms defined at the tender and execution stages. While no physical products are 
sold to end-consumers, safety and responsible usage are inherently addressed through design compliance, 
site-level safety protocols, and handover documentation to clients.
Recycling and/or safe disposal 
Not Applicable. The Company does not sell products that require end-user disposal. However, it follows 
construction waste management practices that include segregation of recyclable materials, reuse of 
excavated earth where feasible, and disposal of non-recyclable waste through authorized agencies in 
accordance with regulatory norms. While these practices contribute to sustainability, they are not linked to 
a revenue-generating product or service line.

Does the entity have a framework/ policy on cyber security and risks related to data privacy? (Yes/No) If available, 
provide a web-link of the policy. 
	
JKIL has established a comprehensive Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Policy to safeguard its digital infrastructure and sensitive 
information. This policy outlines the measures and practices adopted to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
data across the organization. It forms a central part of the Company’s governance and risk management systems, aiming to 
protect data assets, maintain business continuity, and comply with applicable regulatory frameworks.
	
Key Components of the Policy:
	
Scope and Applicability:
	
The policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, vendors, and third-party service providers who access, manage, or 
process information on behalf of the Company. It governs the use, storage, transmission, and disposal of data in both digital 
and physical forms, ensuring consistent safeguards are implemented across office locations, project sites, cloud platforms, 
and enterprise systems. The policy covers not just internal operations but also interactions with external agencies and clients, 
establishing clear responsibilities and controls to minimize the risk of data breaches or misuse.
	
Data Protection Measures:
	
The Company emphasizes the implementation of robust technical and organizational safeguards to prevent unauthorized 
access, loss, alteration, or disclosure of personal and sensitive information. These measures include the use of firewalls, anti-
malware systems, secure configuration of servers, end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest, and regular data 
backups. Data classification protocols are in place to define handling rules based on sensitivity, and access to critical systems 
is protected using secure authentication layers. These practices are regularly reviewed to adapt to emerging threats and 
technological advancements.
	
Access Controls:
	
To maintain strict data confidentiality, the policy enforces role-based access controls that restrict information access to authorized 
personnel only. Access is granted based on defined job responsibilities and is reviewed periodically to ensure relevance. The 
use of strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, session timeouts, and centralized user management further strengthens 
the system’s resilience. All login activity and user behavior on core systems are logged and monitored to detect anomalies or 
suspicious access attempts. The principle of least privilege is rigorously followed to minimize internal exposure to sensitive data.
	
Incident Response:
	
A formal incident response plan is established under the policy to manage cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and breaches 
in a structured and time-bound manner. In the event of a suspected or confirmed incident, the Company activates its 
response protocol, which includes isolating affected systems, notifying internal stakeholders, initiating root cause analysis, 
and implementing corrective actions. Where applicable, legal obligations such as informing data subjects or regulators are 
fulfilled. Lessons learned from such events are incorporated into updated controls to enhance preparedness and minimize the 
risk of recurrence.
	
Compliance and Monitoring:
	
Regular audits, security assessments, and risk evaluations are carried out to ensure compliance with internal policies, client-
specific standards, and applicable laws such as the Information Technology Act, 2000. Any deviations or weaknesses identified 
during these reviews are addressed through documented corrective and preventive action plans. The Company also keeps 
track of evolving legal requirements and cybersecurity frameworks to ensure the policy remains aligned with best practices. 
Compliance performance is reported to senior management and contributes to the overall governance of operational and 
digital risk.

Training and Awareness:
	
The policy mandates continuous education and awareness programs to equip employees and stakeholders with the knowledge 
needed to uphold data privacy and cybersecurity responsibilities. Regular training sessions cover topics such as phishing 
awareness, secure device handling, information classification, and safe use of public networks. Newly onboarded employees 
are trained during induction, while periodic refresher sessions are conducted across departments. Simulated threat scenarios 
and alerts are also used to test readiness and reinforce behavior. The Company aims to build a culture of cyber accountability 
through informed and vigilant workforce participation.

Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway on issues relating to advertising, and delivery of essential 
services; cyber security and data privacy of customers; re-occurrence of instances of product recalls; penalty / action 
taken by regulatory authorities on safety of products / services.
	
There were no corrective actions that were required during the reporting year as there were no reported issues relating to 
advertising, delivery of services, cyber security, data privacy, or product safety. The Company did not face any instances of 
product recalls or penalties from regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, preventive controls and internal assessments continue to 
be undertaken as part of its risk management framework to ensure compliance and operational continuity.

4.	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. 
	
The above is not applicable as the Company operates in the infrastructure and construction sector, providing engineering, 
procurement, and construction (EPC) services, and does not manufacture or sell consumer-facing products. Hence, product 
labeling requirements do not apply in the conventional sense. However, all project documentation and technical submissions to 
clients are made in accordance with applicable regulatory and contractual norms, including environmental, safety, and quality-
related disclosures.
	
Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, 
significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
No. The Company primarily undertakes government and public sector infrastructure projects, where performance is evaluated 
through structured project milestones, third-party quality audits, and client inspections rather than conventional consumer 
satisfaction surveys. However, client feedback and formal review mechanisms are part of post-completion evaluations and 
ongoing stakeholder engagement.
