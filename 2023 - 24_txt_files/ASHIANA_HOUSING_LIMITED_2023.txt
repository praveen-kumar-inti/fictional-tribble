c.	
A brief on types of customers 
	
	
Considering the location of the project, understanding 
of the micro-market, we expect both, End Users, and 
Investors to buy with us. Following are our Customer 
segments / types: 
	
	
1.	
Customer as End Users: Self-use purpose.
	
	
2.	
Customers as Investor: Asset creation + Rent income. 
	
	
3.	
Customers as Pure Investors: ROI centric investors.
	
	
Right percentage is calculated on the basis of analysis 
of existing customers pool, our experience, and locational 
data available. 
	
	
Learning from the past launches of Ashiana projects in 
different cities, we see high Investor ratio at the time of 
launch and as the project progresses further the End 
User contribution starts increasing. In addition to this 
and based on previous projects’ experience, we get major 
response from our existing customer data base at the 
time of launch through their references in terms of group 
/ individual bookings and their repeat purchase with 
Ashiana as investment.
	
	
Type One Customers - END USERS:
	
	
This type of customer can be further divided into 2 
segments – Existing Customer and New Customer. Being 
a major market player in its niche areas (Kid centric 
homes, Comfort Homes, Senior living), Ashiana enjoys 
strong support from our existing customers and their 
referred customers. 
	
	
Existing Customers involves Tenants and Residents/
Owners from our existing projects. Major considerations 
include the location of our projects, the product positioning 
and the features offered, accessibility/Traffic conditions 
and the city’s expansion due to development in progress, 
customers are attracted from various nearby locations. 
It also attracts customers who are looking for premium 
lifestyle, wants to upgrade their living standard, looking 
for new construction with modern amenities, wants to 
have convenience of connectivity to city and to choose 
forthcoming developing location.
	
	
Type two customers: INVESTOR (Asset creation 
+ Rent income)
	
	
The investors can bring in initial sales velocity at the time 
of launch, it becomes another important segment. This 
involves existing customers/investors, like residents/
owners and Investors from our existing projects. And 
new investors like those who are looking at it for Asset 
Creation + Rent Income. There can be few investors who 
want to invest in real estate as investment towards their 
long-term goals.
	
	
Conclusion: Majority of our customers are from our 
existing customers pool, be it investor or end user.
	
	
Senior Living:	
	
	
We have pioneered concepts like senior living in India. 
Senior living is modelled as CCRC (continuing care 
retirement communities) where care at home and Care 
Homes help residents to get continuous care in case of 
short term or long-term care needs. As a strategy, our 
endeavour is to grow the overall pie of our senior living 
business. Chennai, Pune and Bhiwadi are our senior living 
markets. Following are the key features of Senior Living 
product of our company:
 
 
Someone who is 55+ years of age.
 
 
A working professional from PAN India who need 
to settle in Senior Living community. People retired 
from Government/Private organizations and are 
now living alone.
 
 
Defence, 
Aviation 
and 
Govt. 
Employees 
(Working/Retired)
 
 
Can be an investor or an end-user. Though our 
focus would be end-user, but investors might also 
buy due to good returns SENIOR LIVING space has.

price of that product. EPR legislation is a driving force behind 
the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives because it focuses 
on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and 
has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of 
product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of 
waste materials.
