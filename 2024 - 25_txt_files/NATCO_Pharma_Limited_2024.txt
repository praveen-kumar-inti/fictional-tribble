Water 
management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Opportunity: We are committed to

in pharmaceutical manufacturing, 
serving as a key input in the 
production, formulation, and 
processing of APIs, intermediates, 
and finished products. It is widely

adopting water-saving 
technologies, monitoring water

infrastructure to mitigate 
climate change impacts. 
Our target is to increase RE 
in our energy mix to 35% by 
2035 and achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2050.
Positive: Mitigation of 
climate-related risks and 
associated financial losses.
Negative: Costs associated 
with climate-related 
damages, regulatory 
compliance.

compliance with the standards.
Efforts are directed toward 
minimizing the organic and

with waste disposal, fines 
for non-compliance and 
remediation expenses.

safety of all employees across 
our operations.

by building trust, attracting capital, 
reducing risks, and ensuring long-
term growth.

uphold effective corporate 
governance contributes

Opportunity
Opportunity: Superior product 
quality forms the foundation of 
customer trust. We are committed 
to uncompromising standards of

in our products, ensuring strict 
regulatory compliance while 
exceeding customer expectations. 
Through substantial investments in 
rigorous quality assurance practices, 
we aim to reduce the likelihood 
of product recalls and regulatory 
infractions.
Risk: However, compromising on 
pharmaceutical product quality 
would imply a compromise 
on patients’ overall health and 
wellbeing. This will also entail 
failure to comply with GxP (Good

We follow stringent Good 
Manufacturing Practices 
(GMP) by conducting thorough 
testing of both raw materials 
and final products, ensuring

product quality builds 
customer confidence,

The ‘Code of Conduct for Board Members, Senior Management Personnel and Employees’ policy helps manage or avoid 
conflicts of interest involving members of the Board by requiring them to be scrupulous in avoiding ‘conflicts of interest’ with

circumstances thereof to the Board of Directors or any Committee / Officer nominated for this purpose by the Board and a 
prior written approval should be obtained.

aside from discussions during the decision-making process.

members by formulating clear criteria for identifying persons qualified to become Directors, Key Managerial Personnel, and 
Senior Management, and ensuring that all remuneration is recommended by the independent Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee and approved by the Board. Additionally, the policy prohibits Independent Directors from being associated with the 
company in any other capacity during the cooling-off period between terms, thereby reinforcing objectivity and independence.

1.	 Process Innovation through R&D
	
Our R&D team has successfully developed an alternative synthetic 
route for key intermediate stages of the Apixaban production 
process. A comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was 
conducted on the revised process, which demonstrated a potential

Yes, NATCO Pharma has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System across 
all its operational sites. This system is governed by a comprehensive Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) policy 
and is integrated into the company's core operations. We ensure that adequate resources are allocated to implement 
EHS programs aligned with regulatory requirements and business objectives. EHS goals are embedded into business 
planning, governance, and performance evaluation processes to reinforce a culture of safety. Regular safety trainings, 
mock drills, awareness campaigns, and inspections are conducted across sites. The company continuously monitors 
safety performance, conducts root cause analysis of incidents, and takes preventive and corrective actions to avoid 
recurrence. Most of our manufacturing facilities, including the NATCO Research Centre (NRC), are certified under ISO 
14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. Certification for the Crop Health Sciences unit is currently in progress.
	
b.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
	
	
The entity employs a comprehensive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and 
non-routine bases. Key processes include HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study) for systematic examination of complex 
processes to identify potential hazards, and HIRA (Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment) for evaluating the level of 
risk associated with various tasks. In addition, the organization has established detailed Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs) for all critical operations to ensure consistent safety practices. A robust Work Permit System is also in place to 
control high-risk and non-routine activities such as confined space entry, hot work, and working at heights, ensuring 
all necessary precautions are taken before commencing such tasks. These processes are supported by regular audits, 
inspections, and employee training programs to continuously improve workplace safety.
	
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from 
such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes, we encourage a safety-oriented mindset among workers as a vital part of our occupational health and safety system, 
with a strong commitment to the goal of ‘Zero Injury.’ Workers are regularly engaged through structured training programs, 
toolbox talks, and safety briefings to build awareness, reinforce safe practices, and ensure clarity on safety procedures.
	
	
A comprehensive guidance document is in place to help identify, evaluate, and mitigate Safety, Health, and Environment 
(SH&E) risks. It provides clear instructions on risk assessment methods and outlines the roles and responsibilities of 
workers and supervisors in managing safety for all site activities. Workers are empowered to report any unsafe act, 
condition, or near-miss, and they have the right to step away from tasks they believe pose a serious risk to their 
safety or health. 
	
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? 
(Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes, each operational site is equipped with a fully functional Occupational Health Centre, supported by qualified doctors 
and nurses to monitor and support the overall well-being of our workforce. In addition, we provide comprehensive health 
insurance coverage through our Group Medical Insurance policy and the Employee State Insurance Scheme (ESIC), 
ensuring access to a wide range of medical and healthcare services beyond occupational needs.

Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercises are conducted regularly to identify potential workplace hazards and 
implement appropriate control measures. A strict Permit-to-Work (PTW) system is in place to manage all high-risk operational 
and maintenance activities. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided and mandated for employees and workers based 
on the risk profile of their tasks. 
	
At our manufacturing units, we deploy scrubber systems and other emission control technologies to minimize exposure to 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dust, and odours. To ensure fire safety, we maintain well-functioning fire detection and 
alarm systems, equip our facilities with fire extinguishers, and conduct regular fire drills to enhance emergency preparedness. 
Regular safety surveillance, inspections, and internal audits are carried out to maintain compliance and identify opportunities 
for improvement. We conduct exposure assessments and Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) studies to monitor environmental 
and occupational health risks. 
	
We provide regular health and safety training to all employees and workers and conduct emergency preparedness drills for 
scenarios such as chemical spills and fire incidents. Periodic medical check-ups are conducted by independent agencies,

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and 
social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Consultation with stakeholders is primarily conducted through delegated functional teams across various departments. 
These teams are responsible for engaging directly with specific stakeholder groups such as investors, regulators, suppliers, 
employees, patients, farmers, doctors, trade unions, and local communities through mechanisms tailored to each group (e.g., 
meetings, surveys, email interactions, audits, and community initiatives). Each functional team monitors and captures feedback, 
concerns, and expectations from stakeholders that relate to NATCO’s economic performance, environmental impacts, and social 
responsibility. Feedback gathered during stakeholder engagements is analysed and acted upon When issues with strategic, 
reputational, regulatory, or sustainability implications are identified, they are appraised to senior management. This structured 
process ensures that stakeholder perspectives are effectively integrated into the company’s strategic and operational responses.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on 
these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.

targets, and actions related to environmental and social performance. This approach ensures that stakeholder concerns are 
reflected in the Company’s policies and ongoing sustainability initiatives.

NATCO Pharma is committed to minimizing its carbon footprint and actively pursuing sustainable operational practices. 
As part of this commitment, the organization undertook a comprehensive set of sustainability related projects to enhance 
energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Building on its existing solar and wind energy infrastructure, it expanded 
renewable energy generation through the commissioning of ground-mounted and rooftop solar systems. Cooling and 
refrigeration systems were optimized through refrigerant replacement, equipment upgrades, and centralized chilled water 
distribution. Energy savings were further achieved through process optimization, targeted retrofits and system improvements 
across heating, and de-watering operations. The transition from diesel to pipeline natural gas in boiler operations supported 
cleaner fuel usage, contributing to lower carbon intensity and improved operational sustainability. Through these process 
optimization and strategic equipment upgrades, the organization achieved an estimated energy savings of approximately 
1,054,066 kWh during FY 24-25.
	
During the FY 24-25, our company successfully integrated 25.05% renewable electricity into its total electricity consumption, 
which contributed significantly to lowering our environmental impact, leading to the avoidance of 14582.55 tons of 
CO2 emissions.

facilities, and disposal in TSDFs. Used oil, e-waste, and batteries are sent to licensed recyclers or managed through 
structured buy-back programs.
	
2.	
Non-Hazardous Waste: Combustible waste undergoes pre-processing before co-processing in cement kilns, paper 
waste is sent to ITC for recycling, and metal scrap is handled by authorized recyclers. Plastic waste is managed under 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) initiatives.
	
3.	
Biodegradable Waste: Processed through organic waste converters to produce compost for facility landscaping.
	
4.	
Effluent & Sewage Treatment: ZLD, ETP and STP systems to treat the waste water to meet environmental 
compliance standards.
	
Key Initiatives:
 
 
ETP-treated water has been utilized for boiler feed instead of soft water, eliminating the need for softener plant operation 
and resin regeneration salts. As a result, ATFD salt generation has been reduced by 34% in FY 24-25 compared to the 
previous year, enhancing water conservation and sustainability.

PRINCIPLE 
Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner. 
At Natco Pharma Limited, we place the highest importance on the well-being, safety, and trust of our consumers. As a healthcare 
company, we recognize our critical responsibility to ensure that our products are safe, effective, accessible, and affordable. Our 
engagement with consumers is guided by ethical practices, scientific rigor, regulatory compliance, and a commitment to quality.
We maintain stringent quality control and pharmacovigilance systems to monitor product safety and efficacy throughout their lifecycle. 
Transparent labeling, responsible marketing, and adherence to all applicable regulatory standards are integral to our approach. We 
also ensure that consumers have access to accurate product information and channels to raise concerns or provide feedback.
Our initiatives aim to meet customer expectations for life-threatening and chronic diseases, thereby improving access to essential 
treatments. We are continuously innovating to address unmet medical needs and provide long-term value to our customers in India

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Natco Pharma Limited has established a structured and responsive grievance redressal mechanism to handle consumer 
complaints and feedback with a primary focus on product quality and patient safety. Consumers, healthcare professionals, and 
other stakeholders can lodge queries through multiple channels, including email rarely postal correspondence. Queries can be 
submitted via our dedicated email ID: grievanceredressal@natcopharma.co.in or addressed by post to Natco House, Hyderabad.
	
Upon receipt, the Marketing Department logs the complaint and collects the relevant information and the support document 
from the complainant before logging the complaint. Subsequently, they route it through the Quality Assurance for further 
investigation. Since pharma companies do not market the product directly to the patients, direct surveys are avoided at best. 
Whereas such feedbacks are regularly taken from the Doctors through PSUR. This is a regulatory approved practice.  following 
established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Depending on the nature of the issue, departments such as Regulatory 
Affairs and Product Development may also be involved. Natco also operates a robust Pharmacovigilance system in alignment 
with national and international regulations to monitor and address adverse drug reactions and safety-related concerns.
	
Once investigations are complete, responses and resolution updates are shared with the complainant, and appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are taken to mitigate recurrence. This process ensures continuous improvement in 
product quality and enhances consumer trust.
