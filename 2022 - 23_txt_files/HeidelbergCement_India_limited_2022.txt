A brief on types of customers
The company serves a diverse set of customers as mentioned below:
• 
Dealers: The Company appoints dealers in the markets and sells cement through them. Dealers further sell cement to 
retailers and end consumers. The dealers (wholesalers) sell cement to small retailers who thereafter service the demand 
of retailer customers. Dealers place orders on the warehouse / plant and supplies are made accordingly. The Company 
gives discounts / incentives to the dealers both monetary and in kind which are linked to their targets.
• 
Retailers: The Company appoints retailers in the market to whom dealers sell cement. The retailers operate counters 
(sale outlet) and they service the demand of retail customers in vicinity of their location. Majorly, dealers while placing 
orders on company specify the Retailer rm to whom the cement is to be delivered (Ship-to-party). The Company also 
offers incentive schemes to retailers to promote its products and create brand pull from customers.
• 
As part of its institutional sales (non-trade) strategy company directly sells to customers depending on their order, size 
and location. These customers can be Real Estate developers, Infrastructure companies or government departments 
who consume cement for civil construction activities. Such orders could either be procured directly by company ofcials 
or initiated by commission agents. In either case the billing is done by the company directly to the customers.
• 
In order to support its sales & marketing activities, the Company deploys a team of sales personnel for generating 
business from the dealers and direct customers and gather market information. The Company also deploys customer 
service executives to provide technical guidance to end users. The Company uses various modes of  advertising for 
sales promotion and brand building.

4. Does the entity have an anti-corruption or anti-bribery policy? If yes, provide details in brief and if available, 
provide a web-link to the policy.
 
Heidelberg Materials Group has formulated Anti-Corruption Guidelines and the Company has adopted the same. One of 
the goals of the Heidelberg Materials Group’s compliance programme is to prevent corrupt behaviour by Group 
companies and employees. Sections 2.3-2.5 of the Code of Business Conduct (“Anticorruption”, “Gifts, hospitality and 
benefits”, “Conflicts of interest”) set forth general anticorruption principles. This Guideline is part of the Group 
compliance programme and gives guidance to employees by providing additional details. The Guidelines  apply to all 
companies of  Heidelberg Materials Group. This Guideline not only prohibits corrupt practices punishable under 
relevant penal laws but also addresses conflict of interest issues and prohibits unethical behaviour, even if such conduct 
is not a punishable criminal offence. This approach is based on the principle that it is important to avoid even the 
suggestion that a business or governmental decision might have been influenced by the acceptance or granting of an 
advantage, be it personal or for any third party.
 
The Company has also implemented a Code of Conduct that requires the employees to act with high standards of 
personal and professional ethics, integrity and ensure strict compliance with the applicable laws. You can refer to the 
Code of Conduct - https://www.mycemco.com/sites/default/files/PDF/Policies/Code_of_Conduct.pdf

The Company has made capex investments in Alternate Fuels Project at Narsingarh
 
 
 
 
clinker plant and in captive solar power project at Patheria mines. The AFR project
 
 
 
 
has increased consumption of alternate fuels in Kilns and solar power has reduced
 
 
 
 
the dependency on grid power.
2 a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes / No): Yes
 
 
The Company has systems in place for sustainable sourcing of materials and their transportation. Limestone is the 
primary raw material for manufacturing of cement. The Company uses latest mining techniques to stay cost effective 
in its operations and avoid wastage. The transportation of limestone from Patheria mines to Narsingarh Clinkerisation 
plant is done in a sustainable manner via 21 km long Overland Belt Conveyor (OLBC). Despite being capital intensive, 
OLBC has proven advantage over conventional road transportation when it comes to reducing carbon footprint and 
at the same time it reduces logistics cost. In order to optimize and thereby conserve Limestone, the Company has 
been producing blended cement only, i.e. producing more cement from every ton of clinker it produces. 
Consequently, the life of the mines is also getting extended. With a belief that sustainable transportation is attained 
through less polluting and fuel-efficient transportation mix, most of the inward transported bulk material are by rail.
 
 
The Company has long term agreements with thermal power plants to ensure uninterrupted supply of fly ash. The 
Company ensures maximum consumption of fly ash including wet fly ash, to the extent possible within the 
permissible norms laid down by Bureau of Indian Standards.
 
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
 
 
Yes, for all the major purchases such as coal, petcoke, gypsum, fly ash, sweetener, and equipment spares and 
services, 100% of the inputs are sourced sustainably. The company utilizes the SAP-Ariba platform as the guided 
buying, sourcing, and contracting tool, enabling stakeholders to conduct their sourcing activities digitally. 
Additionally, the company has implemented SAP ERP to ensure a robust procure-to-pay process for all purchases.
3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of 
life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste
 
a. The Company produces cement, which is packed in cement bags. These bags are frequently reused to store other 
construction material.
 
b. Our manufacturing process does not produce any e-waste, however, the e-waste produced in the office operations is 
sold to the registered recyclers.
 
c. The Hazardous waste generated in the cement production process, is sold to the registered recyclers or disposers. 
The incinerable fractions of the hazardous waste are disposed off within the plant kilns itself as per the permissions 
from State Pollution Control Board.
 
d. We are utilising hazardous waste as an alternative fuel and waste / by-products of other industries viz., fly ash, slag, 
pet coke and red mud as raw materials in our cement manufacturing process.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether 
the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
 
Yes. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the Company and followed as per the plan submitted to the 
Pollution Control Board.
 
Cement bags get recycled during use phase multiple times to store various items. In addition, the company disposes off 
much higher quantities of plastic wastes (from other industries and municipalities) as compared to the PP bags used by it 
in cement packaging.
2Efforts made towards Technology Absorption: a. Use of alternative fuels by installation of AFR system. b. Adaptation to best practices and processes of 
Heidelberg Materials Group under WOK / CIP, thus reaping the benefits of their global expertise.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace
 
The Company maintains an unwavering commitment to the safety of its workforce, encouraging employees to diligently 
adhere to health and safety programs and protocols. Each plant is equipped with a designated plant safety officer. While 
rare, process-related hazards may arise during operational periods, often resulting from inadvertent unsafe actions.
 
All manufacturing plants hold ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System certification, 
endorsed by TUV SUD South Asia Private Limited. External safety audits, overseen by TUV auditors, are conducted 
annually, supplemented by semi-annual internal audits. Furthermore, the Head of Safety conducts plant safety 
inspections across all facilities on quarterly basis.
 
For any maintenance work, authorized employees are required to obtain a 'Permit to Work'. It's imperative that all equipment 
guards and protective measures are in place before closing the permit, as overlooking this step could lead to potential hazards.
 
To maintain the safety momentum and awareness throughout the year, the Company has adopted the following health 
and safety initiatives:
 
• A monthly safety gate meeting 
 
• A monthly safety theme and communication
 
• Once-a-four-month plant safety star award programme
 
• Strict adherence to safety cardinal rules 
 
• Safety zone system, hazard identification and risk assessment control measures
 
• Work permits and procedures
 
• Safety inspections and audits 
 
• Fire prevention and protection 
 
• Accident and near-miss incident reporting 
 
• Investigation to determine the root cause & Implementation of safety measures
 
If a near miss or other event occurs at any plant, the incident learnings are shared with all plants so that necessary 
corrective actions can be taken if a similar risky condition exists in any other plant. If any of the plant's safety cardinal rules 
are violated, a warning letter is given to the responsible engineer/manager to modify their behaviour and prevent the 
recurrence of such events.
 
There are "Safety Cardinal Rules" that must be followed by workers and contractors. To ensure the safety of employees, 
contractors and third parties, it is compulsory to wear the following Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) within the plant 
premises and comply with the following Cardinal Rules:
 
• All personal protective equipment (PPE) required for a specific task must be used correctly.
 
• Before performing any task, all equipment’s are separated from intrinsic energy sources and inspected to verify that it 
cannot start or move.
 
• Safeguards must be put in place before the equipment is started or resumed.
 
•  Competent people with work permit signed by the responsible superior could enter confined places.
 
• All workplace issues are reported and examined to determine the root cause and implement corrective actions and 
lessons learnt.
 
• All drivers must follow driving norms in strict compliance with local laws and company regulations.
 
Further Health & Safety requirements are laid down in the Company’s Group guidelines and local documents are 
available at the plant which are reviewed and revised. Non-compliance with these rules is viewed seriously in all plants.
 
The Company conducts its business in a way that cause no harm to the people with whom they work with, and 
endeavours to establish a healthy and safe working.

7. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases
 
In order to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases, the company has 
established mechanisms aimed at ensuring a fair and unbiased resolution process. One such mechanism is the 
inclusion of external members in the decision-making committee. These external members bring an objective unbiased 
perspective and help maintain the integrity of the proceedings. 
 
In cases where the complaint remains unresolved by the internal POSH committee, the option of litigation is available. 
This serves as an additional safeguard to protect the rights and well-being of the complainant. Litigation provides a 
formal avenue for seeking legal remedies and addressing any adverse consequences that may have resulted from the 
discrimination or harassment.
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-23  |  89
 
By incorporating external members, the company demonstrates its commitment to address discrimination and 
harassment cases thoroughly and transparently. These measures are designed to ensure that the complainant is duly 
supported and protected against victimisation. 
 
To deal with issues other than Sexual Harassment incidents, Heidelberg Materials Group has established a compliance 
hotline known as “SpeakUp” which can be used by any employee / vendor of any of the subsidiaries of Heidelberg Materials 
group to anonymously report compliance incidents. In line with the group policy, HCIL has also extended this facility to its 
employees / vendors for reporting compliance incidents. This platform ensures that all complaints are heard, recorded and 
registered with the compliance officer for appropriate action and simultaneously ensuring fairness and confidentiality are 
maintained. It helps in improving confidence of concerned stakeholders in the organisation and also has a deterrent effect.
8. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes / No)
 
Yes, the Company mandates its suppliers, contractors, and business associates to ensure that they adhere to human 
rights best practices.

4. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
 
Yes. 
 
Cement Manufacturing is a dry process thus there is no direct utilization of water in manufacturing process. Water is only 
used for industrial cooling purposes. The company is committed to minimise the impact of business operations on 
natural water resources through the zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) pledge.
 
The Company has embraced a sustainable approach by incorporating waste materials from other industries, including 
blast furnace slag and fly ash, as inputs in the cement manufacturing process. This conscious decision plays a vital role in 
reducing our dependence on naturally sourced resources and fosters material circularity by repurposing and reusing 
industrial waste effectively.

7. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
 
Yes. 
 
Energy management lies at the heart of HCIL's sustainability strategy. The Company strives to reduce its reliance on 
fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources. This Commitment is crucial in minimizing greenhouse gas 
emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices. The Company aims to lower air pollutants below average 
emissions prescribed for the cement industry.
 
Further, to mitigate climate impact on operations, the Company has implemented a wide range of initiatives and focuses 
on reduction in emission and adoption of renewable energy. The Company has significantly increased its renewable 
energy footprint by incorporating solar energy and biomass-based fuels in its operations to mitigate climate impact. 
Additionally, the plant is equipped with a waste heat recovery system, allowing the company to recover and utilize a 
significant portion of energy demand. Dedicated plant teams continuously monitor and work to reduce energy 
consumption and emissions by implementing strategic interventions such as incorporating conveyor belts in the supply 
chain and retrofitting existing equipment and machinery.
 
The company commissioned a 5.5 Mega Watt (MW) Solar Power Plant situated in its mining area at Damoh, Madhya 
Pradesh. This development has enabled the mining operations and clinker plant to receive a reliable supply of electricity. 
With an estimated annual generation of 10 Gigawatt hours, the solar plant serves as a sustainable alternative to the 
electricity previously procured through short term open access and from the grid. This initiative aligns with the 
company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.
 
Replacement of fossil fuels with alternative fuels (AFs) in clinker production has led to reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions leading to significant expansion of renewable energy footprint. In line with these goals, AFs were introduced in 
Narsingarh Line 3, initially using biomass from nearby areas. The system handles up to 15t/h of AF, including biomass, 
RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel), and combustible components of Municipal Solid Waste. This initiative underscores the 
company's commitment to sustainable practices and innovative energy sourcing.

9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
The Company is aligned with the concept of the circular economy and prioritizes waste management by embedding 
circularity throughout its production processes, including storage, usage, reuse, recycling, and disposal of waste 
generated at its facilities.
 
The Company strives to replace hazardous and toxic chemicals in or products with eco-friendly alternatives. The Company 
utilizes waste materials from other industries, such as blast furnace slag and fly ash, as input materials for cement 
manufacturing, effectively reducing the reliance on naturally extracted resources and promoting material circularity.
 
Various types of hazardous and non-hazardous waste are generated at the company's different plants, including used 
oil, biomedical waste, E-waste, and battery waste. The company has implemented appropriate infrastructure at each site 
to safely handle, collect, and store the different types of waste until they are sold to registered Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) / State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) vendors and recyclers.
 
At the plant level, waste generated at the site is collected through color-coded collection bins. Instead, the company sells 
its waste to outsourced vendors responsible for the end-to-end handling of the transported waste.
