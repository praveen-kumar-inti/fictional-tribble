locations for reporting any concerns.
We have initiated systems to ensure fast redressal of queries within a specified duration from the receipt of the complaint. If the complaint remains unresolved, it will be escalated to the respective 
local point of contact. The contact details of the officers are available with the concerned departments at each unit. If stakeholders are not satisfied with the response received from the local point 
of contact, then the grievance can be escalated to the Concerned Unit Heads or Department Heads. In cases where the complaint is still unresolved, the stakeholder can write directly to our Senior 
Management explaining the details of the issue concerned. In the reporting year, no concerns were raised by any stakeholder that could be regarded as critical in nature.
