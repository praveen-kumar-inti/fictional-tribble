Provide 
the 
processes 
for 
consultation 
between 
stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, 
and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is 
feedback from such consultations provided to the Board. 
	
HPCL has instituted a governance structure to focus 
on embedding the ESG aspects within our strategy, 
organisational culture and business verticals. The Board 
has 
constituted 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability Development (CSR&SD) Committee, headed 
by an Independent Director. The subcommittee defines 
the sustainability vision, reviews the sustainability strategy, 
provides leadership and direction by periodic review of 
progress and performance across identified focus areas in 
sustainability and reporting. During the process, regular 
feedback is taken from the Committee of Functional 
Directors (CFD), Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Heads and 
other officers concerned. Accordingly, scanning of the risk 
and opportunity is carried out and a sustainability strategy 
across the businesses has been put in place. 
	
The Corporate HSE Department formally carries out the 
process of material topics identification, reporting on 
identified material topics, review and approval of Sustainability 
Report. During the process, regular feedback is taken from 
the Committee of Functional Directors (CFD), Strategic 
Business Unit (SBU) Heads and other officers concerned. 
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the 
identification and management of environmental, and 
social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances 
as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these 
topics were incorporated into policies and activities of 
the entity. 
	
Yes, HPCL extensively uses stakeholder consultation to 
identify areas of improvement in environmental and social 
topics. Many of the company’s major decisions are influenced 
as a result of outcomes of stakeholder engagement.
	
Eg: In the recent years, in line with the directives of the 
Government, HPCL has migrated its supply chain (refineries 
and marketing infrastructure) to produce and market BS VI 
fuels from BS IV, which lead to pollution reduction. Further, 
HPCL is also focussed on augmenting the biofuel (ethanol, 
biodiesel and CBG) supply chain which is a major step in 
reducing GHG emission and combatting climate change. 
Many of these changes are driven by government policies 
who is a major stakeholder of HPCL.
	
While undertaking CSR projects under the specified focus 
areas, HPCL undertakes consultation with concerned 
stakeholders 
of 
the 
community/ 
local 
authorities/ 
representative bodies to tailor programs/ projects to 
address their needs.
	
Being in an oil and gas industry, GHG emissions and climate 
change have been identified as a material topic year on year by 
HPCL’s internal and external stakeholders which include own 
employees, administrative ministry, investment community 
through proxy advisors. Hence, focus on GHG is included in 
the company’s sustainable development policy. HPCL officers 
regularly consult with the administrative ministry (MoP&NG), 
obtain guidance and appraise them of HPCL’s progress on 
its Net Zero Strategy. Having identified GHG emissions and 
climate change through stakeholder consultation, HPCL also 
transparently discloses its initiatives and performance on the 
topic in public domain through its disclosures.
3.	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and 
actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ 
marginalized stakeholder groups.
	
HPCL interacts with communities through its CSR department 
and project implementation partners. Issues identified during 
these interactions are prioritised and put up for review 
of management. As an outcome of these engagements, 
Initiatives have been undertaken for the empowerment, 
upliftment and overall development of communities and 
society at large. 
	
HPCL 
has 
identified 
disadvantaged, 
vulnerable 
and 
marginalised stakeholders. Various activities / programs 
/ initiatives have been undertaken for the welfare of these 
stakeholders to bring about holistic and sustainable 
development. The Corporation undertakes CSR projects 
/ activities for the welfare of SC, ST, OBC and other weaker 
sections. In addition, initiatives have also been undertaken for 
the welfare of communities in Aspirational districts identified 
by NITI Aayog. 
	
The details of CSR activities undertaken by HPCL are provided 
in the CSR Section of the Annual report.
	
Some of these are: Sustainable livelihood program for 
women; Providing facilities in schools and villages; Supporting

through Swachhata Pakhwada, Academic, material and 
social support to girl children from backward and tribal 
areas; Project Kashmir Super-50 (Medical), Distribution

underprivileged backgrounds, conservation and restoration 
of marine ecosystems.
	
Various steps taken by Govt. through different policies 
related to public procurement for development of domestic 
vendors are being followed by HPCL in order to strengthen 
the manufacturing sector. In order to promote and enhance 
procurement from SC/ST MSEs and Women MSEs, dedicated 
VDPs and workshops are organised to increase their 
participation in HPCL tenders. Also, HPCL took the initiative 
to conduct Entrepreneur Development Programmes in the 
past for development of SC/ST Entrepreneurs including 
handholding them through procurement process. A certain 
percentage is earmarked for procurement from SC/ST and 
women entrepreneurs from the overall procurement of 
Goods and Services.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
	
Yes
	
HPCL refineries and major marketing locations employ ETP/ STPs for recycling effluent. Refineries having greater water consumption 
within HPCL installations, both of our refineries are focused on wastewater recycling, water efficiency and rainwater harvesting with 
an endeavour to achieve Zero Liquid discharge at all locations. Both refineries' discharges are monitored for quality parameters. 
Visakh Refinery has installed an Integrated Effluent treatment Plant. At Mumbai Refinery, ~ 75% of effluent water is recycled back to 
process from effluent treatment plant after primary, Secondary and Tertiary Treatment.  Mumbai Refinery has recently tied up with 
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation for sourcing sewage water and processing for reuse which helps in reducing water foot print.
