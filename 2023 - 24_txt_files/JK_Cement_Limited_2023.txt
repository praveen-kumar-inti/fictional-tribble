8.	
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
Cement, an indispensable material for construction, plays a pivotal role in the development of emerging markets 
worldwide. However, the cement industry is also a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions, accounting 
for about 7% of the total and standing as the second-largest industrial emitter after the iron and steel sector. 
Cement production is an energy-intensive process and hard to abate sector for the reduction of GHG emission 
that consumes both thermal and electrical energy.
	
The major source of emission is through primary raw material, limestone, which generates greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions during heating, (known as process emissions). The Process emissions account for approximately 60% 
of total emissions, while power and fuel contribute 10% and 30%, respectively.
	
JK Cement Ltd. (JKCL) has identified four major strategies to reduce its carbon footprint:
	
1.	
Integrations of advanced technologies and practices to enhance energy efficiency.
	
2.	
Transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives such as AFR
	
3.	
Increasing the use of renewable energy and waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) to reduce reliance on 
fossil power.
	
4.	
Lowering the proportion of clinker in cement by producing more blended cement.
	
JKCL has near-term targets aligned with the well-below 1.5-degree celsius scenario, which was validated by the 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in August 2023. The company aims to reduce GHG emissions (Scope 1 
and Scope 2) by 21.7% from FY 2019-20 to FY 2029-30 through various decarbonisation measures. The action 
plan includes increasing the share of green power mix (renewable energy and WHRS) to 75%, reducing the clinker 
factor to 65%, and raising the thermal substitution rate (TSR) to 35% by partially replacing kiln fossil fuel with 
biomass and alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR).
	
Over the years, JKCL has undertaken numerous initiatives to adopt clean and green technologies. The company 
has consistently integrated the best available technologies in the market to enhance energy efficiency and 
reduce its environmental impact.
