 In recent years, Bodal has transitioned from importing most materials from China to sourcing about 90% 
locally in Gujarat, building a robust local supply chain. This has cut Bodal’s carbon footprint by reducing 
transportation needs, economically empowered the community, and enabled closer oversight to ensure 
suppliers follow ethical, eco-conscious practices.
a. 
 Plastics (including packaging) - Bodal has registered under the Extended Producer Responsibility 
programme for managing plastic waste generated from operations and packaging. The Company aims to 
maximise the reuse and recycling of plastic waste, reducing the quantities requiring disposal. For instance, 
plastic bags and containers received from raw material suppliers are returned for reuse, avoiding the need 
for new bags and saving resources. Additionally, used bags are leveraged for solid waste packing to extend 
their lifecycle. Such initiatives showcase Bodal’s commitment to responsible plastic waste
b. 
 Hazardous waste - Bodal continuously works to minimise hazardous waste generation over time. Rather 
than landfill disposal, solid hazardous waste is increasingly sent to authorised actual users, promoting a 
circular economy. For example, chemical gypsum is sent to cement units for co-processing, and spent acids 
are reused or sent to legitimate downstream users. Such initiatives showcase the Company’s commitment 
to responsible hazardous waste management.
c. 
 E-waste: E-waste from Bodal is safely collected onsite and then transported to authorised facilities 
specialising in recycling and responsible disposal, minimising environmental impact.
Bodal has registered under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programme for plastic waste, demonstrating 
its commitment to managing plastic packaging in an environmentally responsible way.

Yes. Any concerns received through email, letter, or other means are logged and reviewed by the 
ombudsperson for validity. Complaints that require further inquiry are assigned to an internal or 
external investigator. The investigator gathers information, analyses data, and documents observations 
and recommendations in an investigation report. The ombudsperson reviews this report and may refer 
serious matters, along with proposed actions, to the Audit Committee. For extremely serious cases, the 
Audit Committee can further escalate to the Board with recommendations. The Board then decides on

 Do you have a focal point (Individual/Committee) responsible for addressing human 
rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
5. 
 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights 
issues.
 
 Bodal has put in place a robust governance mechanism, wherein location heads report to the CMD to address 
human rights grievances. This mechanism enables a transparent review and resolution process for addressing 
any concerns related to human rights.
 
 Bodal has implemented a multi-step grievance redressal mechanism to investigate any human rights concerns 
raised by stakeholders. Upon receiving a complaint through email, letter, or other means, it is recorded and 
evaluated. Valid complaints that require further investigation are handled by an authorised ombudsman. This 
individual gathers information, conducts data analysis, and documents observations and recommendations. A 
thorough, unbiased investigation is conducted before findings are submitted, and recommended actions are 
implemented, recorded, and reviewed by senior management and the Audit Committee for closure.

 Bodal operates a 1.73 MW power plant at its Dudhwada, Padara facility, which utilises steam generated as a 
by-product  of sulfuric acid production. This allows the plant to reduce coal consumption by using available 
steam in its production processes. Additionally, the Company plans to commission another captive power plant 
at its Sayakha location. These initiatives exemplify Bodal’s efforts to improve energy efficiency and minimise 
environmental impact through co-generation and by-product  reuse.

 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe 
the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in 
your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
 
 Bodal ensures responsible waste management through recycling and safe disposal across locations as per 
Government regulations. The Company’s chemical manufacturing inherently involves some hazardous 
materials. It maintains robust handling practices and complies with all applicable laws for the storage and use 
of hazardous chemicals.  
 
 Hazardous waste generated from wastewater treatment and air emission control facilities is collected, stored, 
and transported to authorised disposal facilities or co-processing units through the online manifest system. 
Bodal maximises the utilisation of liquid hazardous waste internally, sending any surplus to actual users as per 
Rule-9 protocols.
 
 Bodal continuously improves its processes to reduce hazardous material consumption and waste generation 
through enhanced raw material conversion, learning from past experiences. For instance, the Company 
neutralises acidic effluent onsite using hydrated lime to produce gypsum for cement industry use, reducing 
effluent load. The aim is to improve resource efficiency and minimise waste.
