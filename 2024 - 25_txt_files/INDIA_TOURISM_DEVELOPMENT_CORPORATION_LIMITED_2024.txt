INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To
The Members of India Tourism 
Development Corporation Limited
Report on the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the Standalone 
financial statements of India Tourism 
Development 
Corporation 
Limited 
(“the Company”) which comprise the 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
Other 
Comprehensive 
Income), 
Statement of Changes in Equity and 
Statement of Cash Flows for the year 
then ended and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Standalone Financial 
Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our 
information and according to the 
explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone 
Financial 
Statements 
give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting 
Standards 
prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with 
the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, 
(“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, 
of the state of affairs (financial position) 
of the Company as at March 31, 2025, 
and its profit (financial performance 
including 
other 
comprehensive 
income), changes in equity and its 
cash flows for the year ended on that 
date except for the possible effects of 
the matters described in the Basis for 
Qualified Opinion section of our report.
Basis for Qualified Opinion 
A.	 MSMED Act Compliances:
As per the information provided to us, 
the Company has identified suppliers 
registered under the MSMED Act, 
2006, by obtaining confirmation from 
suppliers and information has been 
collated to the extent of information 
received. 
In the absence of the requisite audit 
evidence, we are unable to determine 
the delay in making payment to 
MSME entities, liability of interest and 
compliance on such delayed payments 
in terms of provisions of MSMED Act 
(Refer point No. 31 of Note No. 39 of 
the Standalone Financial Statements).
B.	 Revenue from License fee
The Company has not generated 
invoices for license fees on licensees 
of units, viz. Ashok Hotel, Samrat Hotel 
& Taj Restaurant (units of ITDC) to the 
tune of Rs. 1292.59 lakhs during the 
year 2020-21 on account of Covid-19 
pandemic, and hence not considered 
in Books of Accounts. The matter is still 
under consideration before the board 
of Directors of ITDC. Thus, the sale of 
services from license fees and trade 
receivables of the Company continued 
to be understated to this extent. 
(Refer Point no. 11 of Note 39 to the 
Standalone Financial Statements). 
C.	 Ashok Travels and Tours (ATT) 
Delhi
1.	 ATT had entered into a General 
Sales 
Agent 
(GSA) 
agreement 
with M/s Shree Plan Your Journey 
Pvt. Ltd. (SPYJ) in September 
2019 for marketing of its travel-
related business. Upon expiry of 
this agreement, SPYJ was again 
appointed as GSA through a fresh 
open tender process dated October 
21, 2024. As per management, the 
terms and conditions of the new 
agreement are to be considered 
independently from the earlier 
arrangement. In respect of the GSA 
agreement dated September 2019, 
we observed the following points:
I.	
After the initial deposit of 
security of `300.00 lakh. The 
said amount was required to be 
increased additionally through 
the deposit of funds as and 
when required based on the 
business. As per the agreement, 
the evaluation is to be made 
by the Company on a monthly 
basis, and in case of its non-
compliance, the issue of all 
travel-related services would be 
stopped till funds are received. 
	
However, 
as 
at 
March 
31, 
2025, total amount receivable 
from the business conducted 
through the GSA amounts to 
`5,238.96 lakh, whereas, ATT 
has kept on ‘HOLD’ only an 
amount of `1,579.82 lakh in 
the form of security deposit, 
bank guarantee, commission 
and other services payable to 
cover the outstanding limit. 
Hence, there is a deficit which 
is not in consonance with the 
terms of the agreement (dated 
September, 2019) and directive 
of the Board.
II.	 We 
observe 
that 
various 
conditions of the agreement 
with SPYJ were not complied 
&/or not enforced like credit 
limit, reconciliation, monthly 
evaluation, 
additional 
Bank 
Guarantee (BG) etc. Despite 
raising 
the 
issues 
in 
the 
previous years and also in 
the current year. There is 
periodical reconciliation of PLB 
from 
Airlines, 
identification 
of unlinked receipts, credit 
note 
delays, 
settlement 
of 
commission bills after receiving 
full payment from SPYJ clients, 
compliance of SoP etc. Separate
