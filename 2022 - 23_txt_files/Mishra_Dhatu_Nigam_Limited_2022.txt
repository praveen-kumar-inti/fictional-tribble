Statement by director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements: 
	
In the ever-evolving landscape of sustainability, businesses 
are witnessing new trends driven by initiatives that translate 
the philosophy of sustainability into tangible actions, 
impacting both companies and their stakeholders. The 
post-pandemic era has seen a global acceleration towards 
embracing sustainability.
	
MIDHANI -  a renowned manufacturer of Alloys and 
Special Metals with a five-decade legacy, has consistently 
exemplified its commitment to sustainability by judiciously 
utilizing resources. The environmental footprint at MIDHANI 
is limited due to lack of mass commercial scale production. 
The primary focus of MIDHANI is catering to the nation's 
strategic and critical requirements.
	
One of the MIDHANI's noteworthy accomplishments is its 
low impact on the environment. The company's processes 
do not result into greenhouse gas emissions, and its water 
consumption intensity per rupee of turnover remains 
negligible.
	
Beyond environmental stewardship, MIDHANI has always 
recognized its social responsibility, even before it became a 
mandate under the Companies Act of 2013. The company's 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects revolve around 
education, health, and wellness, with a sincere desire to 
upskill and educate communities. MIDHANI actively engages 
its employees in CSR volunteering activities, providing them 
with a platform to interact with local communities, fostering a 
sense of purpose and satisfaction.
	
As a Government-owned company, MIDHANI's operations 
undergo rigorous scrutiny from esteemed authorities 
such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the 
Administrative Ministry i.e. Ministry of Defence, the Central 
Vigilance Commission etc. This ensures transparency 
and accountability and integrity, further reinforcing their 
commitment to good governance.
	
MIDHANI's aim is to be a harbinger of positive change 
and impact, building upon their past achievements. With a 
resolute dedication to sustainability, MIDHANI continues its 
journey towards making sustainable choice.
