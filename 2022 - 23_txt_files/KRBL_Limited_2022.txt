1.
Product 
Quality and 
Safety
R
KRBL Limited operates in the food and agriculture sector. Product quality and 
safety are material ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risks that the 
Company addresses regularly because of the following reasons:
	• Consumer Health and Safety: Consumer health and safety are core ethical 
values for our business. The Company’s products are consumed by individuals 
worldwide, and it remains steadfast in its dedication to delivering products 
that consistently uphold rigorous standards of quality and safety.
	• Supply Chain Risks: KRBL Limited procures paddy from the APMC Mandis, 
and any issues related to the quality of the paddy & rice procured can 
impact the quality of the final product. Thus ensuring that the Company 
continues to source rice from suppliers based on superior grain quality is 
important.
	• Reputation: KRBL Limited’s reputation is critical to its success, and any 
adverse news related to the quality and safety of its products can affect 
its brand reputation, which can have long-term negative effects on the 
business. As a company that exports its products worldwide, KRBL Limited 
ensures that it meets international quality and safety standards to maintain 
its reputation as a premium Basmati rice-brand.
In order to meet product quality 
and safety requirements, the 
company has ensured compliance 
with various certifications 
standards: some of them are:
	•
FSSC 22000 issued by Eurofins
	•
Halal Certification issued by Halal 
Certification Services India Pvt Ltd.
	•
SQF Food Safety Code for 
Manufacturing Edition 9, issued 
by Eurofins

BRC Certification issued by

performance and boost consumer confidence. This has been categorized

	• Reputation and Brand Value: By ensuring that its business practices are 
transparent, ethical, and compliant with local and international laws and 
regulations, KRBL Limited is able to enhance its reputation and brand 
value, which would lead to increased customer loyalty and trust.
	• Competitive Advantage: Companies that prioritize ethics and governance 
in their business practices are more likely to gain a competitive 
advantage, as they are better positioned to attract investors, customers, 
and employees who prioritize ethical and sustainable business practices.

3.
Responsible 
Marketing 
and Com-
munication
O

influences consumer decisions. This issue has been categorized as an 
opportunity because of the following reasons:
	• Consumer Trust: By adopting responsible marketing and communication 
practices, KRBL Limited is able to build trust with consumers, leading 
to increased loyalty and repeat purchases. Consumers are increasingly 
conscious of the impact of their purchasing decisions on the environment 
and society, and companies that prioritize responsible marketing and 
communication can attract and retain these consumers.
	• Reputation and Brand Value: By communicating transparently and 
responsibly about its products and business practices, KRBL Limited 
enhances its reputation and brand value, leading to increased customer 
loyalty, investor confidence, and stakeholder trust.
	• Social 
and 
Environmental 
Impact: 
Responsible 
marketing 
and

society and the environment, such as its efforts to promote sustainable 
agriculture practices and support local farmers. This can enhance its 
social license to operate and attract socially responsible investors.

Health, 
Safety and 
Well-Being
R
KRBL Limited ensures highest level of health and safety  through its 
production process by identifying Health, Safety and Well-Being as a key 
material risk for the following reasons:
	• Employee Well-being: KRBL Limited’s employees are its most valuable 
asset, and their well-being is crucial to the company’s success. A safe 
and healthy work environment will lead to decreased employee turnover, 
increased productivity, and enhanced brand reputation.
	• Occupational Health and Safety: KRBL Limited’s operations involve 
various risks such as machinery hazards, chemical exposure, and 
physical strain.
	• Supply Chain Risks: KRBL Limited sources its raw materials from various 
suppliers, and proper health and safety practices  across their operations 
would lead to decreased risks of supply chain disruptions, product 
recalls, and legal liabilities.
	• Community Health and Safety: KRBL Limited’s production processes 
can also have an impact on the health and safety of the surrounding 
communities. 
	• Regulatory Compliance: Non-compliance with health and safety 
regulations can result in legal and financial liabilities for KRBL Limited, 
leading to reputational damage and financial losses.
In conclusion, health, safety, and well-being can be seen as a material 
ESG risk for KRBL Limited, leading to potential risks such as occupational 
hazards, community health risks, employee well-being, supply chain risks, 
and legal and financial liabilities. By prioritizing health, safety, and well-
being in its operations and supply chain, KRBL mitigates these risks and 
ensures the sustainability of its business.
We have undertaken the following 
risk mitigation measures:
	•
KRBL Limited has in place a 
Standard Operating Procedure 
for Operational Rescue Measure 
to ensure business continuity 
and the safety of employees
	•

Emissions
R
Emissions have been categorized as a risk since KRBL Limited’s operations 
involve various emissions such as greenhouse gases, particulate matter, 
and volatile organic compounds, which can have adverse effects on the 
environment and public health. The company also relies on fossil fuels 
for energy generation, which can contribute to climate change. Failure to 
address emissions can lead to adverse living conditions for society and 
accelerated climate-change. Addressing emission concerns timely helps 
us stay ahead of increased regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, and 
financial losses.
	•
The Company uses rice-husk as a 
primary fuel to power its boilers. 
Hence reducing its dependence 
on traditional fossil fuel and grid 
electricity which has a lower 
energy to emission ratio in 
comparison to rice-husk. 
	•
The 
plants 
are 
strategically 
located near the paddy producing 
markets 
thus 
optimising 
transportation related emissions.
	•
Our Gujarat plant which caters 
to the overseas markets is 
strategically located close to 
the port further optimizing our 
downstream emissions. 
	•
Highly efficient ESP chimneys are 
installed across manufacturing 
units and are cleaned properly by 
trained staff
	•
DG stack emission testing is 
conducted regularly
	•
Masks are provided to workers

weather patterns, conserving resources, and reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. Failure to adopt climate resilient agriculture practices can lead 
to decreased crop yields, increased production costs, and reputational

Procedures (SOP) for Customer Complaint Management and Operational Rescue Measures, KRBL 
Limited is taking all necessary steps to ascertain enhanced performance across the Environment, 
Social and Governance parameters.
As regards performance with respect to NGRBC’s 9 principles, the company ensures the following:
	• Emphasizing the significance of corporate governance, the company conducts regular training 
sessions for both senior management and employees on topics such as Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH), as well as updates and matters concerning regulations. Senior and Key 
Management Personnel also receive training on subjects like insider trading. The company upholds

conducted a materiality assessment to ensure that the topics deemed important by the Company 
also incorporate valuable insights from stakeholders.

KRBL Limited has partnered with a Producer Responsibility Organisation

generated, collected, and processed, as well as the method of disposal.
KRBL Limited then files this EPR data with the Central Pollution Control Board 
(CPCB), which is the regulatory body responsible for enforcing the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016. By filing this data, the Company is demonstrating 
its compliance with the rules and its commitment to environmental protection.

Flexible Plastic (1052 MT), and Category 3 MLP Plastic (570 MT). KRBL Limited has partnered with Ecoex for facilitation of credit

Going forward, the Company has ambitious plans to increase the use of recycled plastic in a host of product packaging, as part of its 
broader commitment to contributing to SDG – 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15. The organization aims to create a more sustainable and equitable
