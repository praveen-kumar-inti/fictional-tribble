vulnerability
Risk
The Company’s revenue streams are closely 
linked to capital expenditures in the solar 
and hybrid energy sector, primarily driven 
by Independent Power Producers (IPPs) 
and Captive Power Producers (CPPs). 
Consequently, ﬂuctuations in the capital 
expenditure 
cycle—such 
as 
reduced 
investments or delayed decision-making 
by IPPs or CPPs—could adversely impact 
the Company’s ﬁnancial performance.
By strengthening customer 
relationships, building 
long-term partnerships,

services, the Company aims 
to foster customer loyalty
