Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of Employees and 
Workers? If yes, give details of the mechanism in brief.
Yes/No (If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
The company has established a Grievance Redressal Policy to address any conflicts or 
complaints, emphasizing a corrective action approach. According to this policy, upon 
receiving a Protected Disclosure, the Chairman of the Audit Committee forwards it to 
the Vigilance Officer for necessary action. The Vigilance Officer conducts a preliminary 
investigation to determine the authenticity of the disclosure. If the Vigilance Officer 
finds the disclosure genuine, they proceed with a thorough investigation. However, if 
they find it otherwise, they may dispose of the complaint with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee's permission, without further investigation.
The Vigilance Officer conducts the investigation themselves or involves another 
company officer, a designated committee, or an external agency. The investigation is 
to be completed within 60 days of receiving the complaint, with the option to seek an 
extension from the Chairman of the Audit Committee if necessary. The findings of the 
investigation are then submitted to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee may request additional information from the complainant if deemed 
necessary and may involve other company officers, committees, or external agencies in 
the investigation process at its discretion. It's important to note that the investigation is a 
neutral fact-finding process and does not imply any accusation.
If the investigation concludes that an improper or unethical act has occurred, the Audit 
Committee will recommend appropriate disciplinary or corrective action to the Board of 
Directors.
