1
Management 
of Chemicals in 
Products
Risk
The Company’s textile operations 
involve finishing fabrics such as cotton, 
blends, linen, viscose, and Lycra, which 
require the use of dyes, bleaches, 
softeners, and other chemicals. Some of 
these substances are strictly regulated 
due to potential impacts on human 
health and the environment, including 
carcinogenic effects or hormone 
disruption. Exceeding permissible limits 
can result in non-compliance, recalls, 
litigation, reputational damage, and loss 
of market access. 
The Company addresses risks from 
regulated chemicals in textile finishing by 
adhering to globally recognized standards 
such as OEKO-TEX Standard 100, GOTS, 
OCS, and GRS, ensuring that dyes, 
bleaches, and softeners meet stringent 
health and environmental requirements. 
It emphasizes the use of eco-friendly and 
certified chemicals, supported by robust 
testing and quality assurance through 
NABL-accredited labs. Safe storage, 
handling, and disposal practices are 
enforced, alongside employee training on 
chemical safety. 
Negative.
*There has been 
no negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of FY 
2024-25.
2
Environmental 
Impact and waste 
management 
Risk
The Company’s textile operations 
involve processes such as dyeing, 
bleaching, and finishing, which are 
water-intensive and can contribute 
to water and air pollution if not 
managed responsibly. In addition, 
these operations generate solid and 
hazardous waste that requires proper 
handling and disposal to prevent 
environmental harm. Discharge of 
untreated effluents, emissions from 
in-house manufacturing activities, and 
improper waste management can result 
in significant environmental damage, 
regulatory penalties, reputational loss, 
and operational restrictions. These 
risks are heightened by evolving 
environmental regulations and 
growing stakeholder expectations 
for sustainable operations within the 
Company’s own facilities. Strengthening 
environmental management systems, 
investing in cleaner technologies, and 
ensuring effective waste management 
practices are therefore essential 
to reducing the Company’s direct 
environmental footprint.
The Company mitigates risks from water-
intensive dyeing, bleaching, and finishing 
through advanced Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs) and robust environmental systems. 
At the Ahmedabad unit, a structured multi-
stage process ensures responsible waste 
water management: effluents undergo 
clarification, aeration, biological treatment, 
and polishing through sand and carbon 
filters before safe discharge to CETP NTIEM. 
Sludge is dried, packed, and disposed 
of at a licensed TSDF facility. To address 
air emissions, the Company has installed 
ESP modifications, water scrubbers, and 
Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems 
(CEMS). These measures strengthen 
compliance with evolving environmental 
regulations, minimize pollution risks, 
and reinforce stakeholder confidence in 
sustainable operations.
Negative. 
*There has been 
no negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of FY 
2024-25.
1 Material issues identified are referred from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 2023-24 version. SASB Standards are 
maintained and enhanced by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This follows the SASB’s merger with the International 
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) into the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF) and subsequent consolidation into the IFRS® Foundation in 
2022. The latest standards have been accessed at https://sasb.ifrs.org/ on 12th June, 2025 at 11:10 IST

Employee safety 
and wellbeing 
Risk
The Company’s operations depend 
on a diverse workforce, including 
employees and on-site workers, whose 
health, safety, and overall wellbeing 
are critical to maintaining productivity 
and morale. Risks arise from potential 
workplace hazards, inadequate safety 
measures, high-stress environments, 
and insufficient health support systems. 
Neglecting these aspects can result 
in increased absenteeism, reduced 
efficiency, higher attrition, and potential 
legal or regulatory repercussions. 
Moreover, poor employee wellbeing 
can impact workplace culture, damage 
the company’s reputation, and erode 
stakeholder trust.
The Company mitigates risks to workforce 
health, safety, and wellbeing through 
a structured occupational health and 
safety framework. It ensures safe 
premises, equipment, and systems across 
all operations, supported by regular 
monitoring and compliance with statutory 
requirements. Employees and on-site 
workers undergo periodic safety trainings to 
strengthen awareness and preparedness. 
The Company also promotes wellbeing 
through healthcare initiatives, welfare 
measures, and a formal grievance redressal 
mechanism to address workplace concerns.
Negative.
*There has been 
no negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of FY 
2024-25.
4
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Regulatory compliance poses a 
significant risk due to the extensive and 
evolving framework of laws governing 
environmental protection, labor rights, 
chemical usage, and product safety. 
Non-compliance can lead to legal 
penalties, operational disruptions, and 
reputational damage, especially given 
the increasing scrutiny on pollution 
control, waste management, and 
ethical sourcing.  Failure to meet legal 
requirements can not only restrict 
market access but also erode trust 
among customers, investors, and global 
supply chain partners.
The Company mitigates regulatory 
compliance risks through a comprehensive 
compliance management framework that 
is regularly updated to align with evolving 
laws. Statutory registers, returns, and 
records are maintained in accordance 
with applicable Acts, and compliance is 
further reinforced through board-level 
oversight. Employee training and internal 
reviews strengthen awareness of regulatory 
obligations, while external audits and 
certifications such as ISO and OEKO-
TEX validate adherence. This structured 
approach minimizes legal, operational, 
and reputational risks while ensuring 
stakeholder trust.
Negative.
*There has been 
no negative impact 
in the reporting 
period of FY 
2024-25.
6
Corporate Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR)
Opportunity
CSR presents a significant opportunity 
for the company to enhance its brand 
value, foster stronger relationships 
with stakeholders, and contribute to 
long-term business sustainability. By 
channelling efforts towards initiatives 
that benefit underprivileged sections 
of society, the company not only 
creates a positive social impact but 
also reinforces its commitment to 
responsible business practices. As 
part of its CSR strategy, the company 
places a special focus on child 
education, supporting programs that 
provide children with access to quality 
learning resources, improve educational 
infrastructure, and promote holistic 
development.

emissions and conserving resources:
1.	
Heat exchangers and insulation systems have been deployed, 
resulting in a 10% to 15% reduction in heat emissions.
2.	
Carbon filter accessories have been installed at the exhaust 
outlets of D.G. sets, effectively cutting carbon emissions by 
approximately 15%.

A Condensate Recovery System has been introduced to recycle 
condensed water back into the boiler, leading to a 5% reduction 
in coal consumption.
Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	
Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements
	
Swan Energy Limited remains steadfast in its commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) principles through a comprehensive approach that integrates sustainability into every facet of 
our operations. Our efforts span across water conservation, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and the 
mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
	
A major milestone in our environmental journey has been the shift from coal to agro-waste, specifically, 
De-Oiled Castor Cake (DOC), as a cleaner fuel alternative for our boilers. This transition has not only 
curtailed the release of hazardous gases but has also substantially reduced ash generation.
	
To further advance emission control, we have implemented mechanical ash collectors and electrostatic 
precipitators (ESP), along with heat exchangers and high-grade insulation to lower heat emissions. Carbon 
filters installed on D.G. set exhausts have contributed to notable reductions in carbon output. In our pursuit 
of energy conservation, we have transitioned to energy-efficient LED lighting and upgraded conventional 
electrical systems to more sustainable technologies.
	
On the social responsibility front, our CSR initiatives are centered on uplifting marginalized communities by 
enhancing access to healthcare, education, and basic amenities. These ongoing efforts reinforce our dual 
focus, tackling ESG challenges while fostering an inclusive and sustainable future for all.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage

At the Ahmedabad unit of Swan Energy Ltd., a structured and efficient effluent treatment process is in place to 
ensure environmentally responsible management of wastewater generated from processing operations. The 
effluents are initially collected in a centralized collection tank, where compressed air is introduced to facilitate 
effective mixing. The wastewater is then transferred to a primary clarifier, where coagulants are added to 
aid in the formation of flocs. These flocs settle in the subsequent settling tank, allowing for the removal of 
suspended solids. The partially treated effluent is then directed to an aeration tank equipped with diffused 
aeration systems to promote microbial activity and enable effective biological treatment. 
	
From the aeration tank, the effluent flows into a secondary clarifier for solid-liquid separation. The resulting 
treated effluent is stored in a pump tank and further polished through a pressure sand filter and an activated 
carbon filter to ensure quality compliance. The final treated water is then safely discharged to CETP 
NTIEM. Sludge generated during the treatment process is collected from the settling tanks and processed 
using sludge drying beds or a filter press. Once dried, the sludge is packed in HDPE bags and stored in a 
designated area before being sent for final disposal to the TSDF site operated by Eco-care Infrastructure 
Private Ltd. This systematic approach reflects the unit’s commitment to sustainable operations and adherence 
to environmental compliance standards.

Upgraded the Air Pollution Control System by 
modifying the Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) and 
installing a Water Scrubber to further minimize air 
emissions. Additionally, a Continuous Emission 
Monitoring System (CEMS) was installed for real-time 
emission monitoring. To optimize energy usage, a 
Root Blower was installed in the Effluent Treatment 
Plant (ETP), and a new submersible pump with a 
frequency drive was installed on the tube well to 
improve operational efficiency and reduce electricity 
consumption.
Achieved a 10-12% 
improvement in air

a 5-8% reduction in 
electricity consumption 
in bore well and ETP 
operations.

Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or 
services.
	
To promote awareness on the safe and responsible use of its products and services, the Company regularly 
shares relevant information through its digital platforms, including its official website, Twitter, and Instagram. 
However, given the Company’s primary focus on a B2B business model, opportunities for direct consumer 
education remain limited in scope.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
As a business operating primarily under the B2B model, the Company’s direct interface with end consumers is 
minimal. Consequently, the scope for communicating potential risks related to the disruption or discontinuation 
of essential services to consumers is inherently limited due to the nature of its operations.
4.

per local laws? (Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any 
survey with regard to consumer satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, 
significant locations of operation of the entity or the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
No, the Company does not display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as 
per local laws.
	
Not applicable, as the Company operates exclusively within a B2B framework and does not engage directly 
with individual consumers.
