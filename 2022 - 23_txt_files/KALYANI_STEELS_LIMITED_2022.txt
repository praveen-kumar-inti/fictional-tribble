No. Steel is ﬁ  h largest carbon emitting industry in the world. Globally, research and development is 
underway to de-carbonize the steel making process. However, the development of such technology is yet 
to be matured for a large commercial scale operations. Considering this, sustainable sourcing of input raw 
materials (major carbon emitting materials) is a signiﬁ cant challenge. Nonetheless, the Company is trying 
to develop suppliers to have sustainable sourcing and plans to introduce such procedures.

Steel has a very long service life before it needs to be recycled. End-of-life steel or scrap steel is not considered 
as waste product by the Company, instead used as input product by remelting. The Company is committed 
to circularity and reuses scrap generated during the production process. Further the steel slag generated 
during the production is sold to cement manufacturers which helps in reducing the emmission intensity of 
cement production.
