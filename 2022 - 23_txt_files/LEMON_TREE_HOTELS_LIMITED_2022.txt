Why we need to engage
How we engage
Owners and  
Partners
Owners/partners who own managed hotels (run 
by Lemon Tree Hotels) are also responsible for 
maintaining our brand standards. This asset-
light growth model is critical to our business 
success as it ensures quick geographic spread 
and penetration, and offers our customers a wide 
choice across the country.
Our business development team and marketing 
team engages with owners and partners to 
ensure they have the necessary tools and support 
to uphold and enhance our brand’s reputation. 
We also have regular discussions through bilateral 
meetings with owners and partners.
Suppliers and 
Vendors
Engaging regularly with our suppliers and 
vendors is critical for our business, to ensure that 
the products and services they deliver to us meet 
our brand standards.
We engage with them frequently through informal 
interactions and periodical reviews. We discuss 
product quality, product specifications, timely 
supply, pricing and payment terms along with 
ethical and responsible sourcing.
Contractors
We are also supported by an outsourced 
workforce in providing quality services to our 
customers. This makes it critical for us to engage 
with our contractors who ensure the availability of 
trained staff who can deliver on our standards.
We engage with them frequently through informal 
interactions, meetings and periodical reviews to 
discuss matters pertaining to the well-being and 
engagement levels of our outsourced workforce.
Online Travel 
Agencies/Portals
Online Travel Agencies support us in customer 
acquisition along with providing us insights into 
customer behavior and decision-making criteria. 
Reviewing customer feedback on their platforms 
is an important aspect of our business.
We maintain an open dialogue and conduct 
frequent meetings to stay connected with them.
NGOs
NGOs help us deliver on our commitment 
to being an equal opportunity employer by 
supporting us in selecting and training candidates 
with disability and candidates from economically/
socially marginalised backgrounds (together 
called Opportunity Deprived Indians (ODIs)). 
Moving forward, they will play a pivotal role in 
supporting the design and implementation of our 
CSR initiatives.
Our annual reports help our NGO partners assess 
our priorities and we engage with them regarding 
further opportunities for collaboration through 
regular meetings and specific engagement 
events.
Local Communities
We engage with local communities to understand 
their needs which helps us deliver greater impact 
through curated social welfare programmes.
We engage with them through our NGO partners

Why we need to engage
How we engage
Employees
Our employees create guest experiences and 
ensure that their expectations are met and even 
exceeded. We rely on the service delivery of our 
employees to enhance our brand image through 
exceptional service.
We regularly engage with our employees through 
internal town halls and other mechanisms. 
Frequent team-building exercises foster harmony 
and bring synergy to our team. We also rely on 
forums including new employee “fresh-eyes” 
discussions and weekly engagement chats 
between hotel managers and employees on a 
one-on-one basis to assess their needs.
Customers
Our customers are key stakeholders who 
experience our service delivery. Our revenues are 
directly linked with the trust and relationships 
that we nurture with our customers. Their 
feedback is critical to our financial success. Our 
brand standards too evolve based on this ongoing 
feedback.
We invite direct feedback from our customers 
prior to departure from our hotels. We also track 
their comments on our services after they have 
left our premises i.e. through Online Relationship 
Management (ORM) platforms. We monitor our 
social media engagement to understand the 
live feedback of our customers. We update our 
customers about hotel launches, new services, 
and/or periodic offers, through our loyalty 
programme via emailers, newsletters, etc.
Regulatory Bodies 
and Government
Ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies and 
the federal/state/local governments. We seek 
their support in complying with applicable laws 
and regulations.
They issue operating licenses and permits, which 
are critical for us to conduct our business.
Investors and 
Shareholders
Our investors and shareholders are interested in 
the success and sustainability of our business. 
They have provided the foundation, by providing 
capital, for our business to grow. The motivation 
to meet/exceed the expectations of our investors 
inspires us to continuously improve and, in 
that process, also deliver better value to other 
stakeholders.
Our quarterly presentations and annual meetings 
serve as an opportunity to engage with investors 
and shareholders regarding our performance and 
get their feedback. We also invite their feedback 
on our annual disclosures.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human 
rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. The implementation of our Human Rights policy is jointly handled by Corporate HR and the ESG Task 
Force. This is done through all initiatives around recruitment, training, sensitisation, and diversity/inclusion.
5	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human 
rights issues.
	
All grievances are addressed as and when received by the respective Hotel General Managers/Executive 
Assistant Managers/ Assistant Hotel Managers/ Department Heads in coordination with HR and the 
Corporate Office team (HR, ESG, and relevant Corporate Function Head). All the grievances received are 
duly investigated and appropriate actions are taken to resolve the matter. Whenever required, disciplinary 
action is taken to ensure such inappropriate behaviour is not repeated by any employee. For example:
•	 Our Code of Conduct known as the ‘LTH Code’, acts as an important guiding force for ensuring that we 
all work collectively to function as a responsible and ethical organisation. Acting with integrity is key 
to our organisational growth as well as our future prospects. This code, applicable to all employees of 
the company, including members of the Board and Senior Management, outlines our commitment to 
upholding the core values of Lemon Tree including acting with integrity and transparency within the 
organisation. The Code is supported by a policy on the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) at the 
workplace. Any POSH-related complaints are handled by the Internal Complaints Committee.
•	 Our Whistleblower Policy encourages our employees and others to report violations or suspected 
violations of the LTH Code and/or any instances of misconduct. This policy provides a robust mechanism 
3	
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the 
concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups.
VULNERABLE GROUP
CONCERNS
ACTION TAKEN
ODI Employees
•	Integration in the team
•	Training in a manner that 
they can understand/receive 
the training content
•	Supervision and guidance in 
the early stages
•	All our hotel teams are regularly sensitised about disability and 
inclusion/diversity. All employees learn Indian Sign Language 
at Lemon Tree and their knowledge of the language is tested as 
well
•	Training for Employees With Disability (EWD) is conducted in a 
manner that is suitable for that disability i.e. deaf colleagues 
are trained in an integrated session where there is a 'speaking' 
trainer and an ISL interpreter who translates alongside; 
low vision colleagues are given content that is inclusive and 
accessible; employees with intellectual/developmental disability 
or autism are not taught in a classroom and are trained 
through a 6 month+ internship
•	All supervisors and managers are trained to guide new EWD 
team members ad to be patient with them for the first 6 
months+ on the job
NGOs (in the disability 
sector)
•	Absence of an inclusive 
culture in society and the 
corporate sector
•	Companies who are willing to 
hire Persons With Disability 
(PWD)
•	Possibilty of sustainable 
employment solutions
•	Our hotels share extensive best practices with other companies 
in hospitality, restaurants, airlines, retail, BFSI, manufacturing, 
IT/ITES, and more. These sessions take place in-person 
and virtually within India and abroad (in-person in the UK 
(Glasgow), Singapore, and Switzerland and virtual in the UK, 
Japan, Europe, Israel, and more)
•	We are an active employer of PWD and act as a strategic 
partner to NGOs working in the disability space. This is done 
across its 88 hotels in India located in 56 destinations. The 
inclusion initiative was started in 2007 and has continued 
through these 16 years (despite the pandemic) making it a 
highly sustainable endeavour.
Communities (segment 
of PWD)
•	Absence of an inclusive 
culture in society and the 
corporate sector
•	Skilling and training to make 
PWD candidates employable
•	Companies who are willing to 
hire Persons With Disability 
(PWD)
Similar to the above plus
•	The Chairman & Managing Director of Lemon Tree was the 
founding Chairperson of Skill Council for Persons with Disability 
(SCPWD) and served 2 terms over 5 years. SCPWD is a part of 
the National Skill Development Council (NSDC) and focussed 
on making training inclusive and implementable for PWD with 
different types of disability including deaf, visually impaired, 
othropaedically handicapped, Down Syndrome, autism, etc.
•	Lemon Tree has engaged regularly with the Minsitry of Social 
Justice (MSJE) with the Department of PWD (DePWD) w.r.t. 
skilling methodology, making companies inclusive and more.

•	 Waste Management: We have discontinued the use of packaged drinking water, plastic cutlery, 
miniature toiletries, and single-use plastic. We have also selected a local partner to process and manage 
our kitchen waste and the compost generated through this is used in and around the reserve.

reused to maintain the gardens at our hotel while ensuring no harmful water discharge in and around 
the resort.
•	 Supporting Local Flora and Fauna: We recognise our role in supporting the local forest division in 
managing forest fires near the resort. Furthermore, we have also planted over 100 trees within our
