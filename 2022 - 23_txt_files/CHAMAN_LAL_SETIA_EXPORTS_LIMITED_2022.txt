rice, thereby generating little waste water and still having a high quality product. Consequently any chance of earth 
pollution from this process is completely ruled out. The energy and water consumption utilized about just one third 
of that available with the company and such saved energy and water to the tune of two third can be utilized for other 
productive purposes. Due to this innovation at our rice parboiling plant, overall fuel consumption in this section is 
reduced resulting conservation of energy. Company has also eliminated the typical off - odour emanating from the

Management Discussion and Analysis Report
1. 	
Global Economy
	
The global economy faced a series of severe and mutually reinforcing shocks -the COVID 19 pandemic, the war in 
Ukraine andresulting food and energy crises, surging inflation, debt tightening, as well as the climate emergency. The 
most important indicatorsfor the future economy will be the threat of resurge of COVID-19, the war between Russia 
and Ukraine, and climate change. The IMF predicts in a more recent update, that there will be no global recession.
The rapid increase in interest rates by central banks concerned impacted demand and global GDP growth. The 
commodity prices however have moderated from the high level seen immediately after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
Lower food and energy prices and an easing of the supply chain are positives. Consequently, headline inflation has 
declined from its peak witnessed in 2022, though core inflation continues to remain high.
	
A hard landing for the global economy is expected due to persistent inflation and financial sector turmoil. The rapid 
increase in interest rates to control inflation has brought forth the vulnerabilities of the banking sector. In such 
a scenario, policymakers must balance controlling inflation and ensuring financial stability while providing much 
needed fiscal support and international cooperation to sustain economic recovery. According to the IMF, GDP growth 
is forecast to drop from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023 and settle at 3.0% in 2024. Advanced economies should 
anticipate a considerable growth decrease, from 2.7% this year to 1.3% the following year. Global headline inflation 
is expected to drop from 8.7% in 2022 to 7.0% in 2023 because of lower commodity prices, even as core inflation is 
likely to decline slowly.
	
China’s reopening in November 2022 brought back a positive sentiment for the manufacturing sector along with 
easing out of logistical challenges. The manufacturing cost has increased globally, driven by higher raw material and 
energy costs, as well as supply disruptions. Despite these challenges, businesses particularly in manufacturing and 
services have been working hard to maintain their profitability and competitiveness. By adapting to changing market 
conditions and implementing new strategies, many companies have been able to weather these challenges and 
continue to thrive in today’s economic landscape.
	
In CY2023, advanced economies are expected to have an inflation of 4.6% while emerging economies will continue 
toface an inflation of 8.1%. About 84% of countries are expected to have lower headline (consumer price index) 
inflation inCY2023 than in CY2022. Macroeconomic policies need to be carefully calibrated to strike a balance 
between stimulatingoutput and stabilising inflation. It is anticipated that thepen-tup demand in numerous economies, 
along with a significantreduction in inflation, will contribute to accelerated economic growth in CY23.
	
The food industry was significantly impacted by high commodity prices, rising interest rates and the continuing 
impact of Russia-Ukraine war during the year. Further, the long-term effects of these factors continue to be felt 
extensively, giving rise to fears of an impending recession in major economies Although commodity prices were 
volatile and inflation was at unprecedented levels, the post-covid normalisation of economic activities supported 
growth throughout the year.
2.	
Indian Economy overview
    	
India was one of the fastest growing economies in the world with robust domestic demand backed by significant 
investments in infrastructure.  Projections indicate that India’s economy will continue to progress and expand at a 
rate of 7% during the fiscal year 2022-23. Additionally, the country’s stable inflation rates, higher disposable income 
and continued investment in infrastructure development are expected to contribute positively to economic growth in 
the future.
	
Various high-frequency indicators, such as GST collections,railway and air traffic, electronic toll collections and E- 
Waybill volume, suggest a robust economic recovery in India. This persistent growth momentum has positioned India 
as an attractive investment destination. Moreover, India is expected to retain its status as the fastest growing G-20 
CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.	
57
nation in the coming years. India’s presidency of the G20 Summit in 2023 has also bolstered its international stature. 
Despite the challenges, the Indian government’s prudent
	
initiatives, such as the PM Gati Shakti - National Master Plan,the National Monetisation Plan (NMP) and the 
Production-Linked Incentive (PLI), have been instrumental in fostering economic growth. The Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) has also taken prudent and proactive measures to ensure financial stability and address liquidity constraints. 
These factors have contributed to the Indian economy’s resilience and stimulated substantial investments.
	
The food industry was significantly impacted by high commodity prices, rising interest rates and the continuing 
impact of Russia-Ukraine war during the year. Further, the long-term effects of these factors continue to be felt 
extensively, giving rise to fears of an impending recession in major economies. During the year, the major challenge 
confronting the food industry was managing inflation in the cost of key commodities like wheat, milk, sugar, palm oil 
and crude oil, all of which were trading at multi-year high prices.
	
Your Company was able to successfully navigate these challenging circumstances and deliver strong performance 
through focused efforts, robust cost efficiency programs, brand marketing and timely price increases. Prudent 
procurement decisions also helped your Company to ensure availability and overcome volatility in prices of essential 
commodities like wheat, sugar and palm oil.
	
In July 2022, a significant development occurred in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council’s decision 
to eliminate GST exemption on packaged food items sold under unregistered brands. As a result, these items are 
now subject to a 5% tax rate, the same as branded food products. This change has leveled the playing field for 
branded players and contributed to the industry’s progress towards greater organization and increased penetration 
of branded food that adheres to food safety standards. The 5% GST is now applicable to all branded or unbranded 
SKUs weighing up to 25 Kg.
	
Rice is the most common staple food in many Asian countries including India. Rice is India’s most significant food 
crop. Feeding more than half of the global population, just 10 countries produce nearly 84% of the global rice 
requirement. As per USDA June 2023 outlook, Annual global rice production in the 2023/24 remains projected at a 
record 520.5 million tons (milled basis), up 8.0 million tons from a year earlier. Global domestic and residual use in 
2023/24 is projected at a record 523.8 million tons, up 750,000 from the previous forecast, with India accounting for 
most of the upward revision.
	
Global rice trade in calendar year 2024 is projected at 55.8 million tons (milled basis), unchanged from the previous 
forecast, but almost 1 percent larger than a year earlier. This month, an increase in India’s export forecast was offset 
by a reduction in Thailand’s. Over the past month, quotes for Thailand’s trading prices for most grades of regular 
(neither parboiled nor aromatic) whole-grain milled rice were nearly unchanged from a month earlier, while Vietnam’s 
increased about 2 percent. India’s prices rose over the past month but remain the lowest among Asian exporters. 
U.S. long-grain milled-rice prices remain near record-high. and nominal quotes for California medium-grain milled-
rice remain record-high.
	
Total global rice supplies in 2023/24 are projected at 694.0 million tons, up almost 4.3 million from the previous 
forecast but around 900,000 tons below a year earlier and the second consecutive year of declining global rice 
supplies 
	
Indian Agriculture Sector
	
India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector worldwide and it is the primary source of livelihood for 
~55% of India’s population. India has the world’s largest cattle herd (buffaloes), the largest area planted for wheat, 
rice, and cotton, and is the largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices in the world. It is the second-largest producer 
of fruit, vegetables, tea, farmed fish, cotton, sugarcane, wheat, rice, cotton, and sugar. The agriculture sector in 
India holds the record for second-largest agricultural land in the world generating employment for about half of the 
58

country’s population. Thus, farmers become an integral part of the sector to provide us with a means of sustenance. 
With around 54.6% of the total workforce involved in agriculture and allied sector activities, the sector contributes to 
17.8% of the country’s gross value added (GVA). 
	
The new changes over the last few years have been enormously helpful to contribute more towards economic 
growth. Recent advancements such as drones, and data-driven facilities help to monitor the process of farming. It 
has been supporting farmers to increase productivity and contribute more towards the agricultural economy.
	
The future of Indian agriculture seems bright and promising with the advent of new technologies. The government 
has increased its focus on the sector, implementing various policies and initiatives to boost productivity and growth. 
India’s vast and diverse agricultural landscape, coupled with advancements in technology, provides immense 
opportunities for farmers to harness their potential and increase yield. In addition, start-ups in the agricultural sector 
are working towards providing innovative solutions to farmers in terms of supporting them with better productivity, 
measuring tools and other data-driven strategies.
	
As per third advance estimates of production of major crops for agricultural year 2022-2023, Total Food grain

Indian Rice Industry
	
Rice is one of the most crucial food crops in the world and a staple diet for nearly half the global population. Over 90% 
of the global rice out put and consumption is centred in Asia, where in the world’s largest rice producers,China and 
India, are also the world’s largest rice consumers. India accounts for more than 22% of the world’s rice production 
through its 48 million hectares of rice plantation area. Due to the favourable climatic condition prevailing in India, the 
nation has emerged as the second largest rice-growing country worldwide. 
	
It is a Kharif (autumn) crop cultivated in warmer regions during the monsoon season from June to September, rice 
is extracted from the paddy crop during harvesting. The leading rice-producing states were West Bengal, Uttar 
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu,  Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. Over 3,000 varieties of rice are 
grown across the country,  some of which take as less as 60 to 75 days to be grown
.	
Rice is grown in India throughout the year heaving region-wise favourable rice growing seasons. Eastern, North-
eastern and Southern are major rice-producing region because of a pleasant climate throughout the year.
	
Throughout history as per the Archeological evidence,rice has been one of man’s most important foods for more than 
5000 years. Today, this unique grain helps sustain two- thirds of the world’s population. Mainly the two major varieties 
of rice that dominate the Indian Market  are basmati and non-basmati rice. 
	
Rice is grown in India throughout the year heaving region-wise favourable rice growing seasons. Eastern, North-
eastern and Southern are major rice-producing region because of a pleasant climate throughout the year.
	
India is a major supplier to rice to several important markets in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa , making their populations 
vulnerable to rice market disruptions. Forty two countries get more than 50% percent of their total rice imports from 
India.
	
The India Rice Market size is expected to grow from USD 51.58 billion in 2023 to USD 58.07 billion by 2028, at a 
CAGR of 2.40% during the forecast period (2023-2028 As per Third Advance Estimates for 2022-23, total production 
of Rice during 2022-23 is estimated at(record)1355.42 lakh metric tonnes (LMT). It is higher by 60.71 lakh tonnes as 
compared to previous year. However India still remains the cheapest supplier in the world today.
	
The export of non-Basmati rice registered a growth of 4 percent in nine months of current fiscal. Non-basmati rice 
export increased to USD 4663 million in nine months of the current fiscal from USD 4512 million in the corresponding 
months of the previous year. Therefore due to high price, the government had banned export of broken rice in 2022 
and imposed a supplement tarrif of 20% on exports of non-basmati rice.	
	
Despite the imposition of duty, exports saw a rise from 33.7 lakh tonne between September 2021 and March 2022 
to 42.1 lakh tonne between September 2022 and March 2023. The sharp increase in exports can be attributed to 
the high international prices due to the geopolitical scenario, El Nino, and extreme climatic conditions in other rice-
producing countries.
	
In order to ensure adequate availability of non-basmati white rice in the Indian market and to allay the rise in prices 
in the domestic market, Government of India has amended the Export Policy of the above variety from ‘Free with 
export duty of 20%’ to ‘Prohibited’ with immediate effect.” Further However in July 2023,  the Government restricted 
exports of non-basmati rice to calm down rice prices that had risen more than 30% since October 2022.
.	
Indian Basmati Rice industry
	
Among the several varieties of rice, Basmati is considered the most superior in terms of product characteristics 
and therefore, the most premium. “Basmati” is long grain aromatic rice grown for many centuries in the specific 
geographical are a, at the Himalayan foothills of Indian sub-continent, blessed with character is tics extra-longs 
lender grains that elongate at least twice of their original size with a characteristics soft and fluffy texture upon 
60 	
CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.
cooking, delicious taste, superior aroma, and distinct flavor, Basmati rice is unique among other aromatic long-grain 
rice varieties. Despite its popularity, basmati rice is not easy to come by outside of its native region. The grain is 
delicate and requires a specific climate to grow properly. As a result, basmati rice is expensive and difficult to find in 
most parts of the world.
	
Basmati is unique to the region. It can be grown where precise climatic conditions, soil quality and temperature exists 
and this only occurs in the Indo-Gangetic area of the Himalayas.
	
Grown in the specific regions in India Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Western 
Uttarpradesh, Uttarakhand  and Delhi are the major basmati rice producing states in India. India exports basmati rice 
in the world to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, the UK, Yemen Republic, USA, Canada and Oman.
	
Basmati rice is majorly produced in India, with balance quantity from Pakistan. Indian Basmati rice has got Geographic 
Indication (GI) recognition. India has strong dominance in the export of basmati rice (160+ countries) especially to 
the Middle East. Basmati Rice exports have witnessed a CAGR growth of 7.1% in last 10 fiscals with its export 
standing at ` 38,524 Cr* as on FY23. Introduction of higher yielding and shorter duration varieties has supported 
strong growth in Basmati production in the last two decades. New variety is increasingly adopted by farmers due to 
shorter growth cycle, lower irrigation requirements and higher yields compared to other traditional varieties..
	
Accounting for nearly 85% of the global Basmati exports are from India. In India the Basmati exports is about 37% 
of the total rice exports by quantity and 60% by value. Exporting basmati rice to nearly 90 countries, nearly 60% of 
India’s basmati rice production is exported.
	
Currently, there are 34 Notified Basmati Varieties under Section 5 of Seed Act, 1966 of India. The main varieties of 
Basmati rice as notified under the seeds Act, 1966 are Basmati 386, Basmati 217, Ranbir Basmati, Karnal Local/ 
Taraori Basmati, Basmati 370, Type-3 (Dehradooni Basmati), Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa Basmati 1121, Punjab Basmati-1, 
Haryana Basmati-1, Kasturi and Mahi Sugandha. Pusa Basmati1121 developed by the Indian Agricultural Research 
Institute (IARI) and released for commercial cultivation in Kharif season of 2003 is the most widely used variety as 
it requires less water, matures early and yields 19–20 quintals of paddy per acre as compared to 9–10 quintals for 
traditional tall basmati.	
   
	
India exported basmati rice worth about Rs 38,524 crore (nearly $ 4.79 billion) in the 2022-23 fiscal (April-March, a 
jump of about Rs 12,109 crore from 2021-22, as per the data of Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and 
Statistics (DGCIS). In terms of value in rupees, Indian exports of the long grain aromatic rice were about 45.84% 
higher in 2022-23 than the previous fiscal.
	
Iran was the biggest importer of the Indian basmati rice in  quantity at about 9.98 LMT followed by Saudi Arabia at 
9.54 LMT and Iraq, a distant third at 3.64 LMT.
	
Despite pandemic challenges in the short-term, the outlook for the Indian Basmati rice industry remains stable. In, 
the medium term, demand prospects from key destinations such as Iran and Saudi Arabia will play a significant role 
and determine trade prospects. Availability of a secure payment mechanism for exports to Iran, easing/ removal of 
sanctions by the US and response to pandemic in the destination country would be the factors underscoring the 
Basmati rice trade.

CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.
	
IV.	
Healthy balance sheet and comfortable capital structure
	
	
Despite limited bargaining power, the Company has done a good job at maintaining a stable financial profile 
and improving The Company never faced any difficulty in servicing its debts and other financing arrangements 
and with the required number of skilled employees, all the financial activities have been carried out on time 
without any delay/disruption. Further Company has adequate financial resources to meet its working capital 
requirement. The Company has never in the past defaulted on any interest or loan payment and does not see 
any issue meeting future obligations too.
	
	
Weakness
	
I.	
Foreign Exchange Risk
	
	
Since the raw material procurement is from within India itself, and around 88% of    revenue come from exports, 
there is an inherent exchange rate fluctuation risk for rice exporters.
	
II.	
Changing Government Policies
	
	
Factors such as Minimum Support Price, import bans and sanctions, ban on export of non-basmati rice may 
affect the operations and profitability of the company.
	
III.	
Volatility in raw material prices
	
	
The prices of paddy might fluctuate subject to the demand and supply scenario, which may ultimately affect the 
profitability of the business.
	
IV.	
Commodity nature of products with little or no differentiation
	
	
The company operates in a highly commoditized industry with very little or no product differentiation.
	
V.	
Dependency on favourable Climatic Conditions
	
	
Besides the quality of the foundational seed itself the cultivation of Basmati closely depends on the vagaries of 
the weather. Any inclemency can upset the potential sales of the brand.
	
Opportunities
	
As Basmati is un-disputedly the king of grains, given its association with being the best, it finds natural up take a 
cross nations and especially in the middle east where rice preparations are part of culture. Higher usage of Rice as 
a staple diet again dovetails into higher consumption of Basmati.
	
Threats
	
Continuing trade wars and the CoVID-19 pandemic both are likely to significantly lower global trade and resultantly 
international sales. Being a daily staple Basmati though could be less impacted.

CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.
 
In preparing the financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
 
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
 
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone financial statements, whether due to  
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
• 
 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
• 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be 
influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone 
financial statements
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.	
121
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

CHAMAN LAL SETIA EXPORTS LTD.
ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT – 31ST MARCH 2023
(Refer to in our report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting   of Chaman Lal Setia Exports Ltd. (“the Company”) 
as of 31st March, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.(“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, as specified under Section 143 (10) of 
the Companies Act, 2013 issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable, to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and both 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether internal financial 
controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material 
respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of IND AS financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the Ind AS financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial 
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023  based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by 
the ICAI.

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and 
the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made.
 
 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties, if any. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control over a 
product or service to a customer.
	
	
To determine whether to recognize revenue, the Company follows a 5-step process:
 
 
• 
Identifying the contract with a customer
 
 
• 
Identifying the performance obligations
 
 
• 
Determining the transaction price
 
 
• 
Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations
 
 
• 
Recognising revenue when/as performance obligation(s) are satisfied.
 
 
Export sales are recognized at exchange rate prevalent on the date of shipping bills.
 
 
Domestic sales are recognized net of discounts, Scheme on Sales, Sale Returns and GST.
 
 
Revenue in respect of Insurance / others claims and Commission, etc. is recognised only when it is reasonably 
certain that the ultimate collection will be made.
 
 
Revenue in respect of Interest is measured as per effective interest method provided in IND-AS 109.

4.2	 Dividend to equity shareholders
             
Dividend to equity shareholders is recognized as a liability and deducted from total equity, in the period in which 
dividend are approved by the equity shareholders in the general meeting in other words when right to receive 
the payment of shareholders is established.
               It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company, and the amount 
of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
             	 Interest Income:-
 
 
Interest income is recognized using the time proportion method based on the rates implicit in the transaction.
	
4.3	 Leases
           The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing 
the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.
               In respect of operating lease, lease rentals are accounted on accrual  basis in accordance with the respective 
lease agreements. However there is no lease as on the date.
 
 
Leases under which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. When acquired, such assets are capitalized at fair value or present value of the minimum 
lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Lease payments under operating leases are 
charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the payments are structured 
to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost 
increases
	
4.4	 Government Grants
 
 
Grants in the nature of capital contribution towards setting up modernization of projects is adjusted from the 
cost of the related fixed assets..
	
4.5	 Tax Expense:-
 
 
Tax expense is the aggregate amount included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in respect of 
current tax and deferred tax
	
4.6	 Current tax
 
 
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid/ recovered to/from the taxation authorities. The tax 
rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date.
	
4.7	 Provision for income taxes and Deferred Tax
 
 
The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements are involved in determining the provision for 
income taxes, including amount  expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are computed on the timing  differences at the balance sheet date between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) is recognized based on 
management estimates of virtual certainty that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which 
such DTA can be realized. The deferred tax charge or credit is recognized using the   tax rates and tax law that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

4.8	 Employees Benefits
	
	
a.	
Defined Contribution Plans
 
 
 
Defined contribution plans are benefit plans under which the company pays fixed contribution to state 
managed benefit schemes. The company contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the 
profit and loss account in the financial year to which they relate.
 
 
 
Eligible employees of the Company receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution 
plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund 
plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee’s salary. The Company’s contribution is 
recognized as an expense in the statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee 
renders the related services.
	
	
b.	
Defined Benefits Plans
 
 
 
The Company has Defined Benefit Plan for post employment benefit in the form of Gratuity for eligible 
employees, which is administered through a Group Gratuity Policy with Life Insurance Corporation of India 
(L.I.C). The liability for the above Defined Benefit Plan is provided on the basis of actuarial valuation as 
carried out L.I.C. The actuarial method used measuring the liability is the Project Unit Credit Method.
                       An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in 
the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. 
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is 
highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. 
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for 
plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies 
consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.
	
4.9	 Property, Plant and Equipment including Intangible Assets:-
 
 
a) 
Freehold Land is stated at Original cost of acquisition. All other items of Property, Plant and Equipment 
are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. The cost of an item of property,

refundable taxes or levies and any cost directly attributable to the acquisition/construction of those item 
and all incidental expenses.
                       When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for 
as separate items (major   components) of property, plant and equipment.
 
 
 
Property, plant and equipment under construction are disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
 
 
 
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting

Cost and market price amounting Rs. 7980.81 lacs has been transferred to Revaluation reserve as per 
general accepted principle and accounting standards. The change was necessiated due to huge difference 
between  cost price of land and market price of land and was to make balance sheet more meaningful for 
investors. 
	
	
	
Subsequent Cost
 
 
 
Subsequent cost are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to statement of profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Gain or losses 
arising on disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss.

recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is measured as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item and is recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
when the item is derecognized.
	
4.10	Investment Properties
 
 
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the

the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the

computed using the weighted average number of equity and dilutive equity equivalent shares outstanding 
during the year end, except where the results would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive potential equity shares are 
adjusted for the  proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average 
market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as 
of   the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined 
independently for each period presented.
 
 
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all  periods 
presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of 
the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
	
4.21	 Cash Flow Statement
