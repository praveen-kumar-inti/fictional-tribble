The Company received Notice from NSE and BSE stating
that pursuant to Regulation 29 of SEBI (Listing Obligations
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, prior
notice of Board Meeting held on February 12, 2022 was not
given to Stock Exchange(s), in which the proposal of fund
raising was considered and fine of Rs. 10,000/- each was
imposed on the Company by NSE and BSE.
In response to the NSE's and BSE's Notice, the Company
replied that the proposed fund raising was an impromptu
discussion that happened in the Board Meeting in which
Board merely decided to explore various fund raising options
(i.e. may be a Preferential Issue or a Rights Issue or any
other equity linked securities).
The Company also requested NSE and BSE for waiver of
fine. However, on getting no reply from NSE, the Company
voluntarily paid the imposed fine of Rs. 10,000/- to NSE and
waited for BSE response as the Company was informed over
telephonic discussion by the concerned person of BSE that
the matter shall be placed before the Request Review
Committee of BSE.
Further, on July 26, 2022, BSE sent a regret letter for waiver
of fine to the Company and imposed fine of Rs. 10,000/-,
which has also been duly paid by the Company.
