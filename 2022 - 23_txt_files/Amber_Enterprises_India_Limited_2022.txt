manufacturing 
facilities. 
Safety 
committees 
are formulated at each facility 
and

mishaps.
Positive:
Investing in OHS helps to 
create a safe and healthy 
workplace. 
It 
promotes 
well-being of employee and 
reduces the risk of workplace 
accidents 
and

Labor and 
Human Rights
Opportunity/ 
Risk
Labor and human rights are 
essential components of any 
business, 
as 
they 
impact 
the well-being and dignity of 
workers and employees. 
As a responsible business 
entity, Amber respects and 
promotes labor and human 
rights across its operations 
and value chain. We prohibit 
child labor, forced labor and 
discrimination of any kind over 
caste, creed, religion, colour, or

7
Environmental 
Management
Opportunity 
Environment 
management 
is necessary due to growing 
concern for the protection 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
environmental 
surroundings. 
Environmental 
management 
provides valuable opportunities 
for any business to reduce 
operational 
cost, 
minimise 
environmental footprints and 
comply with regulations.
Positive: 
Environmental management 
practices 
involve 
upfront 
costs; however, the long-
term benefits far outweigh 
these costs. By improving 
efficiency, 
reducing 
operational cost, complying 
with 
regulations, 
and 
attracting 
environmentally 
conscious 
customer, 
business can improve its 
financial performance and 
competitiveness

Material 
handling 
and Waste 
Management
Opportunity
Material 
handling 
and 
waste 
management 
are 
two interlinked areas that 
businesses can prioritise to 
reduce 
their 
environmental 
impact and improve their 
sustainability performance. 
Effective material handling 
and 
waste 
management 
can help businesses in cost 
savings on raw materials 
sourcing. Also, it provides 
significant opportunities for 
business to drive innovation 
and 
improve

on the environment. 
Implementation of an effective 
management 
process 
for 
waste and materials can lead 
to cost savings and increased 
productivity.
9
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
Supply chain management 
can be a significant risk factor 
for 
businesses, 
particularly 
for those who rely heavily on 
their supply chains to operate. 
Some of the key risks posed by 
supply chain are: 
	
Strategy risk: Risk of 
losing 
confidential 
information 
such 
as 
trade secrets, ideas, and 
intellectual property
To mitigate supply chain risks, 
business should have robust 
supply 
chain 
management 
strategy, diversified supplier base 
and regular monitoring of the 
supply chain. 
9
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
	
Financial risk: Financial 
health of value chain

the continuity of their 
operations
	
Compliance 
risk: 
Adherence 
to 
compliances by value 
chain partner
	
Operational risk: Whether

adequate resources.
On the similar line, At Amber, we 
adopted number of measures to 
mitigate risks associated with 
supply chain, some of these 
include:
	
Group-wide 
standard 
procurement process is 
implemented
	
Sourcing teams are trained 
to ensure maintain data 
accuracy and sanity
	
Use of technology and 
digital transformation tools 
for forward and reverse 
auction, 
vendor 
portals, 
Quality Management to 
evaluate and mitigate the 
strategic and compliance 
risk.
Negative:
Risk associated with supply 
chain can cause significant 
financial 
implications. 
Disruption in supply chain 
can 
result 
increased 
operational cost and loss 
of 
revenue. 
Additionally, 
supply chain disruptions that 
arises from ethical or legal 
violations, can lead to legal 
and regulatory costs, fines, 
and legal liabilities.
