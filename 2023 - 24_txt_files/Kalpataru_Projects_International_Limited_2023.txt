We attained carbon neutrality for our Transmission Line International (TLI) division for FY 2023 and reduced our organization’s 
water intensity on a revenue basis by 35% compared to FY 2022. These milestones reflect our unwavering commitment to 
environmental stewardship and responsible resource management.
KPIL also achieved a 6.6% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity (tCO2e/INR Cr of Revenue) compared to 
FY 2022 and increased the contribution of renewable electricity to 29.2% of our total electricity consumption. Our people-
first culture, supported by comprehensive wellness programs and robust training initiatives, enhances holistic well-being 
and skill development, ensuring our workforce is prepared to drive the Company’s success. Together, we are building a 
legacy of impact, driving positive change for our planet, people, and prosperity.
Challenges and Solutions
Addressing ESG-related challenges requires ongoing and dedicated efforts. While we are making progress through dialogues 
with various agencies, including government authorities and market stakeholders, several challenges persist:

 
Regulatory landscape: The regulatory landscape is evolving in the renewable energy space and we are making efforts 
to leverage the opportunity and address the challenges associated with it.

 
Low Carbon Materials: Adapting to low-carbon cement and steel products presents technical and market challenges 
that need innovative solutions and collaboration.

 
Scope 3 Emissions: Achieving consensus among stakeholders on Scope 3 emission accounting is crucial for accurate 
reporting and requires extensive engagement.

 
Supply Chain Integration: Adoption of ESG principles throughout our supply chain involves continuous and substantial 
efforts to engage and empower our value chain partners.
Additionally, as an EPC company, our project sites are increasingly susceptible to climate risks, necessitating new approaches 
in execution planning and risk management, including enhanced insurance strategies and improved project delivery methods. 
Formulating a consensus among stakeholders and implementing these solutions requires focused efforts.
Despite these challenges, we remain steadfast in our commitment to making meaningful progress towards our sustainability 
goals. We will continue our relentless efforts to contribute to a sustainable future.

Responsibility of the Company 
The legal representatives of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the sustaina-
bility information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. This responsibility includes in par-
ticular the selection and use of appropriate methods for sustainability reporting, the collection

and compilation of information and the making of appropriate assumptions or, where appropri-
ate, the making of appropriate estimates. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsi-
ble for necessary internal controls to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is 
free of material - intentional or unintentional - erroneous information. 
 
Verification methodology and procedures performed 
 
The verification engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the verifi-
cation methodology developed by the TÜV SÜD Group which is based upon the ISO 17029 
and ISAE 3000.  
The applied level of assurance was “limited assurance”. Because the level of assurance ob-
tained in a limited assurance, the engagement is lower than in a reasonable assurance en-
gagement, the procedures the verification team performs in a limited assurance engagement 
vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance en-
gagement.  
The verification was based on a systematic and evidence-based assurance process limited 
as stated above. The selection of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judg-
ment. 
The procedures included amongst others: 
- 
Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the stakeholder engagement und materi-
ality analysis to understand the reporting boundaries 
- 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for compil-
ing, analysing, and aggregating sustainability information as well as for internal controls 
- 
Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, preparing and consoli-
dating sustainability information and performing internal controls 
- 
Analytical procedures and inspection of sustainability information as reported at group 
level by all locations. 
- 
Assessment of local data collection and management procedures and control mecha-
nisms through a sample survey at Corporate office in Mumbai, Corporate EHS depart-
ment Mumbai office, Oil and Gas India office in Mumbai, T & D International office in 
Mumbai, Urban Infrastructure Division, India office Mumbai, Building and Factories north 
India office in Noida, Water and Railway Division India office in Noida, Gandhinagar 
Plant and Corporate HR office in Gandhinagar. 
Conclusion 
On the basis of the assessment procedures carried out from 28.03.2024 to 25.04.2024, Noth-
ing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the completeness with 
respect the Reporting Criteria. 
Limitations 
The assurance process was subject to the following limitations: 
- 
The subject matter information covered by the engagement are described in the “scope of 
the engagement”. Assurance of further information included in the sustainability reporting 
was not performed. Accordingly, TÜV SÜD do not express a conclusion on this information. 
- 
The assurance scope excluded forward-looking statements, product- or service-related in-
formation, external information sources and expert opinions.
