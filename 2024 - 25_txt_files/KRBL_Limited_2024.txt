1.
Product Quality 
and Safety
R
KRBL operates in the food and agriculture sector. 
Product quality and safety are critical material ESG 
(Environmental, Social and Governance) risks that 
the Company addresses regularly because of the 
following reasons:
Consumer health and safety are core to KRBL’s 
values. With a global consumer base, the company 
ensures high-quality, safe products through strict 
standards and robust traceability systems, enabling 
end-to-end supply chain visibility. This allows quick 
identification and resolution of any quality or safety 
issues, while also helps building consumer trust 
through full transparency from farm to table.
A key focus area is allergen risk assessment, which 
KRBL has integrated into its overall risk management 
strategy to proactively identify, evaluate and control 
potential 
allergen 
cross-contamination—further 
strengthening 
product 
safety 
and 
protecting 
consumer health.
KRBL safeguards its global premium brand reputation 
through unwavering commitment to international 
quality standards. Strategic alliances, like with PHD 
Chamber, further reinforce its leadership by driving 
industry advocacy and support.
In order to meet product quality and safety 
requirements, 
the 
company 
has 
ensured 
compliance with various certifications standards:
	
FSSC 22000 Version 6 issued by Eurofins 
	
SQF Food Safety Code for Manufacturing 
Edition 9 issued by Eurofins
	
BRC Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 9 
Certification issued by Eurofins
	
Halal Certification issued by M/s. Halal 
Certification Services India Pvt Ltd.
	
The Company’s Unit is SEDEX registered.
	
Two of the Companies Unit have completed 
BRCGS ETRS (Ethical Trade and Responsible 
Sourcing) assessment with a score of 5/5.
	
We are also in a process of setting up an 
advanced in-house pesticide residue lab to 
rigorously test for pesticides, aflatoxins and 
ochratoxins—ensuring our products meet the 
highest safety and quality standards.
Negative
2.
Ethics 
and Governance
O
Strong ethics and governance are a strategic 
opportunity for KRBL, enhancing performance, trust 
and long-term growth.
KRBL’s commitment to transparent and ethical 
practices strengthens brand value, builds stakeholder 
trust and sets us apart in a competitive market. 
Robust governance mitigates risks like corruption and 
conflict of interest, safeguarding our reputation and 
sustainability.
The implementation of Zoho streamlines project 
planning, 
execution 
and 
monitoring—boosting 
collaboration, transparency, data-driven decision-
making and operational efficiency across the 
organization.
The Company has a strong governance structure 
in place with robust compliance monitoring, 
to 
strengthen 
internal 
controls. 
Corporate 
governance risks are managed through strong 
oversight, guided by the Company’s Code of 
Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all 
Employees of the Company. 
We also conduct regular audits, stakeholder 
engagement and ongoing training to ensure 
transparency and integrity.
By embedding ethics into every layer of our 
operations, KRBL fosters investor confidence, 
drives 
innovation 
and 
ensures 
long-term, 
responsible growth.

Responsible 
Marketing and  
Communication
O
KRBL recognizes brand communication as a powerful 
opportunity to build lasting consumer trust and 
loyalty through responsible, transparent and ethical 
marketing practices. By delivering clear, honest and 
fact-based messaging, KRBL not only enhances 
its brand value but also reinforces credibility 
among investors and stakeholders. Responsible 
communication serves as a vital platform to 
showcase KRBL’s positive social and environmental 
contributions, strengthening its social license to 
operate and aligning with the growing expectations 
of conscious consumers. It enables the company to 
convey its purpose-driven initiatives, sustainability 
efforts and product integrity in a way that fosters 
deeper engagement and trust.
Moreover, strict adherence to advertising and 
labelling regulations ensures legal compliance, 
significantly reducing the risk of financial penalties, 
reputational damage and regulatory action. KRBL’s 
commitment to responsible marketing reflects its 
broader ethos of ethical governance, stakeholder 
accountability and long-term value creation.
	
The Company has adopted a stringent internal 
review mechanism to ensure all marketing 
communications are fact-based, ethical and 
compliant with applicable regulations (e.g., 
FSSAI, ASCI Code of Conduct).
	
The marketing and sales teams are 
regularly 
trained 
on 
responsible 
communication standards and evolving 
regulatory frameworks.

4.
Health, Safety 
and Well-Being
R
KRBL identifies Health, Safety and Well-Being as a 
key material ESG risk due to its impact on Employees, 
operations, 
supply 
chain 
and 
surrounding 
communities. Ensuring a safe work environment 
reduces 
turnover 
rate 
of 
Employees, 
boosts 
productivity and enhances brand reputation. It also 
helps prevent supply chain disruptions, community 
health risks and legal liabilities. By prioritizing health 
and safety across its operations, KRBL mitigates these 
risks and supports long-term business sustainability.
	
Promotes employee well-being through 
health camps, mental wellness initiatives, 
hygienic workplace practices and access to 
medical facilities.
	
Tracks health and safety KPIs such as 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) 
to 
monitor 
performance 
and 
drive 
continuous improvement.
	
A comprehensive risk assessment at Units 
is conducted for identifying gaps if any in 
protection of young Workers, forced labour,

5.
Climate Change
R
Climate change poses a significant and growing risk 
to KRBL given our deep integration with agriculture—a 
sector highly vulnerable to changing weather 
patterns, rising temperatures and water scarcity. 
As a leading global producer of Basmati rice, our 
operations, farmer networks and supply chains are 
directly impacted by climate variability, affecting 
crop yields, quality and long-term sustainability.
Recognizing climate change as a material topic 
enables KRBL to proactively address these risks 
by 
investing 
in 
climate-resilient 
agricultural 
practices, sustainable water management and 
low-emission technologies across our value chain. 
It also strengthens our ability to meet evolving 
stakeholder expectations, regulatory requirements 
and 
international 
commitments 
related 
to 
environmental responsibility.
Moreover, integrating climate action into our core 
business strategy reinforces KRBL’s reputation as 
a 
responsible 
agri-business 
leader, 
enhances 
investor confidence and ensures long-term business 
continuity in a rapidly changing global landscape. 
Addressing climate change is not just a compliance 
imperative—but a strategic opportunity to future-
proof our operations and create enduring value for all 
stakeholders.
	
Sustainable Energy Use: At Company’s two 
primary Units, rice husk is the primary energy 
source, offering a cleaner, more efficient 
alternative to fossil fuels and reducing 
dependence on grid electricity.
	
Renewable Power Generation: A new 3.9 MW 
turbine installed at the one of the Units aims to 
fully eliminate reliance on grid power.
	
Emission Monitoring: Regular DG stack 
emission testing is conducted to ensure 
compliance and environmental safety.
	
Energy Efficiency Gains: KRBL has achieved 
a approx 35% reduction in grid electricity 
consumption, reflecting strong energy 
optimization measures.
	
Carbon Footprint Reduction: A approx 35% 
reduction in Scope 2 emissions demonstrates 
KRBL’s commitment to sustainable operations 
and cleaner energy transition.
Negative
6.
Waste  
Management
O
Waste management is an opportunity for KRBL to 
reduce environmental impact by effectively handling 
agricultural, packaging and wastewater waste. 
Sustainable practices help conserve resources, cut 
disposal costs and enhance KRBL’s reputation as 
an environmentally responsible company, fostering 
stakeholder trust and supporting long-term growth 
aligned with sustainable development goals.
	
Through Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR), KRBL proactively collected, recycled, or 
safely disposed of over 3,320 tonnes of plastic 
waste in FY 2024-25. This was achieved through 
collaboration with waste pickers, collection 
centres and recycling facilities. As a food grain 
company relying mainly on plastic packaging, 
KRBL has maintained its commitment as a 
plastic-neutral brand since 2019, consistently 
meeting EPR guidelines annually.
	
*This pertains to domestic market.
	
KRBL Limited has implemented a Food Loss 
and Waste Reduction Policy to promote 
sustainability and resource efficiency. The 
policy emphasizes preventing food waste 
through better production planning and 
inventory management, maximizing resource 
use and minimizing waste.
	
We also engage with Employees, suppliers and 
partners to foster a culture of sustainability, 
while responsibly managing surplus materials 
through recycling and reuse in compliance with 
local regulations.

Sustainable  
Packaging
O
Sustainable packaging presents an opportunity 
for KRBL to reduce environmental impact by using 
eco-friendly materials and minimizing waste. This 
approach conserves resources, lowers costs and 
strengthens KRBL’s reputation as a responsible, 
environmentally 
conscious 
company, 
boosting 
stakeholder trust and support.
	
By 2025-26, we aim to integrate 30% 
recycled plastics into Category 1 products, 
primarily PET jars and 10% recycled content 
into Category 2 products, including flexible 
packaging materials.
	
KRBL introduced 30% recycled PET in rigid 
packaging to reduce plastic usage and support 
sustainable packaging practices. 
	
Optimized pack size for 6kg SKUs (IG Select 
and IG Super), resulting in an annual plastic 
reduction of approximately 1.4 MT
	
We also reduced the pack size of 10lbs SKUs 
resulting in yearly plastic reduction of approx. 
1.5 MT
Positive
8.
Climate  
Resilient  
Agriculture
R
Climate-resilient agriculture is a key risk for KRBL 
due to its reliance on weather-sensitive operations. 
By adopting practices that adapt to climate 
change, conserve resources and reduce emissions, 
KRBL mitigates risks like lower yields, higher costs 
and reputational damage. Prioritizing climate 
resilience supports sustainable development and 
strengthens KRBL’s long-term sustainability.
KRBL has partnered with IARI, PUSA to develop 
high-yield, disease-resistant and climate-resilient 
rice varieties. This collaboration combines IARI’s 
research with KRBL’s industry expertise to promote 
sustainable farming and deliver superior quality 
rice to consumers.
Negative
9.
Community  
Relations
O
Community relations present an opportunity for KRBL 
to enhance social impact, stakeholder engagement 
and reputation by adopting sustainable practices. 
Initiatives include supporting local farmers, investing 
in community programs and addressing stakeholder 
concerns. Prioritizing these efforts aligns KRBL with 
sustainable development goals and promotes 
positive community development.
During the FY 2024-25, the Company has spent 
approx. ₹10.85 Crores towards various CSR initiatives 
for eradicating hunger, poverty and malnutrition, 
promoting health care and promotion of education.
Approx 2,400+ beneficiaries were supported during 
the FY 2024-25 through various other CSR initiatives.
Positive
10.
Sustainable  
Sourcing
O
Sustainable sourcing is a key opportunity for KRBL, 
given its diverse supply chain involving farmers, 
suppliers and distributors. By adopting sustainable 
practices—such 
as 
promoting 
eco-friendly 
agriculture, minimizing supply chain waste and 
ensuring fair labour—KRBL reduces its environmental 
impact, supports worker welfare and strengthens its 
reputation. Prioritizing sustainable sourcing aligns 
KRBL with sustainable development goals, enhances 
stakeholder engagement and fosters a more 
responsible and equitable supply chain.
	
One of the Unit of the Company is SEDEX

GOVERNANCE, LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT
7.	
Statement by Director responsible for the business 
responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements.
At KRBL, sustainability is not merely an initiative but a 
fundamental tenet that guides our strategic directions 
and day-to-day operations. Our ESG-focused 
approach stands as a key strategic differentiator, 
reinforcing our position as a key leader while aligning 
seamlessly with our vision to create enduring 
value for all our stakeholders. This comprehensive 
commitment transcends compliance, driving 
innovation and resilience across our business.
By embedding environmental stewardship, social 
responsibility and exemplary governance into 
every facet of our organization, we demonstrate our 
unwavering dedication to long-term sustainable 
growth. We remain resolute in our responsibility 
towards all our stakeholders, i.e farmers, customers, 
Employees, value chain partners, communities 
and shareholders, fostering inclusive progress 
and delivering measurable positive impact in an 
increasingly complex environment. In this Financial 
Year, We continued to remain deeply conscious of our 
responsibility towards environmental sustainability 
as well as our obligations towards society and our 
stakeholders at large. During the year, we successfully 
set up a new 3.9 MW Turbine at one of our units which 
aims to fully eliminate the reliance of the Company on 
grid electricity. In our operations, we achieved a 35% 
reduction in grid electricity consumption during the 
year reflecting strong energy optimization measures 
and 35% reduction in Scope 2 emissions reflecting 
our commitment to cleaner energy transition. 
These initiatives reflect Company’s deep-rooted 
commitment to sustainability, transforming by-
products like rice husk into energy, while embracing 
solar and wind as strategic assets in its long-term 
climate roadmap. In this fiscal year alone, KRBL’s 
wind and solar plants enabled carbon offsetting 
of approximately 1.8 lakh tonnes of CO₂, which is 
equivalent to the annual carbon sequestration of 
nearly 1.5 million mature trees.
Through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), KRBL 
proactively collected, recycled, or safely disposed 
of over 3,320 tonnes of plastic waste in FY 2024-25. 
This was achieved through collaboration with waste 
pickers, collection centres and recycling facilities. As 
a food manufacturing company relying mainly on 
plastic packaging, we maintained its commitment 
as a plastic-neutral brand since 2019, consistently 
meeting EPR guidelines annually. We also introduced 
30% recycled PET in rigid packaging to reduce plastic 
usage and support sustainable packaging practices. 
We further aim to integrate 30% recycled plastics 
into Category 1 products, primarily PET jars and 10% 
recycled content into Category 2 products, including 
flexible packaging materials.
We continue to enhance our sustainability 
performance and disclosure quality to achieve a 
higher rating under the S&P Global ESG evaluation 
framework by adoption of GRI Standards, developing 
a company wide ESG roadmap integrating 
sustainability into core business operations, 
governance and value chain management. Your

Enhancing seed quality is a critical step in ensuring robust crop yields 
and sustainable agriculture. By investing in high-quality, certified seeds 
with superior genetic traits—such as improved disease resistance, 
better drought tolerance and higher productivity—farmers are better 
positioned to achieve consistent and profitable harvests. This effort 
begins with rigorous seed selection and breeding programs, followed by 
proper storage and handling to preserve viability. 
In tandem with improved seed distribution, conducting educational 
sessions for farmers on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) is essential. 
These sessions empower farmers with knowledge on soil health 
management, water conservation, crop rotation, proper fertilizer 
application and safe pesticide use. When GAP principles are integrated 
with the provision of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) kits, which 
typically include tools for pest identification, biological control agents, 
pheromone traps and low-toxicity pesticides, farmers are better 
equipped to manage pests sustainably.

a)	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, KRBL is deeply committed to sustainable sourcing practices that align with global standards on human 
rights and ethical business conduct. We uphold the core principles of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) on Business and Human Rights, embedding them across our procurement and operational frameworks.
Demonstrating our leadership in ethical trade, one of KRBL’s manufacturing units is SEDEX-certified (Supplier 
Ethical Data Exchange), reflecting our transparent and responsible sourcing mechanisms. Notably, KRBL is 
the first organization in the rice industry to undergo the BRCGS Ethical Trade and Responsible Sourcing (ETRS) 
assessment, achieving a perfect 5 out of 5 score—a testament to our unwavering commitment to ethical labour 
practices and social accountability.
We actively promote fair labour practices, safe and inclusive working environments and respect for human 
rights throughout our supply chain. Our procurement protocols include routine monitoring of raw material and 
packaging material suppliers against well-defined social compliance parameters, ensuring they adhere to 
standards on worker welfare, ethical conduct and environmental responsibility.
KRBL’s manufacturing units are guided by the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, which reinforces our 
focus on integrity, equity and human dignity at every level of production. Additionally, our comprehensive 
Sustainable Sourcing Policy ensures that we prioritize suppliers who integrate sustainability into their core 
business operations. Through these initiatives, KRBL not only fulfils its responsibility as an ethical enterprise but 
also contributes to building a transparent, resilient and inclusive agricultural supply chain.
	
b)	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
At KRBL, responsible sourcing is a strategic priority embedded within our procurement practices. We are 
committed to fostering inclusive growth by prioritizing the procurement of goods and services from local 
sources, including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and other small-scale producers, wherever 
feasible. This approach not only strengthens local economies but also promotes equitable value distribution 
across the supply chain.
Annual Report 2024-25
16
While the complexity and diversity of our operations make it challenging to quantify the exact percentage of 
sustainably sourced inputs, we maintain stringent expectations for our suppliers. All vendors are encouraged—
and increasingly expected—to align with our standards on product quality, food safety, environmental 
sustainability and social responsibility. These parameters include ethical labour practices, human rights 
protections, waste management and the creation of safe and fair working environments.
Through continuous engagement, KRBL works collaboratively with its supplier base to raise awareness and 
drive improvements in sustainability performance. This proactive approach ensures that our sourcing decisions 
contribute not just to business excellence, but also to a more responsible, inclusive and resilient supply chain.

a structured electronic waste (e-waste) management system in line 
with our ESG objectives and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
All e-waste generated is responsibly collected, recycled and safely 
disposed of through government-accredited e-waste processing 
partners. This initiative supports our commitment to SDG 12 — promoting 
responsible consumption and production — while minimizing 
environmental impact and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
Yes, KRBL is fully compliant with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations under the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016, reaffirming our commitment to sustainable and responsible packaging. As a company 
whose primary products—food grains—require plastic packaging, we have proactively embraced the ‘Replace with 
EPR’ approach to manage downstream plastic waste effectively. In FY 2024–25, KRBL successfully collected, recycled, 
or co-processed over 3,320 tonnes of plastic waste through strategic partnerships with certified collection centres 
and recycling/co-processing plants.
Our EPR strategy, implemented through a dedicated Waste Management Agency (WMA), has ensured responsible 
recovery across India, covering Category 1: Rigid Plastic (90 MT), Category 2: Flexible Plastic (3,230 MT). The company 
also continues to explore opportunities to increase the share of recycled plastic in product packaging to further 
minimize our environmental footprint. All compliance, including credit transfers and annual returns, is meticulously 
managed through the official EPR portal, reinforcing KRBL’s leadership in responsible plastic waste management.

Sustainability is at the heart of our operations and we are committed to making meaningful strides in reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through a targeted, multi-faceted approach to renewable energy, we are making 
a measurable impact:
Solar Power Initiatives: We have invested in extensive solar installations, enabling us to generate clean, renewable 
energy and significantly reduce our dependence on traditional grid electricity.
Utilizing Residual Rice Husk: A by-product of our production process, residual rice husk is efficiently repurposed as a 
sustainable fuel, displacing fossil fuels such as coal and dramatically lowering GHG emissions from power generation.
By implementing these initiatives, more than 90% of the electricity consumed by KRBL for its manufacturing 
operations is sourced from renewable energy, significantly reducing our carbon footprint and contributing to our 
ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship.
