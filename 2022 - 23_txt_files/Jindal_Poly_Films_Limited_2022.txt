We at Jindal Poly Films Limited, recognize the critical importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors 
in driving sustainable business practices. As a part of our commitment to responsible business operations, we have 
integrated ESG considerations into our overall strategy and operations, ensuring that we are accountable for the impact we

Social responsibility is another fundamental aspect of our business. We strive to create a safe and inclusive workplace 
where diversity is celebrated, and all employees are treated with respect and fairness. We are dedicated to fostering 
a culture that promotes employee well-being, health, and safety. Our ongoing initiatives include providing training and 
development opportunities, implementing fair labor practices and ensuring effective health and safety measures across 
our operations. 
In terms of Governance, we uphold ethical standards and value transparency and accountability. We have implemented 
corporate governance practices that promote integrity and responsible decision-making throughout our organization. As 
a part of our governance framework, we regularly engage with our stakeholders, to understand their expectations and 
address their concerns.
Looking forward to the future, we are committed to have  various sustainability goals that align with international standards 
and best practices. Our roadmap includes initiatives to reduce our energy consumption, water usage, waste generation and 
find sustainable solutions to the challenges we face.

operations. The aim is to make the products in a manner that creates value while minimizing and mitigating its adverse 
impacts on the environment and society through all stages of its life cycle. The Company is determined to contribute to the 
improvement of human well-being and the preservation of the earth’s natural resources.

and strives to strictly adhere to the quality standards and controls of the raw materials and conforms the applicable national 
laws and regulations by conducting a regular review to improve upon the process of new technology development, deployment, 
and commercialization, as well as incorporating social, ethical, and environmental considerations.
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1. Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the
environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the
Company, respectively.

Details of improvements in 
environmental and social 
impacts
R&D
Jindal Poly Films Limited demonstrates a strong dedication to both sustainability and innovation, evident 
through its strategic endeavors that encompass a wide range of projects and partnerships. These initiatives 
are focused on enhancing recyclability, minimizing ecological footprints, and championing the use of 
renewable energy sources.
Capex
The expenses required to address potential environmental and social risks are seamlessly integrated into 
the company’s capital expenditures and research and development investments, making it iimpractical to 
isolate them separately.
2. Does the Company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
Yes, the Company has adequate procedure in place for sustainable sourcing. 
b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
The Company is committed to sourcing raw materials and other goods from reputable manufacturers having highest standards 
of quality and consistency. The Company has also implemented a robust Background Verification process of the vendors 
and partners to ensure they share our commitment to sustainability. Moreover, we are actively enhancing our commitment to 
sustainable sourcing and fortifying our ability to track and manage relevant data.
3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the end
of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The company strongly showcases its dedication to promoting environmental sustainability by effectively recycling and reusing 
most of its plastic waste generated internally. Operating as a B2B enterprise, the company sells its products to converters, 
brands, and  various distributors, which makes it somewhat challenging to track post-consumer waste. Nevertheless, the 
company has taken a proactive stance towards responsible disposal of electronic waste by partnering with E-Waste Recyclers 
India through their “Green Earth Programme.” Biennially, the company gathers electronic waste from its corporate office and 
entrusts it to E-Waste Recyclers for conscientious handling and proper disposal, obtaining a “Certificate of Destruction” as 
tangible proof of appropriate disposal procedures.
While the company’s initiatives in managing electronic waste are praiseworthy, it currently lacks specific protocols or methods 
for efficiently recovering plastic or hazardous waste materials beyond the mentioned program. Continual assessment and 
exploration of additional strategies to address these aspects could further elevate its commitment to sustainable practices.
