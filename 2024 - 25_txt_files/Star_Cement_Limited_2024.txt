Financial implications 
of the risk or 
opportunity (Indicate 
positive or negative 
implications)
1.
Climate 
change 
and GHG 
emissions
Risk
The cement industry 
is intrinsically carbon-
intensive, with 
process emissions 
from calcination and 
combustion emissions 
from kiln operations 
accounting for the bulk 
of Scope 1 emissions. 
Continued reliance on 
fossil fuels and clinker-
heavy production 
exposes the Company 
to rising transition 
risks—including stricter 
carbon regulations, 
carbon pricing and 
tightening emission 
thresholds under 
national and global 
climate frameworks. 
Simultaneously, 
physical risks are 
intensifying due to 
climate variability 
impacting quarrying 
schedules, logistics and 
water management at 
plant locations.
1.	
Commissioned 
a 12 MW Waste 
Heat Recovery 
System (WHRS) to 
utilize kiln exhaust 
gases, enhancing 
thermal efficiency 
and reducing 
grid electricity 
dependence.
2.	
Operationalized 
an Alternate Fuels 
and Raw Materials 
(AFR) processing 
unit to enable 
co-processing 
of industrial and 
municipal waste, 
lowering fossil fuel 
use and improving 
Thermal Substitution 
Rate (TSR).
3.	
Increased production 
of blended cements 
with lower clinker 
content to reduce 
process-related CO₂ 
emissions.
4.	
Increase investment 
in renewable energy.
Negative: 
This encompasses costs 
related to compliance, 
harm to reputation, 
higher operational 
expenditures, supply 
chain interruptions and 
effects on profitability 
and shareholder value.
2.
Waste 
management 
& circular 
economy
Opportunity
The cement kiln’s 
ability to safely co-
process a wide range 
of waste materials 
presents a strategic 
opportunity to drive 
circularity at scale. By 
integrating alternative 
fuels and raw materials 
into the production 
process, the Company 
reduces dependency 
on finite natural 
resources, lowers 
clinker factor and 
achieves meaningful
Not applicable
Positive:
1.	
Reduce material 
cost
2.	
Enhanced 
profitability

cuts in GHG emissions. 
This not only enhances 
cost efficiency and 
regulatory compliance 
but also positions the 
Company as a key 
player in supporting 
national circular 
economy and waste 
management goals.
3.
Biodiversity
Risk
Cement 
manufacturing, 
particularly limestone 
mining, has a direct 
interface with 
natural ecosystems 
and can result in 
habitat alteration, 
deforestation 
and disruption of 
local biodiversity. 
Operations located 
near ecologically 
sensitive zones or 
forested areas face 
heightened regulatory 
scrutiny, community 
opposition and 
reputational risks. 
Non-compliance 
with biodiversity 
impact assessments or 
conservation norms 
can lead to delays 
in project approvals, 
penalties or even 
operational shutdowns.
Implemented 
a Biodiversity 
Management Plan to 
protect and restore 
natural habitats around 
the plant operations.
Negative:
Punitive measures may 
be taken from regulatory 
bodies in case of non-
compliance.
4.
Water 
management
Opportunity
Operating in high-
rainfall regions like 
Meghalaya offers the 
Company a strategic 
opportunity to harness 
and manage abundant 
surface runoff through 
structured water 
conservation efforts. 
Initiatives such as 
constructing reservoirs, 
implementing 
rainwater harvesting 
and promoting
Not applicable
Positive: 
Implementing water 
efficient technologies 
and practices can lead 
to significant cost 
savings by reducing 
water consumption, 
wastewater treatment 
costs and energy 
expenses associated 
with water pumping and 
treatment.

community-based 
drip irrigation systems 
help optimize water 
capture, reduce 
reliance on external 
sources and enhance 
water availability 
for both operational 
and local agricultural 
use. These efforts 
strengthen climate 
resilience, support 
community livelihoods 
and reinforce the 
Company’s long-term 
water stewardship 
goals.
5.
Air emission
Risk
Cement production 
generates significant 
air emissions, 
including particulate 
matter, nitrogen 
oxides (NOx), sulfur 
dioxide (SO₂) and 
volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs). 
These emissions, 
if unregulated 
or inadequately 
controlled, can lead 
to environmental 
degradation, 
regulatory penalties 
and reputational 
damage. Stringent 
environmental 
regulations, such as 
emission standards 
and air quality norms, 
are being enforced 
globally and non-
compliance can 
result in operational 
disruptions, fines and 
even legal action.
1.	
Adherence to 
national and state 
regulations is 
ensured through 
the installation 
of Continuous 
Emission Monitoring 
Systems (CEMS) to 
track and manage 
emissions in real 
time.
2.	
Continuous 
Ambient Air Quality 
Monitoring Stations 
(CAAQMS) have 
been set up to 
monitor air quality 
in and around plant 
locations, ensuring 
compliance with air 
quality standards.
3.	
Implementation 
of advanced 
air filtration 
and scrubbing 
technologies to 
reduce particulate 
matter and gaseous 
emissions during 
production 
processes.
Negative:
Punitive actions may 
be taken by regulatory 
authorities in case of 
non-compliance.

ensuring that the 
environmental impacts 
of cement products are 
minimized throughout 
their lifecycle—from 
production to disposal. 
By focusing on the 
use of alternative 
materials, reducing 
the carbon intensity 
of products and 
promoting recycling 
in construction, 
the Company can 
deliver lower-impact 
products that meet 
the growing demand 
for environmentally 
conscious solutions. 
This strategy also 
positions the Company 
to align with global 
circular economy 
trends, reduce waste 
and support regulatory 
compliance, while 
strengthening 
customer relationships 
and meeting the 
increasing demand for 
low-carbon building 
materials.
Not applicable
Positive:

drive revenue growth 
by attracting eco-
conscious customers, 
reduce raw material 
costs through the 
use of alternative and 
recycled materials and 
mitigate regulatory 
compliance costs, 
ultimately enhancing 
profitability and market 
competitiveness.

lapses may result in 
legal, reputational 
and operational 
consequences. 
Ensuring strict 
safety protocols, 
regular training, use

Governance, leadership and oversight
7.	 Statement by Director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related 
challenges, targets and achievements.
Dear Stakeholders,
The global sustainability landscape continues to evolve rapidly, shaped by pressing climate challenges, supply 
chain disruptions, rising stakeholder expectations and a call for businesses to take greater accountability for their 
environmental and social impacts. Amid this backdrop, the imperative for companies to align profitability with 
responsibility has never been stronger.
In India, the macroeconomic outlook remains resilient. As one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, India 
is witnessing robust infrastructure expansion, catalyzed by public investments, rural-urban integration and green 
transition goals. The cement sector plays a pivotal role in this progress, acting as both an enabler of development 
and a stakeholder in the country’s low-carbon transition.
Within this context, Star Cement Limited remains steadfast in its commitment to responsible growth. We recognize 
that our operational success is intrinsically linked to our performance across Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) dimensions. FY 2024-25 marked significant strides in our sustainability journey, underpinned by targeted 
actions, community-centric programmes and strategic partnerships.
On the environmental front, we continued our shift toward low-carbon solutions, with ~89% of our total sales 
comprising blended cement, thereby supporting emissions reduction across the construction value chain. We 
commissioned a 12 MW Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) and an Alternate Fuels and Raw Materials (AFR) 
processing unit, enhancing energy efficiency and enabling circularity. 
Water conservation has been a core focus area. We constructed a new reservoir at our Lumshnong unit and 
facilitated community-based rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation systems to support local agriculture. These 
initiatives reflect our broader ambition to build climate-resilient communities and reduce our water footprint.
In the social domain, we continued to invest in high-impact CSR programmes across health and sanitation, 
education, livelihood and skill building, rural development and emergency relief. We are humbled to be recognized 
as the “Best CSR Performer 2024” at the 2nd North-East CSR Forum, a testament to our deep-rooted commitment to 
inclusive development.
We were also honored at the Exchange4Media Indian Marketing Awards 2024, listed among the Top 50 Companies 
to Work For, reflecting our employee-first culture and efforts to build an inclusive, diverse and high-performing 
workplace.
Strong governance forms the bedrock of our sustainability ethos. Our Board and leadership teams uphold a culture 
of transparency, integrity and ethical decision-making. We have strengthened our ESG oversight, integrated risk 
and compliance mechanisms and ensured adherence to applicable laws and voluntary frameworks. Through 
continual stakeholder engagement and materiality-driven strategies, we remain agile and responsive to emerging 
priorities.
We understand that our future success lies in balancing growth with responsibility. I extend my sincere appreciation 
to our employees, suppliers, customers, communities, partners, investors & shareholders and other stakeholders—
your support and trust inspire us to push boundaries and lead with purpose.
As we look ahead, we are committed to embedding ESG principles deeper into our strategy, operations and culture 
ensuring we contribute meaningfully to India’s development while creating long-term value for all stakeholders.

and Anti-Corruption Policy that ensures compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations. The Policy 
reinforces a zero-tolerance approach towards bribery, corruption and other unethical practices across all levels of

standards lies with everyone, the Company encourages proactive vigilance and awareness among all stakeholders.
Concerns related to suspected misconduct, fraud, bribery, corruption or any unethical behaviour can be reported

Yes.
The Company has established robust processes to manage and avoid conflicts of interest involving members of 
the Board and Senior Management. A comprehensive Code of Conduct for Directors and Senior Management is 
in place, which clearly outlines expectations regarding ethical behaviour and prohibits involvement in any activity, 
business or relationship that could conflict with or adversely impact the Company’s interests.
As part of this framework, all Directors and employees are expected to ensure that personal interests do not interfere 
with their professional responsibilities or the interests of the Company. They are expressly restricted from engaging 
in any business, commercial relationship or transaction with individuals or entities that are parties to dealings 
with the Company. Furthermore, no Director, Senior Management Executive or employee is permitted to exploit 
opportunities that arise in the course of their association with the Company for personal gain—either directly or 
indirectly.
To further strengthen governance, the Company has instituted a formal process wherein Directors are required to 
submit an annual declaration at the beginning of each financial year, disclosing any affiliations, interests or external 
positions that may give rise to a conflict. In the event of any change during the year, they must promptly notify the 
Board through an updated declaration.

10.	Health & safety management system
a.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system
Yes. The Company has implemented a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
in line with ISO 45001:2018 across all its manufacturing facilities. Safety Policy is in place at the locations, 
with clearly defined roles and responsibility mapping. The system is further supported by adherence to OHSAS 
standards, deployment of CAPA mechanisms and continuous monitoring to ensure compliance and proactive 
risk mitigation.
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine 
basis by the entity?
Star Cement Limited has implemented a robust Occupational Health and Safety framework to proactively 
identify and manage work-related hazards across both routine and non-routine operations. Comprehensive 
risk assessments are conducted throughout the year by qualified professionals using recognized methodologies 
such as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA). These assessments inform the development of risk 
mitigation strategies and Standard Operating Procedures, which cover engineering controls, administrative 
practices and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
For non-routine activities, the company mandates the issuance of work permits and conducts detailed risk 
assessments prior to task execution. For machine-related hazards, safeguards such as machine guarding 
and Lockout-Tagout (LOTO) systems are in place. In work-at-height scenarios, scaffolding is used, with red 
(unsafe to access) and green (safe to access) tagging systems. Night-time operations are supported by adequate 
illumination, while road safety within the premises is managed through speed limits, speed breakers, and 
fluorescent safety strips to minimize vehicular accidents.
All safety related SOPs provide clear guidance on safe task execution and emergency response. Employees 
receive targeted training programs and workshops to build competency in hazard recognition and mitigation. 
In case of any incidents, a structured Why-Why analysis is undertaken to determine root causes and all 
corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are documented and reviewed by department heads with oversight 
from the safety team.
c.	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)
Yes, the Company has established a well-defined process that empowers employees and workers to report 
work-related hazards and withdraw from potentially unsafe conditions without hesitation. All reports and 
observations are channelled through the respective Heads of Department (HODs), who facilitate open 
discussions and ensure timely review and resolution. These discussions often trigger Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessments (HIRA), allowing the organization to proactively evaluate risks and implement appropriate 
control measures. Employees are actively encouraged to step in, raise concerns, and address unsafe behaviours 
or conditions, enabling a culture of safety ownership and prevention.
d.	 Do the employees have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
Yes, Star Cement Limited ensures access to comprehensive non-occupational medical and healthcare services 
for its employees and workers. The Company operates onsite occupational health centres staffed with full-time 
doctors and equipped with first-aid facilities across all its locations. In case of serious health issues, employees 
are transferred to nearby hospitals. The Company also provides round the clock ambulances for emergency 
transportation.
Regular medical check-ups are conducted, including re-evaluation upon return from medical leave. In 
addition, the Company extends support through ESI coverage, health insurance and financial assistance for 
medical expenses, reinforcing its commitment to employee well-being both at and beyond the workplace.

Note: IN FY 2024-25, no LTI, TRI, fatalities and high consequence work related injury or ill-health are reported.
12.	Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
Star Cement Limited regularly conducts health and safety training sessions across all its locations, covering topics 
such as working at height, confined space entry, fire safety, permit to work, proper use of PPE, Lockout–Tagout 
(LOTO), electrical safety, material handling and lifting, machine guarding, accident prevention techniques, hot 
work safety, excavation safety, and behaviour-based safety. Classroom-based learning and practical demonstrations 
are used to improve safety knowledge and on-ground application.
To build a culture of early hazard reporting, the Company conducts monthly near-miss awareness programs at 
all units. In FY 2024-25, 12 dedicated sessions were conducted on near miss awareness building. Additionally, a 
unique incentive program has been introduced, wherein employees who accurately identify and report near-miss 
incidents are awarded with safety coupons. These reports are verified jointly by the respective Head of Department 
and the safety officer, reinforcing the value of vigilance and accountability.
As part of its employee motivation and recognition strategy, Star Cement has introduced the “Safety Star Award – 
Golden Helmet” to acknowledge workers and staff who demonstrate exemplary commitment to safety procedures 
and protocols. This initiative not only encourages compliance but also imparts positive reinforcement for safe 
behaviour.
The Company also prioritizes employee well-being through accessible healthcare services. Onsite occupational 
health centres are manned by qualified doctors and employees have access to nearby empanelled hospitals. In 
the case of medical leave, workers undergo re-checkups to ensure they are fit to resume duties. Complementing 
medical services, the company promotes wellness through fitness programs and sports activities aimed at reducing 
stress and supporting healthy lifestyles.
To ensure continuous safety improvement, a structured accident investigation protocol is in place using the Why-
Why analysis technique. This is again backed up with root cause analysis and the development of corrective and 
preventive action plans (CAPA). All incidents are reviewed at the departmental level, with oversight from the central 
safety team, ensuring implementation and verification of actions taken.
The Company ensures safety through layers of safety reviews. The company has initiated inter-plant audits, 
enabling cross-learning through team rotations across different plant locations.

10.	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your 
products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Star Cement Limited has adopted a comprehensive waste management strategy aligned with its vision of 
minimizing landfill waste through sustainable and compliant practices. To enable this, the Company has 
developed and implemented detailed Waste Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that guide the proper handling, 
segregation, storage, and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, in adherence to all applicable 
environmental regulations.
At the plant level, dedicated and clearly labelled scrap yards have been set up to store hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste separately, ensuring safe handling and ease of traceability. Hazardous waste is managed through CPCB/SPCB-
authorized vendors, while non-hazardous waste is handled via local recyclers and vendors, as per regulatory norms.
In alignment with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, the Company fulfils its Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) obligations for post-consumer plastic packaging waste. It collaborates with authorized recyclers 
to ensure systematic collection, channelization and environmentally sound disposal or recycling of plastic waste.
Importantly, Star Cement Limited holds valid permissions for the use of Alternate Fuels and Raw Materials (AFR) 
and operates a system for the co-processing of select waste materials in its cement kilns. These materials are 
subjected to complete thermal destruction under high temperatures, leaving no residue and ensuring a compliant, 
scientific, and environmentally sound method of waste disposal. The use of AFR as part of the Company’s waste 
management framework supports the dual objective of waste minimization and reduced environmental impact 
from external disposal methods like landfilling or incineration.

following format:
Yes, Star Cement Limited is actively engaged in initiatives aimed at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, 
in alignment with India’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. Recognising the escalating impact 
of climate change, the Company integrates climate action into its core business strategy, focusing on reducing 
energy consumption and associated emissions across its operations. Key initiatives under the Company’s low-
carbon transition strategy include:
Energy Efficiency Measures:
Star Cement Limited continuously invests in energy conservation through the adoption of advanced technologies 
and upgrades to existing infrastructure. These measures are aimed at improving energy efficiency and reducing 
the overall energy intensity of its operations.
Integration of Green Energy:
The Company places a strong emphasis on transitioning to renewable energy sources to enhance energy security 
and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. This not only supports decarbonisation goals but also provides a hedge 
against rising fuel costs.
Star Cement has installed a 12 MW Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) at its Lumshnong plant, in addition to an 
existing 12.3 MW WHRS capacity, significantly reducing reliance on coal-based power.
Furthermore, the Company has commissioned an Alternative Fuel Feeding System, enabling the utilisation of 
waste-derived fuels (RDF) and biomass, further supporting emission reductions through resource circularity.
Clinker Factor Reduction:
Reducing the clinker content in cement production is a strategic priority for Star Cement. By substituting clinker 
with supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag, the Company lowers CO₂ emissions associated 
with limestone calcination.
In FY 2024–25, approximately 89% of the Company’s cement production was comprised of blended cement.
As a result of these efforts, the clinker factor was reduced to 67.2% contributing meaningfully to the Company’s 
overall carbon footprint reduction.
