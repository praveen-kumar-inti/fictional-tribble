Production of SPCC with flue gas and lime
The Process of Producing SPCC involves the following steps, 1. Feeding Process: - Quick lime (Cao) pebbles feeding to the lime 
Silo by using a Feeding system. 2. Slacking & Screening Process: - Water & Quicklime are mixed in the slaker to make Hydrate 
slurry. This process involved the following exothermic reaction. Cao + H2O ïƒ Ca (OH)2 3. Carbonation & Screening Process: 
Hydrate Slurry added in the Pressure Reactor. Flue gas from JK’s Lime Kiln is purified to remove all particulates as well as all SOx 
and NOx. The cleaned flue gas is then injected to the lime slurry. The CO2 in the flue gas then reacts with the lime slurry to 
produce calcium carbonate while allowing CO2 free gas to escape. Once the conditions indicating the end of the reaction, the 
SPCC product is drained from the reactor and screened by 325# mesh & transfer to the product tank. This process involved the 
following exothermic reaction. Ca (OH)2 + CO2 ïƒ CaCO3 + H2O This SPCC product is then provided to JK to incorporate into

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Management and disposal of the solid waste and hazardous waste materials is as follows -
	
Non-Hazardous Waste:
1. 	 Fly Ash: Fly ash generated as a by-product of our operations is carefully collected in ash silos and transferred into the closed 
trucks. We have established protocols for the safe handling and transportation of fly ash to authorized facilities for reuse in 
applications such as cement manufacturing and construction activities, in accordance with applicable regulations.
2. 	 ETP Primary Sludge: The primary sludge generated from our Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) undergoes a treatment process 
to remove contaminants and is subsequently utilized as a raw material in the production of boards. We have established 
contractual agreements with authorized vendors for the sale and utilization of ETP primary sludge, ensuring compliance 
with environmental regulations and promoting resource efficiency.
3. 	 Lime Grit: Lime grit, a by-product of our industrial processes, is collected and stored in designated containment areas to 
prevent environmental contamination. We have implemented measures to minimize the generation of lime grit and ensure 
its safe handling and disposal in compliance with regulatory requirements.
	
Hazardous Waste:
1. 	 Used Oil: Used oil generated from our operations is collected and stored in designated containers equipped with secondary 
containment systems to prevent spills or leaks. We have established contracts with licensed hazardous waste management 
companies for the safe disposal and recycling of used oil, ensuring compliance with hazardous waste regulations and 
environmental protection standards.
140 | JK Paper Limited
2. 	 Oil-Soaked Cotton Waste: Oil-soaked cotton waste is segregated and stored in designated containers to prevent 
contamination of other waste streams. We work with authorized hazardous waste management vendors for the proper 
disposal of oil-soaked cotton waste, adhering to regulatory requirements and best practices for hazardous waste 
management.
3. 	 Empty Carbuoys: Empty carbuoys are thoroughly cleaned and rinsed to remove any residual hazardous materials before 
being sent for recycling or disposal. We ensure proper handling and transportation of empty carbuoys to authorized 
recycling facilities or waste disposal sites, in compliance with applicable regulations and industry standards.

Production of 
SPCC with flue gas 
and lime
The Process of Producing SPCC involves the 
following steps, 1. Feeding Process: - Quick lime 
(Cao) pebbles feeding to the lime Silo by using a 
Feeding system. 2. Slacking & Screening Process: - 
Water & Quicklime are mixed in the slaker to make 
Hydrate slurry. This process involved the following 
exothermic reaction. Cao + H2O ïƒ Ca (OH)2 
3. Carbonation & Screening Process: Hydrate Slurry 
added in the Pressure Reactor. Flue gas from JK’s 
Lime Kiln is purified to remove all particulates as 
well as all SOx and NOx. The cleaned flue gas is 
then injected to the lime slurry. The CO2 in the 
flue gas then reacts with the lime slurry to produce 
calcium carbonate while allowing CO2 free gas to 
escape. Once the conditions indicating the end 
of the reaction, the SPCC product is drained from 
the reactor and screened by 325# mesh & transfer 
to the product tank. This process involved the 
following exothermic reaction. Ca (OH)2 + CO2 ïƒ 
CaCO3 + H2O This SPCC product is then provided 
to JK to incorporate into their paper products, thus 
sequestering the CO2 into a marketable product.
We have sequestered 
approximately 16057 
metric tons of CO2 
from JK’s process to 
produce PCC which 
is used as a filler in 
paper manufacturing 
process.
