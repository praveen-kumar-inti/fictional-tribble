Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Premier Energies Limited is committed to upholding human rights and ensuring a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment.
	
To support this, we have established a robust Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
The ICC serves as a dedicated body to address and resolve concerns related to human rights, workplace conduct, and integrity.
	
We actively foster a culture where employees and stakeholders are encouraged to voice concerns without fear of retaliation or 
discrimination. The ICC ensures that all reported issues are investigated promptly, handled with sensitivity and confidentiality, and 
resolved through fair and transparent processes.
	
Premier Energies Limited maintains a strict non-retaliation policy, ensuring that no employee faces adverse consequences for 
raising genuine concerns. This reinforces our commitment to accountability, fairness, and the protection of individual rights 
within the workplace.
9.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. Premier Energies Limited integrates human rights requirements into all business agreements and contracts. Our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, which forms an integral part of our contractual framework, outlines clear expectations related to labor and human 
rights, including the prohibition of forced and child labor, promotion of fair wages and working conditions, non-discrimination, and 
respect for freedom of association.
	
Before boarding any new supplier or partner, we conduct ESG due diligence that includes an assessment of human rights 
compliance across the value chain. This is in line with our commitment to ethical and sustainable sourcing, as well as adherence to 
internationally recognized standards such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Conventions.
	
The Supplier Code of Conduct is a binding document that suppliers must acknowledge and adopt across their own supply chains, 
ensuring cascading compliance. Non-compliance may result in suspension or termination of the business relationship.

Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback. 
	
Mechanisms to Receive and Respond to Consumer Complaints and Feedback
	
Premier Energies Limited has a defined mechanism for receiving, evaluating, and addressing consumer complaints and feedback. 
Complaints are typically routed through the service team—either directly from clients or via the sales team.
	
Upon receipt, each complaint is acknowledged within 2–3 working days, and a claim form is shared with the client to document the 
issue. Preliminary evidence is requested to validate the concern.
	
Based on the evidence provided, the internal team determines the appropriate course of action, which may include: 
 
 
Repair of defective modules
 
 
Replacement of the affected product
 
 
Issuance of a Credit Note
 
 
Rejection of the claim (with proper justification)
	
The standard resolution timeframe ranges from 5 to 7 working days, subject to the availability and clarity of evidence.
	
Resolution Process:
	
For repairable issues, engineers are deputed to the client site for on-site servicing.
	
In other cases, claims are evaluated based on the submitted evidence; additional documentation may be requested if needed.
	
For complex or unclear cases, an on-site verification is conducted before proceeding.
	
Following the site visit (if applicable), a detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) report is 
prepared and shared with the client.
	
After resolution, a feedback form is sent to the client to assess their satisfaction with the handling of the complaint, thereby helping 
to strengthen our service responsiveness and customer relationship.
	
This structured approach ensures transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in consumer grievance redressal

To 
The Board of Directors of 
PREMIER ENERGIES LIMITED
1.	
We have undertaken to perform reasonable assurance 
engagement, for PREMIER ENERGIES LIMITED (the 
“Company”) vide our engagement letter dated April 3, 2025, 
in respect of the agreed Sustainability Information listed 
below (the “Identified Sustainability Information”) for the 
year ended March 31, 2025 in accordance with the Criteria 
stated in paragraph 3 below. This Sustainability Information 
is included in the Company’s Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (the “BRSR” or the “Report”) included 
within the Annual Report of the Company for the year ended 
March 31, 2025. This engagement was conducted by a 
multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, 
environmental engineers and specialists.
2.	
Identified Sustainability Information
	
Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the Identified 
Sustainability Information listed in the Appendix I to our 
report. The reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed 
in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR 
with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective 
questions of the BRSR, where applicable.
3.	
Criteria
	
The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified

4.	
Management’s Responsibility
	
The Company’s management is responsible for selecting 
or 
establishing 
suitable 
criteria 
for 
preparing 
the 
Sustainability Information including the reporting boundary 
of the Report, taking into account applicable laws and 
regulations, if any, related to reporting on the Sustainability 
Information, identification of key aspects, engagement with 
stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the 
Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the 
preparation of the Report and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
5.	
Inherent limitations
	
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between companies.
6.	
Our Independence and Quality Control
	
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we 
have met the requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”) 
and the SEBI Master Circular and its clarifications thereto 
and have the required competencies and experience to 
conduct this assurance engagement.
	
The firm applies Standard on Quality Control (the “SQC”) 1, 
“Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and 
Related Services Engagements”, and accordingly maintains 
a comprehensive system of quality control including 
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional standards, and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
7.	
Our Responsibility
	
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed 
in Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed 
and evidence we have obtained.
	
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the 
Standard 
on 
Sustainability 
Assurance 
Engagements 
(SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability 
Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(SAE) 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse 
Gas Statements (together the “Standards”), both issued 
by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the 
“SRSB") of the ICAI.
	
These standards require that we plan and perform our 
engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix 
I and included in the Report is prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
	
As part of reasonable assurance engagement in accordance 
with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism 
throughout 
the engagement.
8.	
Reasonable Assurance
	
A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in 
the circumstances.

The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of 
processes 
performed, 
inspection 
of 
documents, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing 
or reconciling with underlying records.
	
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above, we:
 
 
Obtained 
an 
understanding 
of 
the 
Identified 
Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
 
 
Obtained an understanding of the assessment 
criteria and their suitability for the evaluation 
and/or 
measurements 
of 
the 
Identified 
Sustainability Information;
 
 
Made inquiries of Company’s management, including 
the Environment team, Health and Safety team, the 
compliance team, the human resource team, the 
finance team amongst others and those with the 
responsibility for preparation of the Report;
 
 
Obtained an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes 
and controls for recording, processing and reporting 
on the Identified Sustainability Information at the 
corporate office and at other plants/offices on a 
sample basis. This included evaluating the design 
of those controls relevant to the engagement and 
determining whether they have been implemented 
by performing procedures in addition to the inquiry 
of the personnel responsible for the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
 
 
Based on the above understanding and the risks 
that the Identified Sustainability Information may be 
materially misstated, determined the nature, timing 
and extent of further procedures;
 
 
Tested the key assumptions, emission factors and 
methodologies used for calculation of GHG emissions;
 
 
Tested the Company’s process for collating the 
sustainability 
information 
through 
agreeing 
or 
reconciling the Identified Sustainability Information 
with the underlying records on a sample basis; and
 
 
Tested the consolidation for various plants and offices 
on a sample basis under the reporting boundary for 
ensuring the completeness and accuracy of data 
being reported.
	
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable 
assurance opinion.
9.	
Exclusions
	
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore 
we do not express a conclusion on:
 
 
Aspects of the Report and the data/information 
(qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified 
Sustainability Information; and
 
 
The statements that describe expression of opinion, 
belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions 
provided by the Company.
10.	 Other information
	
The Company’s management is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included within the BRSR, other than Identified 
Sustainability Information and our independent assurance 
report dated August 12, 2025, thereon.
	
Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance thereon.
	
In connection with our assurance engagement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the Identified Sustainability Information or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
	
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
11.	 Reasonable Assurance Opinion
	
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, the Identified Sustainability 
Information for the year ended March 31, 2025, listed
