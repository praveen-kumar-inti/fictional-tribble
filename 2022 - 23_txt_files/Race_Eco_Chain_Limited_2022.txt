Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, 
how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.  
The Company's Response to Process:  We aim to create value for all our stakeholders. Our key stakeholders include employees, customers, partners and 
vendors, Government and regulatory bodies. We engage with key stakeholder groups to understand their perspectives and cater to their needs. These 
ongoing engagements help us identify and monitor key economic, environmental, and social trends that can be incorporated into our overall business 
strategy. At Race, the stakeholder engagement mechanism is a key driving force towards strengthening and diversifying the stakeholder relationship, 
which further facilitates the identification of key material issues impacting the Company’s growth. The stakeholder engagement and materiality 
assessment exercise conducted in FY2022-23 led to the prioritization of material issues, mapping of the risks relevant to each material topic, and 
development of consequent risk mitigation steps. The primary outcome of the stakeholder engagement exercise resulted in the identification and 
prioritization of material issues relevant to environmental, social, governance, and economic aspects. The identified material issues were presented to the 
highest governing member and the Board for their feedback and guidance on strategizing the sustainable growth model of the Company. As part of the 
Company’s efforts to continually engage with internal and external stakeholder groups for the identification of key material issues impacting them, the 
stakeholder engagement exercise undergoes periodic review.

Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). Yes

strategies and be transparent about the outcomes. In FY23, the company conducted a materiality assessment survey with our stakeholders to assess its 
material ESG topics. Further, in response to current regulations and interactions with stakeholders, the Company performs periodic evaluations to update 
and reissue policies as needed.
