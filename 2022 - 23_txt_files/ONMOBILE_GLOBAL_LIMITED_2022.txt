Opportunity
A healthy workforce is a productive 
workforce. Establishing a culture of 
conducive and comfortable work 
environment among the employees 
helps decrease job turnover, increase 
job satisfaction, manage stress, and 
reduce absenteeism.
OnMobile periodically conducts 
employee awareness programs, 
employee’s health checkups, and 
other wellness measures at workplace. 
OnMobile has robust policies in place 
that support gender equality and 
diversity and processes to prevent any 
discrimination and harassment in the 
workplace (POSH Policy).
Talent Management is an opportunity 
to align work culture with global trends. 
This enhances employee loyalty while 
also increasing their efficiency. Hiring 
from the local community improves 
talent retention and signals to the 
community that you are invested in.
To promote holistic well-being 
of employees, we are currently 
partnering with YourDost, 
which provides 24*7 free and 
anonymous counselling platform 
to OnMobile employees, along 
with additional services like 
community connect, lifestyle and 
mental wellness related blogs and 
articles, and webinars on topics 
related to self-improvement and 
mental health.
OnMobile has Talent Acquisition 
Procedure that is responsible for 
hiring the right talent to deliver 
world-class services to our clients 
across the globe.

Customer 
Centricity
Risk/
Opportunity
OnMobile, being a mobile 
entertainment products & solutions 
provider can be benefited by focusing 
on customer-centricity through 
developing products and services that 
align with the needs and preferences of 
its customers. This in turn can attract 
new customers and retain existing ones. 
However, there are also significant risks 
associated with customer centricity. 
The potential risks associated are cost 
implications and excessive mobile game 
usage.
By taking measures to mitigate 
the risks, OnMobile can reap the 
benefits of customer-centricity 
and maintain a competitive 
edge in the market. Diverse 
demographics are served 
by our product offerings. 
Therefore, it is essential for us to 
continuously simulate, evaluate, 
and test product development 
strategies in order to remain 
true to customers’ interest and 
engagement.
OnMobile shall implement 
features that allow users to track 
and limit their gaming time and 
also provide information on 
responsible gaming practices.
Mandated warnings and 
guidelines including kids content 
given by regulatory authorities 
for gaming companies shall be 
strictly adhered by OnMobile

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements
I am pleased to present to you the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report of OnMobile Global Limited for the 
financial year 2022-23. Our company’s ESG journey involves a commitment to incorporate environmental, social, and 
governance factors into our business operations and decision-making processes. OnMobile recognizes the importance of 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues and we have taken several steps to address these challenges. Also, 
OnMobile continues to sustain its commitment to the highest levels of quality, superior service management, robust 
information security practices, and business continuity management in a sustainable manner.
As a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and minimizing our impact on 
the environment. We have implemented several initiatives such as energy-efficient lighting systems, water conservation 
measures, and waste management practices to reduce our environmental impact.
We believe in creating value for all our stakeholders, including our employees, customers, and the communities we 
operate in. We have taken measures to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for our employees. We have also 
implemented various programs to support the communities, such as health care, education and skill-building initiatives. 
We contribute to the Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Medical Trust - Sankara Eye Foundation to purchase equipment for detecting 
pediatric glaucoma. We are also associated with VAANI Deaf Children’s Foundation to support Early Identification, Early 
Intervention, and Community Outreach.
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency. We have established 
robust systems and processes to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We have also implemented a 
whistle-blower policy to ensure that any concerns raised by our stakeholders are addressed appropriately.
In the financial year 2023, we achieved several milestones in our ESG journey. Some of our notable achievements include:
•	
Participation in several community initiatives, including skill-building programs for underprivileged youth 
•	
Establishment of an Ethics and Compliance Committee to oversee our compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations.
• 	
Reduction of carbon emissions compared to the previous years
• 	
Implementation of a waste segregation and recycling program across all our offices
Looking ahead, we have set ambitious targets to further improve our ESG performance. Some of our key targets for the 
financial year 2024 includes:
• 	
Implementation of an employee wellness program to promote the health and well-being of our employees
• 	
Customer centric approach including product development strategies to maintain a competitive edge in the market
• 	
Expansion of our community initiatives to reach more underprivileged communities.
• 	
Reduction of carbon emissions
We are committed to ensuring that our business operations are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner. We 
believe that our ESG initiatives will not only benefit our stakeholders but also contribute to the long-term success of our 
company.
Thank you for your continued support.
