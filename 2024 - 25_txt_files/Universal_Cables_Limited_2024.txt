Management
Occupational Health & Safety is categorized
as a risk due to the high rates of injuries and
fatalities which are higher than in many other
industries. Temporary workers face greater
vulnerability due to limited training and
experience. Inadequate management of these
risks can lead to serious human harm, legal
consequences, and significant financial
burdens.
Although the Company's operational footprint
is relatively limited, it still presents
environmental risks that may affect local
ecosystems and nearby communities. These
include potential impacts on biodiversity, air
emissions, water discharge, natural resource
depletion, and waste generation. Effectively
managing these risks is essential to prevent
legal challenges and protect the Company's
reputation.
The Company views energy management as
a strategic opportunity due to the advantages
it offers in improving energy efficiency,
broadening the energy mix, and incorporating
renewable and alternative energy sources. By
adopting energy-efficient technologies and
systems, the Company can lower operational
costs, boost productivity, and reduce
exposure to energy price volatility. The
commissioning of a rooftop solar power plant
further reflects the Company's dedication to
clean energy, helping to lessen reliance on
traditional sources while supporting broader
sustainability objectives. Leveraging energy
management in this way not only enhances
the Company's competitiveness but also
reinforces its commitment to environmental
responsibility and a more sustainable future.
The organization places a high
priority on employee health and
safety 
by: 
implementing
comprehensive safety procedures;
conducting risk assessments,
guaranteeing 
adherence 
to
occupational health and safety laws;
offering frequent training courses
and cultivating a robust safety
culture; and consistently observing
and enhancing safety procedures.
The Company is actively mitigating
the risk associated with footprints of
operations by:
•
Implementing 
robust
environmental management
systems;
•
Conducting 
regular
assessments; and
•
Adopting sustainable practices
through responsible resource
consumption, waste reduction
initiatives, and stakeholder
engagement.
Negative: Accidents increase insurance, litigation,
and downtime costs.
Negative:
Non-compliance penalties.
Positive:
By enhancing overall energy efficiency, the
Company can reduce energy consumption and
associated costs, leading to potential cost savings
and improved profitability. Diversifying energy
sources and accessing alternative and renewable
energy can also contribute to long-term financial
sustainability by mitigating the risks of energy
price fluctuations and reducing reliance on
conventional energy sources. Additionally,
investing in renewable energy initiatives, such as
the rooftop solar power plant, may provide
opportunities for incentives, subsidies, and long
term cost savings through reduced energy bills.
Overall, effective energy management can
positively impact the Company's financial
performance and enhance its competitive position
in the market.

With evolving regulatory standards, new
technologies, and increasing client
expectations in both Cables and Capacitors
cable manufacturing, continuous employee
upskilling is necessary to maintain
competitiveness and quality. Lack of training
can lead to operational inefficiencies, safety
issues, and reduced innovation.
As a manufacturer and EPC provider, the
company's products directly impact client
operations, safety, and environmental
performance. 
Growing 
demand 
for
sustainable, compliant, and high-quality
products makes this a competitive advantage.
Conversely, this also presents a meaningful
opportunity for the Company to build trust and
long-term value by actively engaging with
local stakeholders, addressing their needs,
and embedding community priorities into
project planning. Doing so can help secure a
social license to operate, enhance the
Company's brand image, and support long-
term sustainability by fostering inclusive
development and minimizing conflict.
Manufacturing and EPC operations may lead
to high water consumption and wastewater
discharge. Regulatory pressure and risks of
water scarcity in project locations make it a
key area of concern and improvement.
Water management presents a significant
opportunity for the cable industry by enabling
more efficient and sustainable manufacturing
processes, reducing operational costs, and
enhancing the industry's environmental
profile. By adopting water-saving technologies
and practices, cable manufacturers can
minimize water consumption, reduce
wastewater discharge, and potentially lower
energy costs associated with water treatment.
Invest in R&D for greener materials,
meet RoHS/REACH/IEC/TUV
standards, ensure product testing
and third-party certifications.
Promote reclaim or recycling
programs where applicable.
Implement 
water-efficient
technologies, rainwater harvesting,
wastewater treatment and reuse
systems; conduct water audits to
identify savings.
Positive: A well-trained workforce improves
quality, productivity, innovation, employee morale,
and retention, leading to long-term cost savings
and value creation.
Negative
(if unmanaged): Product recalls, compliance
issues, reputational risk.
Positive: Improved reputation and ease of project
execution.
Negative: Water shortages could delay operations
or result in penalties.
Positive: Reducing consumption can cut utility
costs and improve compliance, enhancing
reputation and access to future projects.

The Company views waste management as
a strategic opportunity and is actively
implementing responsible and sustainable
practices to reduce its environmental impact.
This includes minimizing waste generation at
the source, promoting the reuse of materials
within operations, and ensuring safe and
compliant disposal through certified vendors.
By emphasizing proper waste segregation,
circular resource use, and regulatory
compliance, the Company aims to conserve
natural resources and reduce its ecological
footprint. This forward-looking approach to
waste management not only mitigates
environmental risks but also unlocks
opportunities for cost savings, improved
operational efficiency, and strengthened
leadership in environmental stewardship.
The Company identifies Materials Sourcing
as a valuable opportunity to advance its
environmental and business objectives by
reducing both direct and indirect greenhouse
gas emissions. By partnering with suppliers
that demonstrate lower carbon footprints,
encouraging sustainable sourcing practices,
and embedding responsible supply chain
management into its core strategy, the
Company can significantly strengthen its
environmental credentials. This approach not
only supports compliance with rising
stakeholder expectations and sustainability
benchmarks 
but 
also 
appeals 
to
environmentally conscious customers.
Moreover, it enables the Company to improve
operational efficiency, contribute to broader
sustainability goals, and create positive long-
term financial outcomes through enhanced
resilience and market competitiveness.
Positive: Reduced disposal costs and improved
resource recovery.
Positive: Brand enhancement, reduced ESG risk,
and eligibility for green contracts.

To embed sustainability into core operations and comply with BRSR guidelines,
the Company plans to implement measurable, time-bound commitments across
environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions.
Principle 1:
Establish a comprehensive sustainability database: A centralised data system
will capture energy, emissions, water and social indicators. Having robust metrics
and targets is an essential component of ESG reporting. The database will enable
quarterly ESG reviews and support accurate disclosures.
Ethics and governance: Maintain a zero-tolerance stance on bribery and corruption
through policy updates, mandatory compliance training and regular internal audits.
The Board ESG Committee will review ESG performance and risk assessments
each quarter, drawing upon internal assurance processes.
Principle 5:
Employee capability and training: Roll out function-specific ESG training modules
so that 100 % of employees complete mandatory training by next FY. Clear,
measurable and assignable objectives are a recognised way to enhance
accountability.
Principle 6:
Energy and climate commitments:
Increase renewable-energy share: Expand rooftop solar and group-captive power
projects so that renewable sources exceed 45 % of total electricity consumption by
FY 2025-26 (up from roughly 37 % in FY 2024-25).
Improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity: Replace obsolete motors
and power-distribution panels with efficient technologies and switch from furnace
oil to LPG. These actions support a downward trajectory in manufacturing CO2
emissions and align with national decarbonisation goals.
Water stewardship and circularity: Implement additional rainwater-harvesting
structures and sewage-treatment capacity to meet a significant portion of non-potable
water requirements from harvested or treated sources. Continue composting organic
waste and aim for zero untreated discharge.

Performance of the entity against the
specific commitments, goals and
targets along-with reasons in case
the same are not met.
During FY 2024 25, the Company tracked progress against the above commitments
through its sustainability database and quarterly ESG reviews. Key outcomes are
summarised below:
Principle 1:
Sustainability database: UCL adopted ESG tool Karbon provided by Planet
Sustech Private Limited which helped in streamlining the ESG data and more robust
reporting. A structured ESG database was developed and populated with energy,
emissions, water and social data. Data quality and granularity improved significantly,
enabling better analytics and more transparent reporting. Integration of facility level
systems also developed.
Ethics & governance: The Company maintained its zero-tolerance policy toward
bribery and unethical behavior. Internal audits covering all ESG disclosures were
implemented, and audit findings were reviewed by the board's audit committee. No
ethical violations were reported during the year. Continuous training and periodic
policy reviews will sustain compliance.
Principle 2:
Employee ESG training: ESG training was expanded with more function specific
modules. Coverage improved but was not yet universal. Full employee coverage is
targeted by March 2026; logistical constraints (e.g., onboarding of new hires) delayed
completion.
Principle 6:
Renewable energy & energy efficiency:  Appr. 37 % of total electricity consumed
was from renewable sources. Rooftop solar plants (2 MW at Satna and 0.5 MW at
Goa) operated reliably, and electricity supply from a 4 MW wind solar hybrid project
commenced in July 2024. Energy efficiency measures (replacement of DC motors
with AC systems, upgrading power panels) reduced electricity demand. Renewable
energy share did not yet reach the >45 % target because the hybrid project was
commissioned mid year; the target is expected to be met in FY 2025-26.
CO2 emission reductions: CO2 emissions intensity fell by 23.87% due to energy
efficiency improvements and the switch from furnace oil to LPG for boilers. The
company continued to monitor emissions and identify further abatement
opportunities. Further reductions are planned through additional renewable
procurement and process optimization.
Water & waste management: Two sewage treatment plants commissioned in the
previous year (total capacity 70 KL) continued to operate efficiently, raising overall
treatment capacity to 270 KL and enabling reuse of treated water for non potable
applications. Formal composting of organic waste reduced methane emissions and
produced nutrient rich compost.
Additional rainwater harvesting: Structures will be installed to meet larger non
potable requirements.
Other initiatives: The Company converted all HVAC systems to environmentally
safer refrigerants, installed a LPG distribution system to replace furnace oil, continued
tree plantation drives, and enhanced community outreach. These efforts contribute
to broader sustainability goals and support stakeholder trust.

As a forward-looking organization committed to innovation, sustainability, and
responsible growth, I am pleased to share key highlights of our Company's progress
in advancing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) priorities during the
financial year 2024-25.
We have made meaningful progress in strengthening our environmental stewardship.
During the year, approximately 37% of our total energy consumption was derived
from renewable sources. With the commissioning of a 4 MW Wind-Solar Hybrid
Power Plant in July 2024 under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement, we
anticipate this share to exceed 45% in the coming year, further accelerating our
transition to clean energy and reducing our carbon footprint.
On the social front, we remain deeply committed to inclusive development and
community well-being. Our CSR initiatives in FY 2024-25 included the development
of medical facilities at MP Birla Hospital & Research Centre, Chittorgarh (Rajasthan);
infrastructure development at Priyamvada Birla Senior Secondary School, Satna
(M.P.); and the creation of a dedicated library room with supporting infrastructure at
the Government Primary/Middle School in Satrant, Cortalim, Goa. These efforts
have significantly enhanced access to healthcare and enriched educational
environments, thereby improving the overall quality of life in the communities we
serve.
In parallel, we expanded our focus on employee awareness and engagement. The
aggregate number of training programs increased substantially during the year,
with targeted emphasis on function-specific and role-based learning. This initiative
has further embedded sustainability values into our organizational culture and day-
to-day operations.
On the governance front, we continue to uphold the highest standards of ethical
conduct. Our zero-tolerance policy on bribery and unethical practices is rigorously
implemented through comprehensive policies, mandatory training, and ongoing
monitoring. These measures reinforce our commitment to transparency,
accountability, and stakeholder trust.
I take immense pride in the progress we have achieved this year. Our ESG strategy
is not just a compliance requirement, rather it is at the heart of how we conduct our
business, create value, and contribute to a sustainable and equitable future. As we
look ahead, we remain steadfast in our mission to integrate ESG principles across
all dimensions of our operations while upholding our core values of ethics, excellence,
and equity.

In line with its commitment to sustainable sourcing, the Company has established a Supplier Framework.
This framework aims to foster sustainable practices and includes a thorough evaluation and selection
process for suppliers based on three key criteria over and above the sustainability criteria suggested
by the BRSR guidelines.
Quality: Suppliers' products and services are rigorously assessed for performance, durability, reliability,
and industry compliance to ensure they meet the Company's high standards and commitment to
excellence.
Pricing: The financial aspect is carefully considered when evaluating potential suppliers. The overall
cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of pricing structures are scrutinized to strike a balance between
optimal value for investments and maintaining profitability and cost-efficiency.
Delivery: The Company prioritizes suppliers who ensure timely and reliable delivery, minimizing
operational disruptions and enabling the Company to meet customer demands and timelines.
Suppliers are expected to adhere to the Company's desired environmental and social standards as
outlined in specific terms of agreements within the contracts. Performance evaluations and rankings
are conducted based on their compliance with these parameters. Additionally, the Company has
established Environmental Requirements for its suppliers, which are communicated to them.

Plastics
The Company ensures responsible handling of plastic waste by channeling it exclusively to
(including packaging)
authorized recyclers. This promotes environmentally sound disposal practices and contributes
to the circular economy by enabling the recycling and reuse of plastic materials.
E-waste
In full compliance with regulatory requirements, all electronic waste generated by the Company
is sold to government-authorized recyclers. This practice ensures the safe, lawful, and
environmentally responsible recycling and disposal of e-waste, thereby minimizing its ecological
footprint.
Hazardous waste
The Company adopts a stringent and protocol-driven approach to managing hazardous waste.
Such waste is disposed of through authorized recyclers in accordance with statutory guidelines
and safety standards. This ensures that hazardous materials are handled, transported, and
treated in a secure and responsible manner, thereby mitigating associated environmental
and health risks.
Other waste
Acid Batteries: A structured buy-back arrangement with Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) is in place for the disposal of used acid batteries. This ensures safe and environmentally
compliant handling, reducing the risk of soil and water contamination.
Other Non-Hazardous Waste: Non-hazardous waste is responsibly sold to verified and
competent vendors who are equipped to manage, reuse, or recycle these materials. This
promotes resource efficiency, reduces landfill usage, and supports sustainable material
recovery.

There is no social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising
from production or disposal of our products. However, the main
result of LCA shows that the extraction of raw materials,
particularly metals like copper, aluminum, and galvanized iron
(GI) used for conductor and armoring of cables, involves energy-
intensive manufacturing processes. These processes, including
the mining of raw materials, refining iron ore, and melting,
significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Also, both upstream and downstream transportation play a major
role in global warming, primarily due to the combustion of fossil
fuels. Recycling of metal parts (Al & Cu) of cable along with
Insulation (PVC) shows positive effect in all 12 environmental
impact categories.

activities, with all necessary precautions rigorously enforced.
Through the diligent execution of these processes, the Company
demonstrates a steadfast commitment to minimizing occupational risks,
preventing workplace incidents, and fostering a culture of safety across all
levels of the organization.
The Company has instituted comprehensive and proactive mechanisms
that enable all workers to report work-related hazards and to remove
themselves from potentially dangerous situations without fear of reprisal.
These mechanisms are designed to uphold the highest standards of
occupational health and safety across the organization.
Well-defined and accessible reporting channels are in place, allowing
employees and workers to promptly communicate observed hazards, near-
miss incidents, or unsafe conditions. These channels include direct reporting
to supervisors, designated safety officers, suggestion/incident reporting
boxes, and official communication platforms.
In addition to reporting mechanisms, the Company invests significantly in
regular training and capacity-building initiatives. These programs are aimed
at empowering employees to identify, assess, and report hazards confidently
and competently. Workers are educated on their rights and responsibilities,
including the right to refuse work that they reasonably believe poses an
imminent danger to health or safety.
By fostering a culture of safety, accountability, and open communication,
the Company ensures that all hazard reports are addressed with urgency
and that corrective actions are promptly implemented. This reinforces our
unwavering commitment to protecting the health, safety, and well-being of
all employees and workers.
Yes, the Company is deeply committed to the holistic well-being of its
employees and workers, and accordingly, provides access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services. These services extend
beyond workplace-related healthcare and are designed to support the overall
health and quality of life of our workforce.
The Company offers comprehensive health insurance coverage that includes
access to a wide network of trusted third-party medical service providers.
This enables employees to avail essential healthcare services, including
preventive care, diagnostics, treatment, and wellness consultations, even
for non-work-related medical needs.
We recognize that employee well-being is not confined to occupational health
alone. By facilitating access to non-occupational healthcare, the Company
ensures that employees are supported in maintaining a healthy, balanced
lifestyle-both professionally and personally. This commitment reflects our
broader philosophy of fostering a caring and supportive work environment
that always prioritizes the physical and mental well-being of our people.

visual aids are displayed across all operational areas to serve as constant reminders of safety protocols and regulatory
compliance.
•
Employee Feedback Mechanism: We actively encourage employees to share their observations, concerns, and
suggestions regarding workplace safety. All feedback is systematically reviewed, and appropriate corrective or preventive
actions are implemented to address identified issues.

activities to identify overlooked or emerging hazards. This allows us to respond swiftly and decisively to potential safety
threats, ensuring a continuous improvement cycle in our safety performance.
Through these integrated measures, the Company endeavors to foster a culture of safety, reduce the risk of occupational
incidents, and ensure the physical and psychological well-being of all personnel. Our overarching objective is to create a

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS:
1.
Identification of stakeholders group:
The Company has established a structured and strategic stakeholder engagement framework
designed to enhance the identification and prioritization of key stakeholder groups. This framework
plays a pivotal role in fostering transparent communication, maintaining trust, and delivering
sustained value to all stakeholders.
The identification process is guided by two primary dimensions:
•
Stakeholder Interest: The degree to which the stakeholder is affected by the Company's
activities, decisions, and performance.
•
Stakeholder Influence: The stakeholder's capacity to affect the Company's strategic
direction or outcomes.
In addition to these core dimensions, the Company applies the following evaluative criteria to
comprehensively identify and assess stakeholder groups:
•
Dependency - The extent to which stakeholders depend on the Company for the fulfillment
of their needs or interests.
•
Responsibility - The obligations the Company holds towards specific stakeholders, including
ethical, legal, or operational responsibilities.
•
Attention - The degree of focus or consideration the Company allocates to the stakeholder
group based on relevance and risk exposure.
•
Influence - The potential stakeholders possess to impact the Company's operations,
reputation, or strategic direction.
This structured approach enables the Company to prioritize stakeholder groups effectively and
design tailored engagement strategies that reflect their unique expectations and contributions.
By aligning engagement efforts with stakeholder relevance and materiality, the Company ensures
the cultivation of collaborative, transparent, and mutually beneficial relationships-critical for
advancing both corporate and stakeholder objectives.

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
The Company facilitates stakeholder consultations on economic, environmental, and social (EES) matters primarily through
its senior management team and designated committees. These bodies actively engage with stakeholders using a variety of
methods, including structured surveys, formal meetings, and other established feedback channels, to gather valuable insights
and perspectives.
The information and concerns collected from these engagements are systematically compiled and communicated to the
Board through periodic reports, including comprehensive sustainability disclosures and risk assessment summaries. This
ensures that the Board remains well-informed of stakeholder viewpoints and emerging issues related to EES topics.
In instances of critical significance, the Board may also directly participate in consultations to gain firsthand understanding.
Additionally, feedback received from stakeholders is thoroughly reviewed by relevant Board-level committees, which play a
key role in integrating stakeholder input into the Company's strategic decision-making processes.
This structured approach ensures that stakeholder perspectives are effectively incorporated at the highest governance levels,
thereby reinforcing the Company's commitment to transparent, responsible, and sustainable business practices.
2.

topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics
were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes. The Company actively leverages stakeholder consultations as a key input in the identification, assessment, and
management of material environmental and social (E&S) topics. These consultations play a vital role in aligning the Company's
policies and operational strategies with stakeholder expectations and broader sustainability goals.
For instance:
•
Community feedback has informed enhancements in waste management practices and the implementation of more
stringent emission control measures to mitigate environmental impact.
•
Employee suggestions have led to the introduction of comprehensive workplace safety protocols and the expansion of
health and wellness initiatives, reinforcing the Company's commitment to occupational well-being.

on recognizing, preventing, and reporting harassment. These sessions aim to reinforce a culture of respect and inform
employees of the redressal mechanisms available to them.

against any form of harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal, ensuring fairness, safety, and dignity for all.

Mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge
The Company has implemented a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system at its
manufacturing units located at Satna (M.P.) and Verna (Goa). This mechanism
ensures that no liquid waste is discharged from the facility.
Water is primarily used for cooling purposes in the plant's operations and is circulated
within a closed loop, without any release of industrial effluent into the environment.
Additionally, the domestic wastewater generated within the facility is treated in a
Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), and the resulting treated water is then employed for
horticultural purposes within the Company premises. This ensures a sustainable
and environmentally conscious approach to water management within the
organisation.
