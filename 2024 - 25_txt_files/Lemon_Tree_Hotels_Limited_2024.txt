Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and workers, as 
per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps

We take pride in designing all our hotels with universal access in mind. Our goal is to create barrier-free 
environments that cater to guests of all abilities, mobility levels and ages. By providing accessible public bathrooms 
and restaurants, we ensure that guests with disabilities feel welcome and included in our local community.
	
For our specially-abled guests, we offer well-designed rooms equipped with various features for their comfort and 
convenience. Starting from the entrance ramp that provides easy access to the lobby, our hotels are designed 
to be hassle-free for physically challenged guests. The lobby area seamlessly connects to elevators, specially 
designed public toilets and the coffee shop.
	
Our specially-abled rooms are thoughtfully equipped with features such as user-friendly elevators, close proximity 
to elevators (often on the first floor), wider main doors (1,000 mm) for wheelchair passage, a lower "magic eye" 
on the main door, lower luggage rack/table (below 450 mm), writing table at least 750 mm in height, bed height

width, knob-type shower mixer handles, hand showers without buckets or spouts and stainless steel support 
railings for ease of movement. Additionally, we provide convex mirrors at lower levels and handicapped toilets in

Further Details:
	
We are deeply committed to promoting diversity and gender equality within our organisation, recognising the 
value it brings in tapping into often overlooked talent pools. As an equal-opportunity employer, we prioritise 
building a diverse, safe and inclusive work environment. Embracing individual differences and empowering every 
employee to reach their full potential is central to fostering innovation, employee satisfaction and unique ideas.
	
Our efforts towards inclusivity are focused on creating a workplace where everyone, regardless of their 
background, can work collaboratively towards shared goals. We understand that equitable employment 
generation is essential for driving sustainable socio-economic development in our nation. To promote diversity 
and inclusion, we actively hire Opportunity Deprived Individuals (ODIs), encompassing Employees with Disability 
(EwD) and those from Economically and Socially Marginalised backgrounds (EcoSoc).

Employees with Disability (EwD)
	
We began our journey of hiring employees with special needs in 2007. Over the years, we have been strongly 
committed towards hiring individuals with special needs and creating an accessible and growth-oriented work 
environment for them. This includes individuals with:
	
1.	
Physical disabilities: Speech and Hearing Impaired (SHI), Orthopedically Handicapped (OH), Acid Survivors, 
Low Vision
	
2.	
Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD): Down Syndrome, Slow Learner, Mild MR, IDD and Autism
	
Across all our hotels, we have a significant presence of SHIs, followed by OH. Through our strategic partnerships 
with NGOs that focus on training of individuals with Intellectual and Developmental needs, we plan to continuously 
enhance and expand our traineeship model.
	
Economically and Socially Marginalised segment (EcoSoc)
	
We have focused on hiring people who belong to socially and economically weaker sections of society since 2016. 
This includes individuals who fall below the poverty line, widowed or destitute women, orphans/abandoned girls, 
transgender persons and those from select states that rank low on education and employment opportunities. By 
generating employment for these people, we effectively contribute towards poverty alleviation and social justice.

for individuals raising complaints, ensuring their protection and 
confidentiality throughout the process.

PRINCIPLE 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all its 
stakeholders
Essential Indicators
1	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Engaging with our stakeholders is vital as it enables us to comprehend and align with their expectations, ultimately 
leading to better satisfaction. Their diverse needs serve as valuable inputs that shape our goals and strategic 
decisions. We have identified twelve (12) distinct stakeholder groups, and we maintain clear commitments to 
each of them, ensuring we address their specific requirements effectively.
Stakeholder 
Category
Why we need to engage
How we engage
Employees
Our employees create guest experiences and 
ensure that their expectations are met and 
even exceeded. We rely on the service delivery 
of our employees to enhance our brand image 
through exceptional service.
We regularly engage with our employees 
through internal town halls and other 
mechanisms. Frequent team-building exercises 
foster harmony and bring synergy to our 
team. We also rely on forums including new 
employee “fresh-eyes” discussions and weekly 
engagement chats between hotel managers 
and employees on a one-on-one basis to assess 
their needs.
Customers
Our customers are key stakeholders 
who experience our service delivery. Our 
revenues are directly linked with the trust 
and relationships that we nurture with our 
customers. Their feedback is critical to our 
financial success. Our brand standards too 
evolve based on this ongoing feedback.
We invite direct feedback from our customers 
prior to departure from our hotels. We also 
track their comments on our services after 
they have left our premises i.e. through Online 
Relationship Management (ORM) platforms. 
We monitor our social media engagement to 
understand the live feedback of our customers. 
We update our customers about hotel launches, 
new services, and/or periodic offers, through 
our loyalty Programme (Lemon Tree Smiles) via 
emailers, newsletters, etc.
Regulatory Bodies 
and Government
Ongoing engagement with regulatory bodies 
and the federal/state/local governments. We 
seek their support in complying with applicable 
laws and regulations.
They issue operating licenses and permits, 
which are critical for us to conduct our business. 
Investors and 
Shareholders
Our investors and shareholders are interested 
in the success and sustainability of our 
business. They have provided the foundation, 
by providing capital, for our business to 
grow. The motivation to meet/exceed the 
expectations of our investors inspires us to 
continuously improve and, in that process, also 
deliver better value to other stakeholders.
Our quarterly presentations and annual 
meetings serve as an opportunity to engage 
with investors and shareholders regarding our 
performance and get their feedback. We also 
invite their feedback on our annual disclosures.
Owners and 
Partners
Owners/partners who own managed hotels (run 
by Lemon Tree Hotels) are also responsible for 
maintaining our brand standards. This asset-
light growth model is critical to our business 
success as it ensures quick geographic spread 
and penetration, and offers our customers a 
wide choice across the country.
Our business development team and marketing 
team engages with owners and partners to 
ensure they have the necessary tools and 
support to uphold and enhance our brand’s 
reputation. We also have regular discussions 
through bilateral meetings with owners and 
partners.
Suppliers and 
Vendors
Engaging regularly with our suppliers and 
vendors is critical for our business, to ensure 
that the products and services they deliver to 
us meet our brand standards.
We engage with them frequently through 
informal interactions and periodical reviews. We 
discuss product quality, product specifications, 
timely supply, pricing and payment terms along 
with ethical and responsible sourcing.
Contractors
We are also supported by an outsourced 
workforce in providing quality services to our 
customers. This makes it critical for us to 
engage with our contractors who ensure the 
availability of trained staff who can deliver on 
our standards.
We engage with them frequently through 
informal interactions, meetings and periodical 
reviews to discuss matters pertaining to the 
well-being and engagement levels of our 
outsourced workforce.

Why we need to engage
How we engage
Online Travel 
Agencies/Portals
Online Travel Agencies support us in customer 
acquisition along with providing us insights into 
customer behavior and decision-making criteria. 
Reviewing customer feedback on their platforms 
is an important aspect of our business. 
We maintain an open dialogue and conduct 
frequent meetings to stay connected with them.
NGOs
NGOs help us deliver on our commitment 
to being an equal opportunity employer 
by supporting us in selecting and training 
candidates with disability and candidates from 
economically/socially marginalised backgrounds 
(together called Opportunity Deprived 
Individuals (ODIs)). Moving forward, they will 
play a pivotal role in supporting the design and 
implementation of our CSR initiatives.
Our annual reports help our NGO partners 
assess our priorities and we engage with them 
regarding further opportunities for collaboration 
through regular meetings and specific 
engagement events. 
Local Communities
We engage with local communities to 
understand their needs which helps us deliver 
greater impact through curated social welfare 
programs.
We engage with them through our NGO partners 
and/or local hotel teams.
Industry 
Associations
Industry associations serve as a platform for us 
to understand business trends and opportunities 
and collaborate with our peers in the travel and 
tourism industry.
We engage in multilateral meetings and events 
through industry associations and utilise these 
platforms to communicate our initiatives and 
learn about the initiatives of others.
Media
We leverage our relationship with media 
for brand building, engagement with local 
communities on different initiatives as well as 
release press notes on hotel launches, special 
promotions and offers.
We engage with media agencies and personnel 
regularly through press releases, press notes 
and briefings. The intent is to publicise our new 
hotel openings and initiatives. We curate news 
briefs exclusively for our media partners to keep 
them apprised of relevant updates about our 
operations.

Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for addressing human rights impacts 
or issues caused or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. The implementation of our Human Rights policy is jointly handled by Corporate HR and the ESG Task Force. 
This is done through all initiatives around recruitment, training, sensitisation, and diversity/inclusion.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
All grievances are addressed as and when received by the respective Hotel General Managers/Executive Assistant 
Managers/ Assistant Hotel Managers/ Department Heads in coordination with HR and the Corporate Office 
team (HR, ESG, and relevant Corporate Function Head). All the grievances received are duly investigated and 
appropriate actions are taken to resolve the matter. Whenever required, disciplinary action is taken to ensure 
such inappropriate behavior is not repeated by any employee. For example:
•	
Our Code of Conduct known as the ‘LTH Code’, acts as an important guiding force for ensuring that we 
all work collectively to function as a responsible and ethical organisation. Acting with integrity is key 
to our organisational growth as well as our future prospects. This code, applicable to all employees 
of the Company, including members of the Board and Senior Management, outlines our commitment 
to upholding the core values of Lemon Tree including acting with integrity and transparency within 
the organisation. The Code is supported by a policy on the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH) 
at the workplace. Any POSH-related complaints are handled by the Internal Complaints Committee.
•	
Our Whistle-blower Policy encourages our employees and others to report violations or suspected 
violations of the LTH Code and/or any instances of misconduct. This policy provides a robust mechanism 
for investigating and resolving whistle-blower complaints in a time-bound manner while ensuring that 
our employees are able to raise their concerns without any fear of victimisation and discrimination. 
We have an open-door policy in order to enable our employees to share their grievances with any 
member of the management team, apart from their direct supervisor.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide 
details.
	
Yes. We are measuring and monitoring our carbon emissions – Scope 1 and Scope 2, from energy consumption 
at our hotels and have explored ways to reduce our GHG impact through the following measures:
•	
Increasing share of renewable energy
•	
Use of energy efficient equipment
•	
Action plan to use EV vehicles in hotels
•	
Use of cleaner fuels (LPG, CNG)
•	
Phasing out of equipment using Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from our operations
•	
Planting trees in the neighborhood or on our premises across India
•	
Using low GHG emission refrigerant-based HVAC equipment: Replacing old AC units with new 
ones that use low Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) refrigerants 
like R32 or R410 can significantly reduce environmental impact.
•	
RECD (Retro Emission Control Device): The primary purpose of RECDs is to enhance air quality 
by controlling the emission of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide from diesel generators. RECDs 
are installed on generators and can control and reduce harmful emissions. The device, essentially 
a stainless steel box, is mounted on the generator’s exhaust system. It operates on filter-less 
technology and captures and reduces specific particles from emissions. It captures carbon matter with 
an efficiency of more than 90%, significantly reducing the environmental impact of these generators.
•	
DF Kit (Dual Fuel Kit): Dual Fuel kits are designed to enhance the efficiency and versatility of 
diesel generators. They allow a diesel generator to run on a combination of two fuels, typically diesel 
and a gaseous fuel like natural gas or propane. They serve two purposed (1) reduce operating costs 
(gaseous fuels cost less than diesel). (2) reduces the environmental impact/emits fewer pollutants.
•	
Exploring the possibility of going for carbon offsets to further mitigate the adverse effects of emissions 
from our operations.
•	
Bottling plant installed for drinking water to remove single-use plastic packaged water
•	
10-11% reduction in expenditure on packaged water
•	
Reduction of plastic footprint
•	
The process incorporates all required cleaning, sanitising, filling and packaging (date sticker) SOPs
•	
We have used new technology called CDI (Capacitive De-Ionisation) which saves energy and water both.

Capacitive Deionisation (CDI) technology based water purifier and softener has high water recovery of up to 
90%, TDS reduction of up to 90% and low electricity consumption of only 30% as compared to existing Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) technology.
	
Biogas Plant (Aurika Skycity) - Biogas plants simultaneously take care of waste management and act as a source 
of energy. It uses anaerobic digestion, a process where organic waste is broken down by bacteria in the absence 
of oxygen, thereby producing biogas. Benefits include: renewable energy source (zero emissions), reduce waste 
disposal costs, contribution to the circular economy.

With respect to the ecologically sensitive areas Data Needed at Question 10 of Essential Indicators 
above, provide details of significant direct & indirect impact of the entity on biodiversity in such 
areas along-with prevention and remediation activities.
	
Lemon Tree's property in Bandhavgarh is located near a forest and the properties in Cochin, Muhamma/Alleppey 
and Candolim, Goa are located in coastal regulation zones.
	
We recognise the impact of the development and operations of our hotels and accept our responsibility towards 
the surrounding environment, natural resources and biodiversity of the locations where we have our properties. 
We try to ensure that none of our operations lie within the boundaries of designated protected areas, such 
as national parks and wildlife reserves. Further, we shall strive to integrate our commitment to conserving 
biodiversity and habitat into our development/acquisitions and operations strategy.
	
For example at Bandhavgarh, some of the measures taken by us to minimise our environmental footprint include:
•	
Waste Management: We have discontinued the use of packaged drinking water, plastic cutlery, 
miniature toiletries and single-use plastic. We have also selected a local partner to process and 
manage our kitchen waste and the compost generated through this is used in and around the reserve.
•	
Water Management: The water we use at the resort is treated at the Sewage Treatment Plant and 
reused to maintain the gardens at our hotel while ensuring no harmful water discharge in and around 
the resort.
•	
Supporting Local Flora and Fauna: We recognise our role in supporting the local forest division in 
managing forest fires near the resort. Furthermore, we regularly plant trees within our premises to 
maintain the greenery of the surrounding areas.
	
These initiatives have helped us in ensuring that our operations are not in conflict with nature.

11.
RECD
(Retro Emission 
Control Device)
The primary purpose of RECDs is to enhance air quality 
by controlling the emission of hydrocarbons and carbon 
monoxide from diesel generators. RECDs are installed 
on generators and can control and reduce harmful 
emissions. The device, essentially a stainless steel 
box, is mounted on the generator’s exhaust system. 
It operates on filter-less technology and captures and 
reduces specific particles from emissions. It captures 
carbon matter with an efficiency of more than 90%, 
significantly reducing the environmental impact of these 
generators.
12.
DF Kit
(Duel Fuel Kit)
Dual Fuel kits are designed to enhance the efficiency 
and versatility of diesel generators. They allow a diesel 
generator to run on a combination of two fuels, typically 
diesel and a gaseous fuel like natural gas or propane. 
They serve two purposed (1) reduce operating costs 
(gaseous fuels cost less than diesel). (2) reduces the 
environmental impact/emits fewer pollutants.
13.
Bio gas Plant
Biogas plants simultaneously take care of waste 
management and act as a source of energy. It uses 
anaerobic digestion, a process where organic waste 
is broken down by bacteria in the absence of oxygen, 
thereby producing biogas. Benefits include: renewable 
energy source (zero emissions), reduce waste disposal 
costs, contribution to the circular economy.
14.
Bottling Plant
Lemon Tree installs water bottling plant (for drinking 
water) to remove single-use plastic packaged water and 
reduce our plastic footprint. We also see a benefit of 
10-11% reduction in expenditure on packaged water. 
The plant’s SOPs incorporate all required cleaning, 
sanitising, filling and packaging (date stickers used).
At Aurika Skycity (Mumbai), we have used a new 
technology called CDI (Capacitive De-Ionisation) which 
saves energy and water both.
The CDI based water purification process has a high 
water recovery of up to 90%, as well as a TDS reduction 
of up to 90% and low electricity consumption of only 
30% as compared to the current Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
technology.
