The business's objectives and 
principles have been aligned with 
various industry trends. We have 
been able to identify risks.
1.	
Help in risk management
2.	
It is Important to enhance 
long-term 
value 
with 
stakeholders
3.	
Critical in the successful 
running of the Company
The Company is committed to 
conducting business operations 
in accordance with the highest 
standards of ethical, moral, and 
legal conduct. The Company has 
formalised the "Code of Conduct" 
for Directors and employees to 
maintain these standards. This 
lays down the principles and 
standards that govern the actions 
of the employees in the course of 
the Conduct of Business of the 
Company. It covers all dealings 
with vendors, customers and 
other business partners.
The Company is contributing 
to the global environment by 
complying with ISO Certification 
i.e., ISO 9001: 2015, ISO 9001, ISO 
45001 and ISO 14001 under the 
Integrated Management System, 
in each and every process of the 
Company.
Positive: 
Compliance with relevant 
regulatory requirements reflects 
the Company’s commitment

Responsible business practices.
Negative: Noncompliance with 
regulatory requirements may 
affect the Company’s image and 
impact its
business continuity in the long 
term.
2.
Energy
Efficiency of 
operations
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
Climate 
change 
and 
environmental 
risk 
have 
recognised energy management 
as a critical material concern. 
To 
highlight 
the 
Company's 
environmental awareness and its 
commitment to climate change 
mitigation plans, climate change 
and environmental threats are 
discussed.
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive 
resource management plans that 
align with the company's strategy 
for protecting the environment 
will emphasise the Company's 
commitment 
to 
enhancing 
environmental preservation and 
its contribution to initiatives to 
mitigate climate change.
The Company concentrates on 
four key climate change-related 
areas, such as waste minimisation, 
renewable 
energy 
utilisation, 
water conservation, and energy 
conservation.
Positive Implications:
The Company's emphasis on 
improving climate change and 
ESG-specific initiatives bolsters 
long-term value creation and 
makes it possible for the Company 
to successfully address growing 
stakeholder expectations.

3.
Human Rights
Practices
The 
Company's 
performance 
in the social realm from the 
perspective 
of 
the 
employee 
workforce 
as 
well 
as 
the 
community will be impacted 
by the lack of a comprehensive 
Human 
Rights 
governance 
structure from the parameters 
of 
working 
conditions, 
child/
forced labour, fair remuneration, 
gender diversity, prevention of 
sexual 
harassment, 
freedom 
of 
association, 
and 
collective 
bargaining.
The Company respects the human 
rights of all relevant stakeholders 
and 
groups, 
including 
communities, 
consumers, 
and 
marginalised communities, both 
within and outside the workplace. 
Human rights are recognised and 
protected by all of the Company's 
operations and policies, including 
its interactions with vendors, to 
preserve the human rights of all 
of our workers, including their 
freedom 
of 
association, 
non-
discrimination, 
prohibitions 
of 
child and forced labour, and 
their right to engage in collective 
bargaining. 
It integrates a strong human 
rights 
governance 
framework 
that considers the freedom of 
association, human rights, and 
due diligence across all business 
operations, especially suppliers 
and vendors.
Positive: 
The Company's performance in 
the social realm is enhanced by 
its 
comprehensive 
alignment 
with the guiding principles of 
national and international human 
rights 
standards, 
which 
also 
demonstrates its commitment to 
human rights integration inside 
the business strategy of the 
Company.
Negative: 
The absence of a Human Rights 
governance 
structure 
could 
result in employee dissatisfaction, 
impacting 
the 
workforce 
productivity that could impact 
the Company’s long term business 
growth plan. The lack of a strong 
redressal mechanism may result 
in non-compliance issues from a 
relevant regulatory perspective.
4.
Board Diversity and 
Independence
Opportunity
Opportunity: 
The Company acknowledges and 
embraces the importance of a 
diverse Board in its success. We 
believe that having a truly diverse 
board will help us to maintain 
our competitive advantage by 
leveraging diversity in thought, 
perspective, knowledge, ability, 
industry expertise, age, ethnicity, 
and gender.
Ensure a transparent nomination 
process 
for 
directors 
who 
possess a range of perspectives, 
experiences, expertise, and skills, 
as well as performance excellence.
Positive:
Consistent efforts would lead to a 
positive impact due to improved 
productivity, etc.
5.
Water and
Effluent
Management
Water availability may become a 
concern area. Being a responsible 
Company, it needs to map and 
manage the water used across its 
operations and ensure that the 
consumption is socially equitable 
and environmentally sustainable.
The Company has commissioned 
state of the art technologies 
to reduce specific freshwater 
consumption, 
maximise 
recyclability 
and 
minimise 
external discharge.
Dependency 
on 
fresh 
water, 
lack of recyclability and excess 
discharge may impact future 
resource availability, resulting in 
environmental impact.

DOES THE ENTITY HAVE A BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT PLAN? GIVE DETAILS IN 
100 WORDS/ WEB LINK.
	
At Hi-tech, our commitment to safety goes beyond theoretical frameworks. We have firmly established 
onsite Emergency Plans that align seamlessly with Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series 
(OHSAS) guidelines. These plans are not just static documents; they are dynamic, actionable strategies 
designed to safeguard lives, assets, and our commitment to responsible operations.
	
Our onsite Emergency Plans are living blueprints that detail precise steps to be taken in the event of 
unforeseen incidents. Rooted in the OHSAS framework, these plans meticulously outline procedures for a 
wide range of potential emergencies, from fire incidents to natural disasters. These guidelines are not just 
regulatory requirements; they’re our promise to our workforce, our community, and the environment.
	
A plan is only as good as its execution. To ensure readiness, we conduct regular MOCK DRILLS that simulate 
emergency scenarios in real-time. These drills are orchestrated with the participation of key stakeholders, 
including Incident Controllers, Site Controllers, Fire Fighters, and District Authorities such as the District 
Collector, Police, Fire Brigade, and Medical Officers. Our mock drills are a testament to this commitment. 
They exemplify our dedication to the well-being of our employees, the integrity of our operations, and the 
30 
protection of the environment. By adhering to OHSAS guidelines, we uphold the highest standards of 
occupational health and safety, fostering a culture of preparedness, resilience, and responsible conduct.
