Risk
Inability to manage and grow

infrastructure such as software, communication networks and equipment to enhance our digital strength. Additionally,

Not applicable, since the Company is a service entity and being an internet company, we are relatively less resource intensive 
in terms of material inputs. However, as a responsible corporate citizen, we have formulated a policy on ‘Sustainable Supply 
Chain’ that has procedures in place to ensure that the procurement of products and services occurs in a sustainable and safe 
manner. We also endeavor to reduce the environmental impact of our operations by tracking the consumption of resources 
critically. As part of the Company’s operations, a small amount of e-waste is generated by the Company which is dealt with as 
per the statutory norms governing the handling and management of such waste.

The Company is actively implementing a range of employee support programs aimed 
at promoting mental well-being. One notable program is ‘icare’, a collaboration with the 
psychological health program called ‘innerhour’. These initiatives are designed to assist 
employees in effectively managing anxiety, stress and depression. To achieve this, the 
Company organizes webinars on mental well-being and provides mobile app programs focused 
on various aspects of living a happier life, overcoming anxiety and depression, improving sleep 
and more. Additionally, employees have access to on-demand therapy sessions conducted by 
expert therapists.
Ensuring the safety of our employees is of paramount importance to the Company. To achieve 
this, we conduct awareness sessions, mock drills, and periodic demonstrations that cover 
safety, security, and overall well-being. We also provide regular communication and alerts 
to keep employees informed about safety-related matters. The Company ensures that all 
employees receive training on preventing sexual harassment in the workplace. Furthermore, 
managers undergo specialized training to guide them in taking appropriate action when a team 
member reports an incident of sexual harassment.
The Company is committed to enhancing the health of its employees and has implemented 
measures to ensure good air quality within office premises. These measures aim to maintain

employees and provide them with a healthier work environment.

dealing with any supplier contractor if they violate any human rights or are involved in the use of forced or child labor.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
As an IT services company, Info Edge does not engage in manufacturing processes involving hazardous and toxic chemicals. 
However, the Company recognize the importance of being mindful of its environmental impact. To address this, the Company 
has embraced the principles of the 3R’s: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Our operations primarily take place in office settings, 
resulting in waste generated from office processes.
The waste generated within our offices mainly consists of paper waste, plastics, municipal solid waste and e-waste. We 
handle potentially hazardous waste, such as e-waste and used oil from DG sets, in a responsible manner. These materials 
are disposed of through government-approved vendors and recyclers to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
By adhering to proper waste management practices and working with authorized partners, we aim to minimize our 
environmental impact and promote sustainable practices within our operations.

vi.	 Implementation of a solution to have good quality air inside offices with lower values of PM2.5 than WHO & Indian 
Standards guidelines on Ambient Air. 
vii.	 Adopted the use of Automated Energy Monitoring solution named as ‘Zenatix’, which enables monitoring of the energy 
consumption of the electrical devices. 
viii.	 Planned Preventive Maintenance (PPM) schedule put in place for electro-mechanical equipments.

its operations. The Company acknowledges the potential environmental risks and actively engages in relevant initiatives to 
address environmental concerns. Additionally, the Company ensures compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
pertaining to its premises and operations.
9.	
Percentage of value chain partners (by the value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental

sustainable practices. While a formal assessment was not carried out, we remain committed to promoting environmental 
stewardship throughout our value chain and encourage our partners to align with our environmental compliance requirements.
