Waste 
Management
Opportunity
Discarded footwear, due to its complex material 
mix, poses significant recycling challenges and 
environmental risks. The Company addressed this 
by diverting 4,364 tons from landfills—achieving 31% 
recycling and 69% waste-to-energy/co-processing—
transforming a waste burden into an opportunity for 
sustainable impact, in line with CPCB norms.

Efficient 
Resource Use
Opportunity
Efficient resource use lowers operational costs, 
ensures regulatory compliance, and strengthens 
market positioning amid growing demand for 
sustainability. The Company’s solar installations at 
Bhiwandi warehouses generated 136,077.11 kWh in 
FY 2024–25, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, cutting 
electricity costs, and shrinking its carbon footprint.

Healing the Planet: Metro Brands’ Cradle-to-Grave 
Approach
The Company is revolutionizing sustainability in 
the footwear industry through its cradle-to-grave 
initiative. Addressing the staggering 20 billion pairs of 
footwear manufactured annually, the Company has 
implemented an eco-friendly process to manage old, 
discarded footwear (ODF). Through implementing 
partners, the Company collects ODF from landfills, 
waste management agencies, and ragpickers, sorting 
and recycling materials like plastic and rubber. 
Worn-out parts are sent to power generating units or 
cement kilns, replacing coal and reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. The Company has made significant 
progress, processing 5% of ODF in FY 2021-22, 
increasing to 50% in FY 2023-24. In FY 2024-25, the 
Company achieved a milestone, processing 4,364 tons 
(10.10 million pairs) of ODF, slightly exceeding the 
number of new pairs sold showcasing its commitment 
to sustainability and reducing environmental impact. 
This initiative contributes to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), specifically 
Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) 
and Goal 13 (Climate Action). By promoting circular 
practices and reducing environmental impact, the 
Company sets a remarkable example for the footwear 
industry to promoting eco-friendly practices and 
responsible consumption

This is My Company: Celebrating Our People, Our 
Culture
Belonging isn’t just a word here — it’s how we 
work, celebrate, and grow together. For over 
75 years, Metro Brands has nurtured a people-
first culture that values not just performance, 
but the people behind it — their stories, spirit, 
and everyday wins. With our chairman’s vision 
inspiring us to think like owners, we proudly 
say, “This is my Company!”
This year was packed with feel-good moments. 
We gathered twice for Iftar parties during 
Ramzan, launched the appraisal season with 
fresh goals, and stayed connected through HR 
Connects and cheerful birthday celebrations. 
Team lunches and offsite vacations gave us 
space to unwind, share stories, and build 
stronger bonds.
A standout moment? The second Golden Foot 
Awards — where we celebrated stars under 
97+ categories across brands and teams. 
We stretched and reset on World Yoga Day, 
strategized on World Chess Day, and amped up 
the fun with indoor sports.
Wellbeing was front and center with wellness 
camps, skip-level chats, and doctors — both 
allopathic and homeopathic — just a call 
away for our employees. We stood united on 
Independence Day, championed workplace 
safety, and embraced the festive spirit of 
Navratri, Diwali, and Christmas. December also 
saw us honoring our frontline stars on Retail 
Employees’ Day — a tribute to those who keep 
us moving forward.

This is My Company: Celebrating Our People, Our 
Culture
This year, we also sharpened our focus on growth 
from within. Talent Development became a key 
theme, with structured programs that helped 
our people build new skills, take on bigger roles, 
and stay future-ready. We placed 90+ Potential 
Store Managers into leadership roles; we invested 
deeply in learning that empowers.
We achieved a milestone in our digital 
transformation journey, successfully training 
96% of corporate, warehouse, and retail store 
employees in AI awareness and capability-
building. This industry-first initiative covered 
practical AI use cases across functions like 
data analytics, design, and marketing. The 
training enabled teams to integrate AI into daily 
operations, driving efficiency, creativity, and 
speed. The impact is evident: increased AI tool 
adoption, innovation, and agility. This investment 
empowers our people to lead retail’s future with 
data-driven insights.
We also took time to listen — through the 
Engagement Survey and the “I Am Here For You” 
mental wellness initiative. And with “Re-live Your 
Small Joys,” we celebrated life’s little wins.
Here, we don’t just work — we belong.

Training for Tomorrow: Metro Brands’ CSR Initiative 
in Skill Development
Your Company has successfully implemented 
the National Apprenticeship Promotion 
Scheme (NAPS), addressed industry skill 
gaps and provided on-the-job training for 
unemployed young people. Through this 
CSR initiative, 408 youths were trained in 
FY 2024-25 at retail showrooms, enhancing 
their skills and employability. This win-win 
project benefits all stakeholders: society gains 
employable talent, the government meets 
skilling and job creation responsibilities, 
and the Company secures a pipeline of 
trained personnel for its store expansion 
plans while reducing HR costs. On-the-
job training increases industry readiness, 
reduces attrition, and fosters loyalty among 
apprentices and corporates. By partnering 
in NAPS, the Company’s proactive approach 
is demonstrated by bridging skill gaps, 
promoting employability, and contributing to 
the nation’s development, aligning with UN 
SDG Goal 4 (Quality Education) and Goal 8 
(Decent Work and Economic Growth)

Healing Hands: Metro Brands’ Commitment to 
Cobbler Well-being
Cobblers are vital partners for Metro Brands, 
bringing craftsmanship and attention to detail 
to our footwear retailing business. However, 
their strenuous work environment, unhealthy 
habits, and long time away from families pose 
significant health risks. Recognizing these 
challenges, we launched a healthcare project 
to support their well-being. In FY 2024-25, 
we reached 1,313 new cobblers through 23 
health camps, identifying health issues such 
as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. We 
also detected 823 tobacco consumers and 
facilitated positive outcomes, including 214 
quitting tobacco and improved control in 
39 high BP and 51 diabetes cases among 
existing beneficiaries. Additionally, we 
generated and distributed 992 ABHA cards, 
enhancing healthcare access. From the 1,401 
beneficiaries, we supported and tracked 
in FY 2023-24: 214 tobacco users quit, 116 
reduced consumption, and improved control 
in 39 high BP and 51 diabetes cases. This 
initiative contributes to UN SDG Goal 3 (Good 
Health and Well-being), demonstrating our 
commitment to the health and welfare of our 
cobbler partners

dedicated support in income generation, skill development, education, medical assistance, etc as under:

previously low-performing schools. Infrastructure upgrades included repairs, painting, and essential utilities. The project fostered

communities, with a focus on one deserving recipient. Our scholar, Khant Mota, has excelled at Plaksha University, achieving 
notable milestones, including the Arena FIDE Master title, a perfect score in Physics, and two gold medals in inter-university chess

Homecoming Heroes - Transforming Rural  
Education
Many of us cherish nostalgic memories of 
our village school days, but learning our 
alma mater needs urgent attention can be 
painful. We’ve transformed this pain into 
purpose through Homecoming Heroes, 
a volunteering-cum-CSR project. We’ve 
improved quality of education in 8 rural 
schools (2,836 students) across Maharashtra 
by introducing digitized smart class programs 
and infrastructure development. Smart 
classrooms have enhanced lesson planning 
and student engagement, resulting in a 20% 
average increase in student performance. 
Infrastructure upgrades - school repairs, 
painting, refurbishing toilets, providing drinking 
water facilities, constructing compound walls 
etc - have fostered community ownership, 
with teachers and villagers also contributing 
additional funds and forming alumni groups. 
This initiative has not only boosted student 
outcomes but also built strong bonds with 
staff and villages, driving productivity and 
Company growth. By contributing to UN SDG 
Goal 4 (Quality Education), we are creating a 
positive impact that extends beyond education, 
reflecting our commitment to community 
development and social responsibility
