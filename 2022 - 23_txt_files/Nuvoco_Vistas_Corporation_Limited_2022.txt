2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (Yes/No)
	
Yes, the Company has a sustainability program called Protect Our Planet (“POP”), with the goal of achieving environmental and 
social sustainability through participation from cross-functional teams. As part of this initiative, the Company has created an 
Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) framework that will guide the activities undertaken to accomplish 
the project’s objectives. Sustainable sourcing is one under the key agenda under the POP program.
	
Given the rising rates of industrial waste generation, the treatment and disposal of such waste have emerged as crucial economic 
and environmental concerns. The Company has implemented a waste management strategy that involves treating waste as a 
supplementary resource material or for energy recovery, subject to regulatory approvals from authorities such as the Central 
Pollution Control Board (“CPCB”) and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (“MoEFCC”). The Company’s recent 
investments in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have enabled the operationalization of waste pre-processing and co-processing 
facilities.
	
The Company pursues a sustainability agenda aimed at replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels with less carbon-intensive 
materials. Utilization of alternative fuels and raw materials provides a valuable solution that reduces the industry’s reliance on 
coal and greenhouse gas emissions while effectively addressing local environmental concerns.
	
AFR, or Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials, involve the extraction of fuel and raw materials from waste sources. The form of the 
fuel depends on the calorific value of the waste material, while the raw material is utilized in solid form based on the respective 
acceptance criteria in accordance with CPCB norms for material reuse.
	
The Company adheres to an essential process characteristic when dealing with hazardous and other wastes, ensuring that these 
wastes are appropriately fed to the kiln through designated feed points.
	
For packing bags, the Company has selected vendors located near its cement plants based on the Company’s capabilities and 
capacity. Purchasing PP bags from vendors located near the plants has resulted in a reduction in fuel consumption. The Company 
has undertaken an initiative to reduce plastic waste as part of its sustainability agenda. It has resulted in 8% reduction in the plastic 
component of packing bags compared with the previous composition. Further, the Company is exploring the possibility of using 
reprocessed plastic waste for packing bags replacing the virgin polymers.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
~9%
	
This includes the sourcing of alternative fuels, alternative raw materials, packaging materials and waste recovery-based fuel and 
raw materials. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste.	
The Company has initiated a program called “Single-Use Plastic Free NUVOCO” which 
aims to reduce Single Use Plastics on all its premises. Other plastic wastes which are 
recyclable in nature, are collected and stored at designated places for disposal through 
government authorized vendors. The Company has associations with Municipalities to 
provide the Refused Derived Fuels (“RDF”) which has end-of-life plastics, to co-process in 
the high temperature kilns. Processing of RDF and other plastic wastes is being done as 
per state and central pollution control board standards. 
Plastics 
(including packaging) 
	
Co-processing operates on 2 (two) fundamental principles:
	
 1.	
Avoiding any additional emissions or negative impacts on human health and the environment
	
 2.	
Ensuring that the quality of the clinker/cement remains unchanged, with the plant implementing suitable 
measures to uphold this standard
