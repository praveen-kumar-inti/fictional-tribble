Risk
The volatility of geo-political

changes, like wars, adverse 
trade policies and continuing high
inflation in major economies 
can impact the supply chain 
and pricing for the Company’s 
products and services. In the 
absence of appropriate pricing 
policy, this risk may lead to cost 
overruns.
The Company 
tries to address 
the risk of 
material prices

appropriate 
procurement and 
pricing policies 
aimed at ensuring 
stability and cost 
efſ ciency.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Solid waste disposal and

treatment of waste causes 
several spillover effects, including 
organic decay of matter that 
contributes to GHG emissions.
The Company is 
keen on waste 
minimization,
