stewardship but also

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes, our team leads impactful GHG emission reduction projects, targeting key areas of energy conservation. We 
have carried out various projects to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Few thematic areas are 
as mentioned below:
	
1.	
Implementation of energy efficiency and conservation programs at all our manufacturing plants: We conduct 
energy audits each year for the plants to identify opportunities of reducing consumption in the areas of 
compressed air systems, furnace heat loss, energy efficient lightings, etc. We are targeting 3% reduction in 
energy consumption through the audits.
	
2.	
Renewable Energy Penetration: We have installed solar rooftop systems at over 50% of our plants and made 
significant investments in open access procurement through Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO). As a 
result, more than 25% of our renewable energy is sourced through this mechanism. For FY 2025, renewable 
energy accounts for approximately 30% of Varroc’s total energy consumption. We are actively planning to 
enhance renewable energy capacity across all plants in the coming years and are exploring new opportunities 
to expand our solar and wind captive generation capabilities.
	
3.	
Environmental Management Systems (EMS): We have implemented EMS system, which helps us track the Energy, 
Water & Waste Management across all of our plants and optimize it wherever possible.
	
4.	
Optimizing the value chain logistics to reduce our fuel consumption.

We have implemented waste management practices in alignment with applicable regulatory requirements. All 
operational waste is clearly classified into hazardous and non-hazardous categories, with separate collection bins 
installed at each shop floor and workstation. Waste remains segregated throughout its handling—from the point 
of collection to transit and final storage. Authorized and qualified vendors have been engaged to manage waste 
safely and sustainably. Except for e-waste, all other waste is disposed of within 90 days in accordance with regulatory 
guidelines, using Form 10 (manifest forms) as mandated.
