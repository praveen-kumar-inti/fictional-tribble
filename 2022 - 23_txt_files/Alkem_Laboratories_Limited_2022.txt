Resilience 
Business 
Performance
Risk / 
Opportunity
For a pharmaceutical company, it 
is important to always serve the 
market without being impacted by 
uncertainties.
The strategy of the Company 
is 
to 
generate 
long-term 
economic growth with a focus on 
sustainability and value creation 
for all stakeholders. Prudent capital 
allocation is key to profitable 
growth.
The 
Company 
is 
focused 
on 
operating 
with 
stable 
generation of revenue through 
multiple streams by benefitting 
from sustainable supply chain, 
technology 
adoption 
and 
business continuity plan.
Positive 
implications 
due 
to 
smooth 
operations.
Climate 
Change 
& GHG 
Emissions
Risk
Due to rapidly growing focus on 
climate change and responsible 
operations, 
the 
Company 
is 
proactive towards climate change 
and management of their emissions, 
which is a complex process.
The 
Company’s 
initiatives 
and actions are guided by its 
ESG policy that serves as an 
enabling framework to fulfill its 
business responsibilities and 
objectives. The policy drives 
the establishment of a robust 
enforcement mechanism to 
ensure that the Company’s 
commitments are translated 
into actions.
Positive impact due 
to improved energy 
efficiencies 
and 
stakeholder output.
Biodiversity
Risk
In order to be a responsible 
corporate citizen, it is important 
for the Company to operate in a 
sustainable manner with respect to 
the community so that both aspects 
thrive mutually.
The 
Company 
works 
consistently to manage their 
impact on their surroundings 
and grow with them in a 
cooperative manner.
Negative implications 
due to cost incurred 
for the protection of 
biodiversity
Energy 
Management
Risk / 
Opportunity
Responsible 
management 
of 
energy and environment burden is 
necessary for a Company in terms 
of monetary impact and non-
monetary as well. It is important to 
transit from conventional energy 
sources like fossil fuels towards 
modern and efficient fuels.
Energy consumption is a significant 
concern for the Company’s business. 
The Company’s operations are 
energy-intensive and consume a 
high amount of fuel and electricity. 
Therefore, 
upgrading 
to 
new 
technologies, improving processes, 
increasing system efficiency, and 
adopting green energy sources such 
as bio briquettes will immensely 
benefit the Company’s operations 
and profitability.
The 
Company 
is 
working 
through multiple initiatives 
for 
improved 
energy 
management, some of them 
are:
•	 At some sites PNG Gas is 
used in boilers instead of 
furnace oil.
•	 To minimize the use of non-
renewable fuels, Biomass 
Briquette Boiler, solar panels 
have been installed at some 
sites.
•	 Installation 
of 
Variable 
Frequency Drive (VFD)
•	 Replacement of non-efficient 
Air Handling Unit (AHU) with 
new efficient AHU
Negative impact is due 
to cost incurred for 
the capex of energy 
efficient 
equipment; 
however, 
positive 
financial 
impact 
contemplated in long-
run due to lower cost 
of energy.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Poor 
waste 
disposal, 
unsafe 
discharge practices, irresponsible 
waste handling impact adversely 
on the environment. In order to 
be 
compliant 
with 
regulatory 
norms the Company should adopt 
responsible waste management 
practices.
The Company emphasis on 
waste minimization is reflected 
in their adoption of 3R principle: 
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. The 
Company has also tied up with 
an approved agency to support 
in the collection, recycling / 
co-processing of plastic base 
waste.
Negative 
impact 
is 
due to cost incurred 
in 
handling 
and 
management of waste.
Water 
Management
Risk
The regulatory constraints are 
strict on water resource due to its 
decreasing availability. Responsible 
usage 
and 
discharge 
ensure 
stakeholder 
entrustment 
and 
operational continuity.
The Company focus is pivoted 
on 
decreasing 
freshwater 
intake by monitoring of water 
consumption, 
educating 
workforce 
for 
exercises 
in 
saving in water consumption 
and auditing on raw, effluent, 
and treated water.
Rainwater 
harvesting 
is 
adopted at Sikkim site and 
effluent treatment plants are 
adopted across all sites.
Negative 
impact 
is 
due to cost incurred 
in 
handling 
and 
management of water.
Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Risk or 
Opportunity
Due to the nature of the industry, the 
workforce is exposed to hazardous 
chemicals and substances. The 
health 
& 
safety 
management 
is 
a 
continuous 
improvement 
process to mitigate ever-evolving 
challenges.
A robust EHS management system 
combined with thorough hazard 
identification, mitigation strategies, 
root cause analyses of reported 
occurrences, and related corrective 
action plans will highlight the 
Company’s strategy and persistent 
commitment to employee health 
and safety.
•	 The Company is focused 
on its ‘Zero Harm’ approach 
– Zero Harm to People, 
Asset 
and 
Environment. 
The 
Environment, 
Health 
& Safety (EHS) policy is 
applicable across the all the 
sites and Baddi and Daman 
manufacturing sites are ISO 
45001 certified.
•	 The 
Company 
carries 
periodic EHS audits on the 
sites to identify the gaps 
and 
address 
them. 
The 
culture of health & safety is 
promoted through extensive 
employees 
and 
workers 
trainings. Multiple initiatives 
are 
deployed 
to 
ensure 
Process safety and Control of 
chemical exposure.
Negative implications 
are due to cost incurred 
on safety trainings and 
protective gears.
Human 
Resource 
Development
Opportunity
The industry demands human 
capital which is knowledge and 
skill driven. The productivity and 
efficiency of the human resource 
provides better asset integrity and 
business growth.
The Company has a dynamic 
HR policy framework. The HR 
team provides strategic and 
skill development trainings to 
foster a balance of personal 
and professional growth of 
every employee.
Positive 
implications 
due 
to 
increased 
productivity 
of 
workforce.

R&D 
Innovation
Opportunity
Due to rapid increase in demand 
of healthcare, it is important to 
innovate solutions and products to 
serve the market. Further, having 
the advantage over R&D provides 
efficient and accuracy excellence in 
work product.
The Company has a strong 
team of scientists that steers 
the 
R&D 
operations. 
The 
R&D infrastructure has six 
technologically advanced and 
internationally accredited R&D 
centers spread across India and 
the US. The Company invests 
some 
percentage 
of 
their 
revenue into R&D to innovate 
to provide better solution.
Positive impact due 
to 
new 
product 
development
Sustainable 
Supply Chain
Risk
To operate with continuity and 
always serve the customers, it 
is important to decrease the 
dependence 
on 
single 
source 
supplier and trans-border supplier 
engagement 
and 
procurement. 
The Company can enjoy auxiliary 
benefits in both monetary and 
reputational terms due to a resilient 
and sustainable supply chain.
Strong 
inventory 
management, robust planning, 
and 
alternative 
vendor 
development and assessment 
for 
critical 
materials 
is 
supporting the Company in 
mitigation of risk.
Negative implications 
are 
observed 
due 
to cost incurred in 
suppliers’ assessment.
Human Rights
Risk
It is important for a Company to 
promote a healthy culture of respect 
towards human rights. Violation 
of 
these 
practices 
harm 
the 
reputational image of the Company 
and trust within stakeholders.
The 
Company 
has 
well-
structured 
Human 
Rights 
policy which is applicable for 
all employees across all grades 
and locations and stakeholders.
The Company also have a 
specific code of ethics for 
all suppliers, vendors, and 
contractors to guide ethical 
practices.
Negative implications 
are found due to cost 
incurred 
to 
ensure 
strict 
inclusivity 
of 
fundamentals 
of 
human 
rights 
in 
systems and processes.
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
For a Company to thrive with 
community 
entrustment, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
grow 
with 
the 
community priorities and align 
the business goals with them. Any 
violating practices can damage 
Company’s reputation and give rise 
to conflicts.
Establishing relationships of trust 
with communities and ensuring 
their frequent participation will 
help the company contribute to 
social development and minimize 
potential 
objections 
from 
the 
communities.
The Company address and 
support 
the 
immediate 
and long-term needs of the 
community 
and 
focus 
on 
creating major positive impact 
to uplift the community in 
diverse ways. The initiatives 
are impacting the community 
in healthcare, education, rural 
development, 
environment, 
and sports aspects.
Positive 
implication 
due to good will and 
reputation among the 
local communities.

Data 
Privacy and 
cybersecurity
Risk
With an increasing focus on data 
security and privacy, it is important 
for a Company to safeguard the 
data and prevent any breach that 
could harm their reputation and 
may lead to loss on both financial 
and non-financial ends.
The Company has enforced 
Information 
Security 
Policy 
in accordance with Microsoft 
Active Directory. The Company 
is investing adequately in IT 
tools for data protection. Any 
data loss or leakage is closely 
monitored through VAPT and 
IT audits.

due 
to 
cost 
incurred for hardware 
and software needed 
for 
data 
security 
management system
Availability 
and 
affordability 
of medicines
Risk
Being a pharmaceutical Company, 
it is important to provide and 
place product in the market where 
they are accessible and affordable 
for the customers. The medicines 
should be made available and 
affordable so that the Company 
can enjoy competitive edge while 
maintaining a suitable margin.
The Company’s R&D facilities 
are 
working 
to 
innovate 
solutions to ensure affordability 
and accessibility of products 
without 
compromising 
the 
quality.
Positive 
implications 
in longer run due to 
increased market share 
and development.
Clinical Trial 
Conduct
Risk
The conduct of clinical trial is 
significant for any pharmaceutical 
Company to ensure safety and 
efficacy of their products. Violation 
of regulatory norms and unethical 
practicing in clinical trial harms the 
Company on both financial and 
non-financial ends.
The 
Company 
adheres 
to 
all protocols and regulatory 
constraints 
to 
incorporate 
ethical conduct in clinical trials.
Negative implications 
are due to cost incurred 
in 
adhering 
with 
regulations and ethical 
processing.
Product 
Quality and 
Patient Safety
Risk
With 
increasing 
regulatory 
restrictions 
and 
protocols, 
it 
has become significant for the 
Company to be compliant with 
them 
and 
ensure 
customer 
centricity. 
Non-compliance 
may 
lead to reputational damage, fines, 
or penalties along with loss of 
customers’ trust.
The 
Company 
adheres 
to 
cGMP guidelines strictly which 
are enforced by regulatory 
agencies 
for 
manufacturing 
processes, 
hence, 
ensuring 
quality 
assurance. 
The

A smooth integration of corporate 
governance and business ethics 
in a company is essential for 
ensuring ethical conduct within its

a standard framework and strategic 
guidance to navigate the ever-
evolving corporate ecosystem. The 
primary focus of governance is on 
how the organization is managed 
and whether it adheres to best 
practices in terms of transparent 
and ethical leadership. Operating 
in an unethical manner not only 
undermines 
the 
company’s 
reputation 
but 
also 
has 
the 
potential to cause significant harm, 
leading to potential litigation or 
reputational damage.

corporate 
governance 
with 
dedicate
