Navneet’s focus is on 
fostering a positive work 
environment with better 
infrastructure, clean food 
facilities, engaging activities, 
and regular appraisals for 
employees’ growth and 
satisfaction.
Negative 
implications
5
Occupational

Risk

and supportive community 
network.
Positive 
implications

Anti-corruption & 
bribery
Risk
Failure to effectively address 
anti-corruption and bribery 
risks exposes us to legal 
and regulatory violations, 
reputational damage, and 
financial penalties, among 
others.
To mitigate anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption risks, 
Navneet has implemented a 
strong ESG Policy, upholding

Corporate 
governance
Risk
Companies are evaluated 
on their overall performance 
regarding important 
governance matters, such as 
ownership and control, board 
compensation, accounting 
practices, business ethics, and 
transparency in tax matters. 
This subject investigates 
how a Company’s corporate 
governance and ethical 
practices impact its investors, 
including shareholders.
Navneet’s board of directors 
with diverse expertise 
ensures proper governance 
and decision-making. The 
Company maintains robust 
internal control systems, to 
prevent fraud and ensure 
compliance. Transparency 
and accountability are 
upheld through clear 
governance structures 
and defined roles and 
responsibilities.
Negative 
implications
10
Water and 
wastewater 
management
Risk
Water is one of the 
components in production 
process and Company may 
experience operational 
disruptions due to water 
scarcity. This can lead to 
higher water procurement 
costs and capital 
expenditures. Additionally, 
manufacturing process 
produces wastewater that 
must be treated before it can 
be disposed. Failure to comply 
with water quality regulations 
may result in additional 
costs related to regulatory 
compliance and mitigation 
efforts.
At Navneet’s major 
production sites, it has 
installed wastewater 
treatment plants to 
effectively treat water and 
minimise environmental 
impact. Additionally, 
the Company is actively 
focussed on increasing 
the water recycling rate 
as part of its commitment 
to sustainable water 
management and 
conservation efforts.
Negative 
implications
11
Circular economy
Opportunity
The Circular Economy 
model advocates for the 
reuse, refurbishment, and 
recycling of existing materials 
and products. This shift in 
production and consumption 
can lead to a reduction in 
material usage. The transition 
to a circular economy 
could result in a change in 
regulations and demand for 
products, coupled with the use 
of new technology, which has 
the potential to reduce costs.

Responsible

Risk
Navneet publishes alot of 
content, hence the risk of 
inadequate content creation 
and dissemination, which 
may include inaccurate 
information, leading to 
reputational damage, legal 
liabilities, and loss of audience 
trust and loyalty.
Navneet implements 
rigorous editorial standards 
and guidelines, ensuring 
accuracy, fairness, and 
ethical practices. Navneet 
has a thorough content 
review process, including 
fact-checking and 
adherence to industry best 
practices. The Company 
maintains open channels 
of communication to 
receive feedback and 
promptly address any 
concerns or complaints 
from its audience, including 
teachers.
Negative 
implications
13
Product 
innovation and 
quality
Opportunity
Customer preferences 
and needs are constantly 
evolving, and a Company 
that fails to keep up with 
these changes may find 
itself losing customers. In a 
highly competitive market, 
a company that does not 
innovate risks losing its 
competitive edge to its 
rivals. By introducing new 
and improved products, a 
company can stay ahead of 
its competitors and capture 
a larger share of the market. 
Companies that are known for 
their innovative products are 
often seen as more dynamic, 
progressive, and forward-
thinking.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related  challenges,  targets 
and  achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
I am pleased to present our first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, highlighting the challenges, 
performance, and achievements of NEL. At Navneet we recognize the significance of Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) factors and the associated risks and challenges they present.
To better understand and address our key ESG risks and opportunities, we have conducted a comprehensive materiality 
assessment. This assessment plays a crucial role in defining our challenges more accurately and enables us to develop 
targeted strategies and initiatives.
We are committed to environmental responsibility and have set ambitious targets to reduce our carbon footprint and 
minimize waste. A significant achievement has been our successful adoption of wind and solar power, reducing our 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources. We invest in new technologies to enhance product sustainability, exploring 
eco-friendly paper sourcing and UV coating for stationery. We have conducted a comprehensive carbon footprint 
assessment, calculating our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions company-wide.
Our commitment to quality extends beyond our products to the well-being of our employees and the communities we 
serve. We strive to maintain a safe and inclusive work environment, fostering diversity and equal opportunities for all. 
Furthermore, we are dedicated to promoting inclusive growth and have made significant contributions to society in 
various areas, including education, healthcare, and the environment. We believe in giving back and actively support 
initiatives that foster educational opportunities for underserved communities, improve healthcare access, and protect 
the environment. By engaging in these social endeavours, we strive to create a positive impact and contribute to the 
overall well-being and sustainable development of the communities we serve.
In reflecting on our achievements, we are proud of the progress we have made so far. However, we acknowledge that 
there is still much work to be done. We remain dedicated to continuously improving our ESG performance and setting 
new targets that align with our values and the expectations of our stakeholders.

Employee health and safety meetings are conducted every quarter to review the usage of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE), accidents, incidents, and other health and safety-related matters.
	
	
Hazard-risk assessments are performed regularly or as needed when significant changes occur. These 
assessments help verify that all necessary controls are in place and identify any new hazards that require control 
measures.
	
	
By implementing these measures, we aim to create a safe and healthy work environment for all our employees.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Yes,
	
Navneet has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which include:
	
Renewable Energy Generation: The Company has installed 724 KWP of solar panels at two of its manufacturing facilities, 
replacing traditional power consumption with renewable solar energy. This move has resulted in a significant reduction 
of around 30% in power consumption at both factories combined.
	
In addition, the Company also installed a wind power capacity of 4.8 MW, generating 7,738,000 units of power annually. 
By utilising wind and solar power, it is able to significantly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and cut down on its 
greenhouse gas emissions.
	
Solar Heaters in Canteen Operations: Navneet is harnessing the power of the sun not only for its manufacturing needs 
but also for its everyday operations. Solar heaters are used to heat water and for cooking in the Company’s canteens, 
further emphasising its commitment to sustainable energy use.
	
Carbon Emission Reduction: The Company’s effort to reduce carbon footprint have been recognised by its prime 
customer in their Gigaton project, earning it the title of ‘Giga-guru’. So far, its initiatives have led to a significant reduction 
of CO2 emissions, with savings of 19,244.2 metric tonnes to date.
	
By incorporating renewable energy sources and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, Navneet is actively contributing 
to the global fight against climate change. The Company remains committed to exploring and implementing more 
sustainable practices across its operations to further reduce its environmental impact.

adopted to manage such wastes.
	
(a) 	 Plastics (including packaging)
	
	
Navneet’s commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility is reflected in the various initiatives it 
has implemented, all of which are designed to adopt the best waste management practices and minimise the use 
of hazardous chemicals in its products. Here are some key initiatives that we have undertaken:
	
	
1. 
Disposal of Hazardous Wastes: recognising the importance of responsible waste management, Navneet 
ensures that all hazardous materials generated by its operations are properly disposed of. This is done 
through government-authorised vendors, ensuring strict compliance with regulatory requirements and 
guaranteeing the safe and responsible handling of hazardous wastes.
	
	
2.	
Safety Precautions for Solvent-based Ink and PVC-based Adhesive: Navneet prioritise the safety of its 
employees and the environment. Accordingly, the Company adheres strictly to safety protocols in the handling, 
storage, and consumption of solvent-based ink and PVC-based adhesive, taking all necessary precautions to 
minimise any potential risks associated with these substances.
	
	
3.	
Reusable Water-based Ink Carboys: To minimise plastic waste, Navneet has developed a system where 
water-based ink carboys are lined with polybags. This system allows the Company to return the carboys 
to the manufacturer for reuse, significantly reducing plastic consumption and its associated environmental 
impact.
	
	
4. 
Reusing Wiro Product Packaging Materials: Navneet actively encourages the return of wiro product packaging 
materials, such as boxes, rings, and cores, to their manufacturers. These materials are then reused in 
packaging for future orders, thereby reducing waste and contributing to resource conservation.
	
	
5.	
Reuse of PET Straps: Navneet’s approach to palletising export orders and internal palletised material moves 
involves reusing PET straps rather than purchasing new ones. This practice not only minimises waste 
generation but also reduces the Company’s environmental footprint, promoting a circular economy and 
leading to significant cost savings.
	
	
6.	
Improved Adhesive Carboy Design: Navneet has redesigned adhesive carboys to maximise adhesive usage 
and maximise waste. Transitioning from 50 kg carboys to 5 kg carboys with a wide mouth and liner has allowed 
the Company to achieve 100% adhesive consumption, eliminating the previous waste of approximately 1 kg of 
adhesive per carboy.
	
	
7.	
Reusable Antiskid Grip Sheets: In Navneet’s internal mobility processes for finished goods (FG) and work-in-
progress (WIP) items, it now uses reusable antiskid grip sheets. This change eliminates the need for single-
use stretch wrap film, contributing to a reduction in plastic waste and promoting more sustainable packaging 
practices.
	
	
8.	
Transition to Higher-Micron Plastics: Navneet has moved away from lower-micron plastics like BOPP, PP 
bags, and shrink film, opting instead for higher-micron alternatives. This transition is part of the Company’s 
commitment to minimising environmental risks associated with plastic usage and underlines its dedication 
to reducing its environmental impact.
