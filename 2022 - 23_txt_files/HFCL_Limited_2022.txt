addressed, the employee can escalate/ appeal the matter to the higher management 
(Plant Head, Function/ Business Head or MD).

Corporate Overview
	
Illustration of the energy efficient initiatives undertaken by HFCL: -
• Our office building for Optical Fiber Plant developed with Double Layer Glass Facade to conserve energy due to less requirement 
of light and cooling requirements.
• Entire utility equipment is monitored and controlled through Smart BMS (Building Management System) to have real time 
monitoring of critical parameters and optimum use of energy.
• All air handling units are designed with high efficiency DIDW fans with VFD drive instead of Belt drive and are operated with 
closed loop system with field control system to optimise energy consumption.
• All motors in the facility equipped with soft starters instead of the conventional switch gear starters for energy conservation 
and reduction of electrical spikes.
• All plant lightings designed with LED luminaires to save energy.
• High efficiency UPS installed with 96% efficiency.
• All centrifugal chillers equipped with VFD drive, ATC to maintain desired approach, thereby conserve electrical energy.
• All chilled and process water pumps are equipped with VFD drive to optimise Energy consumption.
• Humidifiers designed with high efficiency Humifog system to conserve electrical energy.
• Cable Plant designed with provision of sufficient natural air & light to reduce the Cooling & illumination requirements.
• Cross Air Ventilation & Turbo Ventilators installed wherever applicable.
• 02-Inch Rockwool Insulation is provided to prevent heat, inside the Roof.
• New motors are above IE3 energy efficient therefore electricity consumption reduction in comparison to standard motors.
• HVAC system is of environment friendly R407C refrigerant gas.
• 40% reduction in fuel- diesel consumption by optimising forklift operations in the year 2021-22 at Goa facility.
	
Other Energy efficient products/solutions as illustrated below:
• Developed new-generation wireless point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connectivity solutions with improved energy 
efficiency while delivering higher capacity.
• Developing new generation 5G wireless radio products with energy efficiency features. These products include indoor small 
cell base stations and O-RAN compliant outdoor Macro Radio and mmWave FWA CPE products.
• The energy efficient 5G products operating in n78 band with 1) integrated base station architecture, and 2) O-RAN compliant 
disaggregated architecture.
• Outdoor mmWave CPE products support SA and NSA mode of operations and offer energy saving features like discontinuous 
transmission and reception (DRX).
• The research team is working on developing energy efficient waveforms that could potentially be part of 6G technology standards.

In alignment with our commitment to zero waste to landfills by the year end 2024, a comprehensive waste management plan is 
in place at all the locations of HFCL. We ensure that each type of waste generated categorised and segregated at the source level. 
The hazardous waste generated is collected, transported and disposed through a CPCB authorised vendor as per the regulations 
whereas the non-hazardous waste is either reused/ recycled within the operations (wherever possible) or processed through an 
appropriate mechanism by the authorised vendors. In addition, we ensure that all the raw materials used to manufacture Optical 
Fiber and Optical Fiber Cables are Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant. HFCL has upgraded its RoHS compliance in line with the latest directives 2015/863 
(EU) RoHS that adds four additional restricted substances to the existing list and do not contain substances which are identified 
in the “candidate List of substances of very High concern” published by ECHA on 07/01/2023. Furthermore, HFCL promotes 
the manufacturing of modern designs with reduced level of jelly or no jelly and replacing it with the use of dry water blocking 
materials and switched to 90% of designs with dry core construction. These dry tube/dry core designs help in reduction in use of 
petroleum products.

role is to ensure smooth project operations and align them with the expected outcomes outlined in the MoU.
	
We also actively engage with the local community leaders and directly communicate with the community to receive their grievances, 
complaints and suggestions. We understand the importance of hearing directly from the serving community. As soon as we receive 
such feedback, we promptly address these concerns and forward them to the Project partners for swift action and resolution.
	
Post grievance resolution, the Project partner informs us in a comprehensive manner about the specific mode of redressal and the 
corrective measures taken to prevent similar service delivery lapses in the future.

All India Heart Foundation: 
For years, the National Heart Institute had been a beacon of excellence in cardiac 
care, providing cutting-edge treatments to patients from all over the country. 
However, despite their best efforts, there were still who could not afford the 
medical expenses associated with heart surgeries and treatments. This is where 
HFCL came into the picture. With a mission to make quality healthcare accessible to 
all, HFCL had endured that the financial barriers were no longer a hurdle for those 
who needed heart surgeries but were unable to afford them. And with this new 
partnership, a new era of hope had dawned, where patients from all social classes 
could receive the best possible treatment and care. The core of this partnership was 
a common vision - a vision to make a positive impact on people's lives and provide 
hope for those who were unable to afford it.

that still many struggles to obtain these necessities. However, HFCL and Samarpan 
Foundation joined hands to address this issue by extending a helping hand to the 
street children of Delhi. Our CSR initiative aimed at providing these children with 
a solid foundation through basic education and nutritious meals. The program 
specifically targets those who are homeless or the children of casual migrant 
workers living on the streets or in unauthorised areas. Its goal is to bridge the gap 
between their current situation and the mainstream education system. Not only 
do we provide these young ones with the opportunity to gain experience, but we 
also ensure they receive nourishing food to fuel their growth and development. 
Furthermore, the program guarantees enrolment in regular schools, which paves 
the way for a brighter future.
