1.
Governance
Risk
Governance is a critical and material issue for Nazara, as it 
affects the Company’s ability to create long-term value for its 
shareholders, maintain its reputation, and comply with legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Effective governance is essential to ensure 
that the Company’s decision-making is 
transparent, ethical, and in the best interests 
of all stakeholders, including shareholders, 
customers, employees, and the broader 
community. Good governance practices 
can help to mitigate risks, foster trust, and 
promote sustainable growth.
In case of failure of governance regulations, 
the Company may face actions that could 
lead to financial fines and penalties and a 
tarnished reputation. Additionally, there is a 
risk of reputational damage from incidents that 
may not be regulatory in nature, but still raise 
questions about the ethical conduct of the 
business.
2.
Data Privacy
Risk
Data privacy is a material issue for the Company as it is 
critical to maintaining customer trust, complying with legal 
and regulatory requirements, and avoiding any financial 
or reputational risks associated with data breaches or 
unauthorised access to personal data.
To mitigate the Data privacy risk, the 
Company implemented robust security 
measures, 
conducting 
regular 
security 
audits and risk assessments, and providing 
training and education to employees on 
data privacy best practices.
Breach of Data Privacy can lead towards legal 
fines and penalties, loss of customers and 
the Company may need to spend significant 
amounts of money to remediate a data breach. 
The Company also faces reputational loss in 
case of data breach and securities.
3.
Regulatory 
Approvals
Risk
The Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and 
failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals can delay 
the product launch, increase compliance cost, damage the 
reputation and have legal and financial penalties.
To mitigate the material risk, the Company 
has prioritised compliance with all applicable 
regulations and work closely with regulatory 
agencies to obtain the necessary approvals 
in a timely manner.
Failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
can result in legal and financial penalties. 
These penalties can be significant and can 
include fines, sanctions, and even suspension 
of operations.

4.
Talent, 
attraction and 
retention
Risk and
Opportunity
Opportunity: The Company should focus on creating a 
positive work environment that emphasises employee 
development, growth, and recognition. This can include 
offering competitive salaries and benefits, providing 
opportunities for learning and development, and creating a 
culture of innovation and collaboration. By prioritising talent 
attraction and retention, the Company can position itself for 
long-term success and growth.
Risk: Talent attraction and retention can also be a material 
risk for the Company, as the loss of key employees can 
have significant impact on loss of critical knowledge and 
expertise which can impact the Company’s ability to innovate 
and develop new products or services and can also result in 
decreased productivity and efficiency.
To mitigate the material risk posed by talent 
attraction and retention, the Company 
should focus on creating a positive work 
environment 
that 
prioritises 
employee 
development, recognition, and engagement.
The cost of recruiting and training new 
employees can be significant, particularly 
for highly specialised roles. If the Company 
experiences high turnover, it may need to 
spend more on recruitment and training, 
which can impact the Company’s financial 
performance.
5.
Employee 
Health, Safety, 
and well-being
Risk
Ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees is of 
utmost importance to the Company, as employees are the 
most valuable resource. To achieve this, the Company  assess 
and manage health and safety risks across all our operations.
The 
Company 
emphasises 
on
placing safety as a pre-requisite across all 
its operations. Further, the Company also 
takes various measures to ensure the health 
and well-being of employees by resorting 
to various interventions through health 
awareness programmes.
Prioritising employee health, safety, and well-
being can provide financial benefits to the 
Company by reducing costs associated with 
accidents and illnesses, increasing productivity 
and profitability, and improving talent attraction 
and retention.
6.
Product 
and Service 
Stewardship
Opportunity
Product 
and 
service 
stewardship 
presents 
material 
opportunities for Nazara Technologies by aligning its business 
practices with sustainability principles, enhancing its brand 
value, driving innovation, engaging stakeholders, attracting 
investors, and managing risks. By embracing stewardship, 
Nazara Technologies can position itself as a responsible 
leader in the gaming and entertainment industry, contributing 
to a more sustainable future.
By prioritising product and service stewardship, 
the Company can create long-term value 
for its stakeholders, including customers, 
investors, and the environment. This can 
lead to increased profitability and financial 
sustainability over time.

7.
Climate 
Change
Risk
Industries in the IT, gaming, technology service sectors 
consume a substantial amount of energy and are heavy 
emitters of carbon. The effects of climate change, specifically 
extreme weather events, can physically disrupt the operations 
of the Company and compromise the safety and welfare of 
its employees. Furthermore, economic disruptions caused by 
transition risks can hinder the growth and profitability of the 
Company.
The Company  is implementing several 
measures to mitigate risks, starting with 
assessing its energy consumption. The 
Company is transitioning to more energy-
efficient sources and creating awareness 
among stakeholders to do the same.
Climate change can lead to increased 
operational costs as rising global temperatures 
and extreme weather events can affect the 
Company’s infrastructure, data centres, and 
gaming servers. Further, increasing climate-
related risks, such as natural disasters and 
extreme weather events, can impact insurance 
costs for businesses.
8
Customer 
centricity/ 
customer 
satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk: If the Company fails to prioritise customer needs and 
preferences, it may result in decreased customer satisfaction. 
Dissatisfied customers are more likely to switch to competitors 
resulting in losing market share.
Opportunity: The openness, precision, and clarity of 
marketing communications, service explanations, terms, and 
procedures are crucial in shaping the relationship between 
businesses and their customers. In the context of Nazara 
Technologies this necessitates the provision of trustworthy 
information about their services.
To mitigate these risks, Nazara Technologies 
should prioritise customer-centric strategies, 
including actively listening to customer 
feedback, 
personalising 
experiences, 
improving 
customer 
support, 
and 
continuously innovating to meet evolving 
customer needs.
Positive: The Company’s profitability is greatly 
impacted by customer satisfaction and loyalty, 
as they have a significant positive influence. 
In addition, enhancing customer satisfaction 
can open up better business prospects and 
contribute to financial growth.
Negative: The loss of customers can lead 
to a decline in market share and operational 
revenue for the Company. Additionally, 
customer dissatisfaction has the potential to 
negatively impact the Company’s reputation.
9
Waste 
Management
Risk
The rapid growth of the gaming industry has resulted in a 
significant impact on the environment, from the use of mined 
metals and plastic casings in circuits to the energy required 
to power game consoles. E-waste is also one of the growing 
concerns.
The Company is taking deliberate measures 
to reduce plastic waste and promote the use 
of recyclable paper. To encourage waste 
management, visual aids are being placed 
strategically throughout the organisation. 
Pet plastic bottles are being replaced, and 
paper shredders are used to recycle the 
waste generated. Furthermore, wet and dry 
wastes are separated into biodegradables 
and non-biodegradables.
Failure to comply with current and future 
regulations related to recycling and the circular 
economy can lead to financial penalties and 
harm the reputation of the Company.
