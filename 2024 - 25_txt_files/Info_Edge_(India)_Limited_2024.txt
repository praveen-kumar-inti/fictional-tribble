potential or actual conflicts of interest. This policy applies to the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, associates and

conduct. For example, it strictly prohibits employees from accepting gifts and require them to surrender any such gifts 
to the HR department.

work contracts. These contractual provisions cover anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery measures, confidentiality, and other

LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Awareness programmes conducted for value chain partners on any of the principles during the 
financial year:
	
Recognising the need to equip our suppliers with the knowledge and tools necessary for effective ESG implementation, 
we conducted dedicated capacity building sessions focused on ESG principles and SEBI BRSR compliance expectations. 
These sessions aimed to:
•	 Enhance suppliers' understanding of ESG risks and opportunities,
•	 Familiarise them with the BRSR framework, reporting structure, and key performance indicators, and
•	 Promote the adoption of sustainable practices in their day-to-day operations.
2.	
Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of 
the Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.
	
Yes, the Company prioritises the establishment of a positive and ethical work environment through its Conflict of Interest 
clause within the Code of Ethics & Conduct. With a commitment to integrity and business sustainability, it recognises the 
significance of avoiding conflicts of interest while respecting the rights and choices of its employees. The Code of Ethics 
& Conduct applies to all employees, the Board of Directors, wholly owned subsidiaries. It provides detailed guidance 
on identifying and addressing various conflict-of-interest scenarios, emphasises disclosure methods and outlines the 
consequences of non-compliance. The Code of Ethics & Conduct can be accessed at the Company’s website: https://
www.InfoEdge.in/pdfs/code-of-ethics.pdf.
	
Additionally, the Company has implemented a policy titled ‘Policy for Personal Investments and Engagement by Executive 
leadership with Other Entities’. This policy regulates external commitments of full-time Directors and executive leadership, 
setting limitations and defining an approval process for employee engagement and investment for employees in executive 
positions, including Whole-time Directors.
	
The aforesaid policy most importantly ensures that the focus on core business of the Company is maintained and there 
is no conflict of interest between the obligations of executive leaders towards the Company and other engagements. A 
copy of the said policy is uploaded on the website of the Company at https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/Policy_for_Personal_
Investments_and_Engagment_by_Executive_Leadership_with_other_Entities.pdf.
	
Furthermore, the Company has developed a comprehensive Code of Conduct to Regulate, Monitor, and Report Trading 
by Insiders. This code aims to prevent insider trading among the management and staff by establishing clear guidelines, 
monitoring procedures, and reporting mechanisms. A copy of the said Code is uploaded on the website of the Company 
at https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/Code-of-Conduct-To-Regulate-Monitor-&-Report-Trading-By-Insiders.pdf.
	
Also, the Company believes in the conduct of its affairs in a fair, accountable and transparent manner and is committed to 
creating a culture of ‘Right Doing’ and avoid any potential or actual conflicts of interest. In view of the same, the Company 
has in place a Related Party Transactions Policy. A copy of the said Policy is uploaded on the website of the Company at 
https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/Related-Party-Transaction-Policy.pdf.

Technology efficiencies. Over the previous years, the Company has made substantial investments to bolster its capital 
assets, particularly in upgrading its IT infrastructure including software, communication networks, and equipment to 
enhance its digital capabilities, leveraging artificial intelligence where applicable. Furthermore, the Company is actively 
implementing measures to promote environmental sustainability across its operations.

2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Since the Company is a service entity and being an internet company, it is relatively less resource intensive in terms 
of material inputs. However, as a responsible corporate citizen, it has formulated a policy on ‘Sustainable Supply 
Chain’ that has procedures in place to ensure that the procurement of products and services occurs in a sustainable 
and safe manner. The Company has also endeavored to reduce the environmental impact of its operations by 
tracking the consumption of resources critically. As part of the Company’s operations, a small amount of e-waste is 
generated by the Company which is dealt with as per the statutory norms governing the handling and management 
of such waste. Link to the policy: https://www.infoedge.in/pdfs/sustainable-supply-chain-policy.pdf.
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
While the Company has not captured data for sustainably sourced inputs in the current financial year, it plans to put 
in place mechanisms for measurement.
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other 
waste.
Waste type
Waste management procedure in place
Plastic (including packaging)
Given the service-centric nature of the Company's operations, the reliance on 
material resources is relatively low, rendering product recycling not relevant 
to the organisation's activities. The waste generation at the Company's office 
facilities remains minimal. However, the Company has established robust 
procedures to ensure the proper disposal of e-waste through authorised 
vendor channels. Furthermore, the Company engages third-party agencies, duly 
authorised by the district authority, to manage the collection and disposal of 
other waste streams, such as wastepaper and paper products, in a responsible 
manner.
E-waste
Hazardous waste
Other waste 
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes/No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Given the service-oriented nature of the Company’s business operations, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not 
applicable. As the Company does not engage in the manufacturing of any physical products, the requirement to submit 
an EPR plan to Pollution Control Boards does not pertain to the Organisation’s activities.
LEADERSHIP INDICATORS
1.	
Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for 
manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details:
	
Given the inherent nature of the Company’s service-oriented business model, the environmental footprint associated 
with its operations is relatively modest. Thus, the Company has not undertaken any Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments 
(LCA) for its services during the current financial year.
2.	
If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or 
disposal of your products/services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or 
through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.
	
Not Applicable, as the Company has not performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), as mentioned in our previous response.
3.	
Percentage of recycled or reused input material to total material (by value) used in production (for 
manufacturing industry) or providing services (for service industry).
	
Given the service-centric nature of the Company's operations, the reliance on material resources is relatively low and 
rendering product recycling not relevant to the organisation's activities. The waste generation at the Company's office 
facilities remains minimal. However, the Company has established robust procedures to ensure the proper disposal of 
e-waste and battery waste through authorised vendor channels as per government norms. Furthermore, the Company 
engages third-party agencies, duly authorised by the district authority, to manage the collection and disposal of other 
waste streams, such as wastepaper and paper products, in a responsible manner.

Of the products and packaging reclaimed at end of life of products, amount (in metric tonnes) reused,

Given the service-centric nature of the Company's operations, the reliance on material resources is relatively low and 
rendering product recycling not relevant to the organisation's activities. The waste generation at the Company's office

waste streams, such as wastepaper and paper products, in a responsible manner.
5.	
Reclaimed products and their packaging materials (as a percentage of products sold) for each 
product category.
	
As the Company does not manufacture any tangible products, there are no physical products or packaging materials 
that require reclamation or end-of-life management. The Company’s operations are focused on the provision of services, 
which do not generate physical products or packaging that would need to be reclaimed.
