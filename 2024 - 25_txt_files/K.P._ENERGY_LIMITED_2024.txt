Risk
Company’s revenue 
streams are closely tied 
to capital expenditures 
in the wind energy 
sector, primarily driven 
by Independent 
Power Producers (IPP) 
and Captive Power 
Producers (CPP). 
Therefore, fluctuations 
in the capital 
expenditure scenario 
and cycle, such as 
reduced investments 
by either IPPs or CPPs, 
have the potential to 
adversely affect our 
financial performance.
By Strengthening 
customer relationships, 
building strong 
partnerships and 
delivering value-added 
services, we aim to 
foster customer loyalty 
and retain a stable
