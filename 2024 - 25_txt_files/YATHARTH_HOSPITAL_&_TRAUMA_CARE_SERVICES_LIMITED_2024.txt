1
Energy and
Emission
Risk
In the healthcare sector, 
energy consumption and 
related emissions pose 
significant challenges. 
Hospitals and medical 
facilities operate 24/7, 
requiring substantial 
energy to power medical 
equipment, maintain 
climate control, and 
ensure proper lighting. 
This intensive energy 
demand drives up 
operational costs and 
contributes to a larger 
carbon footprint. Volatile 
energy prices can further 
exacerbate financial 
strain. Moreover, high 
emissions levels may 
result in regulatory 
non-compliance and 
reputational damage, 
particularly as societal 
expectations around 
environmental 
responsibility continue 
to rise.
The Company is committed 
to energy conservation and 
has entered into a captive 
electricity agreement 
to reduce dependence 
on conventional energy 
sources. One of our 
hospitals has been awarded 
a prestigious three-star 
certification by the GRIHA 
Council, in recognition 
of its sustainable 
design and operational 
practices. To foster a 
culture of environmental 
responsibility, the Company 
actively promotes 
awareness among 
stakeholders on efficient 
energy use. In addition, tree-
planting drives are regularly 
organized to enhance 
the local microclimate 
and contribute to carbon 
offsetting. Through the 
implementation of energy-
efficient technologies, 
emissions reduction 
initiatives, and community 
engagement, the Company 
is advancing its mission 
toward a greener, more 
sustainable future.
Positives:
Cost Optimization:
Adoption of energy-
efficient practices 
contributes to the 
reduction of long-term 
operational costs.
Environmental 
Stewardship:
Utilizing renewable 
energy sources 
demonstrates a 
strong commitment 
to environmental 
sustainability 
and corporate 
responsibility.
Challenges:
High Operational 
Costs:
Continued reliance 
on non-renewable 
energy sources leads 
to elevated operational 
expenses and 
exposure to energy 
price volatility.
2
Water 
Management
Risk
Water management 
is a critical concern for 
healthcare facilities, 
which require substantial 
volumes of water for 
patient care, sanitation, 
equipment sterilization, 
and various medical 
procedures. Inefficient 
use or contamination 
of water resources can 
significantly increase 
operational costs, pose 
serious health risks, and 
lead to regulatory non-
compliance. In water-
scarce regions, supply 
constraints may further 
challenge the ability of 
healthcare institutions 
to maintain hygiene 
standards and ensure the 
uninterrupted delivery 
of essential medical 
services.
The Company proactively 
mitigates water 
management risks through 
responsible practices 
aligned with the 3R 
principle—Reduce, Reuse, 
and Recycle. A variety of 
water-saving initiatives 
have been implemented, 
including the installation of 
sewage treatment plants 
and low-flow fixtures 
in restrooms, aimed at 
optimizing consumption 
and minimizing waste. 
Furthermore, the Company 
is committed to achieving 
water neutrality and 
ultimately water positivity 
by managing resources 
efficiently and offsetting 
usage through sustainable 
and regenerative initiatives.
Positives:
Environmental 
Sustainability:
By fostering a culture 
of responsible water 
usage, the Company 
actively contributes 
to water conservation 
and reinforces 
its commitment 
to sustainable 
environmental 
practices.
Challenges:
Operational and 
Financial Risk:
Ineffective water 
management can 
result in service 
disruptions due 
to water scarcity, 
leading to potential 
operational downtime 
and increased financial 
burden.

Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste management is 
a critical concern in the 
healthcare sector, given 
the significant volumes 
of hazardous, biomedical, 
and pharmaceutical waste 
generated. Improper 
handling, storage, or 
disposal of such waste 
can lead to severe health 
risks, environmental 
contamination, and 
substantial legal liabilities. 
Healthcare facilities 
must comply with 
stringent regulations 
governing medical waste 
disposal, with non-
compliance potentially 
resulting in heavy 
fines and legal action. 
Moreover, inefficient 
waste management 
practices can increase 
operational costs and 
negatively impact the 
organization’s reputation. 
As the volume of 
medical waste continues 
to rise, healthcare 
providers face increasing 
pressure to implement 
safe, compliant, and 
sustainable waste 
management solutions 
to mitigate these risks 
effectively.
The Company ensures 
systematic segregation 
of hazardous waste, 
biomedical waste, e-waste, 
and both dry and wet 
waste streams. Disposal of 
biomedical, hazardous, and 
electronic waste is carried 
out through government-
authorised vendors and 
certified recyclers, in strict 
adherence to all applicable 
regulatory standards, 
ensuring safe and 
environmentally responsible 
waste management.
Positives:
Environmental and 
Cost Benefits:
Efficient waste 
management supports 
environmental 
preservation and 
promotes cost 
optimization through 
streamlined disposal 
processes and 
resource recovery.
Challenges:
Reputational and 
Community Impact:
Improper waste 
disposal can degrade 
the surrounding 
environment, leading 
to community 
dissatisfaction 
and potentially 
straining stakeholder 
relationships.
4
Patient Care 
and Service 
Quality
Risk
Inadequate patient 
care can result in severe 
health outcomes, 
increased readmission 
rates, and, in critical 
cases, loss of life. These 
consequences may 
expose healthcare 
providers to malpractice 
litigation, reputational 
harm, and a deterioration 
of patient trust. 
Maintaining consistently 
high standards of care 
presents an ongoing 
challenge, particularly in 
the context of evolving 
medical practices, 
rapid technological 
advancements, 
and rising patient 
expectations.
The Medical Superintendent 
and Facility Directors 
serve as custodians of all 
medical complaints within 
the Company, rigorously 
managing the complaint 
tracker to ensure prompt 
and effective resolution. 
Following established 
protocols, the Company 
takes appropriate actions 
to address patient 
concerns and, when 
required, implements new 
procedures or corrective 
measures to maintain the 
highest standards of patient 
satisfaction.
Positives:
Improved Clinical 
Outcomes:
A dedicated focus on 
patient safety helps 
reduce medical errors 
and adverse events, 
leading to better 
clinical results.
Increased Patient 
Trust:
Emphasizing patient 
safety and quality of 
care builds stronger 
trust and loyalty 
among patients.
Challenges:
Reputational Risk:
Any failure in 
maintaining patient 
safety can lead to 
negative media 
exposure, potentially 
harming the 
organization’s public 
reputation.

Corporate 
Governance 
structures
Risk
Weak governance can 
lead to mismanagement, 
financial irregularities, 
and non-compliance 
with healthcare 
standards and 
regulations. Such 
failures may result in 
legal complications, loss 
of accreditation, and 
erosion of stakeholder 
trust. In a sector as 
sensitive and heavily 
regulated as healthcare, 
poor governance can 
jeopardize patient care, 
increase the risk of data 
privacy breaches, and 
cause financial instability. 
Furthermore, ineffective 
leadership and a lack 
of accountability can 
contribute to a negative 
organizational culture, 
diminishing staff morale 
and ultimately affecting 
the quality of care 
provided. Therefore, 
robust governance is 
essential for navigating 
the complexities of 
the healthcare sector 
and securing the 
organization’s long-term 
sustainability.
The Company’s Board of 
Directors champions the 
organization’s vision and 
strategic goals, providing 
strong leadership and 
direction. To maintain clear 
hierarchy and accountability, 
the Company has 
established dedicated Board 
and internal committees. 
Key management personnel 
and Board members act 
in the best interests of 
investors and stakeholders, 
ensuring their concerns are 
thoroughly represented and 
effectively addressed.
Positives:
Ethical Decision-
Making:
Strong governance 
frameworks foster 
ethical decision-
making, nurturing a 
culture of integrity and 
responsible business 
practices.
Transparency and 
Accountability:
Effective corporate 
governance enhances 
transparency and 
accountability, 
reinforcing 
stakeholder trust and 
confidence.
Challenges:
Reputational Risk:
Weak governance can 
lead to reputational 
damage, undermining 
stakeholder trust and 
confidence.

challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 
	
The healthcare sector carries a substantial environmental footprint, and we acknowledge that integrating 
sustainable practices is essential not only for environmental preservation but also for the long-term resilience 
and success of our business, as well as the well-being of the communities we serve.
	
Our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is comprehensive and strategic. 
We focus on optimizing resource utilization, including energy and water consumption, enforcing responsible 
biomedical waste management, enhancing employee welfare through human-centric policies, and maintaining 
strong corporate governance frameworks. This integrated approach enables us to effectively address and 
advance sustainability across all ESG dimensions.
	
In line with our Environmental, Social & sustainability agenda, during the year, we entered into an agreement with 
a fourth partner for captive power consumption. This strategic initiative is a significant step towards enhancing 
our energy efficiency and reducing our dependence on conventional energy sources. By transitioning to captive 
power usage, we aim to lower our carbon emissions, increase energy cost predictability, and reinforce our long-
term commitment to cleaner and more resilient energy solutions.
	
We maintain stringent controls over biomedical waste management, ensuring full compliance with the Bio-
Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016, issued by the Government of India. This includes systematic monitoring, 
segregation, treatment, and safe disposal of biomedical waste to mitigate environmental and health risks.
	
Our leadership, senior management, and workforce are committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and 
integrity. We promote a workplace environment that is equitable, inclusive, and free from unlawful discrimination 
and harassment. Our governance framework includes policies that encourage transparent communication and 
provide confidential channels for reporting any violations related to compliance, ethics, or fraud.
	
These sustained efforts underscore our dedication to responsible management and positive societal impact. 
Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize innovation and operational excellence in healthcare delivery, with 
sustainability deeply embedded in all aspects of our business operations.
