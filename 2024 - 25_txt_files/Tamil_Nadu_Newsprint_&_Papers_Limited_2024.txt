or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk/

Financial implications of the 
risk or opportunity
1.
Excess pulp 
production 
in Packaging 
Board 
manufacturing
Opportunity
The company plans to utilize excess 
pulp for setting up a new tissue 
paper plant. This not only prevents 
wastage and promotes resource 
efficiency but also supports business 
expansion into a new product line, 
aligned 
with 
circular 
economy 
principles
Positive 
– 
Potential 
to 
generate additional revenue 
streams from tissue paper 
production, improve overall 
resource 
utilization, 
and 
achieve economies of scale. 
This may enhance profitability 
and reduce operational costs 
in the long run.

2
Increasing 
Demand for 
Sustainable 
Packaging 
Solutions
Opportunity
Rising consumer awareness and 
regulatory push for sustainable 
alternatives to plastic have created 
a growing market for eco-friendly 
packaging. The paper industry is 
well-positioned to meet this demand. 
The Company is actively investing 
in 
R&D 
to 
develop 
recyclable, 
compostable, 
and 
biodegradable 
packaging materials.
Positive 
– 
diversification 
into 
premium 
sustainable 
packaging can result in higher 
margins and open new export 
opportunities.
3.
Climate Change 
Impact on 
Agro-based 
Inputs
Risk
Changing 
rainfall 
patterns 
and 
temperature shifts are impacting 
the availability and quality of agro-
residues like bagasse and hardwood. 
These are key inputs for pulp 
production.
Negative 
– 
potential 
for 
increased 
raw 
material 
costs or supply disruptions. 
Mitigation 
includes 
diversifying 
input 
sources 
and improving raw material 
storage.
4.
Global Pulp 
Price Volatility
Risk
International pulp prices remain 
volatile due to geopolitical tensions, 
supply 
chain 
constraints, 
and 
inflationary pressures. While the 
Company 
has 
internal 
pulping 
capabilities, 
it 
is 
still 
partially 
dependent on imported pulp.
Negative – may increase input 
costs and affect profitability. 
The Company is expanding 
domestic pulping capacity to 
mitigate this.

Governance, leadership, and oversight
 7.
Statement by the director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related 
challenges, targets, and achievements.
Over the past five decade, the importance of sustainability has grown significantly due to the increasing global 
population and higher per capita resource consumption on our planet. This has led to the emergence of sustainability 
science as a field that bridges different disciplines. Inclusive and sustainable development has become a top priority 
for nations and industries alike. TNPL stands out as an excellent example of an organization that efficiently uses 
natural resources, maintains environmental cleanliness, uses non-traditional raw materials and energy sources 
and even uses waste from paper processes, lime sludge for cement production. TNPL’s dedication to sustainability 
positions them as a leader in guiding industries toward a more sustainable future. 
TNPL is dedicated to efficient resource utilization and renewable energy generation through a circular economy 
model. The company is investing in Research and Development to enhance operational efficiency and minimize 
environmental impact. This development will yield cost savings in resource utilization while boosting overall 
operational effectiveness. 
Acknowledging that proper engagements of employees are crucial for sustained success, TNPL encourages 
collaboration to enhance well-being and satisfaction. The company offers diverse training opportunities to motivate 
employees at all levels, fostering a culture prioritizing health, safety, collaboration, inclusivity, continuous learning, 
and personal growth. TNPL recognizes its responsibility to uplift surrounding communities, investing in education, 
infrastructure, health facilities, and youth livelihoods. 
Ongoing involvement and partnership with our stakeholders are crucial for company’s advancement and fulfilling its 
goal of safeguarding people and the environment. To establish a solid basis for ESG strategy, the company engaged 
with stakeholders to grasp significant matters for the Company and are actively dealing with them. 
Also, we aim to make this report more comprehensive in the coming years by adding more parameters.

In accordance with the E-Waste Management Rules, TNPL qualifies as a Bulk Consumer and 
ensures the environmentally sound disposal of e-waste through authorized recyclers.
(c)	 Hazardous 
waste
TNPL has implemented an integrated solid waste management system to ensure the safe 
reuse and recycling of hazardous waste. Paper mill by-products such as lime sludge, lime grit, 
and fly ash are utilized in an in-house cement manufacturing unit, thereby converting waste 
into value-added products. Additionally, lime-based wastes are reused as raw materials 
within the production process to promote circularity and reduce environmental impact.
(d)	 Other waste
Organic waste generated from the pulp mill operations is effectively used as fuel in the 
Company’s power boilers, supporting energy recovery and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. 
Black liquor solids produced from pulping operations are processed in chemical recovery 
boilers to generate power and steam. Furthermore, TNPL operates a bio-methanation 
plant that enables the conversion of organic waste into biogas, which is used to replace 
conventional fuels in various operations.

Yes, The Company’s waste collection strategy is in alignment with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
action plan prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), thereby demonstrating its adherence to 
the principles of sustainable plastic waste management. As a registered Brand Owner, TNPL utilizes various 
forms of plastic— including flexible and multilayered plastics—for packaging its products such as Printing and 
Writing Paper, Paper Boards, and Cement. In line with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2022, the Company 
obtained its EPR registration from the CPCB on 09th March 2022 and has undertaken multiple initiatives to ensure 
compliance with the applicable EPR guidelines.

Principle 9: Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner:
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
TNPL has a structured and transparent mechanism in place to receive, investigate, and respond to consumer 
and dealer complaints. Complaints are initially lodged by customers or dealers and subsequently registered 
in the company’s ERP system by the respective branch or regional office, which generates a unique complaint 
reference number for tracking.
	
The registered complaint, along with supporting documents such as samples, photos, or labels, is forwarded to 
the factory’s Marketing Complaint Cell. After preliminary scrutiny, the complaint is routed to the Quality Control 
(QC) department for detailed investigation. The QC team examines the nature of the complaint, inspects relevant 
materials, and prepares a report outlining findings and corrective actions, if necessary.
	
This report is reviewed and shared with the concerned branch/regional office, which communicates the 
resolution to the customer or dealer. In case the complaint is found valid, a compensation process is initiated by 
the marketing team through an approval note, followed by issuance of a credit note by the Finance Department. 
Final communication regarding complaint closure is shared with the customer. For complaints deemed invalid, a 
formal response is issued, clearly explaining the rationale.
	
This well-defined process ensures accountability, timely redressal, and continuous improvement in customer 
satisfaction. Moreover, customers have the option to utilize our https://www.tnpl.com/grievance-redressal/
platform for addressing any grievances they may have.
