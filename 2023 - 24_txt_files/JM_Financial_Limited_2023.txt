fall under the purview of the Human Resources department. This also includes addressing any grievances put forth 
by its employees.
	
The Company also has a robust whistle blower mechanism, wherein the whistle blower can send the complaint in form of 
Protected disclosure directly to the Chairman of the audit committee of the Company.
	
Additionally, for sexual harassment related complaints, 4 (four) Internal Committees (IC) have been constituted region wise 
to consider and redress complaints of harassment. The composition of IC comprises majority of women employees and an

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Internal Mechanism for employees
	
The Company is committed to ensure a secure and supportive work environment for all its employees. The Company 
has implemented a formal grievance mechanism for employees to report any concerns they may have, confidentially 
and anonymously, without fear of any retaliation. This mechanism is accessible to all affected employees in a fair and 
transparent manner.
	
Should such a situation arise, employees may report their concerns either in writing or orally. They can communicate their 
concerns to their reporting manager, compliance or firm management, or the human resources department.
	
Whistle Blower Mechanism
	
The whistle blower can send the protected disclosure in a sealed envelope to the Chairman of the audit committee or can 
write directly to him on his email id viz., pkanakia3@gmail.com.
	
The Chairman of the audit committee is mandated to relay all cases to the audit committee. Upon receiving a protected 
disclosure, the committee has the discretion to either personally investigate the matter or to assign the investigation to a 
senior official, a committee of managerial personnel, or an external party (collectively referred to as ‘Investigators’). This is 
applicable unless the protected disclosure is judged to be frivolous or ties to a grievance that is part of the exclusions listed 
in the policy. The audit committee also has the authority to outline an elaborate protocol for an investigation, which must be 
adhered to by the appointed senior executive or managerial committee during the investigation of the protected disclosure.
	
The Company shall endeavor to resolve the complaint within 45 days. The time frame may be exceeded depending on 
the nature and seriousness of the complaint. If an investigation leads the audit committee to conclude that an improper or 
unethical act has been committed, the audit committee shall take such disciplinary or corrective action as it deems fit.
	
Under POSH
	
A specific email id icc@jmfl.com is created for the purpose of receiving written complaints. The Group Head of Human 
Resources and the Presiding Officer have access to this email id.
	
For complaints made to the IC, there is Informal Redressal Process that consists of directly speaking with the respondent and 
involving the Human Resources facilitator to arrive at a mediated resolution. In cases where an informal redressal process 
and the possible actions are not satisfactory, a formal redressal process shall be followed. Some steps include proceeding 
with an inquiry within 7 working days of receiving the complaint. Additionally, the complainant and the respondent shall 
be informed of the outcome of the investigation. The inquiry shall be completed within 90 days and corrective actions 
recommended by IC to Firm Management and Firm Management will act upon the recommendations within 60 days of

receipt of recommendations from the IC. Where any misconduct is determined after due enquiry by the IC, appropriate

sought by the complainant.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
	
To address electricity consumption, the Company has installed motion sensors in office cabins and other areas to avoid 
unnecessary energy consumption when these spaces are unoccupied. Furthermore, traditional lighting has been swapped 
out for more energy-efficient LED lights and smart UPS have been implemented, which also contributes to a reduction in 
energy consumption. The use of video conferencing technologies by the Company has allowed it to cut down on employees’ 
air travel, thereby contributing to a reduction in related emissions.
	
The Company plans to conduct energy audits at all corporate offices in a phased approach to evaluate the potential, 
installing energy-efficient equipment, appliances and smart sensors for managing lights and other devices. Based on this 
baseline, the Company will establish goals for reducing total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in the subsequent 
years. At present, the Company utilizes renewable energy for the common space (lobby, balcony, lift, and parking,) at 
Cnergy office, Mumbai. As part of digitalization, the Company continuously pursues automation. The Company is currently 
in the process of migrating a few entities to the cloud using shared infrastructure services like Google/AWS, which will 
contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

this indicator not applicable. However, the Company’s waste management programmes are based on the 3R principles 
- Reduce, Recycle, Reuse. The waste is segregated based on its origin and method of disposal. The Company’s waste 
management practices are detailed below:
	
•	
E-waste and emissions reduction: The Company identified scrap material based on factors like being outdated/
obsolete or non-repairable hazardous waste. The scrap is then handed over to a selected vendor, and the Company 
received E-Green certificates for the scrapped material.
	
	
Additionally, the Company replaced conventional lights with LED lights, which minimizes the harmful effects of mercury 
and reduces health and environmental concerns. Projectors were also replaced with LEDs, contributing significantly to 
power consumption reduction, and reducing waste.
	
•	
Reducing paper and printing consumption: The Company recycles shredded paper. Cartridge reclaiming is 
conducted through a vendor. New LEED approved products may be used to reduce the consumption of tissue papers. 
Additionally, employees are encouraged to-
	
	
•	
Use their own ceramic mugs, eliminating the need for paper cups
	
	
•	
Refrain from using tissue papers in washrooms and opt for installed hand-dryers
	
	
•	
Reading documents electronically and printing only when absolutely required
	
•	
Curbing generation of plastic waste: Keeping in line with the Central & State Government (India) Directives in 2018, 
the Company has eliminated ‘single-use plastics’ in all its offices in India. The Company has also stopped using plastic 
bottles and shifted to glass bottles, which is also implemented in all meeting rooms.
	
•	
Conscientious use of water: The Company advocates for mindful water usage and urges its employees to be aware 
and responsible in their consumption.

Shri Vardhman Nidan Seva
The project was initiated in December 2020, to provide primary - curative and 
preventive healthcare services to families in over 30 villages and 55 hamlets in 
Sikandra and Khaira blocks of Jamui district, Bihar. The villages covered under 
the project are primarily inhabited by tribal and scheduled caste populations, who 
face the hardest time in accessing quality healthcare owing to unavailability of 
transportation, poor-quality and expensive service by local quacks, and related 
challenges in terms of livelihoods, agriculture, water, and sanitation.
The project was initiated with its first Mobile Health Unit (MHU) in December 2020, 
to provide healthcare services to 15 villages across Khaira and Sikandra blocks of 
Jamui district, Bihar. The project was further scaled up after a year with another 
Mobile Health Unit reaching out to next set of 15 villages. Each MHU is equipped 
with a doctor, nurse, pharmacist, driver and a community health worker and 
supported on ground with 28 village-based Community Mobilizers. 
The clinical curative services provided have helped in early diagnosis and prevented 
patients from reaching chronic stages of their health concerns, especially in the 
case of children, women and geriatric population, who are more dependent on 
their family members for their well-being and care. In addition to curative services, 
preventive healthcare awareness is disseminated periodically through sessions 
held in each village/hamlet by the MHU team, with the help of IEC (Information 
Education Communication) tools created by JM Financial Foundation (JMFF). 
Certain special interventions are carried also out throguh the project mainly in 
Maternal and Child Health, Anemia, Malnutrition and Hypertension.
