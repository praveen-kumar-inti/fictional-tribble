Further, the Company has a well-defined vigilance framework which provides a platform to the employees, Directors, 
vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders to lodge their grievances/ complaints.
 
 
The shareholders can directly submit their complaints to Company through investorrelations@mahanagargas.com or to 
RTA at rnt.helpdesk@in.mpms.mufg.com and queries or service requests in electronic mode are to be raised only through 
RTA’s website, i.e., https://web.in.mpms.mufg.com/helpdesk/Service_Request.html. The Company has empowered a 
Board-level Stakeholders Relationship Committee (‘SRC’) to examine and redress complaints by shareholders
 
 
MGL has set up various online and offline touch points such as 24*7 call centers, Customer Helpline, Walk-in Centres, 
Back Office facilities, and electronic channels such as the Mobile App, Website, and social media platforms like 
Facebook and Twitter. This setup is designed to address complaints, queries, and service requests from the customers. 
Additionally, MGL periodically communicates with its customers through print and electronic media, SMS, hoardings, 
flyers, and other channels.
 
 
Further, MGL is also a part of the Centralized Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System (‘CPGRAMS’). This 
system is aimed at providing the citizens and the public at large with a platform for redressal of their grievances, where

Financial implications of

(Indicate positive or

1.
Energy 
management
Risk
Under City Gas 
Distribution (‘CGD’) 
sector where 
compressors 
consume 
substantial power 
for compression 
of natural gas to 
dispense it as CNG, 
inefficient energy 
management can 
lead to an increase 
in operational 
costs. Energy 
utilized for office air 
conditioning system 
is also an important 
factor.
Some of the important initiatives undertaken 
by the Company for energy management at 
its premises are listed below:
 
 
Installed natural gas fuelled Microturbine 
at the MGL’s Mahape Office to use 
it as primary power source for office 
building and utilize its exhaust heat 
for centralized air conditioning system 
of office building. This reduces power 
intake from the grid and utilizes exhaust 
heat which is otherwise wasted.
 
 
Installation of solar power panels at MGL 
offices and gas receiving stations.
 
 
Completed deployment of 107 nos. of 
Type-3/ Type-4 composite CNG cylinder 
cascades for CNG transportation. 
These cascades have resulted in 
transporting more CNG per trip, thereby 
reducing the number of trips and hence 
fuel consumption.
 
 
Installed IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar 
Transistor) based power factor correction 
panels at all MGL owned CNG stations 
and STU (State Transport Utility) depots 
to ensure power factor at desired 
level which ensures optimum use of 
electrical energy from grid and avoid 
burden on grid. All other CNG stations 
are also installed with power factor 
correction panels which ensure optimum 
utilization of grid power.
Energy Management 
serves as a Risk 
and has a potential 
negative implication for 
the Company. However, 
due to various energy 
efficiency initiatives 
undertaken, the 
negative implication is 
minimal.
2.
Asset 
integrity 
and critical 
incident 
management
Risk
Pipeline & 
compressor 
infrastructure is 
backbone of CGD 
industry. Gas being 
inflammable and 
a necessity of life; 
asset safety, human 
life and continuity 
of supply can be at 
risk without efficient 
systems in place.
MGL has a Board-approved Asset integrity 
Policy & Integrity Management Plan.
Additionally, the company has implemented 
various policies and procedures which 
includes risk audit framework, operation 
and maintenance guidelines covering gas 
pipeline surveillance, defect assessment & 
repair policy, Management of Change (MOC) 
procedure, Non-Routine Operation (NRO) 
procedure to optimize asset integrity, safety 
& productivity.
Regular mock drills are conducted to check 
effectiveness and for monitoring and control 
as part of Emergency Response & Disaster 
Management Plan (ERDMP)
Negative implication 
would depend upon the 
extent of damage and /
or period for which gas 
supply is discontinued.

(Indicate positive or

3.
GHG 
emissions
Opportunity The combustion of 
natural gas emits 
fewer Green House 
Gases (‘GHGs’) 
compared to coal 
and liquid fuels 
and also releases 
significantly fewer 
pollutants per unit 
of energy delivered. 
The increasing 
emissions of 
CO2 and other 
air pollutants are 
primarily attributed 
to the rapidly 
expanding road 
transportation 
sector in India. The 
transition from liquid 
fuels to natural gas 
is proving beneficial 
for India, addressing 
both global 
warming concerns 
and health hazards 
associated with 
pollution.
Continuous expansion of operations gives 
the Company an opportunity to increase gas 
sales and thereby reduce GHG emissions 
which could be caused by other energy 
alternatives such as petroleum products.
The Company has undertaken systematic 
study for GHG inventory & Net Zero targets 
setting.
The Company is also replacing, re-sizing 
gas meters, conducting regular maintenance 
of risers in domestic customer category, 
Usage of multi-layered composite pipes as 
a replacement of copper pipes, carrying out 
leak surveys using FLIR (‘Forward Looking 
Infrared’) cameras at all CNG stations, CGSs 
and DRSs etc. are other actions carried out 
to minimize the methane leakage /emissions. 
MGL conducted Real Time driving emission 
study for in-service Diesel and CNG vehicle 
through Automotive Research Association 
of India.
Positive implication 
because of increased 
geographical coverage 
& incremental sale of 
natural gas helps to 
reduce GHG emissions 
otherwise caused by 
petroleum products.
4.
Human 
Rights
Risk
Non-adherence 
of human rights, 
a Company 
can be prone 
to operational 
delays, lawsuits, 
reduced employee 
satisfaction, lost 
opportunities in 
expansion or new 
investments, and 
reputational harm.
MGL has developed and implemented a 
formal Human Rights policy apart from a 
code of conduct, which   is applicable to 
different stakeholders including employees.
Periodically the Company has taken 
positive affirmation from employees about 
understanding & adherence to the Human 
Rights Policy.  
MGL supports the safeguarding and 
upholding of human rights. The Company 
conducts its activities in a way that respects 
human rights and is a business imperative. 
The Company prohibits any kind of 
employment of children or minors below the 
age of 18 at its workplace. 
Negative implications 
on case-to-case basis.
5.
Water 
Stewardship
Risk
Water is a scarce 
& precious natural 
resource. Wastage 
& sub-optimal 
usage of water 
can lead to acute 
shortage of potable 
water and an 
increase in costs for 
business processes.
MGL has developed and implemented a 
formal Water Stewardship Policy in addition 
to general guidelines for saving water issued 
to all employees. 
The Company commissioned Sewage 
Treatment Plant & Rainwater Harvesting 
projects at 4 of its city gate stations in FY 
2024 -25 & FY 23-24.
The Company has also installed sensor-
based taps to avoid wastage of water.  
Negative Implication. 
Overuse of fresh water 
can lead to increased 
business operation 
costs

6.
Local 
communities 
including 
Corporate 
Social 
Investment
Opportunity In developing 
nations like India, 
Companies have 
good role to 
play in ensuring 
inclusive growth. 
While CSR related 
Regulations make it 
mandatory, at MGL 
it is considered as 
one of the ways 
of uplifting needy, 
marginalized 
community through 
various projects.
MGL has a Corporate Social Responsibility 
policy in place. The Company considers 
the local community as an important 
stakeholder. It continuously engages with 
communities through awareness camps to 
understand their expectations and explain 
the benefits of nature gas distribution.
Under the banner of ‘MGL We Care,’ the 
Company covers seven thematic areas. 
These are “MGL Aarogya” for health 
care, “MGL Vikas” for rural development, 
“MGL Saksham” for empowerment, “MGL 
Vidya” for Education, “MGL Hariyali” for 
environment protection, “MGL Hunar” for 
skill development and “MGL Saathi” for 
other social development initiatives.
Positive reputation 
with community will 
translate into faster 
project executions.
7.
Customer 
relationships 
and 
experience 
and 
satisfaction
Risk & 
Opportunity
Risk:
In the future era of 
losing marketing 
exclusivity, 
unsatisfactory CRM 
can lead to loss of 
market share.
Opportunity:
On the other hand, 
due to a common 
product of natural 
gas without any 
differentiation, 
excellent CRM can 
help retain market 
share and aid in 
increase of sales 
volume.
MGL has a robust consumer grievance 
redressal mechanism in place. All the 
Company’s CRM processes & practices are 
ISO certified.
The Company has an omni channel 
customer interface consisting of 108 call 
agents - 24x7 customer helpline, 12 walk-in 
centers. To provide additional support to 
customers, there are back offices, mobile 
application, and social media channels.
A customer satisfaction survey is also 
conducted annually by an independent 
agency to gauge the satisfaction index of 
domestic PNG & CNG customers.
Negative implication. 
There are financial 
costs involved in 
running the CRM 
system, but customer 
satisfaction is a positive 
outcome of it.
8.
Waste 
Management 
Risk
Unless hazardous 
as well as other 
wastage is disposed 
of carefully 
or generation 
minimized, it 
will harm the 
environment and 
would entail costs 
due to storage 
space occupied.
The Company’s products PNG and CNG do 
not result in waste generation. But some 
items which are part of the pipe network and 
electronic items used in the company offices 
need due attention. The Company has a 
formal Waste Management Policy in place.
All types of waste generated are handed 
over to authorized agencies to dispose 
off. Also, the Company has established 4 
Sewage Treatment Plants which are already 
in operation. This is in alignment with the 
Company’s Waste Management Policy. 
Negative Implication 
due to non-effective 
waste management.

Occupational 
health 
and safety 
including 
Employment 
practices
Risk
The employees are 
the greatest assets, 
and their safety 
and wellbeing 
are of paramount 
importance. 
Improper handling 
of health and 
lack of training 
with respect to 
safety risks can 
lead to disastrous 
impacts on both 
property and the 
stakeholders.
MGL is an ISO 45001:2018 certified Company 
and has a Health, Safety and Environment 
Policy in place which is available on the 
Company’s website. This confirms the 
Company’s commitment towards health and 
safety practices. 
The following are some of the initiatives 
taken by the Company to ensure complete 
Health and Safety in the Company’s 
operations:
 
 
Every activity / process undertaken 
is initiated / conducted with proper 
Hazard Identification and Risk 
Assessment (HIRA) undertaken by 
concerned process owner.
 
 
Personal protective equipment is 
distributed to all eligible individuals and 
usage of the same is ensured. 
 
 
Every contract person working for MGL 
gets trained in the required safety 
and technical competency (‘STC’) and 
Employees are suitably trained.
 
 
Apart from the mandatory annual health 
surveillance for all employees, periodic 
executive health check-ups are also

Diversity
Risk & 
Opportunity
Not only gender 
diversity but other 
aspects of identity 
such as race, 
ethnicity, age, 
socio-economic 
status etc. need 
careful dealing in 
any organization 
to foster equal 
opportunity & 
inclusiveness to all 
concerned.
The Company is committed to providing 
equal opportunities in employment and 
thus creating an inclusive work environment 
which gets reflected through its talent 
acquisition policy. 
In its continued efforts to boost the 
performances of the employees, training 
programs are planned throughout the 
year to enhance the skills and knowledge 
of the employees.
The Company has also formulated and 
implemented an Equal Opportunity 
policy. This policy is available on the 
Company’s website.
Positive implication due 
to various policies & 
system in place.
12.
End-use 
Safety
Risk
MGL takes 
adequate safety 
measures including 
pressure reduction 
at appropriate 
levels as a CGD 
Company but 
lack of awareness 
about product 
usage, hazards 
etc. at the end of 
customers could 
pose significant risk 
of accidents.
MGL caters to a large number of domestic 
customers. While at CGS the Company 
may receive gas at pressure of around 
49 bar, MGL follows a pressure reduction 
methodology such that at cooking stoves, 
the gas pressure is just 21 millibar.  
The Company’s invoices, mailers, web 
site, newsprint advertisements, registration 
camps and other mediums of communication 
facilitate awareness creation. A strong after-
sales service mechanism is also in place for 
any eventuality.
Negative implication. 
This can be due to 
consequential costs 
and reputational 
damage for the 
Company.
13.
Data Security
Risk
A large amount 
of personal data 
is captured for 
operational 
reasons, 
particularly in 
household customer 
category which 
puts customers’ 
data privacy 
at significant 
risk. Ensuring 
data privacy 
of customers is 
necessary for the 
Company and is 
also covered under 
the data protection 
laws.
Data privacy is covered as a separate 
chapter under MGL’s Code of 
Conduct policy.
Privacy Framework consisting of Policies 
and Procedures based on DPDP Act 2023 is 
being finalized.
 Also, the Company has a web-enabled 
registration process for its potential 
customers. In case, customer prefers to 
provide data in hard form, post scanning, 
the collected data is stored in the ERP 
system where the Company follows a strict 
access control guideline with due care on 
segregation of duty.
Privacy Enhancement Tools like Privilege 
Access Management (‘PAM’) have been 
implemented to strengthen the access 
control mechanism. Also, tools like Data 
Loss Prevention (‘DLP’), Mobile Device 
Management (‘MDM’) are in the process of 
evaluation and implementation to protect 
customer’s personal data. Vendor Risk 
Assessments and Data Protection Impact 
Assessments are also being carried out to 
identify and mitigate the risk of leakage of a 
customer’s personal data.
Negative Implication. 
Leakage of personal 
data can lead to 
negative implications 
including penalties, 
fines, and reputational 
damages.

Risk 
Management
Risk
Risk Management 
is important in any 
business for various 
stakeholders but 
assumes much 
higher significance 
in CGD industry due 
to risk of accidents, 
volatility in gas 
prices and need for 
uninterrupted gas 
supply.
MGL has an enterprise risk management 
policy in place which details the Risk 
Management principles and framework 
along with the associated procedures 
for MGL’s business environment and act 
as guidance for critical decision-making 
processes such as strategic, operational, 
financial, legal etc. The Policy framework 
includes objective of identification 
of elements of risks which includes 
operational risks as well as business risks 
and assessment of management’s actions 
to mitigate the exposures periodically. 
Further, Risk Management tool is in place to 
aggregate risk data for identification of the 
elements of risks.
Negative implication. 
This can be due to 
consequential costs 
and reputational

Governance, leadership, and oversight
7.	 Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG-related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
	
At MGL, we continue our steadfast commitment to addressing two of the most pressing challenges facing India — meeting 
India’s growing energy demands for accelerating growth and reducing carbon emissions. As a leading player in the City Gas 
Distribution (CGD) sector, MGL is dedicated to delivering innovative, low-carbon, and sustainable energy solutions across its 
Geographical Areas (GAs) of Greater Mumbai, Urban Thane & Raigad District as well as the three GA’s of our 100% subsidiary  
M/s Unison Enviro Pvt Ltd viz Ratnagiri, Latur/Osmanabad in Maharashtra & Chitradurga /Davangere in Karnataka.
	
Natural gas remains at the core of our sustainability efforts, as we continue to promote eco-friendly energy sources. At the same 
time, we place great emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, ensuring that these pillars are deeply 
embedded across our value chain & businesses.  MGL has established an ESG policy to ensure good governance and promote 
sustainability. This policy outlines our commitment to environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and transparent governance 
practices, guiding our operations and decision-making to create long-term value for stakeholders and support a sustainable future
	
Our efforts are directed toward tackling key issues such as carbon emissions, environmental conservation, climate resilience, 
and the protection of human rights. MGL’s governance structure is anchored by a robust framework, comprising empowered 
statutory and non-statutory committees with clearly defined responsibilities. These committees, many of which report directly to 
the Board, uphold our commitment to transparency, ethical conduct, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
	
As one of the fastest-growing large economies, India has committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070. Currently, Natural 
Gas comprises approximately ~7.15% of the country’s energy mix (as per Niti Aayog), with a target to increase this share to 15% 
by 2030. In alignment with this national goal, MGL is scaling up its operations to further promote the adoption of natural gas — a 
cleaner, greener, and more efficient fuel alternative. Its usage significantly reduces the carbon footprint, making it a

much cleaner and efficient fuel option. MGL has been supplying PNG & CNG at rates comparable /lesser than competing fuels 
like LPG, Petrol & Diesel thereby reducing the barriers and creating better access to the customers (Households, Industries, 
Commercial establishment & Vehicle owners) and promoting affordability. 
	
LNG as automotive fuel 
	
To address the decarbonization of the long-haul trucking (which is one of the biggest source of vehicular emissions), MGL, through 
its JV, Mahanagar LNG Private Limited (“MLPL” incorporated in December 2023) commissioned its 1st LNG Station in Aurangabad 
in October 2024 & technically commissioned its 2nd LNG station at Seoni (MP). MLPL has plans to commission  additional 3 LNG 
stations(at Amravati, Bhiwandi & JNPT) in FY 25-26. These LNG stations along with MGL’s existing LNG station at Savroli,our JV 
Partner, M/s Baidyanath LNG Pvt Ltd.’s 3 stations & other CGD’s stations across Maharashtra will spearhead the shift of the  long 
haul trucking to LNG as a fuel in Maharashtra. Additionally, MLPL is also working with various OEM’s & Fleet owners to expand the 
LNG ecosystem thereby “Greening” the Long haul trucking market.
	
Li-ion battery venture 
	
India’s Li-ion battery market is poised for rapid growth, with demand projected to reach 250 GWh by 2030. Currently, the country 
remains heavily dependent on China for Li-ion battery cells used in battery pack manufacturing. To address this critical supply 
gap and to support decarbonization of the mobility segment, MGL has partnered with International Battery Company, Inc. (USA) 
through a JV- International Battery Company India Pvt. Ltd. to establish a Giga factory in Bangalore. The facility will be technology 
agnostic and will initially manufacture prismatic NMC Li-ion cells, targeting applications in 2  & 3 wheeler electric vehicles (EVs) as 
well as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in India. 
	
MGL as part of its committed investment of H 350 crore in the giga plant, has already disbursed H 35 crore in January 2025. 
Land for the project has been secured from Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). The initial 500 MW facility is 
expected to get commissioned in Q1 of FY 27. The capacity would later be scaled up to 5 GWh based on market requirement. It is 
worthwhile to mention that International Battery Company, USA has already established a pilot Li-ion cell manufacturing facility 
at South Korea for manufacture of prismatic NMC cells & these cells are being supplied to Indian EV manufacturers for extensive 
field trials.
	
3EV 
	
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining momentum, particularly in the three-wheeler segment. This growth is primarily driven by 
increasing demand for last-mile logistics from companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Porter, Big Basket etc. To support this transition, 
MGL had invested in 3EV Industries Pvt., a Bangalore-based manufacturer of L5-category electric three-wheelers. MGL had 
committed  investment of H 96 Cr. in four tranches and, till date, had invested H 73 Cr. of which H 23 Cr. as third tranche was 
disbursed in March 2025,  taking the total holding of MGL to approximately 24.5% in the company. Post receipt of investment from 
MGL, 3EV  has demonstrated significantly better  performance, with revenue increasing by ~200% & vehicle sales by ~90% in FY 
25.
	
Other Significant Measures
	
During the year, MGL installed Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at City Gate Stations (CGS) at Mahape and Ambernath. These STP’s 
collect, treat, and discharge wastewater, providing a service essential to environmental and public health thereby eliminating the 
possibility of sewage leaching into subsoil and contaminating ecosystems. Also, during the year, MGL implemented Rainwater 
Harvesting system at CGS Mahape and Taloja for collecting and storage of rainwater, rather than allowing it to run off and utilizing 
it for gardening purposes as well as for replenishing ground water.
	
MGL drives the business with the utmost safety measures and in adherence with its Health Safety and Environment policy. 
Customers are kept at the center of business operations. Every necessary step is taken to ensure that customers get the best 
services without any disruptions. MGL also has in place Enterprise Risk Management policy, which is the guidance for critical 
decision making to mitigate the business Risk.
	
MGL has been able to reverse the increasing trend of LUAG (Lost & Unaccounted Gas). LUAG had been increasing by an 
average of 0.34.% every year while this year we are successful in reducing LUAG by 0.4%; thereby reducing it from 2.7% in 
FY:2023-24 to 2.3% in FY:2024-25.  
	
MGL had signed MOU with BMC to setup 1000 tons per day CBG plant in June 2023.The proposal for allocation of land at Deonar 
to MGL on concessional rate has been recently approved by the State Cabinet. MGL has also signed a MoU with City corporation 
of Davangere (CCD) for setting up a  CBG plant to process 150TPD organic MSW.

CSR
	
MGL continues to uphold its commitment to social responsibility through impactful CSR initiatives under the umbrella of ‘MGL 
We Care’. We focus on seven thematic areas: MGL Aarogya for healthcare, MGL Vikas for rural development, MGL Saksham for 
empowerment, MGL Vidya for education, MGL Haribala for environmental sustainability, MGL Hunar for skill development and 
MGL Saathi for other social initiatives. Our CSR initiatives cover 15 out of 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
	
Under MGL Vikas, the company undertook holistic rural development programs across 21 villages in Raigad district, focusing on 
improving access to education, healthcare and sustainable livelihoods. These interventions aimed to uplift communities and foster 
long-term socio-economic growth.
	
MGL Hariyali led the Rapid Forest Project, based on the Miyawaki method, to promote afforestation using native species. Over 
56,000 saplings were planted across four locations, contributing to increased green cover, biodiversity restoration and climate 
resilience.
	
Through MGL Aarogya, MGL donated TruNAAT machines and ultra-portable handheld X-ray machines for tuberculosis (TB) 
detection. These machines enhanced diagnostic accuracy and speed, especially in high-burden areas & remote areas of Raigad 
district covering ~12,000 citizens. Out of 11,941 tests conducted, 843 TB-positive cases were identified and treated. Resulting in 
early diagnosis of ~800 patients who received timely treatment. Through many such CSR initiatives, MGL continues to create a 
lasting, positive impact in the communities it serves, reflecting its dedication to inclusive growth and sustainability.
	
Internal Orientation
	
MGL organized a Nature Trail for employees at BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society) Reserve in Goregaon to emphasis 
importance of biodiversity reflecting MGL’s commitment to biodiversity conservation, ecological awareness, and sustainable 
development. By engaging employees and stakeholders in such activities, MGL fosters a deeper understanding of environmental 
preservation while reinforcing its ESG efforts. MGL also promoted responsible e-waste disposal by installing collection bins 
at select offices for 15 days. The initiative successfully collected 50 Kilograms of e-waste, demonstrating our commitment to 
environmental sustainability.
	
As part of MGL’s continued commitment to integrating ESG principles across its operations, a focused training program on ESG was 
conducted for around 200 employees. This initiative aimed to enhance awareness, build internal capabilities, and foster a culture 
of sustainability and responsible governance within the organization. The training covered ESG principles, including climate action, 
resource efficiency, ethical business practices, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance. By empowering employees 
with the knowledge and tools to incorporate ESG considerations into their daily roles, MGL is strengthening its foundation for long-
term sustainable growth and aligning its workforce with global best practices.
	
MGL had initiated Green Building Certification for its CGS at Savroli, Mahape, Ambernath, Taloja and two Administrative 
offices in Mumbai. MGL is delighted to inform that we have received Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), GOLD rating for our 
ZION office, Kharghar in May 2025

Environmental Management System and ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management System in the 
overall business operations.
 
 
MGL has implemented Safety, Health, Environment and Quality (SHEQ) Management System which is applicable to the 
Company’s employees and contractors to ensure safe and healthy workplace. Employees and workers are provided with 
safe workplaces at all MGL work locations. MGL Life Saving Rules have been defined and employees and workers are made

Mahanagar Gas Limited
from MGL and other entities, and areas for improvement. Contractor Safety Forums with the front-line workers are being 
conducted for sensitizing them with respect to HSE issues related to their work.
 
 
It is mandatory to carry out site specific Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment for all the activities in MGL. The control 
measures are implemented based on this exercise and the same are explained to the personnel involved in the activity during 
Toolbox Talk prior to commencing the site activity. Other hazards and control measures identified by the site personnel are 
also discussed during Toolbox Talk. For high hazard activities like Work at Heights etc. Permit to Work system is applicable 
and these activities are started only upon verification of fulfilment of site safety requirements. MGL has identified 13 such 
activities where Permit to Work system is applicable.
 
 
HSE Reward scheme has been in place at MGL which recognizes significant contribution of ground level personnel in 
improving Safety, environment. Workmen irrespective of their designation can be recognized through this scheme. This 
scheme rewards personnel on a monthly and quarterly basis.
 
 
Additionally, a new award “Agni Suraksha Padak” has been introduced. This award is dedicated to all brave employees/
Business Partners involved in Fire –Fighting in critical situations and who have displayed exceptional dedication and 
commitment to their duties.
 
 
Apart from this, all workmen are encouraged to report Hazards, Near Miss and give safety suggestion through online portals. 
These portals are accessible through smartphones through internet explorer. MGL also recognizes Business Partners for 
their performance annually. The performance of Business Partners are measured and monitored through well-established 
system of Contractors Performance Evaluation based on leading and lagging indicators. During routine payment processing 
of Invoices submitted by Business Partners, their Safety Performance during applicable billing cycle is considered and 
penalties are imposed in case persuasion by means of counselling and communication does not work effectively.
 
 
HSE training, including hands-on firefighting have been imparted to employees and contractors. MGL has taken initiative to 
impart Fire Prevention training at TS Chanakya. In this training employees are given hands on experience on firefighting for 
two days at TS Chanakya (Indian Marine time Institute). In this training the theoretical along with practical knowledge was 
imparted to the participants. The participants were asked to wear coveralls and perform the firefighting.

application has been developed to ensure site compliance through real time site photos. MGL Lifesaving Rules is a set of rules 
which are mandatory for work execution and checklists are developed based on MGL Lifesaving Rules. These checklists are 
converted into android based application and this app records site audits and generates report in the form of percentage safety 
compliance at the site. This app which is used by HSE team for site safety monitoring also has facility to take photographs of 
non-compliances for record. Additionally, virtual audits are conducted by HSE team using facility of video calls.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
MGL implements its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives through multi multi-pronged approach. This results in 
giving direct benefits to the marginalized community as well as a snowball effect to more beneficiaries. The entire approach 
is process-driven, focusing on need assessment at the inception. MGL focuses on investing in need-based projects. MGL has 
instituted a robust framework for the selection of projects. A mandatory part of the framework is a visit by MGL’s official to the 
proposed community/ site to gauge the community's needs, enthusiasm, and acceptance of the proposed intervention. MGL has 
implemented various new interventions on a pilot basis and then scaled them up, based on a review of the project. Further, MGL 
has also adopted a robust in-house monitoring strategy. Additionally, an app-based monitoring system is implemented to get 
live data as and when required. Regular monitoring visits are carried out to ensure that the project is implemented in line with the 
stakeholders' expectations. The sustainability of CSR intervention is an important consideration and the community’s involvement 
is elicited right from the inception. People’s institutions are formed and strengthened to ensure that the impact created is sustained 
post-exit of the Company from the intervention. MGL CSR also believes in and undertakes coordinated efforts and works closely
