Clinical trial
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk:
•	
Clinical trials demand significant 
financial investment, presenting 
a substantial risk to the 
Company.
•	
The inherent uncertainties 
in R&D, along with the long 
duration of trials, increase 
exposure to potential setbacks.
•	
Risks include trial failures, 
unforeseen disruptions, or non-
compliance, which may:
	–
Lead to financial losses
	–
Cause delays in product 
launch
	–
Impact brand reputation
	–
Result in legal liabilities
	–
Lead to missed revenue 
opportunities
Opportunity:
•	
Successful clinical trials 
are a cornerstone of the 
pharmaceutical industry.
•	
They confirm a drug’s efficacy 
and safety, thereby enhancing 
credibility with regulators, 
healthcare professionals, and 
patients.
•	
Positive trial outcomes support:
–	
Smoother regulatory 
approvals
–	
product commercialization
–	
Successful product launch 
and marketing potential
Proactive risk assessment
Comprehensive risk identification 
is conducted at the beginning 
of each clinical trial to detect 
potential hazards and operational 
challenges.
Qualified Investigative Team
A dedicated and experienced 
team is formed to oversee the 
clinical trial process and ensure 
adherence to protocols.

assess performance, and identify 
improvement areas.
Process Refinement

Statement by director 
responsible for the 
business responsibility 
report, highlighting ESG
related challenges, targets 
and achievements 
At our company, we truly care about building a sustainable future that benefits everyone involved 
in our employees, partners, customers, and communities. This year, we’ve continued to grow and 
adapt, especially focusing on meeting the important, often overlooked medical needs in the 
Central Nervous System (CNS) area.
We feel a deep responsibility to do the right thing, which is why we’ve been working hard to 
bring Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) values into everything we do in research and 
development. Over the past year, we took a close look at how we operate, searching for ways to 
lessen our environmental impact, support our people better, and make sure we’re always acting 
ethically. The challenges to mitigate the environmental impact by controlling use of chemicals 
that are pollutant still exists.
We’re setting clear goals to shrink our environmental footprint, improve how we monitor the 
safety of our medicines, and raise the bar for clinical trial safety. We know it’s not always easy to 
blend these ESG goals with scientific innovation, but we believe it’s the right path one that will 
help us grow responsibly and lead the way in our industry.
 We’re committed to learning, being transparent, and innovating responsibly as we move forward.
