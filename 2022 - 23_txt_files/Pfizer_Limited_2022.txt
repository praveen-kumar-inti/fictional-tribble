BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Pfizer Limited, being a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., USA, one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical companies, understands 
the significance of our role in helping address healthcare challenges in India while upholding ethical standards and 
environmental stewardship. 
We stand by our commitment towards contributing to long term value creation and a sustainable, responsible and patient 
centric business model. Our focus is rooted in our purpose to deliver Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives through 
ethical decision-making and our core values —Courage, Excellence, Equity, and Joy.
This Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (“BRSR”) for the financial year 2022-23 seeks to disclose our performance 
against the nine principles of the “National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct”. These nine principles are further 
divided in the BRSR into Essential Indicators and Leadership Indicators. While Essential Indicators are to be reported on a

disclose only Essential Indicators.
Further, for reporting purpose, we have developed certain methodologies and used certain assumptions, in line with 
Guidance Note prescribed by the Securities & Exchange Board of India. These methodologies and assumptions will continue 
to be reviewed and refined as the regulatory framework governing BRSR evolves in India.

(Indicate positive or

1.
Occupational 
Health and Safety 
Risk and 
Opportunity
Protecting the health, safety, 
and well-being of employees 
and workers, all of whom 
are essential to driving our 
business forward, is an integral 
part of how the Company 
operates.
Risk: Even with a solid health 
record 
and 
good 
safety 
performance, there is scope 
for continous improvement 
when it comes to the safety of 
our workers and employees.
Opportunity: Effective health 
and safety management helps 
promote the well-being of 
the workforce, enhance the 
employees’ satisfaction, and 
increase employee productivity 
and efficiency.
1.	 Maintain 
effective 
management of inherently 
high-risk operations.
2.	 Support the health and 
wellness 
of 
colleagues 
by 
carefully 
managing 
workplace hazards.
3.	 Have rigorous procedures 
and controls to protect 
employees from hazards.
4.	 The India Driver Safety 
program 
focuses 
on 
reducing the risk associated 
with driving.
Negative: Any increase in 
number of health & safety 
incidents may adversely affect 
the health and safety of the 
employees, 
their 
morale 
and productivity, Company’s 
reputation as well as may 
lead to increased costs to the 
Company.
Positive: Implementing our 
robust 
health 
and 
safety 
management 
standards 
and expectations allows the 
Company to better mitigate 
the risk of incidents involving 
occupational health and safety 
leading to the betterment 
of employee well being and 
increased 
productivity 
that 
can help to effectively create 
financial growth.
2.
Skill Upgradation
Opportunity
Periodic 
training, 
skill 
programs and skill upgradation 
through the Company’s talent 
management 
framework 
helps address upskilling and 
the evolving needs of the 
employees and the Company.
 -
Positive: 
Through 
this 
framework, 
non-traditional 
growth 
opportunities 
and 
career 
paths 
have 
been 
opened to employees who 
can be engaged from varying 
sectors 
of 
the 
Company, 
thereby providing flexibility to 
employees and the Company 
in employee management. 
Overall, the framework helps 
enable the Company to attract, 
develop and retain talent, 
and create a positive work 
environment.

 3.
Climate Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: The Company recognizes 
the significant risks posed 
by climate change, including 
increased adverse impacts on 
human health and potential 
for 
decreased 
access 
to 
critical medicines and vaccines 
due to disruptions in value 
chains caused by the greater 
frequency of severe weather.
Opportunity: 
Management 
and reduction in emissions 
is important to mitigating 
climate change.
Further, through the use of 
alternative fuel sources, the 
Company 
could 
increase 
resilience to fossil fuel and 
energy prices resulting from 
the low-carbon transition and 
increase returns on investment 
in low-emissions technology.
1.	 The Company, through its 
parent company, Pfizer Inc., 
aims to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, and 
achieve the voluntary Net-
Zero standard by 2040, 
through 
accelerating 
the transition away from 
fossil fuels and engaging 
suppliers 
to 
catalyze 
equivalent action.
2.	 The Company is investing 
in onsite solar projects at 
its manufacturing facility at 
Goa.
Positive:
1.	 The Company’s focus on 
its climate change-related 
goals helps enable it to 
reduce environmental risks 
and create a more resilient 
business.
2.	 An 
increasing 
number 
of 
national 
healthcare 
systems 
and 
countries 
have announced targets 
to become Net-Zero by 
future 
dates 
including 
in 
their 
supply 
chain, 
i.e., 
the 
suppliers 
and 
pharmaceutical 
products 
used 
by 
healthcare 
providers.
3.	 Healthcare systems may 
therefore prefer or require 
suppliers 
to 
provide 
low-carbon 
products. 
If 
Company 
products 
are 
demonstrably 
lower 
in 
carbon than competitors, 
this may potentially lead 
to increased demand for 
such products and increase 
revenue.
Negative:
1.	 Failure to address climate 
change-related 
risks 
may 
adversely 
impact 
the Company’s business 
operations.
2. 	 Transition to alternative 
fuel 
sources 
potentially 
entails increased capital 
investment.

 4.
Waste 
Management
Risk
Waste 
and 
Waste-water 
management 
is 
crucial 
to 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
and improper management 
poses 
the 
potential 
for 
significant ecological risks. 
1.	 The Company is committed 
to limiting discharge of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients 
to waste-water from its 
manufacturing 
processes, 
using environmental risk 
assessment methodologies 
and 
emission 
control 
practices and technologies.
2.	 The Company tracks its 
performance to evaluate 
its 
waste 
management 
practices. 
3.	 The 
Company 
evaluates 
waste 
management 
practices as they relate to 
the hierarchy of control 
of handling waste: avoid, 
reduce, 
reuse, 
recycle, 
dispose.
4.	 Waste reduction at source 
by 
adoption 
of 
lean 
operations. 
Negative: 
1.	 Adoption of proper waste-
water management sources 
potentially entails increased 
capital investment.
2. 	 Failure to manage waste 
and 
waste-water 
may 
lead to financial impact 
on account of any needed 
remediation.
 5.
Product Quality 
and Safety
Risk
Failure to maintain product 
quality and product safety 
may have adverse impact on 
the well-being of the patients, 
reputation of the Company, 
and may expose the Company 
to litigation.
Product quality and safety are 
paramount to the Company 
and the Company’s approach 
to mitigating risks include the 
following:
1.	 The Quality Management 
System (“QMS”) of the 
Company 
is 
based 
on 
industry-recognized quality 
management 
principles 
and is designed and built 
to adhere to applicable 
standards and requirements 
of health authorities and 
best practices.
2.	 The 
Company 
provides 
training to employees for 
product safety and quality.
3.	 The 
grievance 
redressal 
mechanism of the Company 
enables complaints to be 
raised relating to product 
quality.
Negative: Failure to maintain 
high 
standards 
of 
quality 
in products could have an 
adverse impact on patient 
health, reputational damage, 
financial 
liability, 
product 
recalls and shortages.

6.
Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
Opportunity
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
(“DEI”) is a key focus area for 
the Company. Towards this, 
the Company has prioritized 
gender diversity as a core 
area of focus. The Diversity 
and Inclusion Council of the 
Company acts as a think 
tank that gives shape to 
the DEI initiatives to bring 
positive effects in the work 
environment.
Focus on DEI has already 
led to giant strides being 
taken by the Company in 
increasing gender diversity, 
and the Company continues 
to progress towards increasing 
women representation in the 
workforce.
The Company also strives to 
ensure that our workplaces 
are designed and equipped 
to 
support 
any 
person 
with disability (PWD) so as 
to 
ensure 
all 
colleagues 
are suitably supported. In 
addition, we are committed 
to 
equal 
opportunities 
in 
the terms and conditions of 
employment for all employees 
and job applicants with no 
discrimination 
and 
without 
regard to race, color, religion, 
sex, sexual orientation, age, 
gender identity or gender 
expression, national origin or 
disability.
-
Positive: DEI has a positive 
impact on the Company’s 
workforce, 
operations 
and 
business.
7.
Access to 
Medicines
Opportunity
The Company is committed 
to enhancing the access of 
its 
portfolio 
of 
medicines 
to patients who may need 
them. Towards this end, the 
Company 
engages 
actively 
with all stakeholders, including 
policy makers to expand access 
opportunities. 
-
Positive: 
Expanded access will create an 
opportunity for the Company 
to reach more patients, thereby 
benefitting the community as 
well as having a positive impact 
on the Company’ s business.

including commercial entities and individuals, in exercising their responsibilities.
	
The Company is guided, to the extent applicable, by the “Blue Book - Summary of Pfizer Policies on Business Conduct” 
— of its parent company, Pfizer Inc., USA. Pfizer’s Blue Book —our Code of Conduct— is designed to support our 
core Values, particularly Excellence, as we perform at our best together, and Equity, as we should always act with 
integrity. The Blue Book describes how we operate and guides the decisions we make in support of our purpose, 
including how we speak up when we see something that concerns us—a behavior essential to our Value of Courage. 
Seeking advice, raising concerns, and reporting misconduct are critical to our ability to serve patients. Every Pfizer 
colleague is responsible for understanding the Blue Book and adhering to our Code of Conduct every day. In doing so, 
we demonstrate our continued commitment to living our Values and earning the trust of the patients we serve.
	
In addition, Pfizer’s My Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedures (“MAPP”) sets out Pfizer’s global enterprise-wide 
approach to preventing bribery and corruption . MAPP provides the tools needed to help address bribery and corruption 
risks in our interactions with healthcare professionals, government, regulators, and business partners. By following 
MAPP and acting in accordance with applicable laws and Pfizer’s values, each Pfizer colleague contributes to our culture 
of ethics and integrity.
	
Further to our prohibition on all forms of bribery, we are committed to fostering a culture of ethics and integrity. Pfizer 
is committed to competing lawfully and ethically in the marketplace and expects every Pfizer Colleague and business 
partner to conduct all aspects of Pfizer business with integrity. Resources, training, and messaging emphasize the 
accountability of leaders to own compliance and engage in proactive risk management and ethical decision-making and 
to make clear that non-compliant conduct is not tolerated. Pfizer also strives to be an ethical leader within our industry 
by taking leading roles within industry associations and diverse business forums to advance anti-corruption efforts.

 Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and

 Yes / No
(If yes, then give details of mechanism in brief)
Permanent Workers
Yes. 
Courage is a core value, and we promote a speak up environment. Our whistleblowing 
policies (e.g., Open Door policy) and strict anti-retaliation policies require reporting 
misconduct and encourage raising concerns about any issues. Retaliation against 
anyone who seeks advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information 
in an investigation is prohibited. The Company takes all policy concerns seriously and, 
to the extent violations of policy are identified, takes appropriate disciplinary action and 
corrective actions, including potential termination. We measure our culture of integrity 
with surveys, and the results are used to focus leadership communications, training, and 
other proactive improvement efforts.
We provide multiple channels for asking questions and raising potential compliance 
concerns, including anonymous reporting options where permitted by law, and keep 
matters as confidential as possible.
The avenues for raising concerns are listed in the Blue Book and on our website 
www.pfizerltd.co.in, both of which are publicly available. Every employee, irrespective 
of hierarchy, has access to the Employee Relations Investigations Group, Compliance or 
Legal Division, Office of the Ombudsman, People Experience Division of the Company and 
in appropriate and exceptional cases, concerns may be raised directly to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee of the Company.

who use such mechanism.

good faith reported a potential violation, the Company will take appropriate action—even if it later turns out that the 
employee was mistaken in reporting the matter originally.
