10.	  Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
The Company has adopted a strong waste management system to meet the compliance with respect to local regulations. 
The well-established system is supporting our operations to properly segregate the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept 
to reduce, reuse & recycle. The waste generated within our premises is recycled through authorized recyclers and on-site 
composting machines (in facilities and residential establishments) and remaining waste is disposed through State Pollution 
Control Board approved landfill/incineration facilities.
	
HAL is governed by various Acts and Rules like the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) 
Rules, 2016, Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, Air Prevention and Control of Pollution Act (1981), Environment 
(Protection) Act, 1986, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act, 1974 etc.
	
All the Divisions are ISO 14001 certified and comply with the rules prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards. All 
emissions and waste generation is monitored as prescribed by the Pollution Control Boards.
	
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated from Townships and Factories is segregated at source in Townships and Factories 
(Wet, Dry, Garden, Sanitary and Rejects). Through the process of Vermi-Composting, the Bio-degradable waste comprising of 
domestic waste and horticulture waste is being converted to manure. For better utilization of biodegradable waste generated 
from HAL Estates, the Company has installed Solid Waste Management Units like Organic Waste Converters and Bio Gas 
Plants at select places. At Bangalore, 1.5 Tons per day capacity bio-gas plants are installed.
	
The Divisions which use and generate hazardous effluents such as chrome, acid/alkali, cyanide etc. have independent Effluent 
Treatment Plants (ETPs) for treatment.

Independent Assurance Statement
To,
The Board, 
Hindustan Aeronautics Limited
15/1, Cubbon Road, 
Bengaluru – 560 001, Karnataka.
Scope and Approach
Sustainability Actions Private Limited (“SAPL”) has been 
engaged by management of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
(“HAL” or “the Company”), to perform an independent 
reasonable assurance engagement of the Company’s Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core Matrices 
(refer to Annexure 1) for the FY 23-24.
Reporting Criteria
The Report is prepared based on BRSR Core Framework 
(Annexure I of the SEBI circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/
CIR2023/122 dated July12, 2023 and “Guidance Note for 
Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting Format” 
by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
Management Responsibilities
The Company’s Management is responsible for identification 
of key aspects, content and presentation of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with 
the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility includes the 
design, implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core Matrices 
which are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the 
requirements of independence and quality assurance set out 
in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements and have 
fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance 
with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption 
that the data and information provided by the Company to 
us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and 
free from material misstatements. We were not involved in the 
preparation of any statements or data included in the report 
except for Assurance Statement.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality 
control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance conclusion 
on the BRSR Core Matrices, based on the procedures we have 
performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted 
our engagement in accordance with the International Standard 
for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms 
of reference for this engagement as agreed with HAL. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform our engagement 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material 
respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with 
the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and 
extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, 
including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance 
conclusions.
Basis of our Opinion
We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence 
we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance 
opinion and the process did not involve engagement with 
external stakeholders. We carried out one-to-one discussions, 
onsite and remote assessments.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of 
sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the disclosures 
presented within the Report and referenced information, and 
sampled the disclosures and were reviewed through the HAL’s 
customised sustainability information management system.
We undertook the following activities:
• 
Obtained an understanding of the BRSR core matrices ;
• 
Interviewed selected senior managers responsible for 
management of sustainability topics and reviewed selected 
evidences to support issues disclosed in the Report. We 
were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those 
with overall responsibility to deliver HAL’s sustainability 
objectives;
• 
Reviewed processes and systems for aggregating site level 
sustainability information, that is, reviewed sustainability 
disclosures for selected sites as well as the overall data 
aggregated and consolidated at the Corporate level from 
the Company’s sustainability management system;
• 
Review of the processes for gathering and consolidating 
the selected performance data related to identified material 
topics and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation 
in context under the Principle of Completeness.
Annual Report 2023-24
137
Based on the above understanding and the risks that the 
matrices may be materially misstated, determined the nature, 
timing and the extent of further procedures, reviewed records 
and performed testing including recalculation of sample data 
to establish an audit trail.
Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence 
we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the company’s identified sustainability 
criteria as per BRSR core framework (refer to Annexure 1) 
for the year ended 31st March 2024 are not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations
We have relied on the information, documents, records, data, 
and explanations provided to us by the Company for the 
purpose of our review. The assurance scope excludes:
• 
Any disclosure other than those mentioned in the scope 
section above
• 
Data and information outside the defined reporting period
• 
Data related to Company’s financial performance, strategy 
and other related linkages expressed in the Report.
• 
The reported financial data are based on audited financial 
statements issued by the Company’s statutory auditors 
which is subject to a separate audit process. We were not 
involved in the review of financial data from the Annual 
Report.
• 
The Company’s statements that describe expression of 
opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, forward looking 
statements provided by the Company and assertions 
related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive 
issues.
• 
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks other 
than those mentioned in Reporting Criteria above.
• 
While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and extent 
of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not 
designed to provide assurance on internal controls.
• 
The procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation 
or calculation of data within IT systems.
