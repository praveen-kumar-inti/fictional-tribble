uphold similar ethical standards and do not expose the organization to reputational or legal risks. Training 
and awareness initiatives are periodically undertaken to reinforce the anti-corruption stance across all levels 
of the organization.

2. 
 a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) 
 
Yes. The Company has put in place internal procedures to support sustainable sourcing as part of its 
responsible procurement practices. These procedures emphasize compliance with applicable 
environmental, safety, and ethical standards while selecting and engaging with suppliers. 
 
A significant portion of the Company’s key raw materials is procured from leading Indian manufacturers 
that are known for their structured operational systems and adherence to legal and regulatory 
requirements. The Company conducts evaluations of its suppliers based on quality, cost-efficiency, 
delivery reliability, and environmental and safety considerations. 
 
Additionally, where operationally feasible, the Company encourages local sourcing to reduce 
transportation-related emissions and support regional economic activity. These practices contribute to a 
more resilient, cost-effective, and sustainability-aligned supply chain. 
 
 b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?  
 
Approximately 75% of the Company’s key raw materials, by value, were procured from leading Indian 
and multinational suppliers that are known to follow their own sustainability goals, governance standards, 
and responsible sourcing practices. While formal supplier-level ESG assessments were not conducted 
during the year, the Company relies on the reputation, certifications, and declared commitments of these 
suppliers to environmental and social responsibility. The Company continues to strengthen its supply 
chain engagement to improve visibility and alignment with its sustainability priorities over time. 
 
3. 
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the  end of life, for  
 
a. Plastics (including packaging) 
 
The Company follows a structured approach to plastic waste management in line with applicable 
environmental regulations. Plastic waste, including packaging materials, is segregated at source and 
collected separately to facilitate recycling. Efforts are made to minimize plastic usage and encourage reuse 
wherever possible. The Company also ensures that plastic waste is handed over only to authorized 
recyclers for environmentally sound processing. 
 
b. E-waste

Although the generation of e-waste at the Company’s facilities is minimal, the disposal process adheres to 
regulatory norms. All end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment are segregated and stored securely 
until they are sent to government-authorized e-waste handlers or recyclers. This ensures responsible 
disposal and prevents environmental contamination. 
 
c. Hazardous waste 
 
A structured product segregation process has been implemented across the Company’s units to ensure 
effective hazardous waste management. Waste is categorized based on product types and managed under 
the supervision of designated personnel with relevant expertise. The Company operates under permissions 
granted through the Consolidated Consent and Authorization (CCA) framework. For example, at the Vapi 
plant, the permissible limit for hazardous waste generation has been increased from 135 MT to 280 MT. 
Initiatives such as reusing spent hydrochloric acid (HCl) in effluent treatment operations have also been 
introduced to minimize solid waste generation. 
 
d. Other waste 
 
The Company is working towards achieving zero solid waste at certain locations by converting solid waste 
and wastewater into a prime solution that can be reused or sold to other companies. This initiative, 
currently underway at Jhagadia Unit 2, is expected to be implemented in the next financial year. Across all 
manufacturing locations, a comprehensive waste management system ensures proper collection, 
segregation, and disposal of non-hazardous and process-related waste through authorized vendors in 
compliance with applicable environmental norms. 
 
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.  
 
Yes, the Company’s activities are subject to Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) under the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2016 (as amended). During the year, the Company received registration as a Brand 
Owner from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on 11th November 2024 under registration number 
BO-11-000-11-AACCV0024A-24. The Company’s waste collection and disposal processes are aligned with 
the approved EPR Action Plan submitted to the CPCB. It is committed to fulfilling its annual EPR targets

As disclosed in the table above, the Company did not reclaim any products or packaging materials during the 
reporting period. This is attributable to the nature of its business, which involves the production of industrial 
and specialty chemicals that are supplied as intermediates to other manufacturing sectors. These products are 
not sold in consumer-facing formats and are typically consumed as part of downstream production processes, 
leaving no end-of-life stage suitable for direct reclamation by the Company.

No products or packaging materials were reclaimed during the reporting year, as reflected in the table. Given 
the Company’s role as a business-to-business (B2B) supplier of bulk chemicals and intermediates, the 
products are fully consumed by customers during further processing and do not result in end-use packaging or 
recoverable components that can be reclaimed. Consequently, the concept of product or packaging take-back 
does not apply in the conventional sense to the Company’s product categories.

Accessibility of workplaces  
Are the premises / offices of the entity accessible to differently abled employees and workers, as per the 
requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are being 
taken by the entity in this regard. 
 
The Company remains committed to fostering an inclusive and accessible work environment in line with 
the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Given the nature of the Company’s 
operations in the chemical manufacturing sector where the handling of hazardous substances is a core 
activity, it is operationally challenging to employ differently abled individuals at certain plant locations due 
to safety considerations. 
 
However, the Company has employed differently abled individual at its head office, where infrastructure 
such as elevators, signage, and basic accessibility features are in place to support their needs. Further, the 
Company is progressively evaluating and upgrading its infrastructure to enhance accessibility across all 
locations, in alignment with its commitment to equity and non-discrimination.

The reported work-related injuries during FY 2024–25 were primarily minor in nature and limited to first-
aid level cases. The Company continues to take proactive safety measures, including regular training, 
supervision, and adherence to safety protocols, to prevent workplace incidents and promote a safe working 
environment. 
 
12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.  
 
The Company places utmost importance on ensuring a safe and healthy workplace across all its 
manufacturing units and operational locations. This commitment is supported by an ISO 45001:2018 
certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System implemented across all plants, ensuring 
structured governance, compliance with applicable regulations, and continuous improvement. 
 
A variety of proactive safety and health measures have been institutionalized: 
 
• 
Daily toolbox talks are conducted across all units to address operational risks, reinforce safety 
procedures, and promote awareness. Safety officers and in-charges lead these sessions and ensure that 
every worker, including contractual staff, is engaged in ongoing safety dialogue. 
 
• 
Extensive safety training programs are conducted regularly at each site. These include topics such as 
chemical handling, static electricity, material safety, on-site emergency preparedness, fire drills, 
process safety, and HAZOP studies. For example, Jhagadia Unit 1 has conducted over a dozen 
practical sessions for permanent and contractual workers, while Sarigam has significantly increased 
the frequency of its training sessions to ensure updated awareness. 
 
• 
The Company has also adopted behavioral safety practices, such as encouraging intervention under its 
Life Protection Rules (Zero Tolerance Rules), requiring employees to report hazards and remove 
themselves from unsafe environments without hesitation. 
 
• 
Site-specific safety infrastructure improvements have been made, such as:

• 
Preventive safety measures are deeply embedded in plant operations: 
 
• 
Material handling sheets, pre-startup safety reviews, and standard operating procedures are in 
place to reduce accident probability. 
 
• 
Regular internal safety audits, along with third-party audits (e.g., safety and fire adequacy audits 
at Vapi and Sarigam), ensure compliance and offer scope for improvement. 
 
• 
Monthly and quarterly safety review meetings are held at site and management levels to track 
near-misses, incidents, and preventive actions. 
 
• 
Additionally, employee engagement around health and safety is encouraged through initiatives 
like Safety Week celebrations, certification awards, birthday events, and farewell ceremonies, 
which strengthen the safety culture and morale of the workforce. 
 
These comprehensive and plant-specific initiatives reflect the Company’s unwavering focus on fostering a 
workplace that is not only compliant with regulatory norms but also actively prioritizes employee health, 
safety, and well-being through preventive, participative, and responsive measures.

Employees (Y/N) (B) Workers (Y/N) 
 
Yes – The Company provides a comprehensive Group Term Life Insurance facility that covers both 
permanent employees and workers. In the unfortunate event of death, the policy offers financial support to 
the nominee or legal heir of the deceased. The claim process is well-defined and requires submission of 
essential documentation, such as the death certificate, to ensure timely and fair disbursal of benefits. This

statutory documents such as registration certificates for Provident Fund (PF), Employees’ State Insurance 
Corporation (ESIC), Goods and Services Tax (GST), Professional Tax, and a valid Workmen Compensation 
Policy are collected and verified. 
 
During monthly billing, contractors are required to submit relevant supporting documents, including PF and 
ESIC challans, wage registers, Professional Tax challans, and Labour Welfare Fund challans (where 
applicable). These submissions are thoroughly reviewed by the Company to confirm statutory compliance 
before any payment is processed.

employees have been engaged as consultants, particularly at the Sarigam and Ahmedabad units, under a 
pilot program, in addition to a director reappointed as Consultant at headoffice. This initiative is aimed at 
leveraging their expertise while also providing them with opportunities for continued professional 
engagement. Based on its effectiveness, the Company may consider expanding this program across other

PRINCIPLE 4- Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to 
all its stakeholders 
 
ESSENTIAL INDICATORS 
 
1. 
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
 
The Company identifies its key stakeholders by examining the ecosystem in which it operates and 
evaluating who is directly or indirectly connected to its value creation process. Rather than relying solely on 
static categories, the process considers the nature of interactions, expectations, and potential impact on 
business continuity and long-term growth. 
 
Departments such as HR, EHS, Procurement, Investor Relations, and CSR collaborate to review internal 
records, regulatory engagements, supplier dependencies, and community interactions to build a holistic 
stakeholder profile. Factors like mutual accountability, strategic relevance, regulatory significance, and 
social footprint are central to this evaluation. 
 
Through this approach, the Company has identified a diverse group of stakeholders that includes: workforce 
(employees and contractual staff), investors and shareholders, government bodies, vendors and service 
providers, customers, community representatives, and other business collaborators. These groups are 
reviewed periodically to reflect changes in the operating environment or stakeholder expectations.

Consultations with stakeholders on economic, environmental, and social topics are typically managed by the 
respective departments such as CSR, EHS, Investor Relations, Human Resources, and Procurement. These 
functional teams regularly engage with stakeholder groups and escalate material feedback, concerns, or 
trends to senior management. Significant matters are discussed at the functional committee level and, where 
relevant, are included in periodic updates to the Board. 
 
In particular, inputs related to community development, employee well-being, environmental compliance, 
and investor expectations are consolidated and shared with the Board through management presentations, 
committee reviews, or through agenda items during quarterly meetings. This structure enables the Board to 
remain informed and involved in strategic decision-making on key ESG topics. 
 
 
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs 
received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.  
 
Yes – Stakeholder consultation plays a key role in identifying and managing relevant environmental and 
social topics. Inputs gathered through regular engagement with communities, employees, contractors, and 
regulatory authorities have informed several initiatives. 
 
For example: 
• 
Feedback from local communities has influenced the design and focus areas of the Company’s CSR 
programmes, particularly in areas like sanitation, health camps, and education. 
• 
Employee feedback has supported enhancements in welfare initiatives and safety training modules. 
• 
Interactions with suppliers and contractors have reinforced the need for continued compliance with 
EHS protocols and ethical sourcing expectations. 
 
These insights are reviewed by internal teams and, where relevant, integrated into operational 
improvements, policy reviews, or future planning. 
 
 
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of 
vulnerable/ marginalized stakeholder groups.  
 
The Company actively engages with vulnerable and marginalized groups, particularly in the communities 
surrounding its plant locations. Through its CSR initiatives, the Company has conducted regular field-level 
interactions and need-based assessments to understand the concerns of underrepresented sections. 
 
Key actions taken include: 
• 
Implementation of health awareness and sanitation drives in low-income and underserved 
communities 
• 
Support for education and skill-building initiatives, especially for youth and women 
• 
Collaboration with charitable organizations to reach out to socially and economically disadvantaged 
groups 
 
These programmes are monitored for impact and are designed in alignment with the needs and feedback 
received from the target communities.

The Company has established formal mechanisms to address grievances related to human rights issues in 
alignment with its Human Rights Policy and other internal frameworks. Employees, workers, and other 
stakeholders can report concerns related to discrimination, harassment, abuse, or any form of rights 
violation through multiple channels, including their reporting manager, the HR department, or the 
designated grievance officer. 
 
Grievances are handled with confidentiality, and all complaints are reviewed and resolved through a 
structured process that ensures fair and timely action. For specific cases related to gender-based concerns, 
the Company has constituted an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) under its Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (PoSH) Policy, in line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, 
Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. 
 
The Company regularly sensitizes employees about these mechanisms to promote awareness and build a 
safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace.

8. 
Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment 
cases.  
 
The Company has put in place specific safeguards to ensure that complainants in cases of discrimination 
and harassment are protected against any form of retaliation. As outlined in the Whistle Blower Policy, 
employees and stakeholders are encouraged to report concerns, including unethical behavior, harassment, or 
rights violations, without fear of victimization. 
 
The policy strictly prohibits retaliation, direct or indirect, against any individual who raises a genuine 
complaint or participates in an inquiry. Any attempt to intimidate, harass, or penalize a complainant is 
treated as a separate violation and may lead to disciplinary action. 
 
All complaints are handled with due confidentiality, and access to case information is limited to authorized 
personnel involved in the investigation and resolution process. 
 
9. 
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)  
 
No – While explicit human rights clauses are not currently embedded in the Company’s standard contracts, 
the Company remains fully committed to upholding and promoting human rights principles across all levels 
of operation. It expects its employees, contractors, suppliers, and other value chain partners to adhere to 
ethical conduct and respect for human dignity in all business dealings. 
 
The Company incorporates these expectations through its internal policies, due diligence during partner 
onboarding, and engagement practices. It continues to evaluate ways to strengthen contractual safeguards 
related to human rights in alignment with evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations.

Note: The Company has adopted a robust approach to water management, with a strong focus on recycling and 
reuse. As of the reporting period, five out of six manufacturing facilities operate with Zero Liquid Discharge 
(ZLD) systems, ensuring that water used in the production process is fully treated and reused within the facility. 
 
Water is processed through on-site Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) or Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and is 
reused primarily for production-related needs or non-potable purposes such as gardening, floor washing, or 
cooling operations. As a result, no treated industrial wastewater is discharged outside the facility boundaries at 
these units. 
 
The Company continues to evaluate water discharge practices at the remaining unit and is working towards 
achieving ZLD status at all locations in the near future.

Yes, the Company has implemented a comprehensive Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) mechanism across the 
majority of its manufacturing units, reaffirming its commitment to sustainable water management and 
environmental protection. As of FY 2024–25, five out of six plants operate under the ZLD framework and 
has undertaken significant infrastructure upgrades aimed at achieving ZLD compliance in the upcoming 
year. 
 
Key Measures Implemented- 
• 
Effluent Treatment and Recycling Systems: 
All ZLD-compliant units are equipped with Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs), Reverse Osmosis 
(RO) systems, and Agitated Thin Film Dryers (ATFDs) to treat and recover process wastewater. At 
Jhagadia Unit 1, 70% of the water used in operations is now recovered as condensate and reused. 
Similarly, the Ahmedabad and Sarigam units have deployed advanced drying and filtration systems, 
including ATFDs and ANFDs (Agitated Nutsche Filter Dryers), to minimize liquid discharge. 
 
• 
Advanced Upgrades at Jhagadia Unit 2 (under implementation): 
The Company has installed a 165 KLD RO system, a 350 m³/day RO plant for stormwater treatment, 
and a PVA Gel system to improve effluent quality. Repair of the SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) 
tank and other infrastructure enhancements have further improved wastewater treatment. A key 
initiative is underway to convert solid and liquid waste into a prime solution for resale. 
 
• 
Infrastructure Enhancements Supporting ZLD: 
Capital investments have been made across units to strengthen water and waste management 
infrastructure. This includes- 
 
• 
Raw water storage tanks (e.g., 300 KL tank at Jhagadia Unit 1) to ensure uninterrupted 
supply and reduce stress on external sources. 
 
• 
Internal water recycling mechanisms, supported by condensate recovery, to reduce 
dependency on fresh water. 
 
• 
Automation and process optimization using Distributed Control Systems (DCS), as installed 
in units like Tarapur and Sarigam, which improve operational control over effluent treatment 
and discharge prevention. 
 
• 
Water Quality and Compliance: 
The Company ensures that the quality of treated water, surpasses the standards of supplied water 
from local industrial development corporations (e.g., GIDC). This demonstrates both effective 
treatment processes and commitment to compliance with applicable norms. Third-party audits, such 
as the internal environmental audit submitted to MPCB from Tarapur, further reinforce regulatory 
adherence. 
 
• 
Water Conservation and Consumption Reduction: 
Across sites, RO systems and process integration have significantly reduced overall water 
consumption. For instance, Ahmedabad reported a 20–30% reduction in water usage through ATFD 
integration and colored water reuse. Sarigam’s process upgrades such as reusing PNT (Para-
Nitrotoluene) wash water in MVR (Mechanical Vapor Recompression) systems further reinforce 
internal recycling initiatives.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.  
 
The Company has adopted a structured and evolving approach to waste management, with continued 
emphasis on the “3R” principles- Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, across all its manufacturing locations. The 
strategy integrates regulatory compliance, process optimization, and technology deployment to minimize 
waste generation and improve environmental outcomes. 
 
1. Operational Waste Management Practices: 
The Company’s waste streams include hazardous waste, process sludge, e-waste, and minimal 
volumes of bio-waste and municipal waste. These are managed in strict compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, including the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and 
Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. 
 
Key practices already in operation include- 
 
• 
Installation of Agitated Thin Film Dryer (ATFD) at Ahmedabad, which has been 
instrumental in reducing liquid waste by evaporating effluents, thus minimizing the volume 
of hazardous waste sent for disposal. 
 
• 
Use of spent hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at Vapi, 
reducing the generation of neutralization sludge and optimizing resource recovery. 
 
• 
Solvent recovery using Agitated Thin Film Evaporators (ATFE) at Sarigam, supporting 
process efficiency and minimizing solvent waste. 
 
• 
Hazardous vapor recovery through FRP scrubbers at Ahmedabad and Venturi scrubbers at 
Jhagadia Unit 2, which help control emissions and reduce air-borne chemical discharge. 
 
• 
Structured product segregation systems and appointment of dedicated personnel at plants 
like Ahmedabad, ensuring appropriate classification, storage, and disposal of different types 
of waste. 
 
• 
Regular audits and regulatory approvals, including the Consolidated Consent and 
Authorization (CCA) at Vapi, which now permits an increased hazardous waste generation 
capacity from 135 MT to 280 MT in line with expanded operations. 
 
2. New and Ongoing Initiatives in FY 2024–25: 
In the current financial year, the Company has further strengthened its waste management 
infrastructure and undertaken the following initiatives: 
 
• 
At Jhagadia Unit 2, the Company is in the process of implementing a waste-to-resource 
initiative aimed at converting solid waste and wastewater into a marketable prime solution. 
Once operational, this is expected to result in zero solid waste from the site. 
 
• 
Greenbelt development covering over 15,000 sq. meters at Jhagadia Unit 2 contributes to

passive waste mitigation and environmental buffering. 
 
• 
Across units, multipurpose filtration and drying equipment like ANFDs and RVDs (Rotary 
Vacuum Dryers) have been operationalized to improve drying efficiency and reduce 
generation of hazardous sludge. 
 
• 
Automation and DCS-based process control systems introduced at Tarapur (and upcoming 
at Vapi) help ensure precise dosage and mixing of chemicals, thereby reducing chemical 
overuse and waste. 
 
• 
Continued investments in PSA systems for in-house nitrogen generation, ash handling 
systems, and enhanced boiler performance monitoring (e.g., EFFIMAX 4000) have 
indirectly contributed to waste minimization and lower emissions. 
 
3. Reduction in Hazardous and Toxic Chemical Usage: 
To minimize the use and impact of hazardous chemicals, the Company has adopted the following 
strategies: 
 
• 
Process modifications to reduce chemical inputs and formation of by-products, especially in 
synthesis and separation stages. 
 
• 
Substitution of high-risk chemicals wherever feasible, and controlled inventory 
management to avoid excess storage or unnecessary use. 
 
• 
Neutralization and reuse practices, such as PNT wash water neutralization at Sarigam and 
reuse in MVR systems, which reduce effluent load and chemical disposal volumes. 
 
All hazardous and non-hazardous waste that cannot be reused or recycled is disposed of through authorized 
waste management vendors, ensuring full traceability and compliance with legal and environmental 
requirements. This includes handling of e-waste, bio-waste, and spent process materials.
