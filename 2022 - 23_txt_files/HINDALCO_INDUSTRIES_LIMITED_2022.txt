Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach to adapt or 
mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format
S.  
No.
Material issue 
identified
Indicate 
whether risk 
or opportunity 
(R/O)
Rationale for identifying the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negativeimplications)
1
Energy and 
GHG Emissions 
Management
R
Coal is one of the primary sources of energy for the Indian 
operations. Being a continuous process industry, with 
process dependence on coal, it is difficult to replace coal 
with any alternate material in the near term.
We have been investing in renewable energy projects to run 
other operations such as townships. We are also evaluating 
the feasibility of other energy sources including increasing the 
use of biomass in power plants. We have also been working on 
carbon capture as well as energy storage.
Negative Implications
2
Waste and 
Hazardous Waste 
Management
R
Proper disposal of waste from operations is essential 
for protecting the environment, and safety. Some of the 
waste is stored in a secured area for which substantial 
land is required. Land availability is becoming difficult 
and storage of waste in ponds has its own risks as well. 
Need to adhere to evolving regulatory requirements 
within specified time frames
We have set up a year-on-year target of 5% for recycling and 
reusing generated waste, with the aim to achieve zero waste to 
landfill by 2050. Several initiatives are in the pipeline - such as 
utilising bauxite residue for backfilling and road building, and 
establishing long-term contracts with cement/road developers. 
These initiatives are being monitored on a regular basis.
Negative Implications
3
Water 
Management
R
Natural resource depletion is a risk all over the world. 
This can eventually impact our immediate environment 
and operations. Our business depends on coal supply, 
bauxite, copper concentrate, water etc. Four of our plants 
are in water-stress areas
We have planned several initiatives for water recycling and 
rainwater harvesting at various plants. Our aim is to achieve 
zero liquid discharge and water positivity across mining and 
downstream verticals by 2025
Negative Implications

Air Emissions
R
Our non-GHG air emissions result from both fuel 
combustion and production processes. Our aluminium 
smelting process contributes to fluoride emissions 
while the burning of fossil fuels contributes to Oxides of 
Sulphur (SOx), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and Particulate 
Matter (PM).
We are taking up several projects to minimise emissions 
from our operations. We are installing pilot Flue Gas 
Desulphurisation (FGD) units at Mahan, Aditya, and Renusagar. 
Negative Implications
5
Biodiversity
R
Our operations depend on coal and bauxite mines. 
Further, many of our locations are situated near areas 
of high biodiversity. Proper management of biodiversity 
around our operations is critical for continued operations 
at our locations
We are taking up several initiatives towards conservation 
of biodiversity, including development of biodiversity 
management plans. 
Negative Implications
6
Occupational 
Health and Safety
R
Health and safety is of utmost importance. However, 
we face injuries due to safety related risks in our 
manufacturing processes. 
We have implemented ‘Serious Injuries and Fatality (SIF) 
prevention programme’, a unique initiative in Indian 
manufacturing which standardises contractor safety 
management processes across Hindalco. Additionally, we are 
incorporating digitalisation to reduce human intervention.
Negative Implications
7
Community 
Relations
O
To actively contribute to the social and economic 
development of underserved communities, lifting the 
burden of poverty, and helping bring in inclusive growth 
in sync with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
In doing so, we are building a better, sustainable way 
of life for the weaker sections of society and raising 
the country’s Human Development Index. In line 
with our Group’s CSR vision, Hindalco has adopted 
socially responsible practices where these SDGs are 
enumerated through the five focus areas of education, 
health care, sustainable livelihood, social empowerment, 
and infrastructure development. We were able to 
positively impact 2 million+ lives through our community 
development programme.

Performance
O
We have been able to achieve our deleveraging target 
well ahead of time leading to a strong balance sheet. This 
has resulted in increased trust between the shareholders 
and lenders. We have a robust approach to the capital 
allocation framework. Further, our focus has been on 
maximising shareholder return by directing our growth 
capex towards value-added downstream expansion 
projects.

Compliance 
Management
R
In the metals and mining industry, regulations play 
an important role in shaping the business. Frequent 
regulatory changes give rise to uncertainty in the 
surrounding environment. Our value chain is highly 
dependent on the resources available with the 
government
We continuously engage with Government agencies and 
work on policy advocacy at various levels. We also actively 
participate in industry associations activities. This helps us in 
proactively engaging with the government and prepare us for 
any regulatory changes.
