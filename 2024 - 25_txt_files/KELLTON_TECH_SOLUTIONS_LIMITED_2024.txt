Sustainable Sourcing
	
While the Company has not made specific R&D or capital expenditure investments dedicated exclusively to environmental 
and social impact technologies during the current financial year, we remain committed to integrating sustainable practices 
across our operations. As a technology-focused organization, we continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance our 
environmental footprint through our core business processes and solutions. The Company prioritizes resource optimization, 
energy efficiency measures, and digital transformation initiatives that inherently contribute to reduced environmental 
impact. Going forward, we are exploring strategic investments in green technologies and sustainable innovation as part of 
our long-term ESG roadmap to create meaningful environmental and social value for our stakeholders.
	
At Kellton, we uphold rigorous standards when onboarding strategic suppliers to ensure alignment with our sustainability 
objectives and ethical values. Each prospective supplier undergoes a thorough due diligence process, managed by our 
dedicated supplier management team, and is required to digitally acknowledge Kellton’s Supplier Code of Conduct. By 
doing so, our partners commit to upholding the company’s expectations for responsible sourcing, business integrity, and 
regulatory compliance.
	
As a result of these robust practices, Kellton ensures that all critical inputs are sourced sustainably, minimizing environmental 
impact and promoting social responsibility within our supply chain.

Processes in place to reclaim products for reuse, recycling, and safe disposal of products at the endof life for Plastics 
(Including Packaging), E-Waste, Hazardous waste, Other waste:
	
Kellton is primarily engaged in providing advanced IT and digital transformation services, and therefore, end-of-life 
reclamation processes for products such as plastics, e-waste, hazardous waste, or similar materials are not applicable to 
our core operations. As we do not manufacture physical products, our environmental footprint in terms of waste generation 
is inherently minimal.
	
Nonetheless, Kellton remains committed to environmental stewardship and sustainable business practices. Any waste 
generated during our business operations is handled responsibly and safely disposed of through authorized vendors in 
accordance with the respective State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) guidelines and standards. Through our continued 
focus on digital innovation, we strive to uphold sustainability, minimize operational waste, and contribute positively to a 
circular economy.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s 
activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, steps taken to address the same;
	
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is not applicable to Kellton’s operations, as the Company is primarily engaged in 
providing IT and digital transformation services and does not manufacture or place physical products into the market that 
would require an EPR framework. Accordingly, Kellton is not required to submit an EPR plan to Pollution Control Boards. The 
Company remains committed to environmental compliance and ensures all operational waste generated is managed and 
disposed of responsibly through authorized channels.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.
	
Kellton is committed to fostering an environment where every individual can report discrimination or harassment with 
confidence and without fear of retaliation. To ensure this, Kellton has established the following safeguards:
	
•	
All complaints are handled with strict confidentiality and impartiality throughout the grievance redressal process.
	
•	
The identity of the complainant is rigorously protected, so individuals feel secure in reporting concerns.
	
•	
Kellton’s Whistleblower Policy and POSH Policy clearly and explicitly prohibit any form of retaliation against complainants 
and witnesses.
	
•	
Any retaliatory behavior—including intimidation, demotion, dismissal, or other adverse actions—is treated as a 
separate violation and is subject to prompt disciplinary action in accordance with company policy and legal standards.
	
•	
Employees have the right to escalate unresolved or sensitive complaints directly to a designated independent authority, 
ensuring fair and transparent oversight for every case.
	
•	
In the event of a false accusation, if an investigation determines that a complaint was deliberately malicious or based 
on forged or misleading information, Kellton may take appropriate disciplinary action against the individual responsible. 
This may include a written apology, reprimand, withholding promotion or pay increment, termination of employment, 
or mandatory counseling, except where claims are made in good faith.
	
All individuals dissatisfied with the outcome of their grievance investigation may appeal for higher review, ensuring protection 
of their rights as per applicable laws.
	
Through these mechanisms, Kellton upholds the dignity, safety, and trust of all employees, reinforcing a culture of fairness, 
accountability, and zero tolerance towards discrimination and harassment in the workplace.
8.	
Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts?
	
Yes, human rights requirements are part of our business and contracts. We expect of our vendors that they uphold and 
advocate the protection of the internationally recognized principles of human rights and that they refrain from engaging in 
violations of those principles.

(POP), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), or other specified parameters for FY24 and FY23. 
All values remain at zero.
	
This is attributable to the nature of Kellton’s business operations, which are focused on IT services and software development 
and do not involve manufacturing activities. Hence, the possibility of releasing air emissions into the atmosphere is negligible 
or not applicable.
	
Further, no independent assessment, evaluation, or assurance has been conducted by an external agency in this regard.

Kellton is a Software and IT services company, whose operations are primarily office-based and do not involve manufacturing, 
industrial processes, or large-scale consumption of physical resources. As a result, the generation of plastic, e-waste, bio-
medical, hazardous, or construction and demolition waste is negligible or non-existent across all categories.
	
The Company’s processes and activities are designed to minimize environmental impact, with strict protocols for electronic 
equipment management and responsible workplace practices. Consequently, there is no significant waste available for 
recycling, re-use, recovery, incineration, or landfilling, as reflected in the reported data.
	
This approach aligns with Kellton’s commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship in the IT sector.
	
Note: Indicate if any independent assessment/ evaluation/assurance has been carried out by an external agency? (Y/N) 
If yes, name of the external agency: No
9.    Details of waste management practices, strategy adopted by the company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals in our products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
As a Software and IT services company, Kellton’s operations primarily involve digital solutions and office-based activities, 
which inherently minimize the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in its products and processes. Consequently, the 
generation of hazardous waste is minimal to negligible.
	
Kellton adopts responsible electronic waste management practices, ensuring safe disposal and recycling of obsolete IT 
hardware through proper e-waste recyclers in compliance with applicable environmental regulations. The Company tries to 
minimize a less use of paper culture and uses energy-efficient electronic devices to reduce environmental impact.
	
While hazardous chemical usage is negligible to zero, Kellton follows strict procurement policies that prioritize suppliers who 
adhere to environmentally responsible standards. The Company also educates employees on safe handling and disposal of 
any potentially harmful materials used within office environments.

(Explained)
Corporate 
Governance & 
Ethics
Opportunity
E ective governance and high 
ethical standards are 
fundamental to building a 
culture of integrity, 
accountability, and long-term 
value creation. By embedding 
robust corporate governance 
and clear ethical expectations, 
Kellton ensures compliance 
with all applicable regulations, 
fosters transparent decision-
making, and prevents 
misconduct. This strengthens 
stakeholder trust, 
di erentiates the brand, and 
supports the sustainable 
growth and resilience of the 
organization.
Kellton implements a 
comprehensive governance 
framework, including a 
dedicated board committee, 
transparent and updated 
codes of conduct/ethics, 
regular training, internal 
audits, and sustained 
integration of ESG 
(Environmental, Social, 
Governance) principles at all 
levels of business.
Positive & Negative: Good 
governance and ethics avoid 
compliance issues and 
enhance reputation; lack 
thereof leads to regulatory 
nes, lawsuits, and loss of 
investor con dence.
Business Ethics
Risk
Engaging in unethical, non-
compliant, or corrupt business 
practices can result in 
regulatory scrutiny, litigation, 
nancial penalties, and erosion 
of corporate reputation. It can 
also undermine customer, 
employee, and investor 
con dence, cause loss of 
contracts, and signi cantly 
impact operational 
sustainability. These risks can 
have cascading long-term 
e ects, not just on nances 
but on the broader brand 
image and stakeholder 
relationships.
Proactive ethics training, 
well-publicized reporting 
and whistleblower channels, 
a zero-tolerance stance 
towards violations, and 
frequent updates to internal 
control systems help 
prevent ethical failures. All 
reported breaches are 
promptly investigated and 
corrective action is taken.
Negative: Legal costs, 
nancial penalties, 
reputational damage, and 
lost opportunities directly 
a ect pro tability and 
growth.
Transparency
Opportunity
Organizational transparency 
regarding policies, decisions, 
and business performance 
builds stakeholder trust, 
improves regulatory 
compliance, and minimizes the 
risk of misinformation and 
speculation. Open 
communication with investors, 
clients, employees, and other 
partners supports 
constructive feedback, timely 
problem-solving, and a 
positive workplace culture, 
further enhancing Kellton’s 
brand and investor appeal.
Kellton maintains thorough 
disclosures of nancial and 
ESG performance, open 
channels for stakeholder 
queries, a company-wide 
policy on transparency, and 
periodic review of 
communication practices. 
Deviations are quickly 
addressed with corrective, 
documented actions and 
management oversight.
Positive: Promotes investor 
con dence, strengthens 
brand, helps secure 
advantageous nancing, 
and mitigates compliance 
risk.

Data Privacy & 
Cybersecurity
Risk
Data privacy and protection of 
sensitive digital assets are 
critical for customer trust, 
legal compliance, and 
continued operations. Cyber-
attacks, phishing, malware, 
and data breaches can result in 
severe nancial costs, 
regulatory action, and loss of 
goodwill. As digital business 
accelerates, staying ahead of 
cyber threats becomes 
increasingly complex and vital 
for risk management.
Multi-layered security: 
quarterly phishing 
awareness, privileged 
access management, data 
leakage prevention tools, 
third-party audits, endpoint 
security, multi-factor 
authentication, network 
monitoring, regular cyber 
risk trainings, cloud disaster 
recovery, and robust data 
backup protocols.
Negative: Breaches result in 
expensive remediation, 
regulatory nes, lost 
revenue/contracts, and 
lasting reputational harm.
Social Media & 
Information 
Security
Risk
Inappropriate or unauthorized 
disclosures about Kellton on 
public platforms may damage 
brand credibility, erode client 
and public trust, and lead to 
regulatory or legal issues. With 
increased use of digital 
communication, the potential 
impact of a misstep or 
malicious post is ampli ed and 
immediate.
Comprehensive social 
media policies, ongoing 
employee awareness 
programs, careful 
monitoring of public 
channels for brand 
mentions, crisis 
communication plans, and 
established reporting/
escalation  
Negative: Reputational 
damage, public relations 
expense, customer/partner 
attrition, and legal costs.
Inclusion, 
Diversity & 
Labour Practices
Opportunity
A diverse and inclusive 
workplace draws on a broader 
talent pool, supports 
innovation, and enhances 
decision-making and problem 
resolution. Fair and 
progressive labour practices, 
including respect for employee 
rights, positively impact 
morale, retention, and external 
reputation. Companies that 
value diversity and inclusion 
are better positioned to attract 
skilled professionals and foster 
a positive, supportive work 
culture.
Targeted hiring of diverse 
candidates, mandatory anti-
bias and inclusion training, 
employee resource/a
nity 
groups, clear policies 
against discrimination, 
extensive engagement with 
workforce to understand 
and remove barriers, and 
frequent review of HR 
practices at the leadership 
level.
Positive: Greater employee 
engagement and 
productivity; strengthens 
brand, drives organizational 
excellence, reduces 
recruitment costs, and 
attracts top talent.
Talent Retention 
& Succession
Risk
High employee turnover and 
inadequate succession 
planning can interrupt 
business continuity, cause 
critical skill shortages, delay 
projects, increase costs, and 
disadvantage the company in 
competitive markets. Loss of 
experienced leaders or key 
sta  may also result in loss of 
client accounts and intellectual 
capital if not managed 
proactively.
Formal succession planning 
for key roles, targeted 
retention programs (career 
mapping, mentoring, 
rewards for tenure/
performance), regular talent 
reviews and risk mapping, 
leadership development, 
proactive exit interviews, 
and continuous monitoring 
of attrition trends.
Negative: Increased HR and 
training costs, business 
disruptions, loss of key 
client relationships, 
potential delay in project 
delivery, reputational harm.
