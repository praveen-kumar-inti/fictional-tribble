1.
Business 
Continuity 
Plan and 
Disaster 
Resilience
Risk
HFL’s Business Continuity Plan (BCP) 
primarily focuses on identifying the 
resources and capabilities required 
by the organisation to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from potential 
threats. 
These 
potential 
threats 
include homogeneity in the customer 
portfolio, the location of operations, 
and inadequate succession planning. 
Furthermore, HFL considers political 
issues in various areas of facilities 
and operational interruptions due to 
equipment breakdown. 
Additionally, HFL considers disasters or 
emergencies at facilities or the head 
office resulting from natural disasters 
such 
as 
earthquakes, 
hurricanes, 
storms/cyclones, lightning, etc., as well 
as fire, explosions, riots, terrorism, and 
power failures.
HFL’s key measures for the Business 
Continuity Plan includes establishing 
operational units across India and 
implementing 
proper 
succession 
planning. A major focus is to diversify 
the 
customer 
base 
and 
avoid 
overdependence 
on 
a 
selected 
few. Additionally, all manufacturing 
facilities have well-prepared disaster 
management plans and are equipped 
for disaster preparedness.
Positive: Impact 
of HFL’s key 
measures on 
the business 
continuity plan. 
However, costs 
can be incurred 
negatively 
during the 
time of disaster 
preparedness.
2
Regulatory 
Compliance 
Risk
The 
rapidly 
changing 
regulatory 
environment and adapting to major 
regulatory changes can cost the 
Company more.
In its current practice, HFL is compliant 
with all applicable laws and regulations. 
HFL always follows updates in the 
regulatory framework.
Positive: Ensuring 
compliance with 
all applicable 
laws and 
regulations 
fosters a positive 
environment for 
businesses.

3
Business 
Ethics and 
Conduct and 
Corporate  
Governance
Risk
HFL operates within a context where 
it faces risks associated with corporate 
governance 
and 
ethical 
business 
practices. 
Engaging 
in 
unethical 
conduct can significantly damage 
the Company’s reputation and result 
in financial repercussions, such as 
fines and penalties. On the other 
hand, implementing strong corporate 
governance 
practices 
contributes 
to the long-term sustainability and 
resilience of the business.
HFL recognises that good corporate 
governance plays a vital role in 
establishing trust among stakeholders, 
including shareholders, employees, the 
environment, and the communities it 
serves. Corporate governance is seen 
as an essential component of effective 
management at HFL, and the Company 
is committed to upholding the highest 
standards 
of 
integrity, 
ensuring 
compliance with laws and internal 
policies. To facilitate this, the Board of 
Directors has implemented a Code of 
Conduct Policy and a Whistle Blower 
Policy that applies to all.
HFL 
has 
established 
various 
committees dedicated to sustainability 
matters. As per the Companies Act, 
2013, HFL has a CSR Committee, 
which is a committee of the Board 
duly constituted to formulate and 
recommend CSR activities to be 
undertaken by the Company to the 
Board. Additionally, HFL has a Risk 
Management Committee that consists 
of a framework for identifying internal 
and external risks specifically faced 
by the Company, which also includes 
ESG-related risks.
Positive: Good 
governance leads 
to ethical actions 
and stronger 
stakeholder 
relationships.
4
Climate 
Change
Risk
Customer expectations are leaning 
towards 
embracing 
sustainability 
and 
implementing 
a 
low-carbon 
transition plan. This shift is due to 
the rapidly growing focus on climate 
change and responsible operations. 
As a result, the Company has taken 
a proactive stance towards climate 
change and the management of its 
emissions, recognising the complexity 
of this process. Moreover, companies 
are facing regulatory expectations 
concerning their efforts to address 
climate change.
The Company is focusing on the 
importance of GHG emission reduction 
and effective utilisation of energy by 
selecting 
appropriate 
low-carbon 
transition 
technologies. 
Currently, 
Bio briquette is being used at some 
manufacturing facilities. The Company 
identified opportunities for improving 
energy efficiency. For example, the 
Company 
replaced 
inefficient 
old 
motors with Variable Frequency Drive 
motors, and Lights are now LED lights.
Negative: In 
the short term, 
there are capital 
and operating 
expenditures 
involved in 
the adoption 
of renewable 
energy sources 
and switching to 
cleaner fuels.

Operational 
Excellence
Opportunity
Operational excellence is to enhance 
the business performance. It can 
be achieved by implementing and 
executing its day-to-day business better 
than its peers. It focuses on continuous 
improvement and lower costs when 
compared to competitors in their 
market and industry.
HFL 
has 
implemented 
various 
strategies 
to 
achieve 
operational 
excellence in manufacturing activities. 
These strategies include improving the 
efficiency of the equipment, increasing 
safety 
standards 
and 
measures, 
enhancing the quality of the products 
being developed, and evaluating the 
process for improvement opportunities.
HFL has also implemented the 5S 
model and has been accredited with 
certifications such as ISO 9001:2008, 
BRC Food Certificates, and ISO 14001. 
Additionally, HFL aims to continually 
improve the organisation by focusing 
on customer requirements and process 
optimisation.
Positive: Due to 
the increase in 
Productivity
6
Employee 
and Workers 
Wellness 
Engagement 
and Talent 
Attraction 
and 
Retention
Opportunity
HFL believes that healthy employees 
and workers lead to a healthy Company. 
They prioritise wellness and enthusiasm 
to create the best place to work, which, 
in turn, attracts more talent to the 
Company.
The availability of skilled Indian workers 
at relatively lower costs provides a 
significant advantage for companies to 
outsource and access a large pool of 
trained workers, which will help meet 
increasing business requirements.
HFL 
provides 
additional 
wellness 
benefits to its employees, such as 
recognition, leadership, and behavioural 
training, in addition to maintaining 
work-life balance and overall health. 
HFL’s success largely depends on our 
highly skilled workers and our ability to 
hire, attract, motivate, retain, and train 
these personnel.
There are 
positive financial 
implications 
resulting from 
the quality and 
productivity of 
their employees’ 
work.
7
Workers 
Development 
and Skill 
Building
Opportunity
Worker 
development 
and 
skill 
development provide an excellent 
opportunity for Company to thrive. By 
investing in improving our workforce’s 
expertise, HFL open the door to a 
brighter future filled with top-tier talent 
and a highly skilled workforce. This 
business decision ensures that our 
organisation is well-equipped to face 
tomorrow’s challenges and ensure 
long-term growth.
HFL is fortunate to have an excellent 
record 
of 
worker 
and 
employee 
relations. HFL up-skills the workforce 
constantly through various training 
programmes. These investments meet 
workforce aspirations and provide 
us with increasing skill sets in a win-
win relationship. Moreover, various 
programmes and initiatives taken by 
governments are further enhancing the 
availability of skilled workers.
Positive: Through 
Increased 
revenues
8
Community 
Engagement
Opportunity
Community engagement is one of the 
key constituents for HFL to maintain 
harmony with the community and 
ensure smooth operations. In the long 
run, support from the communities is 
crucial for HFL’s business operations. 
Therefore, 
building 
trust 
between 
the community and HFL’s business 
operations is essential.
HFL ensures that the well-being of 
the local community is vital to their 
business. They achieve this through 
various CSR initiatives, which not only 
increase reach but also ensure the 
adoption of these initiatives by the 
communities.
Positive: It 
creates a positive 
brand image 
and goodwill. 
It maintains 
a reputation 
among 
communities.

Diversity and 
Inclusion
Opportunity
Embracing gender equality, diversity, 
and inclusion helps companies attract 
and retain top talent. Promoting 
these principles is not only a matter 
of social justice but also makes 
good 
business 
sense. 
Companies 
that foster an inclusive environment 
where all employees feel valued 
and respected tend to have higher 
employee engagement, satisfaction, 
and productivity.
HFL 
focuses 
on 
and 
prioritises 
gender equality. Currently, female 
representation at the board level is 
around 20%. Female representation 
among employees and workers is at 
14%. Additionally, HFL’s units across 
India promote diversity in their business.
Positive impact 
due to diversity 
and inclusion in 
their business.
10.
Stakeholder 
Engagement
Opportunity
Stakeholder engagement is crucial for 
all internal and external stakeholders. 
Understanding 
the 
grievances 
of 
stakeholders 
and 
their 
feedback 
enables the Company to assess the key 
issues of stakeholders and devise a plan 
for improvement.
HFL clearly understands the grievances 
of its stakeholders. The Company 
provides 
efficient 
platforms 
for 
receiving 
stakeholders’ 
grievances 
and ensures timely resolution. HFL 
offers different channels for different 
stakeholders to report their grievances. 
This mechanism allows stakeholders to 
freely provide feedback on the services 
offered by the Company.
Positive impact  
due to goodwill 
with all 
stakeholders.
