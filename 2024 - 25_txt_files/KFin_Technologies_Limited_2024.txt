Financial implications 
of the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or

1.
Carbon 
Footprint 
and 
Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
The Company could face 
risks from stricter regulations, 
reputational damage, higher 
costs, and operational disruptions 
due to climate change and 
energy price volatility.
As an opportunity, the Company 
can benefit from market 
differentiation, cost savings, 
innovation, attracting ESG 
investments, and appealing 
to environmentally conscious 
customers and employees by 
embracing sustainable practices 
and reducing its carbon footprint.
The Company can shift 
to renewable energy 
sources for powering data 
centres and other facilities, 
reducing carbon emissions 
and energy consumption. 
Also, implementing energy 
efficient technologies, such 
as efficient cooling systems 
and server virtualization, 
could lead to reduced 
energy usage.
Negative implications 
of risk could include 
potential fines, increased 
operational and insurance 
costs, revenue loss from 
reputational damage, and 
higher expenses due to 
supply chain disruptions.
Positive implications can 
include cost savings due 
to lower energy bills and 
operational efficiency, 
increased revenue due to 
market differentiation, and 
attracting ESG investments.
2.
Electronic 
Waste
Risk
Stricter disposal and recycling 
regulations, reporting 
requirements, reputational 
damage and increased 
stakeholder expectations 
demanding responsible E-waste 
management practices.
The Company has endorsed 
a robust and established 
Waste Management Policy 
specifically focused on 
E-waste. Under this policy, 
we have partnered with 
approved vendors who 
specialise in the appropriate 
disposal of electronic waste.
Non-compliance with 
E-waste handling rules can 
result in financial penalties.
3.
Data 
Privacy 
and 
Security
Risk and 
opportunity
As a QRTA, the Company 
handles sensitive customer data. 
Ensuring robust data privacy 
and security measures is crucial 
to maintaining customer trust 
and compliance with relevant 
regulations.
The Company has 
implemented strong data 
protection controls including 
encryption, access control 
mechanisms, and employee 
training programs, to 
mitigate the risk of data 
breaches and compromise 
of data privacy.
Increased investment 
in robust controls can 
build and maintain trust 
with customers, leading 
to increased loyalty and 
long-term relationships. 
The identified risk, if not 
resolved could lead to 
fines or penalties, loss of 
customers, reputational 
damage, etc.
4.
Workforce 
Diversity & 
Inclusion
Opportunity
A diverse and inclusive workforce 
can lead to enhanced creativity 
and innovation, better decision 
making, increased employee 
engagement and retention, 
attracting top talent, positive 
organisational culture and a 
socially responsible organisation.
The Company is an equal 
opportunity employer and 
does not discriminate its 
workforce on any grounds.
Improved financial 
performance on account 
of broader market reach, 
improved reputation and 
brand loyalty.
5.
Employee
Well-
being
Opportunity
A safe and healthy work 
environment, work-life balance, 
and employee development 
opportunities are essential 
for employee satisfaction, 
productivity, and overall 
organizational success.
Prioritise employee 
wellbeing through 
initiatives like flexible work 
arrangements, mental 
health support, employee 
benefits/ facilities and 
professional development 
opportunities.
Improving employee 
well-being and creating an 
inclusive work environment 
can enhance productivity, 
reduce employee turnover, 
attract top talent leading 
to increased revenues.
