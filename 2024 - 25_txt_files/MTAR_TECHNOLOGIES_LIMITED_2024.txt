3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
(a) Plastics (including packaging): Plastic packaging materials are segregated at source and collected separately. Reusable 
packaging is retained for internal use, and the remaining plastic waste is sent to authorized recyclers as per local pollution 
control board guidelines. Efforts are also made to minimize single-use plastics in packaging by shifting to biodegradable or 
recyclable alternatives. 
(b) E-waste: Obsolete electronic items and equipment are identified and handed over to certified E-waste recyclers authorized 
by the government. An inventory of E-waste is maintained, and disposal is carried out as per E-Waste Management Rules, 
ensuring no environmental harm during handling or recycling.
(c) Hazardous waste: Hazardous waste, including used oils, paints, chemicals, and contaminated materials, is stored in 
labeled, secure containers in designated hazardous waste storage areas. It is disposed of only through Pollution Control Board 
(PCB)-authorized vendors as per the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules. 
Manifest tracking is used to ensure safe transportation and disposal. 
(d) other waste: Other non-hazardous industrial waste such as metal scrap, wood, glass, and packaging material is segregated 
at source. Metal scrap is sent to authorized recyclers. Wood is reused for internal packaging or disposed through vendors for 
secondary use. All disposal activities follow environmental compliance protocols and internal waste management policies.
4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, 
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution 
Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
EPR isn’t applicable to the company as we do not manufacture any consumer products, there is no specific plastic, 
electrical and electronic item produced where EPR is pertinent under e-waste Management.
