The Company has submitted the Trading 
Application with National Stock Exchange of 
India Limited (“NSE”) on March 22, 2024, well 
within the stipulated period of seven working 
days from the latest listing approval granted by 
the stock exchanges and made simultaneous 
attempts to file the Trading Application with BSE 
as well. However, due to technical issues on the 
Listing Portal of BSE, the Company could not file 
the Trading Application on BSE on the same day 
as it was filed with the NSE.
Further, despite of numerous attempts to 
contact BSE's officials at the provided contact 
numbers for preferential issues on their website, 
communication remained unestablished.
Furthermore, the challenges were compounded 
by the weekly-off on March 23, 2024, March 24, 
2024, due to Saturday and Sunday, and on March 
25, 2024, due to the festival of Holi, making it 
more difficult for the Company to co-ordinate 
with BSE officials.
Following communication with BSE officials on 
March 26, 2024, the Trading Application was duly 
submitted with BSE.
The Company, vide its email dated March 27, 
2024, had suitably replied to BSE and requested 
to reconsider the imposition of fine. Further, 
as informed by BSE, pre-payment of fine is 
mandatory for granting trading approval, 
therefore, the Company had paid the fine on April 
02, 2024.

• Whole-time Directors are prohibited from engaging in activities that may compromise their responsibilities to 
the Company or conflict with its interests. This includes refraining from concurrent employment with suppliers, 
customers, or competitors, and avoiding actions that support competitors.
• Prior approval from the Company's Audit Committee is required for Directors who wish to accept assignments with 
companies or agencies that compete with the Company. Directors should avoid conducting business on behalf of the 
Company with any relative or with a business in which a relative holds a significant role. In unavoidable situations, 
they must seek the approval of the Audit Committee, in accordance with applicable laws. Directors are encouraged 
to minimise transactions with relatives or their businesses. Should such transactions be necessary, compliance with 
relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI Regulations is mandatory.
• Directors must disclose and seek approval from the Board before personally benefiting from corporate assets, 
information, or their position.
	
These measures uphold transparency, integrity, and the prevention of conflicts of interest within the Company and its 
Board of Directors.

Permanent Workers
At HFCL, we promote transparency and open communication among employees and 
management at all levels. We have implemented measures to provide a safe, inclusive, 
and supportive work environment for all employees and workers. Employees can file 
grievances in writing to their immediate supervisor, department head, or HR business 
partner. The responsible individual conducts a personal hearing and strives to resolve 
the grievance at their level. If the problem is not resolved, employees can escalate it to 
higher management (Plant Head, Function/Business Head, or MD).
Furthermore, the Company has designated a Vigilance Officer under the Whistle 
Blower Policy, allowing employees and labourers to file complaints. The Vigilance 
Officer analyses these complaints and reports the results to the Audit Committee 
for final decision-making. HFCL has established Internal Complaints Committees at 
each workplace in accordance with the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment 
at Workplace (POSH) to address to any sexual harassment complaints as swiftly as 
possible.

Regular
Our objective in engaging with the 
community is to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the concerns and 
gaps in our CSR projects, as well as to 
gather feedback on their expectations, 
aspirations, needs, complaints, and 
suggestions. Throughout our engagement 
processes, we have encountered various 
topics and concerns raised by community 
stakeholders. Some common key issues 
include insufficient time allocation for 
service delivery to address all beneficiaries, 
demand of additional services in the 
project, the distant location of the service 
site from beneficiaries' homes and 
individual grievances against the project's 
operational team. We collect and compile 
this feedback, requests, complaints, 
and information to direct the respective 
project partners to address each individual 
complaint, understand every suggestion 
and strive to implement corrective 
measures. Additionally, we aim to adjust

A comprehensive waste management plan is in place at all HFCL locations, in accordance with our commitment to 
dispose of zero waste to landfills by December 2024. We ensure categorisation and segregation of all waste types at 
the source. The hazardous waste is collected, transported, and disposed of by CPCB-authorised vendors, while the 
non-hazardous waste is either recycled or utilised within the operations (wherever feasible) or processed through 
an appropriate mechanism by the authorised vendors. Additionally, we ensure that all the raw materials used to 
manufacture Optical Fiber and Optical Fiber Cables are Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) compliant. HFCL has upgraded its RoHS compliance in 
line with the latest directives 2015/863 (EU) RoHS that has added four additional restricted substances to the existing list 
and do not contain substances which are identified in the Candidate List of  Substance of Very High Concern published 
by ECHA on 07/01/2023. Furthermore, HFCL promotes the manufacturing of modern designs with reduced level of jelly 
or no jelly and replacing it with the use of dry water blocking materials and has switched to 90% of designs with dry 
core construction. These dry tube/dry core designs help in reduction in use of petroleum-based products.

Brief of the Case 
Corrective action taken 
There are no anti-competitive conduct issues reported in the FY24, therefore, no corrective actions are underway. Further, 
HFCL is the only Indian Company against which no Anti-Dumping duty has been determined by European Commission 
on export of Optical Fiber Cables (“OFC”) to European countries. After thorough investigation, in a landmark verdict 
on June 14, 2024, European Commission ruled that HFCL and HTL, its subsidiary, are the only Indian companies not 
engaged in dumping of OFC in European markets whereas provisional Anti-dumping duty has been determined on all 
other Indian Optical Fiber Cable Manufacturers. This makes HFCL as the only Indian Optical Fiber Cable manufacturer to 
have been exempted from anti-dumping duties by European Commission. This proves HFCL’s unwavering commitment 
to transparency and fair business practices in a half-a-year long investigation by European Commission on Indian Optical 
Fiber Cables manufacturers for dumping OFC in European market.
