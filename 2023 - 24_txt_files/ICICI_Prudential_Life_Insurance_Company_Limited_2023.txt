solutions designed to meet the diverse financial 
aspirations of its customers, the Company has fortified 
its position as a trusted life insurance provider committed 
to serving them throughout different stages of their lives.
The Company recognises that its customers depend on

the varied life insurance needs of its customers.
Leveraging advanced technologies such as data analytics,

better insights into customers’ needs, behaviours and 
affordability. This allows the Company to develop several 
industry-first initiatives such as a product which offers 
100% refund of all premiums paid, same-day policy 
issuance and paying out commission to distributors on 
the same-day to name a few. Importantly, the Company 
has been settling all non-investigative claims with an

STRATEGIC REVIEW 
Message from the Chairman
AS INDIA MARCHES FORWARD TO 
JOIN THE RANKS OF DEVELOPED 
NATIONS, THE DEMAND FOR 
LONG-TERM SAVINGS, PROTECTION 
AND ANNUITY PRODUCTS WILL 
ONLY ACCELERATE.
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
It is with great pleasure that I present to you the 
Company’s Annual Report for FY2024. This report 
showcases a year of resilient performance amidst a mix 
of challenges and opportunities.
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
The International Monetary Fund has projected global 
economic growth at 3.2% in 2024-2025, in the face 
of restrictive monetary policies and geopolitical risks. 
The India Outlook report by CRISIL has forecasted the 
Indian economy to become the third largest in the world 
by 2031, marking its entry into the upper middle-income 
club of countries.
Life insurance serves the fundamental needs of society 
and is tightly interwoven with the economic progress 
of the country as it provides a source of long-term 
funds, essential for a developing economy such as ours. 
India’s thriving economy thus offers significant growth 
opportunities, especially for the life insurance sector by 
making it accessible to the underserved. 
THE INDIA OPPORTUNITY
As per Swiss Re’s Asia Mortality Protection Gap 
research, 83% of protection needs of Indian consumers 
are unmet (USD 16.5 trillion). Swiss Re, also estimates 
life insurance premiums in India, during 2024-2028 to 
grow by 6.7% fuelled by rising demand for protection 
by the mass-affluent segment and a large young 
working population.
Also, as per estimates put out in December 2023 by 
the National Insurance Academy, sponsored by the 
Government of India, there exists a striking 93% pension 
gap in the country. It goes on to state that only 24% of 
individuals rely on employer-provided retirement plans. 
Studies also suggest that retirement savings in India 
stand at just 14% of GDP as compared to other developed 
nations, such as the US and Canada, where it stands at 
150% and 192% respectively.
The Regulator has articulated its vision of ‘Insurance for 
All’ by 2047 and rolled out several conducive regulations 
which will promote innovation, improve ease of doing 
business, make insurance simple and easily accessible 
leading to deepening penetration in the country.
As India marches forward to join the ranks of developed 
nations, the demand for long-term savings, protection 
and annuity products will only accelerate. ICICI Prudential 
Life Insurance, with its customer-focused approach, suite 
of easy-to-understand products and strong brand equity 
is appropriately poised to address these needs. We aim 
to capture this untapped opportunity by continuing to 
simplify life insurance through simple products and ease 
of on-boarding and thus make life insurance accessible 
for various customer segments, which we believe 
shall provide us with the edge to power sustainable 
growth going forward.
ENHANCING STAKEHOLDER VALUE
Life insurance products provide ‘peace of mind’ from 
financial uncertainty and our endeavour shall be to 
enhance customer experience by improving the product 
proposition and providing service excellence across the 
entire customer life cycle. With an array of protection, 
long-term savings, annuity and group products, we are 
committed to making life insurance accessible to larger 
sections of the country’s population.

Promoter Score of 63, as per the Insurance CuES

shall 
be 
pivotal 
for 
empowering 
and 
engaging 
all our stakeholders, enabling us to achieve our 
strategic objectives. 
Accordingly, to fortify our competitive edge, we 
shall continue to invest in Data Analytics, Artificial 
Intelligence, 
Machine

proposition 
while 
our 
anytime

architecture helps us deliver superior customer service 
24/7 across multiple platforms and touchpoints as may 
be preferred by the customer.
Cutting-edge digital technologies have enabled us to

facilitated providing sharper and deeper insights into 
customer needs, preferences and challenges resulting 
in identifying unserved and under-served customer 
segments while delivering best-in-class customer service.
We will continue to empower our distribution network 
with technology-enabled platforms to offer the ‘right 
product to the right customer’ enabling us to remain the 
preferred life insurance brand for customers.

with technology interventions has resulted in us having 
one of the best claim settlement ratio and turnaround 
time in the life insurance industry. This underscores our 
commitment to deliver on the promises made to our 
customers and their families.
Our strategy of keeping the customer at the centre 
of everything we do has been recognised on several 
industry-leading platforms. It is a matter of pride for 
us to have received awards for the ‘Customer Service 
Company of the Year’ from Synnex India and ‘Best Use of 
Mobile to Enhance Customer Experience’ from Customer 
FEST. These awards are a testament to our ‘Customer 
First’ approach and motivate us to continuously exceed 
customer expectations.
RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZEN
We continue to demonstrate our steadfast resolve 
to utilise business as a driver for positive societal 
transformation. The Company partners with ICICI 
Foundation to support initiatives on skill development 
for sustainable livelihoods and healthcare programmes 
which are aimed at improving the health outcomes of 
underprivileged children. The Company’s Corporate 
Social Responsibility initiatives have positively impacted 
1.9 million lives since inception.
We would like to reaffirm our commitment to creating 
a culture that embraces sustainability. The Company’s 
environmental and its sustainability initiatives are aimed 
at leaving the planet a better place for future generations.
It is with great pride that I state, the Company is the

that Mr. Sandeep Batra, an ICICI Group veteran, will be 
taking over. He has been on the Board of the Company 
since 2014 and brings with him a wealth of knowledge

To conclude, having witnessed first-hand our collective 
triumphs, it fills me with immense contentment and 
a profound sense of accomplishment. I would like to 
thank the Board, the Regulator, the leadership team, 
all employees, shareholders, distributors and other 
stakeholders for their commitment and support. It has

LIFE INSURANCE CATERS TO THE 
PRIMARY NEEDS OF SOCIETY OF 
PROTECTING HEALTH AND LIFE, BUILDING 
LONG-TERM SAVINGS AND PLANNING 
FOR RETIREMENT, THEREBY MAKING IT A 
NON-SUBSTITUTABLE PRODUCT.
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
Message from the Managing Director & CEO
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
It is a pleasure to present the Annual Report for the 
fiscal year 2024. The Company has posted a resilient 
performance on the back of furthering its efforts to 
simplify life insurance.
It is my privilege to lead an organisation that stands as 
a testament to trust, excellence and innovation in the 
Indian life insurance sector.
As I begin, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to the 
Company’s vision ‘To build an enduring institution that 
serves the protection and long-term saving needs of 
customers with sensitivity.’
Customer centricity remains at the core of our strategy as 
we progress in our journey of simplifying life insurance to 
deliver an enhanced experience to customers.
Before we discuss the year gone by, it is important to 
understand the economic landscape we operate in.
MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT & THE INDIA 
POTENTIAL
Despite muted growth in the global economy, as per the 
Ministry of Finance, India is well on its way to becoming 
the world’s third largest economy with a GDP of USD 7 
trillion by 2030.
With India emerging as a strong performer on the global 
stage. The country is seeing a surge in investments 
and a positive outlook from businesses and consumers 
alike, setting the stage structurally for continued 
economic going forward.
This sense of optimism around the prospects of the Indian 
economy augurs well for the life insurance industry. 
As per Swiss Re, India’s score on the Resilience Index for 
mortality was 9.2%, indicating that life insurance covered 
less than 10% of the existing needs. This signifies the 
financial vulnerability of Indian families in case of demise 
of the breadwinner.
Further, estimates released by Swiss Re in January 2024, 
India’s insurance sector is poised for exceptional growth 
over the next five years (2024-2028), making it the 
fastest-growing 
insurance 
marketplace 
among 
all G20 countries.
Life insurance caters to the primary needs of society of 
protecting health and life, building long-term savings 
and planning for retirement, thereby making it a 
non-substitutable product. As per UN Population Division, 
the share of working population in India will grow to 736 
million by 2030. This growing population will need life 
insurance to provide financial security to themselves and 
their loved ones. With this as the backdrop, India’s life 
insurance landscape holds a lot of growth opportunities 
for a customer-focussed Company such as ours.
Our effort will be to take advantage of the economic 
growth 
momentum, 
deliver 
enhanced 
customer 
experience and position the Company as the preferred 
insurer for serving the growing protection, long-term 
savings and income needs of our customers.
We will deepen our penetration across diverse customer 
micro-segments and micro-markets through tailored

customer service architecture.
ENABLING REGULATIONS TO UNLOCK 
POTENTIAL
The Regulator is focussed on implementing enabling 
regulations and other collaborative initiatives to boost 
growth, increase penetration and drive financial inclusion 
to achieve its vision of ‘Insurance for All’. Initiatives such 
as ‘Use and File’ have increased go-to-market speed of 
life insurers to offer innovative propositions to customers.
The three key initiatives of Bima Sugam, Bima Vistaar and 
Bima Vahak by the Regulator are designed to simplify 
insurance while offering an immersive experience to 
customers. We believe these efforts have paved the way 
for fulfilling the insurance needs of the uninsured and 
under-insured and drive financial inclusion in the country.
Going forward, the Company will focus on deepening 
capabilities to innovate, grow and establish leadership 
in the Indian life insurance market. We will continue to 
augment trust to build long-lasting relationships with 
customers through designing customer-centric products 
and solutions and deliver value to all our stakeholders. 
With a strong foundation, we are excited about 
the journey ahead.
ENHANCING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
For the Company, the path to sustainable growth is 
anchored on simplifying products and processes to 
enhance customer experience. By focussing on these 
areas, we have ensured our offerings are easy-to-
understand, cater to customers’ life stage needs and 
enhance their overall experience with the brand.
Enhancing customer experience is about more than just 
satisfaction; it’s about providing a seamless journey 
that is personalised and responsive. Life insurance is 
a long-term product enabling fruition of customers’ 
non-negotiable life goals. We are therefore committed 
to understanding and anticipating their needs, delivering 
products and services that exceed expectations and 
build long-lasting relationships based on trust and 
mutual respect.
By committing to these principles, the Company is not 
just powering growth but also evolving in a way that 
aligns with the needs and expectations of our customers, 
fortifying our position as a leader in the life insurance 
industry for the long-term.
Here I am happy to state that the Company has received 
an award for ‘Customer Experience Team of the Year’ from 
Synnex India, a validation of our customer first approach.
TECHNOLOGY DRIVING SIMPLIFICATION
The Company is committed to enhancing customer 
experience, beginning from prospecting to customer 
service to claim settlement. We continue to be at the 
forefront of innovation, to support our objective of being 
the most customer and distributor-friendly life insurer in 
India. We have introduced several industry-first offerings 
such as a product which provides customers a 100% 
refund of premiums paid. Also, we have recently launched 
a unit linked product which links the distributors’ payouts 
to the assets under management of their customers. 
Another one of our products’ allows customers to make 
partial withdrawals to meet liquidity requirements.
We have rolled-out the ICICI Pru Stack, a set of platform 
capabilities which empowers our distribution partners 
with 
customer 
segmentation, 
identify 
cross 
and 
upsell opportunities to offer the right product to the 
right customer.
The Stack has enabled us to extend ‘Term By Invite’ – 
pre-approved sum assured offers to customer based 
on their profiles. Similarly, for our long-term savings 
business segment we have curated the ‘Insurance By 
Invite’ offering. Both these invitational offers provide a 
hassle-free buying experience to customers. By leveraging 
technology, we have been able to issue a significant 
majority of our policies on the same day for the savings 
business segment. Notably, we are the first life insurer in 
the country to pay out commissions to select distributors 
on the same day.
Customer centricity continues 
to be at the core of our 
strategy. We believe our 
approach of offering the 
right product to the right 
customer at the right price 
will unlock the country’s 
untapped potential.

service architecture.

Embedded Value (EV)
EV is a measure of the consolidated value of the shareholders’ 
interest in the life insurance business. It is calculated as the 
sum of the Company’s adjusted net worth (ANW) and the 
value of in-force business (VIF). The VIF includes the present 
value of future profits attributable to shareholders from the 
in-force business of the Company (which includes the new 
business written during the previous year). Future profits 
are computed based on assumptions such as persistency, 
mortality, morbidity and external factors like interest rates 
and capital market performance.
Embedded Value Operating Profit (EVOP)
EVOP is a measure of the increase in the EV during any 
given period due to matters that can be influenced by 
Company management. The key components of EVOP are 
expected investment income on opening EV (unwind), the 
VNB added during the year and the EV variances.
The EV variance is a measure of the performance as 
compared to what was assumed in arriving at the EV at 
the beginning of the year. The key factors are mortality, 
persistency and renewal expenses. If these variances 
are expected to continue in the future, then it is usual to 
capitalise these variances by way of an assumption change.

GOVERNANCE & RESPONSIBILITY FRAMEWORK 
The Board has established a framework of policies 
and practices which identifies all the elements of a 
sound approach to governance and responsibility. 
A Management Committee, comprising senior officers 
led by the Managing Director & CEO, uses this framework 
to set and monitor governance and responsibility 
objectives, identify improvement opportunities and 
ensure that activities are aligned with the pre-defined 
business strategy. Reputation, trust and confidence 
are some essential elements that the Company 
seeks to protect and enhance for the benefit of all 
its stakeholders.
GIVEN BELOW ARE SOME KEY ELEMENTS OF THE 
COMPANY’S ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES 
AND GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY:
Board Governance Structure
The Company operates under a governance structure 
designed to establish effective checks and balances 
in its management and create long-term value for the 
stakeholders. The Board’s constitution duly adheres to 
the applicable statutory requirements. The separation of 
Board’s supervisory role from the executive management 
and an effective independent Board is the basis of 
the 
Company’s 
corporate 
governance 
philosophy. 
Diversity in Board composition ensures having diverse 
thoughts, perspectives, knowledge, skills and industry 
experience 
to 
retain 
the 
Company’s 
competitive 
advantage. The Chairman of the Board is an Independent 
Director, and the Board Committees comprise mostly of 
Independent/Non-Executive Directors (NED) and are 
chaired by Independent Directors (ID).
Employee Compensation Structures and 
Governance
The Company follows prudent compensation practices 
under the guidance of the Board, and the Board 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee (BNRC). 
The Company’s approach to compensation is based 
on the ethos of meritocracy and fairness within the 
framework of prudent risk management. While the 
Company aims to ensure internal and external equity 
consistent with emerging market trends, the Company’s 
business model and affordability based on business 
performance sets the overarching boundary conditions. 
The output from the Performance Management System 
and Talent Management System serve as inputs for 
administration of the Compensation Policy.
The Company’s long-term pay schemes including the 
Employees Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock 
Unit Scheme are designed to encourage institution 
building among the employees. As a philosophy, 
long-term pay is given to enhance employee motivation, 
enable employees to participate in the long-term growth 
and financial success of the Company and act as a 
retention mechanism.
For the Managing Director & CEO, compensation is 
aligned to both financial and non-financial indicators of 
performance including controls like risk management, 
process perspective, customer perspective and others. 
Compensation for Wholetime Director/s is aligned to their 
predefined key performance indicators, as approved by 
the Board and BNRC. Compensation is also aligned with 
prudent risk parameters such as solvency, grievance 
redressal, expense management, claim settlement, overall 
compliance status and the overall financial position such 
as Net Worth and Assets Under Management (AUM). 
The quantum of performance bonus as a percentage of 
total fixed pay is governed based on the Compensation 
and Benefits Policy.
Compliance Framework
The Insurance and Regulatory Development Authority 
of India (IRDAI) is the primary regulatory authority 
for the insurance sector in the country. The Board 
of Directors, through the Board Audit Committee, 
oversees the compliance framework. The Company has 
various compliance policies and procedures, including 
a compliance policy, code of business conduct and 
ethics, policy against sexual harassment at workplace, 
professional 
workplace 
conduct, 
anti-bribery 
and 
anti-corruption policy, whistle-blower policy and a code 
of conduct for personal investments. The compliance 
responsibility vests with each business department, 
with the Compliance Policy serving as a guiding force in 
building the compliance culture within the organisation. 
In accordance with the above framework, the Compliance 
function creates company-wide awareness and provides 
guidance on applicable insurance laws, regulations, 
guidelines and circulars issued by the regulatory authority.
Risk Management
Risk is an integral element of the Company’s business 
and managed acceptance of risk is essential to generate 
shareholder value. The risk governance structure of 
the Company consists of the Board, the Board Risk 
Management Committee, the Product Management 
Committee, the Executive Risk Committee and its 
sub-committees. The risk philosophy of the Company 
is outlined in the Board-approved Risk Policy, which 
is reviewed by the Board at least annually. The Risk 
Policy details identification, measurement, monitoring 
and control standards relating to various individual 
risks, namely investment (market, credit and liquidity), 
insurance, operational (including legal, compliance, 
outsourcing, customer dissonance, business continuity, 
information and cyber security) and reputation.

The Board periodically reviews the potential impact 
of strategic risks such as changes in macro-economic 
factors, government policies, regulatory environment 
and tax regime on the business plan of the Company. 
In addition to these risks, the life insurance industry faces 
a number of emerging risks, such as sustainability risks, 
particularly environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
related issues. One of the most prominent ESG risks is 
that of climate change and its potentially far-reaching 
consequences. Apart from climate change, there are 
several emerging risks associated with public health 
trends such as increase in obesity-related disorders and 
demographic changes such as population urbanisation 
and ageing. The risk management framework seeks to 
identify, measure and control all the exposures to all 
these risks within the overall risk appetite.
Investment Framework
The Board and Board Investment Committee (BIC), 
supported by the Executive Investment Committee 
(EIC), oversees investment management, investment 
norms and the monitoring and control processes 
related to investments. The Investment Policy sets out 
the framework and guidelines for the management of 
investments with the objective of ensuring adequate 
returns on the policyholders’ funds with protection, 
safety and liquidity of such funds. The framework 
encompasses aspects concerning compliance with 
prudential regulatory norms on investments, prudent 
risk management and mitigation strategies to ensure 
commensurate yield on investments.
Framework for Managing Conflicts of Interest
The Company has a Framework for Managing Conflicts 
of Interest that clarifies the principles and the measures 
to manage potential conflicts of interest at the individual 
and organisation level, in order to conduct the Company’s 
activities in an ethical and transparent manner. 
Declarations are annually obtained from employees 
on any potential conflicts of interest, which are duly 
assessed and acted upon.
Code of Conduct
The Company is committed to adopting the highest 
business, governance, ethical and legal standards in the 
conduct of the Company’s operations. The Company has 
a Code of Conduct which defines the professional and 
ethical standards that employees and Directors need to 
adhere to, in compliance with all applicable statutory 
laws, regulations and internal policies. The Code of 
Conduct is published on the Company’s website and the 
Intranet. Employees including Directors are required to 
annually confirm that they have read and understood 
the Code of Conduct. All new employees also need to 
confirm that they have read and understood the Code of 
Conduct at the time of their joining.
Code of Conduct for Dealing in Securities (Code)
The Code reflects the Company’s commitment to always 
operate with the highest level of integrity and ethical 
conduct at all times. The Code establishes trading 
limitations and includes requirements for pre-clearance 
of personal securities transactions and minimum 
holding periods. Depending on the line of business 
and job function, employees may also be required to 
comply with an additional policy applicable to specific 
corporate functions. Policies that apply to employees 
may also apply to their spouses, minor children or 
anyone to whom the employee provides significant 
financial support/advice.
Certain provisions of the Code apply to Directors 
including NEDs and IDs. Further, employees dealing in 
the Company’s securities are subject to more restrictive 
personal trading policies.

VALUE CREATION
PRODUCT CONCEPTUALISATION AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
Data analytics, market information, customer 
insights and feedback is leveraged to design 
appropriate cost-effective products based on the 
changing preferences and needs of the customers.
PRUDENT FUND MANAGEMENT 
The set of policies and practices are more stringent than the 
ones prescribed by the regulator. Based on the investment 
framework, the Company carries out in-depth analysis of 
companies and relevant sectors. The Company follows a 
disciplined approach for investment, which works across 
market cycles and facilitates in achieving the goals and 
objectives, while also meeting the expectations of all the 
stakeholders. The Company’s disciplined and long-term 
investment approach has held the Company through market 
cycles. The Company incorporates ESG factors into the 
Company’s investment process in addition to fulfilling the 
stewardship responsibilities. As one of the key institutional 
investors in Indian listed companies, the Company ensures 
that the businesses they invest in are operating in a 
responsible manner. The Company currently has Assets 
Under Management worth ` 2.941 trillion. 
CUSTOMER SERVICES AND CLAIM MANAGEMENT
Customer service and claim settlement play a vital role in 
building trust for the Company’s business that has customer 
at the core. The customer-focussed approach involves 
understanding their needs and empathise with them, 
reinforcing their trust on the Company. Prompt resolution 
of issues, communication at every milestone and being 
transparent about processes, charges and policies also 
fosters trust and enhances customer satisfaction.
Claims settlement is the ultimate moment of truth, and it is 
vital to settle all genuine claims efficiently to assuage any 
customer anxiety. The Company has digitised the Company’s 
claim process which not only improves efficiency but also 
reduces paperwork, streamlines communication, and 
provides real-time updates to the claimant. The Company’s 
motto is to provide a seamless claims experience that builds 
trust and loyalty.
PRODUCT BRANDING, MARKETING AND 
DISTRIBUTION
The extensive multi-channel distribution network helps 
distribute products effectively. To ensure wide coverage 
among prospective customers, the Company regularly 
designs awareness campaigns around the importance 
of life insurance and its products/services.
POLICY UNDERWRITING AND 
REINSURANCE
The underwriting team evaluates the risk 
profile of policyholders against established 
criteria. This involves analysing various 
factors such as the policyholder’s history, 
the nature of the risk, and potential financial 
impact. Based on the risk assessment, 
the underwriting team sets premiums 
that are commensurate with the level of 
risk. This ensures that the policy is priced 
appropriately, balancing the potential 
for claims against the premium income. 
Additionally, they also weed out the potential 
risky business.
DIGITALISATION
The Company’s continued focus on 
digitisation bundled with Gen AI capabilities 
should drive them to the next wave of innovation, 
solution possibilities and growth. The Company 
has fully digitised the Company’s policy issuance and 
servicing processes. More than 98% of all the policies 
are logged digitally. The Company has also offered its 
customers the facility of opening e-insurance accounts, an 
electronic repository of policies. This enables the customers 
to electronically store and administer their policies. To the 
extent permitted, the Company also communicates with its 
customers via SMS and emails to reduce the use of paper. 
The digital platform is extended to employees, advisors 
and partners too. Due to these initiatives, the Company’s 
paper usage has dropped drastically over the years. The 
above initiatives and digital processes have not only 
provided speed and convenience to customers 
and distributors but have also had a positive 
impact on the environment.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Operating Context
THE NEW FACE OF LIFE INSURANCE IN INDIA
The life insurance sector is undergoing a fundamental 
transformation because of technology improvements, 
shifting client expectations, and a move towards 
customised products. In this era of disruption, insurers are 
embracing innovation to provide life insurance products 
that meet the different demands of their consumers.
Life insurers have become agile and are constantly 
evolving based on customer preferences, market 
and demand trends to provide the most appropriate 
proposition to their customers. Technology and data 
analytics are the biggest enablers for life insurers to 
deliver this value proposition. 
Apart from the traditional savings products, the 
life insurance industry has evolved to cater to the 
mortality, morbidity and longevity needs of customers 
with innovative protection and annuity products 
over the years. The products are characterised by 
sound underwriting and faster claims processes. 
Insurers are utilising technological innovations to 
automate operations, decreasing paperwork, and 
shortening turnaround times, which leads to efficient 
distribution and significant cost savings.
Data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine 
learning are providing insurers with insights into 
individual consumer risk profiles and preferences. 
This is used by them to tailor the products and meet 
specific needs of customers. Increasing financial 
In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, 
change has become a constant. Shifts in customer 
and 
societal 
expectations, 
combined 
with 
macroeconomic 
and 
geopolitical 
volatility, 
are 
compelling 
enterprises 
around 
the 
world 
to 
transform their tech infrastructure, products and 
services, business models and organisational culture 
to not only fuel profitability, but also to remain 
relevant and survive. 
The insurance industry is no different. In fact, these 
colliding forces have the potential to be the catalyst 
for reinvention, both in terms of how the industry 
does business and their entire purpose and position 
within the society. 
Life insurance is a critical societal requirement in 
India, particularly given the current social security 
structure in the country. It is a one-of-a-kind financial 
planning tool that offers families with a financial 
safety net, while also allowing them to achieve their 
long-term financial objectives and protecting their 
family in the event of unforeseen circumstances. 
The life insurance sector provides a wide range of 
products for long-term wealth creation. It also provides 
annuities for retirement planning and protection plans 
to safeguard an individual from any unforeseen event. 
Thus, the life insurance sector serves as a risk manager 
by providing coverage for investment, longevity, 
mortality and morbidity risks. The life insurance 
industry has covered 247.7 million lives through 
individual policies and 467.7 million lives through 
group policies, providing a total insurance cover (sum 
assured) of ` 295.4 trillion at March 31, 2023.
Additionally, 
insurers 
also 
assist 
in 
economic 
development in general and the development of 
financial markets in particular. The life insurance 
business has used its enormous distribution network 
across the country to supply long-term capital to 
both the debt and equity markets. The industry 
manages assets1 worth ` 54.1 trillion at March 31, 
2023. More importantly, the industry also provides 
long-term capital needed for infrastructure projects 
and is a significant source of part-time and full-time 
employment to professionals with varied skill levels.
A CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
literacy, digitalisation, rising per capita income, product 
innovations, and development of strong distribution 
channels have led to better channelising of household 
savings towards financial savings. All these factors 
complemented by various initiatives taken by IRDAI 
to increase insurance penetration resulted in the 
life insurance industry drawing a higher share of 
household savings. 
CURRENT OPERATING CONTEXT
The total life insurance premiums grew from ` 500.94 
billion in FY20022 to ` 7,825.04 billion in FY20233 
(14.0% CAGR). Additionally, new business premiums 
(retail weighted received premium) grew from ` 116.00 
billion in FY2002 to ` 1,089.75 billion in FY20244 (10.7% 
CAGR). According to a report by Swiss Re, between 
CY2024‒CY2028, total insurance premiums are expected 
to grow by 7.1% in real terms, well above the global 
(2.4%), emerging (5.1%) and advanced (1.7%) market 
averages. At this rate, India will have the fastest growing 
insurance sector of the G20 countries. Currently, there 
are 26 life insurance companies in India. Of these, the 
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) commands a 
32.2% market share based on retail weighted received 
premium in FY2024. The top 5 private life insurance 
companies together account for another 46.1% share of 
the total market.

THE INDIA OPPORTUNITY
Strong economic growth, increasing disposable 
incomes coupled with India’s demographic 
factors such as a growing middle class, young 
insurable population and growing awareness of 
the need for protection and retirement planning 
supports the growth of India’s insurance sector. 
The insurance opportunity in India can be divided 
into four key segments, as below: 
•	Savings: The savings market is estimated 
to provide a steady growth opportunity, 
considering 
the 
under-penetration 
of 
life 
insurance in India at 3.0% of its GDP for 
FY2023, 
favourable 
demography, 
rising 
affluence, projected economic growth and the 
increasing allocation of life insurance in total 
household savings.
•	Protection: 
With 
a 
protection 
gap 
of 
USD 16.5 trillion, India is lagging significantly 
behind the other more developed Asian 
economies. India’s sum assured to GDP ratio 
is significantly lower than the rest of the world, 
presenting a strong multi-decade growth 
opportunity in the protection segment.
•	Retirement: India’s pension market is one of 
the lowest penetrated in the world at 6.5% of 
GDP5 in FY2023. Additionally, with an increase 
in life expectancy, the post-retirement period 
is becoming longer. Given that the annuity 
product can be offered only by life insurance 
companies, this offers a significant business 
opportunity for the life insurance industry.
•	Health: While there is significant opportunity in 
the health segment, life insurers currently limit 
their participation in the health market, which is 
primarily around critical illness riders on account 
of regulations. If permitted by regulators, health 
can become one of the key growth drivers for 
India’s life insurance industry.
For more details on opportunities envisaged 
by the Company, please refer to the section 
“Opportunities and Threats” under Management

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Risks & Opportunities
Regulatory compliance and alignment with emerging risk management practices are 
the Company’s key strategic imperatives, and form a key element of the business. 
Managed acceptance of risk is essential to protect the stakeholders from potential risks and 
generate adequate shareholder value. 
HOW THE COMPANY MANAGES RISKS
The Company’s risk management model comprises a 
four-stage continuous cycle, namely the identification 
and assessment, measurement, monitoring, and control 
of risks.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK
The risks faced by the Company are classified into market, 
credit, liquidity, insurance, operational and reputation. In 
addition to these risks, the life insurance industry faces a 
number of emerging risks. There are also emerging risks 
related to ESG (environmental, social and governance) 
issues.
IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS
The Company conducted stress testing of the Company’s 
assets and liabilities to identify the impact on solvency, 
statutory profits, available economic capital, and 
liquidity position.
•	 During the year, periodic stress testing of the solvency 
position has demonstrated that there is no capital 
requirement even in further stresses
•	 Reverse stress testing and liquidity stress testing 
exercises have also demonstrated the Company’s 
resilience to scenarios which are extreme, but plausible
•	 The solvency ratio stood strong at 191.8% at March 31, 
2024, well above the regulatory requirement of 150%
•	 Solvency ratio on an internal economic capital basis 
was also robust at 411% as on December 31, 2023
MITIGATING ACTIONS
•	 During the year, the Company reviewed its balance 
sheet exposure and took actions to reduce the 
sensitivity to economic shocks, including placing 
hedges 
to 
further 
improve 
the 
resilience 
of 
the Company’s balance sheet
•	 The Company uses forward rate agreements and 
Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal 
Securities (STRIPS) to hedge the interest rate risk of 
the Company’s non-par guaranteed savings portfolio 
as well as the annuity portfolio
Key opportunities
•	 The mortality protection gap for India 
continues to provide significant opportunities 
to increase the penetration of the Company’s 
protection business
•	 An ageing population and an increase 
in 
average 
life 
expectancy 
offers 
opportunities for life insurers to expand their 
annuity business
•	 Based on the vision of “Insurance for all by 
2047” articulated by the insurance regulator, 
which means that by the year 2047, the 
centenary year of India’s independence, 
every citizen should have a life cover, health 
cover and old age security, several measures 
have been taken by the regulator. This is 
being done with a clear focus of increasing 
insurance penetration in India and the ease 
of doing insurance business. The Company 
expects these measures to have a pronounced 
impact on the growth of the industry
CAPITALS IMPACTED:
The 
current 
geo-political 
environment, 
changes 
in regulatory and tax regime, and the competitive 
landscape can potentially impede the business growth 
and profitability, which in turn can have an impact on the 
Company’s financial capital.

Risk Management Framework
The risk management framework sets out the risks that the Company is prepared to accept, given the expected 
rewards and consistency with strategic objectives, and the risks for which the Company has no tolerance and wants 
to avoid. The framework is designed to support risk-based decision-making and sets out limits and controls to ensure 
that the Company’s risk exposures remain within its risk appetite.
RISK LANDSCAPE
The key risks that the 
Company is exposed to 
can be broadly categorised 
into the following:
First line of defence: 
Risk taking and management
Second line of defence: 
Risk control and oversight
Third line of defence: 
Independent assurance
•	 Business functions 
that manage risks
•	 Responsible for identifying 
risks and maintaining 
effective internal controls
•	 Executing risk and control 
procedures on a daily basis
•	 Risk management function 
that facilitates and monitors 
the implementation of effective 
risk management practices by 
business functions
•	 Red Team that validates 
the effectiveness of cyber 
security controls	
•	 Defining target risk exposure, 
reporting adequate risk-related 
information throughout 
the organisation
•	 Internal and external audit 
provides the Board with 
comprehensive assurance 
based on independence 
and objectivity
•	 To ensure adequacy of risk 
controls and appropriate 
risk governance
THREE LINES OF DEFENCE - 
RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK MODEL
	
Market risk
The risk arising out of 
variations in the level or 
volatility of the market prices of 
assets, liabilities and financial 
instruments, including the risk 
arising from any mismatch 
between assets and liabilities, 
owing to external market and 
economic factors.
Credit risk
The risk arising out of 
partial default, full default 
or delayed payments from 
counter-parties.
Liquidity risk 
The risk that the Company, 
though solvent, either does 
not have sufficient financial 
resources to enable it to meet 
its obligations as they fall due, 
or can secure them only at 
excessive cost.
Insurance risk
The risk arising because 
of mis-estimation of the 
best estimate or because 
of random fluctuations 
in the frequency, size 
and timing of insurance 
liabilities. This includes 
mortality, morbidity and 
longevity risk, persistency 
risk and expense risk.
Operational risk
Risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and 
systems, or from external 
events. This includes 
legal, fraud, compliance, 
customer, outsourcing, 
information and cyber 
security and business 
continuity risk.
Reputation risk
The risk of potential 
or actual damage 
to the Company’s 
image which may 
impair the Company’s 
profitability 
and/or business 
sustainability.
Strategic risk
The risks to the 
Company’s business 
plan due to changes 
in various factors such 
as macro-economic 
factors, government 
policies, regulatory 
environment and 
the tax regime.

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY RISKS
Sustainability risks, particularly ESG (environmental, 
social and governance) related issues continue to 
increase in significance for the life insurance industry. 
Failure to mitigate climate change is widely seen as 
the top long-term global risk faced by the world today. 
For the life insurance industry, climate change could 
potentially have wide ranging implications, including but 
not limited to, adverse impact on economic growth and 
investment markets, higher than expected claims due to 
increased risk of future weather-related catastrophes, 
pandemics as well as possible changes in long-term 
mortality/morbidity rates. 
Apart from climate change, there are other emerging 
risks associated with public health trends such as an 
increase in obesity-related disorders and demographic 
changes, including population urbanisation and ageing. 
Sustainability can also be impacted by issues related to 
customer experience, reputation, corporate governance, 
data security and privacy.
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance works towards developing 
an understanding of the Company’s ESG risks, including 
climate change, and being aware of industry best 
practice as it develops. The current industry consensus is 
for insurers to treat climate risk as an amplifier of existing 
risks rather than a new risk. Accordingly, sustainability 
risks including climate-related risks are integrated in 
the risk management framework and are a part of the 
Company’s Board-approved Risk Policy (“the Policy”).
The risk appetite statements, as articulated in the Policy, 
outline specific constraints that define the total level of 
risk that it is willing to accept. In particular, it also has 
an appetite statement on customer risk and a framework 
to monitor outcome with the objective of taking 
actions to deliver positive outcome. Likewise, it has an 
appetite statement on reputation risk and a framework 
to monitor various factors that could impact the 
Company’s reputation.
The Company’s corporate governance framework is 
aligned with the regulatory guidelines on corporate 
governance. The risk governance framework, which 
forms a part of the overall corporate governance 
framework, is detailed in the Policy. In addition to the 
various risk management committees whose roles and 
responsibilities are specified in the Policy, it also has 
an executive ESG Committee comprising senior leaders 
which provides oversight on ESG-related policies and 
initiatives and monitors its implementation. 
Several 
other 
elements 
of 
the 
Company’s 
risk 
management 
framework 
are 
applicable 
for 
the 
management of sustainability risks, as detailed 
in the Policy. In particular, it has a framework for 
information and cyber security as well as business 
continuity management to analyse the emerging risks 
through regular monitoring of the external and internal 
environment. The Company has set out the technology 
modernisation, employee engagement approaches, and 
process changes that are found to be effective for the 
rapidly changing environment. 
The Company has been accredited with ISO 22301:2019 
certification 
for 
Business 
Continuity 
Management 
processes and ISO 27001:2013 for Information Security 
management systems, which provide additional level of 
assurance. It also has a privacy policy to ensure protection 
of sensitive personal data or information collected. 
Further information on the Company’s approach to 
sustainability risk management has been set out in the 
section on ‘Meeting challenges from sustainability risks’ 
of the ESG Report and ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ of 
the Annual Report.

RISK OUTLOOK
A detailed review of the Company’s risk exposures 
to market, credit, liquidity, insurance, operational, 
reputation and other emerging risks, as well as the 
key control processes is set out in the ‘Enterprise Risk 
Management’ section of this Report in page 184. 
The risk assessment process is an ongoing analysis of 
the Company’s risk profile. Testing the resilience of the 
balance sheet is an essential element of this process. 
It shows how the Company’s solvency position responds 
to different risk factors. The Company’s solvency ratio 
stood strong at 191.8% at March 31, 2024, well above 
the regulatory requirement of 150%. 
With the proposed risk-based capital under discussion 
by IRDAI, the Company’s solvency ratio on an internal 
economic capital basis was robust at 411% at 
December 31, 2023. The Company has been carrying out 
stress testing of the solvency position periodically during 
the year, and these tests demonstrate that there is no 
capital requirement even in further stresses. 
Additionally, the Company continues to carry out reverse 
stress testing and liquidity stress testing exercises during 
the year and these also demonstrated the Company’s 
resilience to scenarios which are extreme, but plausible. 
During the year, the Company has reviewed the balance 
sheet exposure and taken actions to reduce the sensitivity 
to economic shocks, including placing hedges to further 
improve the resilience of the Company’s balance sheet. 
The Company makes use of forward rate agreements 
and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal 
Securities (STRIPS) to hedge the interest rate risk of the 
non-par guaranteed savings portfolio as well as the 
annuity portfolio. 
While the Company’s solvency and liquidity positions 
continue to remain strong, there are challenges, 
particularly given the current geo-political environment, 
changes in regulatory, tax regime and competitive 
landscape which could potentially impede overall 
business growth and profitability, and need to be 
monitored closely. A series of actions taken in the recent 
past, such as developing a comprehensive product suite 
to cater to all customer preferences, greater digital 
adoption, new partner acquisition and expanding the 
protection business, will keep the Company well placed 
to manage some of these uncertainties. 
As the Company moves forward, it continues to pursue 
a resilient, agile and growth-oriented strategy by 
offering suitable products and deploying appropriate risk 
management practices.

STRENGTHENING CYBER SECURITY
The Company plans to further strengthen its cyber security posture by ensuring key initiatives in 
the below areas: 
OPPORTUNITIES
The Company’s financial strength, coupled with the 
ongoing transformation, makes it resilient and allows 
it to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing 
business environment. For example, by combining 
profound customer and market understanding and 
evolving data-analytics techniques, it remains well 
positioned for growth and productivity gains. With a 
comprehensive product portfolio and a well-diversified 
distribution network, the Company’s key strategy is to 
capitalise the growing opportunities in the emerging 
environment, 
without 
compromising 
on 
the 
risk 
management approach. 
The mortality protection gap for India, which is high 
as compared to the rest of the world, continues to 
provide significant opportunities for Indian life insurance 
companies to increase the penetration of their protection 
business. Further, an ageing population and an increase 
in the average life expectancy also offers opportunities 
for life insurers to expand their annuity business. 
Given the Company’s wide distribution network and 
strong customer proposition, it is increasingly focussing 
on these product segments. 
As per the vision articulated by the regulator that by 
the year 2047, centenary year of India’s independence, 
every citizen should have life cover, health cover and 
old age security. Based on this vision, the regulatory 
authority has taken several measures with a clear focus 
of increasing insurance penetration in the country and 
the “ease of doing insurance business”. The Company 
expects these measures to have a pronounced impact on 
the growth of the industry. 
For further details on opportunities envisaged by it, 
please refer to the section “Opportunities and Threats” 
under Management Discussion and Analysis in page 166 
of this report. 
People: Helping employees 
and senior leadership 
understand the risks 
due to an ever-evolving 
landscape and their role in 
risk mitigation
Technology: Ensuring 
sufficient capacity 
and solution 
deployment to mitigate/ 
minimise cyber risk
Processes: Promoting resilience, 
periodic drills for ensuring business 
continuity and cyber security crisis 
management; Monitor, integrate, 
automate, and standardise the

PREMIUM GROWTH
The Company endeavours to grow its premium 
through the below initiatives: 
•	 Enhancing distribution: The Company has been 
continuously investing in building distribution capacity 
especially in the proprietary channel, continuous 
product and process innovation, digitalisation and 
data analytics geared to simplify the Company’s 
business operations, aimed at enhancing customer 
experience. The Company is also focussed on 
expanding 
the 
distribution 
network 
with 
the 
acquisition of new partners and investing in the 
creation of new sourcing channels. The Company will 
look to strengthen its distribution network through a 
closer mapping of distribution segments with customer 
segments and products.
•	 Growing annuity line of business: The Company 
will continue to cater to the retirement savings need 
of its customers, while managing the investment 
risks appropriately.
•	 Deepening penetration in under-served customer 
segments: The Company will continue to focus on 
broadening its customer base through initiatives 
spanning across both distribution and products. 
Progress
The Company’s Annualised Premium Equivalent (APE) 
grew by 4.7% from ` 86.40 billion in FY2023 to ` 90.46 
billion in FY2024. Within channel segments, agency 
APE grew by 15.6%, direct business APE grew by 
20.0%, bancassurance APE grew by 2.3%, partnership 
distribution APE declined by 8.1% and group APE declined

PROTECTION BUSINESS GROWTH
The Company remains focussed on expanding the 
protection business and believes it offers strong growth 
opportunities. This will be achieved by offering protection 
products across channels, penetrating the online term 
insurance market and partnering with loan providers 
to offer coverage against loans. Given the current levels 
of under-penetration, retail protection business growth 
presents a multi-decadal opportunity, while credit life and 
group term business also offer significant opportunities 
as it witnesses growth in credit and the economy.
Progress
The overall protection APE stood at ` 15.25 billion in 
FY2024 with contribution from credit life business at 
39.4%, retail protection at 31.4% and group term at 
29.2%. The retail protection business has registered 
a strong year-on-year growth of 46.6% in FY2024. 
Credit life business grew by 25.2% year-on-year, in line 
with strong credit growth in the economy, while the 
group term business declined in FY2024.

PERSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT
The Company believes persistency is probably the most 
effective indicator of the quality of sale and is a barometer 
of customer experience. This parameter tracks the 
percentage of customers renewing their policies. It has 
developed AI models which predict future persistency 
behaviour of the customer at various stages, and enable 
the Company to take appropriate interventions. It will 
continue to invest in data science and customer-centric 
analytics engine to further improve the persistency.

PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT
The Company’s productivity improvement initiatives are 
targeted at improving the cost ratios. Technology and 
process re-engineering have been at the centre of the 
Company’s efforts to drive productivity improvement. 
The Company will continue to leverage the digital 
platform to improve customer experience and efficiency 
of the Company’s service operations.
Progress
The Company’s total expenses grew by 21.6% in FY2024. 
The increase in new business commission is attributed to 
the redesign of commission structure pursuant to flexibility 
provided in IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations.

support future growth. The investments made, though 
front-ended, are necessary for delivering long-term 
sustainable growth for the Company.

savings business was 15.8%. for FY2024. The Company

VNB margin stood at 24.6%. The decline in VNB margin 
is primarily on account of the shift in underlying product 
mix towards unit-linked and participating business 
from non-participating business, decline in group term 
business and higher expense ratio for the current year. 
In FY2024, contribution of VNB from protection products 
stood at 51.4%, non-linked saving products was at

Customer Segmentation
By analysing customer and household data, the Company 
can segment the customer base into distinct groups based 
on factors such as demographics, behaviour, preferences, 
and risk profiles. This segmentation allows the Company 
to develop tailored insurance products, pricing models, 
and marketing strategies for each segment.
Risk Profiling
Machine learning models help assess individual risk 
profiles by analysing various data sources such as 
customer-provided information, claims history, credit 
scores, and external data like bureaus. By understanding 
individual risk profiles, the Company customises coverage 
options and premiums based on the specific needs and 
risk tolerance of each customer.
Personalised Pre-approved Offers
Leveraging data analytics to develop personalised 
offers (Pre-approved sum assured), taking into account 
individual risk factors and behaviour. By analysing 
historical data and applying advanced analytics 
techniques to determine the appropriate premiums for 
each customer, considering factors such as education, 
age, income, and location.
Tailored Recommendations
Deploying 
machine 
learning 
models 
to 
provide 
personalised recommendations to customers based 
on their specific needs. By analysing customer data, 
such as policy history, claims, and interaction patterns, 
the Company offers relevant add-on coverage, policy 
upgrades, or discounts that align with the customer’s 
unique circumstances. This personalised approach 
ensures that customers receive the most relevant and 
beneficial coverage, enhancing their satisfaction and 
engagement with the Company.
Predictive Analytics for Underwriting
Data analytics techniques, such as predictive modelling 
and machine learning, are applied to underwriting 
processes. By analysing a wide range of data, including 
customer demographics, historical claims data, and 
external factors, the Company can assess risks more 
accurately 
and 
make 
personalised 
underwriting 
decisions in real-time. This helps in a significant reduction 
in the time it takes to underwrite a policy. Customers can 
thus enjoy quicker approvals and faster access to their 
life insurance policies.
Enhanced Customer Service
Data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) 
help the Company understand customer preferences, 
past interactions, and sentiment analysis from customer 
feedback or social media. This information is utilised 
to personalise customer service interactions, improve 
response times, reduce escalations, and enable the 
Company to tailor communications and offers to each 
customer’s specific needs, making interactions more 
relevant and engaging. Personalised service enhances 
customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Enhanced Claims Experience
Utilising artificial intelligence to assist in the initial 
assessment of claims by processing documents, images, 
and other evidence submitted by claimants. Data analytics 
allow the Company to evaluate the validity of claims 
quickly, reducing processing time, and improving the 
customer experience. For customers, this means faster 
and more efficient claims processing, reducing the stress 
and financial burden during critical times.
Customer Retention and Engagement
Predictive models identify customers at risk of lapsing 
their policies right from the prospecting stage, post-login 
stage, renewal stage, and deep lapse stage. By analysing 
factors such as customer profile, demographics, 
payment history, engagement levels, and understanding 
individual preferences and behaviours, the Company 
enables tailored communications, policy options, and 
offers to each customer, making them feel valued 
and understood. Using data analytics, the Company 
proactively reaches out with retention strategies, such 
as personalised reminders or special offers, before a 
customer decides to leave.

Developing and building talent from within and offering 
a long-term career constitutes the essence of the 
Company’s employment proposition. The Company 
actively focusses on building a strong bench of internal 
successors at all levels, and this gives a rich source of 
tacit knowledge, experience and alignment of the culture

multi-generational workforce uniquely positioned for 
successful execution of the business strategy.

strong foundation for my professional journey.”

onboarding process. The Sales Management 
Academy - New Manager Induction (NMI) 
programme gave me an in-depth understanding 
and 
clarity 
about

product 
bouquet, 
processes and right selling skills & practices.”

The employee capacity strategy is enabled through an 
end-to-end digital recruitment and onboarding process. 
The Company uses a diversified sourcing strategy for 
lateral hiring including partnerships with intermediaries 
such as recruitment process outsourcing partners 
and recruitment consultants through the Company’s 
in-house applicant tracking system (ATS) – iSmarthire. 
The Company actively encourages employees to 
advocate the employer brand and refer those in their 
network through the Company’s employee referral 
programme enabled through “Talent@Hunt” portal. 
In FY2024, referrals constituted 21% of the total sourcing 
mix. To tap into the internal talent pool for open positions, 
the Company has revamped and strengthened the 
Internal Job Posting (IJP) communication framework 
through the IJP portal. 
With the primary objective of ‘standardised recruitment 
journey for all’, the Company has revamped the 
Company career website. The website acts as a pivotal 
step to give a realistic job preview through a video job 
description and critical to quality profile markers for 
potential employees. In FY2024, close to 7% of total 
employees hired were sourced from the career website 
and other digital media.
The Company offers a 100% paperless onboarding 
experience to candidates through the in-house ATS- 
iSmarthire, and continuously strives to create a superior 
candidate 
experience 
through 
efficient 
processes 
that 
simplify 
recruitment 
and 
onboarding 
using 
technology enablers. 
“Reimagine Talent Acquisition” – a project aimed to 
relook at the recruitment and onboarding experience 
was launched in FY2024, which evaluated around 180 
process steps with solutions proposed through over 
30 improvement areas. In an effort towards increasing 
speed and seamless access, areas have been identified 
to leverage external digital infrastructure, automate 
existing processes, simplify candidate and employee 
transactions, eliminate redundancies in processes, 
standardise menus, enable auto population of fields, 
wherever possible, and reduce the need for manual 
scrutiny. The aim is also to build stronger data analytics 
and reporting capabilities throughout the system.

Performance management and  
succession planning 
The Company has an established performance and 
talent management framework. The objectives of the 
framework are threefold: 
a.	To ensure alignment to the Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) of the Company as set out by the Board and 
ensure clarity of purpose across levels
b.	 To create a talent pipeline by nurturing high 
potential talent and 
c.	 To enable differentiated rewards and capability 
development to help ringfence talent for the future.
The 
Company 
has 
a 
structured 
Performance 
Management System (PMS) anchored on the principles 
of Fairness and Meritocracy. It enables clarity of goals 
and alignment between KPIs of the Company as set 
out by the Board and individual KPIs. Alignment to the 
Company’s strategy and KPIs is cascaded through the 
Management Committee comprising the Managing 
Director & CEO and the team reporting to him. 
The Company enables a meritocratic culture through 
relative assessment of performance and reinforcing 
performance accountability and linkage to rule-based 
rewards. Employees in frontline sales and sales 
management 
roles 
can 
track 
their 
performance 
in real-time against their individual KPIs through 
performance 
dashboards. 
These 
dashboards 
are 
available on the PMS microsite of the Company. 
With an objective to review business quality, integrated 
dashboards and forums for right-selling practices have 
been constituted for the sales teams. This helps segment 
employees in top, middle and bottom cohorts within their 
roles – frontline sales, first line managers, managers of 
managers – and development actions are taken based 
on their performance cohort.
The Company has a well-defined succession planning 
process to facilitate the development and career 
planning of high potential talent, mitigate vacancy risk 
arising from attrition and ensure business continuity. 
A framework is in place for identifying key roles and 
measuring the depth of leadership cover for each role by 
identifying successors who can move to the role either 
immediately or over a period, or by restructuring the role 
to mitigate vacancy risk and ensure business continuity, 
where successors are not immediately available to fill the 
vacancy. Based on the number of successors identified, 
their readiness to move to the next level role and the 
feasibility of conducting restructuring in the event of 
the role holder’s exit, a score called the Leadership 
Cover Index (LCI) is derived for each key role. An annual 
exercise is carried out to identify the LCI for each key role 
along with the talent development actions.
#3 FOSTERING ALIGNMENT FOR GROWTH 
To strengthen alignment at the leadership level, 
the Leadership Anchors articulating the expected 
behaviours from the leadership team to enable 
movement from the current state to the desired state, 
have been launched in FY2024. The Leadership Anchors 
cover behaviours under the three categories of:
i.	 Leadership 
Excellence, 
i.e. 
behaviours 
around 
personal and professional conduct and the dimension 
of people leadership
ii.	 Execution Excellence, i.e. behaviours necessary for 
delivering current and future results and the dimensions 
of problem-solving and decision-making, and
iii.	Derailers, i.e. contra-behaviours or undesirable 
behaviours that detract from performance.
In addition to creating awareness around the Leadership 
Anchors, feedback had been enabled between managers 
and team members in the leadership team through a 
survey followed by a feedback report.
At other levels in the organisation, the Company has a 
multi-pronged approach to build an engaged and agile 
workforce, which includes initiatives to:
•	 Drive alignment
•	 Listen and amplify ground realities
•	 Emphasise right behaviours
•	 Encourage employee well-being
•	 Promote diversity & inclusion
•	 Celebrate people

organisation, and inclusion of Persons with Disabilities 
(PwD) and LGBTQs as part of the workforce. 
The principles of Fairness and Meritocracy, also one of the 
key cornerstones of the Company, are always upheld, to 
ensure no single employee cohort is unfairly advantaged 
or disadvantaged. 
The narrative of diverse thoughts, perspectives and ideas 
is recognised as foundational to promoting a culture of 
creativity and innovation within the organisation, and 
accordingly, the Company has expanded its D&I priority 
areas to include the same.
The Company’s D&I programme is anchored upon the four pillars of the ABCD framework.
a.	
Attract Diverse Talent: The objective of this 
pillar is to augment access to diverse talent pools 
through the Company’s talent acquisition sources. 
The Company strives to maintain a balanced 
gender representation in campus recruitment for 
all entry-level roles both at frontline sales and 
across all functions and professional qualifications. 
For onboarding of experienced talent pool, the 
Company’s recruitment partners are encouraged 
to source profiles with a balanced mix of gender 
representation. In FY2024, overall women hiring in 
the organisation was 32%. 
b.	
Enhance Belongingness & Inclusion: The Company 
strives to enhance a sense of belongingness 
and 
inclusion 
at 
the 
workplace, 
through 
enabling policies, awareness and sensitisation 
programmes, and employee-related processes. 
Besides implementing policies to support the 
lifestage needs of women employees, the Company 
has amended its policies for gender-agnostic 
references, expanded the definition of spouse to 
include same-sex partners and moved away from 
gender stereotype benefits to extending role-
based benefits. Accordingly, spousal benefits have 
been extended to same-sex partners for policies 
like Mediclaim cover and primary caregivers were 
included for receiving benefits related to crèche 
facility, childcare while on domestic business 
travel, and leave for adoption/surrogacy.
	
A key module around understanding and reframing 
unconscious biases has been added to the 
Company’s managerial development programme. 
This sensitisation helps managers be aware of 
their own biases and helps them manage the same, 
thereby minimising biases in workplace decisions 
and leading to a more inclusive culture. In FY2024, 
850+ managers have been covered through 
these programmes.

attitude towards different types of disabilities and 
encourage conversations around them. During this 
walkathon, each employee was paired with a 
person with disability participant for a short walk. 
The pair had free flowing conversations with 
each other, thereby creating greater awareness

NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES
In the endeavour to simplify the onboarding journey 
for customers and partners, multiple new initiatives 
were introduced. In accordance with the organisation’s 
strategy, 
focus 
was 
maintained 
on 
leveraging 
technology and data analytics. For this, various business 
models were implemented to ascertain risk and forecast 
customer propensity to pay, which led to reduction in 
frauds and an improved customer experience. 
Some of the digital initiatives are listed below:
Same-day issuance:
To 
enhance 
customer 
experience 
and 
improve 
productivity, same-day issuance for savings policies was 
initiated. Process reengineering and digital initiatives 
such as introduction of eKYC and income estimation 
were implemented. This helped achieve 51% same-day 
issuance of saving policies in March 2024. In adVdition 
to enhancing customer experience, same-day issuance 
of policies also aids in improving sales productivity. 
To encourage the advisors to adopt new digital 
initiatives, the Company also introduced same-day 
commission payment.
Digital KYC:
To enable hassle-free, paperless, pre-filled application 
journey, digital authentication services like Central Know 
Your Customer (CKYC) and Electronic Know Your Customer 
(eKYC - Aadhaar) were initiated. These eliminate 
the need for collecting physical documents from the 
customers. It also enables customers to digitally 
authenticate their identity by using PAN, mobile number, 
and date of birth. Based on customer consent, details are 
fetched from government portals and pre-populated in 
the application form. This facility has been extensively 
utilised by customers and distributors. Nearly 86% of the 
new business applications were logged in March 2024 
through the digital KYC option. 
Income estimation using digital enablers:
During 
the 
onboarding 
process, 
various 
income 
requirements are triggered based on customer profile 
(salaried/self-employed). Multiple avenues for digital 
authentication of customers income, using enablers such 
as Vahan, Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), 
Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), 
Account Aggregator and Perfios have been introduced. 
These enablers provide multiple options to digitally 
submit income proofs for both salaried and non-salaried 
customers and empower the Company to accurately 
ascertain their income for financial underwriting.

deducted and is done by entering the Universal Account

module for sales is also being incorporated. A dedicated 
service helpline has been introduced called ‘We Serve’ 
for sales teams and advisors. This facility provides real 
time information and quick resolution over call to sales 
teams and advisors. 
With the aim of providing enhanced services to the 
Titanium Eternal (TTET) advisors, an Elite Protect Team 
was introduced. This team is aligned to manage all

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Company 
has started encouraging customers and partners to opt 
for digital policy kits instead of physical policy kits. It has 
also given preference to digital communication modes for 
all service-related communication. Awareness campaigns 
were carried out to educate customers and partners 
on the benefits of opting for digital kits. This resulted 
not only in reduced cost, it also helped in saving paper, 
water and carbon footprint. Since the introduction of this 
initiative, a total of 6,652,121 pages were saved, leading 
to saving of almost 798 trees, 3,595,741 gallons of water, 
and 399,127 kg of carbon footprint.

Claims:
Claims is the moment of truth for the Company, and as a 
Customer-First organisation, it has been delivering on the 
promises made to the customers. The Company has taken 
multiple initiatives to provide ease and convenience to 
claimants such as doorstep document pickup service for 
submission of claim and related documents and enabled 
digital claim submission. It has also implemented a 
robust communication framework to inform claimants at 
all milestones. Additionally, to manage claimant anxiety, 
real-time tracking of claim status is made available

(FAQs) for customers on the Mobile App and website to 
resolve all their queries related to claims.

models to analyse customer behaviour, preferences and 
needs to provide a personalised experience. Also, these 
models are enabling identification of policies where 
additional diligence at onboarding is needed. It also 
helps identify policies having potential risk of early 
claims and bolster the risk management processes, thus 
streamlining the claim experience.

pre-populating 
data 
and 
eliminating KYC requirements. Additionally, for income

pre-approved offers for term, savings, and annuity 
lines of business by using analytics and providing a 
differentiated journey.

a de-dup logic to calculate the total sum assured, total 
savings sum assured, and total protection sum assured 
calculations for better financial and risk profiling of

risk 
checks.

What this Capital implies
Natural Capital represents one of the Company’s six 
capitals on which the business runs and entails the 
renewable and non-renewable natural resources. 
The Company’s efforts are channelled at promoting 
sustainable growth and development, with a focus 
on reducing energy consumption, and treating and 
recycling waste as effectively as possible.
Due to the nature of ICICI Prudential Life 
Insurance’s business, the direct impact of the 
Company’s operations on the environment is 
minimal. However, it uses all the natural resources 
(energy, water, and paper) optimally in the 
internal operations to minimise the Company’s 
carbon footprint. With the aim of demonstrating 
the Company’s commitment to environmental 
protection and reduction of carbon footprint, it has 
formulated an Environment Policy.
As a financial services company, the Company’s 
initiatives are grounded in its core ethos of 
responsible consumption and recycling, wherever 
possible. The Company operates 470 offices 
in India, which includes the headquarters and 
two Back Offices. To further reduce the carbon 
footprint, the Company has transitioned to green 
energy in majority of its offices in Maharashtra and 
will keep exploring opportunities of deployment of 
green energy in other states, wherever feasible.
During FY2024, the Company was able to reduce 
carbon footprint within its operations. The carbon 
emission per FTE (full time employee) remained 
same in FY2023 and FY2024 at 0.71. However, the 
carbon emission per FTE (full time employee) for 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 decreased from 0.36 to 0.34.
The Company continued to take concerted efforts to 
further reduce its carbon footprint, going forward. 
The Company identified carbon reduction targets 
to be achieved by year 2030 through adoption of 
Science Based Target Initiatives. Scope 1, Scope 2 
and partial Scope 3 carbon emissions have been 
calculated and vetted by an external Sustainability 
Consultant, and are also independently verified by 
the assurance partner. The Company also aims at 
increasing awareness among the employees with 
regards to its sustainability initiatives. 
Strategic 
measures
•	 Engaged an external sustainability consultant to 
guide and estimate total emissions under Scope 1, 
Scope 2 and relevant Scope 3 heads
•	 Limited 
assurance 
verification 
on 
Greenhouse 
Gas Inventory for FY2023 as per ISO 14064-3 
conducted by 3rd party sustainability consultant and 
certification obtained
Water 
Initiatives 
•	 Conventional water-based urinals in offices are 
being 
converted 
phase-wise 
to 
sensor-based/
water-less urinals
•	 Most branches have a dual flush mechanism installed 
to optimise water utilisation
•	 New 
offices 
and 
branches

replaced with water-efficient appliances (aerator 
taps/sensor-based taps)
•	 Sewage 
treatment 
plant

•	 Re-utilisation of wastewater from RO/AC drain in 
select offices for branch cleaning purpose
Energy efficiency 
measures 
•	 Engaged in the adoption of renewable energy 
to minimise harmful emissions and protect the 
environment. The Company took a strategic leap in its 
renewable energy journey with adoption of green tariff 
from electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) in 
Maharashtra. Presently, 44 offices in Maharashtra 
relate to green energy which helped the organisation 
reduce its electricity carbon footprint by 1,884 tCO2e

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
For the detailed ESG Report, refer to ESG Report FY2024 under the Investor Relations section on 
the Company’s website.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) PRIORITIES
Sustainability is intrinsic for the protection and long-term saving needs of the 
Company’s customers with sensitivity. Having initiated its ESG journey in 2020, 
the Company has come a long way today and has cemented its position as the 
highest-ranked ESG company in the Indian insurance industry.
Within the current social security framework prevalent 
in India, life insurance forms a key cornerstone for 
the nation’s citizens. The Company’s uniqueness as a 
financial planning tool shields families with a financial 
safety net and facilitates them in achieving its long-term 
financial goals.
The Company is committed to integrating sustainability 
with its business processes and as a way of doing 
business. Today, the Company is already aligned with 
one of the best ESG practices by opting to bring its overall 
sustainability framework under the Board’s purview. 
It is doing this by amending the terms of reference of 
the Board Corporate Social Responsibility Committee 
and renaming it as ‘Board Sustainability and Corporate 
Social Responsibility Committee’.

Report of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company 
Limited (the Company) with the audited statement of 
accounts for the year ended March 31, 2024 (FY2024).
PERFORMANCE
Industry in FY2024
During FY2024, the global economy was confronted 
with another bout of geopolitical conflict in the Middle 
East. As a consequence, rising inflation and increased 
interest rates exerted pressure on the cost of living in 
several economies, including those of advanced nations. 
Despite these challenges, the Indian economy remained 
resilient, bolstered by strong domestic demand, robust 
manufacturing and healthy investments. 
India reported a strong Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1 
growth of 8.2% in Q1-FY2024, accompanied by a 
8.5% growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)2. 
This growth trend persisted in Q2-FY2024, with a growth 
rate of 8.1%, which was supported by a 11.6% increase 
in GFCF. In Q3-FY2024, GFCF growth rate further surged 
to 10.6%, which drove the GDP growth rate to 8.4%, 
while private consumption showed modest growth in 
all quarters. Advanced estimates suggest that GDP3 
is expected to attain a robust growth rate of 7.6% in 
FY2024, up from 7.0% in FY2023. 
The size of the Indian life insurance sector was ` 7,825.04 
billion on a total premium4 basis in FY2023 as compared 
to ` 6,926.14 billion in FY2022, growth of 13.0% year-
on-year. The new business Retail Weighted Received 
Premium (RWRP) for the overall industry increased by 
4.8% from `1,039.56 billion in FY2023 to `1,089.75 billion 
in FY2024. The market share of private players increased 
from 65.8% in FY2023 to 67.8% FY2024.

ratio5 was 99.77% for FY2024. The average time taken for 
settlement of non-investigated retail death claims stood at 
1.27 days in FY2024. The grievance ratio was 58 per 
10,000 new individual business policies issued for FY2024. 
The 13th month persistency ratio6 was 89.0% for FY2024.

growth, Persistency improvement and Productivity 
enhancement, while keeping customer centricity at the 
core. The Company continues to integrate aspects of 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) into the 
management of the business as well. The Company 
has a 4D framework that includes ‘Data analytics’, 
‘Diversified propositions’, ‘Digitalisation’ and ‘Depth in 
Partnerships’ which drives the 4P strategy in order to 
make sure the Company stays true to the philosophy and 
improves performance across all 4P strategic elements.

country, a facilitative regulatory regime and coupled with 
the objective to grow absolute VNB.

The Company endeavors to grow premium through: 
•	
Enhancing distribution: The Company has been 
continuously investing in building distribution 
capacity especially in the proprietary channel, 
continuous 
product 
& 
process 
innovation, 
digitalisation and data analytics geared to simplify 
the business operations, aimed at enhancing 
customer experience. The Company is also focused 
on expanding the distribution network through the 
acquisition of new partners as well investing in 
creation of new sourcing channels. The Company 
will look to strengthen its distribution network 
through a closer mapping of distribution segments 
with customer segments and products.
•	
Growing annuity line of business: The Company 
would continue to cater to the retirement savings 
needs of customers while managing the investment 
risk appropriately.
•	
Deepening penetration in underserved customer 
segments: The Company will continue to focus on 
broadening the customer base through initiatives 
spanning across both distribution and products.

APE grew by 88.0%, linked business APE grew by 26.1%, 
retail protection APE grew by 46.6% & group funds APE 
grew by 4.6% in FY2024.
Protection business growth: 
The Company has been focused on expanding the 
protection business & believes it offers strong growth 
opportunities. This would be done by offering protection 
products across channels, penetrating the online term 
insurance market and partnering with loan providers 
to offer coverage against loans. Given the current 
levels of under-penetration, retail protection business 
growth presents a multi-decadal opportunity, while 
credit life and group term business also offer significant 
opportunities as the Company witness growth in credit 
and the economy.
The overall protection APE stood at ` 15.25 billion in 
FY2024 with contribution from credit life business at 
39.4%, retail protection at 31.4% and group term at

year in FY2024 in line with the strong credit growth 
in the economy while the group term business has 
declined in FY2024.

The Company believes persistency is probably the 
most effective indicator of the quality of sales and is a 
barometer of customer experience. This parameter tracks 
the percentage of customers renewing their policies. 
The Company has developed AI models which predict 
future persistency behavior of the customer at various 
stages, and these enable them to take appropriate 
interventions. The Company will continue to invest in 
data science & customer-centric analytics engines to 
further improve the persistency.
The 13th month persistency ratio improved by 240 basis 
points to 89.0% in FY2024. Similarly, the 49th month 
persistency ratio also improved by 430 basis points to 
68.5% in FY2024.
Productivity enhancement: 
The productivity improvement initiatives are targeted 
at improving cost ratios. Technology and process re-
engineering have been at the center of the efforts to drive 
productivity improvement. The Company would continue 
to leverage the digital platform to improve customer 
experience and efficiency of the service operations.
The total expenses grew by 21.6% for FY2024. 
The increase in new business commission is attributed 
to the redesign of commission structure pursuant to the 
flexibility provided in IRDAI (Payment of Commission) 
Regulations. Additionally, the Company has been 
investing in capacity creation to support future growth. 
The investments made, though front ended, are necessary 
to deliver long-term sustainable growth for the Company.

(TWRP) stood at 24.0% and the cost to TWRP ratio for 
the savings business at 15.8% for FY2024. The Company

Outlook for the industry and the Company
The Indian life insurance sector stands as the fourth largest 
in Asia10 and is on course to be the sixth largest market 
in the world by 203211 . The total life insurance premiums 
grew from ` 500.94 billion in FY200212 to ` 7,825.04 
billion in FY202313 (14.0% CAGR14). Additionally, new 
business premiums (retail weighted received premium)15 
have risen from ` 116.00 billion in FY2002 to ` 1,039.66 
billion in FY2023 (11.0% CAGR). This growth can be 
attributed to initiatives promoting financial inclusion, 
rapid digitalization of financial services driven by high 
internet penetration, increased disposable income in 
the middle class, growing awareness of retirement 
planning and long-term savings. The life insurance 
penetration, measured as a percentage of GDP, has 
increased from 2.1% in FY200216 to 3.0% in FY202317. 
Despite substantial growth in the life insurance industry, 
significant opportunities exist for further expansion 
to enhance insurance penetration and improve the 
insurance density of the country. A supportive regulatory 
environment along with India’s demographic factors

structure that segregates duties among business 
groups, thereby, ensuring orderly and efficient

recommendations is actively monitored. A compliance 
certificate signed by the Managing Director & CEO, based 
on the certification from respective functional heads, is 
placed at the Board Audit Committee and Board of 
Directors meetings on a quarterly basis.
Risk management
The Company recognises that risk is an integral element 
of the business and managed acceptance of risk is 
essential for generating shareholder value. 
The risk governance structure of the Company consists 
of the Board, the Board Risk Management Committee 
(BRMC), the Product Management Committee (PMC), 
the Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and its supporting 
committees. The risk philosophy of the Company is 
outlined in the Board approved risk policy which is 
reviewed by the Board at least annually. The Board risk 
policy details identification, measurement, monitoring 
and control standards relating to various individual 
risks, namely investment (market, credit and liquidity), 
insurance, operational (including fraud, legal, compliance, 
outsourcing, customer dissonance, business continuity, 
information and cyber security) and reputation. The Board 
periodically reviews the potential impact of strategic risks 
such as changes in macro-economic factors, government 
policies, regulatory environment and tax regime on the 
business plan of the Company. 
In addition to these risks, the life insurance industry 
faces a number of emerging risks. Geo-political tensions 
and the potential for disruption to energy supplies are 
an additional source of uncertainty for financial and 
commodity markets and a trigger for inflation (which could 
impact credit quality of counterparties, as well as reduce 
real wages thereby impacting discretionary savings, 
insurance new business and persistency risk). There are 
also emerging risks related to ESG (environmental, social 
and governance) issues. One of the most prominent ESG 
risks is that of climate change which could potentially 
have wide-ranging implications including (but not 
limited to) adverse impact on economic growth and 
investment markets and higher than expected claims due 
to increased risk of future weather-related catastrophes, 
pandemics as well as possible changes in long-term 
mortality/morbidity rates. Apart from climate change, 
there are emerging risks associated with public health 
trends such as increase in obesity related disorders and 
demographic changes such as population urbanisation 
and ageing. Other important ESG elements include data 
privacy which has an increasing material impact on 
Company’s reputation.
The risk management framework of the Company seeks 
to identify, measure and control its exposures to all 
these risks within its overall risk appetite. The Company 
periodically carries out stress testing of its assets and 
liabilities to identify impact on regulatory and economic 
solvency, 
statutory 
profits 
and 
liquidity 
position. 
Such testing is used as an aid in identifying significant 
existing or emerging risks to its financial position, 
including the potential impact of severe economic 
shocks and catastrophic events like pandemics, 
which could materialize as a consequence of several 
risk factors including climate change and other 
sustainability risks. The Company has a framework 
for information and cyber security as well as business 
continuity management to analyse emerging risks 
through regular monitoring of the external and internal 
environment which has been further augmented in 
the current situation. The Company also has a privacy 
policy to ensure protection of sensitive personal data 
or information collected. The Company has updated 
the Board risk policy by integrating sustainability risks 
in the risk management framework. The key aspects of 
the Company’s risk management framework have been 
outlined below. Further information on the Company’s 
approach to risk management is available in the 
sections on ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ and ‘Risks 
and Opportunities’ of this Annual Report.
1.1.	 Investment risk
Investment risk is the risk arising out of variations in the 
level or volatility of market prices of assets and financial 
instruments, including the risk arising from any mismatch 
between assets and liabilities, due to external market and 
economic factors. The Company faces limited liquidity 
risk due to the nature of its liabilities. The key mitigation 
approaches for this risk are as follows:
(a)	 Product approval process: Launching new products 
can significantly alter the risk profile of the 
Company’s Balance Sheet. Investment risks inherent 
in new products or significant modifications to 
existing products are identified at the product design 
stage and products are launched only after approval 
by the ERC and the PMC. 
(b)	 Asset Liability Management (ALM): The Company 
has detailed Investment Specifications that govern 
the investment strategy and limits for each fund 
depending on the profile of the liability backed 
by those assets. For each category of products, 
the Investment Specifications define limits to 
permissible exposures to various asset classes, 
duration guidelines for fixed income instruments and 
minimum investment in liquid assets. The Company 
uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk.
(c)	 Exposure limits have been defined for companies, 
groups and industries in accordance with regulatory 
guidelines and the Company’s internal Investment 
Policy. The Company restricts investments primarily 
to securities rated AA and above.
(d)	 The 
Company 
has 
a 
liquidity 
contingency 
plan in  place.
(e)	 As part of its ESG philosophy, the Company has 
implemented a framework for investment decisions 
that will support mitigation of risks due to climate 
change as well as other ESG risks by factoring these 
in its investment decisions.

management policy that sets out the approach 
and guidelines for management of fraud risk. 
The Company follows both a proactive and reactive 
approach to manage fraud. Proactive management

frauds 
and 
through 
random 
sample 
checks. 
Reactive management is done through incident 
management. The Company ensures implementation 
of controls to prevent recurrence of such incidents, 
financial 
recovery 
whenever 
applicable 
and 
disciplinary action against involved employees in 
accordance with the Company’s Code of Conduct. 
It also initiates actions through law enforcement 
authorities based on severity of incidents.

policy to ensure effective oversight and adequate 
due diligence with regard to outsourcing of activities.

being tested periodically. The Company has been 
accredited with the ISO 22301:2019 certification for 
the business continuity management systems.
1.2.	 Insurance Risk
Insurance risk is the risk arising because of variance to 
the best estimate or because of random fluctuations in 
the frequency, size and timing of insurance liabilities. 
Insurance risk comprises the following components: 
mortality, morbidity, persistency and expense risk. 
These risks are mitigated through the following:
(a)	 Product approval process: Insurance risks inherent 
in the new products or significant modifications 
to existing products are identified at product 
design stage and products are launched only after 
approval by the ERC and the PMC. The Company, 
in its product design, incorporates product features 
and uses appropriate policy wordings to mitigate 
insurance risk. 
(b)	 Reinsurance: 
The 
Company 
uses 
appropriate 
reinsurance arrangements, including catastrophe 
reinsurance, to manage insurance risk. Such reinsurance 
arrangements may be used to support risk transfer of 
sustainability risks as well. The arrangements are with 
select and financially sound reinsurers. The Company’s 
reinsurance exposures are considered and approved 
by the ERC periodically.
(c)	 Underwriting and claims controls: Underwriting 
and claims policies and procedures are in place to 
assess and manage mortality and morbidity risks. 
The Company seeks to minimise these risks by 
diversifying its business portfolio and adhering to 
appropriate and segmented underwriting norms. 
The Company conducts periodic reviews of both 
underwriting and claims procedures. Adjustments to 
the underwriting strategy may be made to allow 
for any changes in the insurance risk landscape or 
emerging risks.
(d)	 Experience analysis: The Company conducts its 
experience analysis regularly in order to monitor 
trends, gain insights on emerging risks, if any and 
to ensure that corrective actions can be initiated 
at the earliest opportunity and that assumptions 
used in product pricing, reserving and embedded 
value reporting are in line with the experience. 
The Company actively monitors its claims experience, 
persistency levels and expense ratios. 
(e)	 Aligning key performance indicators: The Company 
uses appropriate key performance indicators for 
different levels of hierarchy in sales and operations 
to align interests and ensure adequate focus on 
insurance risk especially, persistency and expense.
(f)	
Product contracts: The Company designs exclusions 
and terms and conditions in consultation with 
reinsurers and with due regard to market practices 
to manage insurance risk, especially mortality and 
morbidity risk. In order to deal with a changing 
insurance landscape or emerging risks, new 
products may be developed with more suitable 
product features, policy wordings, exclusions and 
terms and conditions.

Effective governance of compensation:

risks are taken into account in the remuneration 
processes.
•	
The Company follows prudent compensation 
practices under the guidance of the Board 
and the Board Nominations & Remuneration 
Committee (BNRC). The Company’s approach 
to compensation is based on the ethos of 
meritocracy and fairness within the framework 
of prudent risk management. The performance 
rating assigned to employees is based on an 
assessment of performance delivered against 
a set of defined performance objectives. 
These objectives are balanced in nature 
and comprise a holistic mix of financial, 
customer, people, process, quality, compliance 
objectives and/or any other parameters as 
may be deemed fit.
•	
For the MD & CEO, other wholetime Directors 
and KMPs/SMPs, compensation is sought to 
be aligned to both pre-defined performance 
objectives of the Company as well as prudent 
risk parameters.
•	
For the MD & CEO, other wholetime Directors 
and KMPs/SMPs, the quantum of bonus does 
not exceed a certain percentage (as stipulated 
in the Compensation Policy) of total fixed pay in 
a year; a minimum of 50% (as stipulated in the 
Compensation Policy) will be under deferment. 
If the bonus amount is under ` 25 lacs, the 
deferment shall not be applicable. The deferral 
period would be spread over a minimum period 
of three years (deferment period). The frequency 
of vesting will be on annual basis and the first 
vesting shall not be before one year from the 
commencement of deferral period. The vesting 
shall be no faster than a prorata basis. 
Additionally, vesting will not be more frequent 
than on a yearly basis.
•	
The deferred part of the variable pay 
(performance bonus and long term pay in the 
form of stock options/stock units) for wholetime 
Directors and KMPs/SMPs is subject to malus, 
under which, the Company will prevent vesting 
of all or part of the variable pay in the event 
of an enquiry determining gross negligence or 
integrity breach.
	
•	
In 
malus 
clawback 
arrangements 
with 
wholetime Directors and KMPs/SMPs, the 
employee agrees to return, in case asked for, the 
previously paid variable pay to the Company in 
the events as stated in the Compensation Policy 
including gross negligence, misconduct, integrity 
breach, deterioration in financial performance. 
	
•	
Errors of judgment shall not be construed 
to be breaches.
Description of the ways in which the Company seeks to 
link performance during a performance measurement 
period with levels of remuneration.
The Company’s approach to compensation is based 
on the ethos of meritocracy and fairness within the 
framework of prudent risk management. The extent 
of variable pay for individual employees is linked to 
individual performance for sales frontline employees and 
to individual & organisation performance for non-sales 
frontline employees & employees in the management 
cadre. For the latter, the performance rating assigned is 
based on assessment of performance delivered against 
a set of defined performance objectives. These objectives 
are balanced in nature, and comprise a holistic mix

THE ANNUAL REPORT ON CSR ACTIVITIES FOR FY2024
1.	
Brief 
outline 
on 
Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility Policy of the Company:
	
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been 
a long-standing commitment at the ICICI Group 
and forms an integral part of the Company’s 
activities. The Group’s Contribution to social 
sector development includes several pioneering 
interventions, and is implemented through the 
involvement of stakeholders within the Company, the 
Group and the broader community. ICICI Foundation 
for Inclusive Growth (ICICI Foundation) was 
established in 2008 by ICICI Bank with a view to 
significantly expand the ICICI Group’s activities 
in the area of CSR. Over the past few years ICICI 
Foundation has developed significant projects in 
specific areas, and has built capabilities for direct 
project implementation as opposed to extending 
financial support to other organizations. 
	
The Company’s objective is to proactively support 
meaningful socio-economic development in India 
and enable a larger number of people to participate 
in and benefit from India’s economic progress. 
This is based on the belief that growth and 
development are effective only when they result in 
wider access to opportunities and benefit a broader 
section of society. 
	
The CSR Policy of the Company sets the framework 
guiding the Company’s CSR activities. It outlines 
the governance structure, operating framework, 
monitoring mechanism, and CSR activities that 
would be undertaken. The Board Sustainability and 
Corporate Social Responsibility (BSCSR) Committee is 
the governing body that articulates the scope of CSR 
activities and ensures compliance with the CSR Policy. 
The Company’s CSR activities are largely focused in the 
areas of education, skill development and sustainable 
livelihoods, healthcare, financial inclusion and other 
activities as the Company may choose to select in 
fulfilling its CSR objectives. The Company supports 
programs and initiatives keeping “protection” as the 
core proposition and cornerstone of all its CSR initiatives 
as “protection” is core to the Company’s business. 
	
The 
Committee 
at 
its 
meeting 
held 
on 
October 17, 2014 had recommended the Corporate 
Social Responsibility Policy (CSR Policy) to the Board 
of the Company. The Policy indicates the activities 
to be undertaken by the Company, towards fulfilling 
its CSR objectives, in compliance with section 135 of 
the Companies Act, 2013. 
	
Further, the Committee reviews the CSR Policy 
annually or as and when required

I. INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS REPORT
1.1 Macroeconomic environment and outlook 
1.1.1 Growth and Inflation
The ongoing geopolitical conflict in the Middle East 
has had a significant impact on global economies. 
Geopolitical tensions, elevated inflation, and higher 
interest rates exerted pressure on the cost of living in 
various economies, including the advanced economies. 
However, the Indian economy has continued to display 
resilience, largely due to robust domestic demand, 
stronger manufacturing, and healthy investments.
Inflation rates across the globe have been subject 
to fluctuations in recent years. As of March FY2024, 
inflation1 in the United States had decreased to 3.5%, 
a notable drop from the peak of 9.1% witnessed in 
June 2022. Similarly, the European Union experienced 
a decline in inflation2 to 2.6% compared to the peak of 
10.6% observed in October 2022. Meanwhile, inflation3 
in India had surged to 7.4% in July 2023, before easing 
to 4.9% in March 2024. Throughout the year, inflation 
has been persistent. Even though inflation has decreased 
globally from its CY2022 highs, it is still higher above the 
comfort level set by central banks. As a result, central 
banks, including the RBI, continue to hold a tight position 
and postpone reduction of interest rates. In addition, 
they have implemented measures to tighten liquidity to 
control inflation. 
The average price of brent crude oil4 decreased to USD 
82 per barrel in FY2024, as compared to USD 95 per 
barrel in FY2023, despite OPEC+(Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia) 
supply cuts, geopolitical tensions, and the Red Sea 
crisis. The combination of increased oil output in the 
United States and weaker global demand contributed 
to maintaining crude prices largely stable. However, the 
geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains a cause 
for concern and could result in a rapid escalation in oil 
prices in the event of supply disruptions.
During the period of July-August 2023, inflation5 in 
India surpassed the tolerance band range of 6.0%. 
This was followed by a decline to an average of 5.2% until 
March 2024. The increase in vegetable prices during this 
time, a seasonal phenomenon, contributed to the upward 
pressure on headline inflation. On a positive note, core 
inflation (excluding food & fuel) price index6 remained 
consistently below 5.3% throughout the financial year 
and even decreased to as low as 3.2% in March 2024. 
Given the persistent elevation of global inflation, the 
Reserve Bank of India opted to maintain the repo rate7 at 
a high of 6.5% since February 2023. Moving forward, the 
RBI's monetary policy decisions are likely to be influenced 
by domestic inflation and growth trends, as well as the 
stance of major central banks such as Federal Bank.
In the recent years, Central Government of India has 
introduced several reforms aimed at expanding the 
manufacturing sector, including the Production-Linked 
Incentive (PLI) scheme and a recent initiative to promote 
Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing in the country. 
India has also been actively pursuing new Free Trade 
Agreements (FTAs) and has recently signed one with 
the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), comprising 
Iceland, 
Liechtenstein, 
Norway, 
and 
Switzerland. 
These measures are expected to create a favourable 
business environment for manufacturers, promote 
innovation and technology transfer, and enhance India's 
competitiveness in the global market.
The 
Government's 
efforts 
in 
developing 
robust 
infrastructure in the country have been notable. 
The capital expenditure8 has recorded an average 
annual growth rate of 30.6% during FY2021–FY2024, 
and the Government has proposed an additional 17.0% 
growth in FY2025. The allocation of capital expenditure 
is significantly high in the most productive sectors, 
including roads, railways, defence, telecom and housing. 
The Government aims to bring the fiscal deficit9 under 
control and has set a target of 5.1% and 4.5% for FY2025 
and FY2026 respectively.
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP)10 reported a strong 
growth of 8.2% in Q1-FY2024, accompanied by an 
8.5% growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)11. 
Economic growth in Q2-FY2024 remained robust 
at 8.1% year-on-year, as GFCF increased by 11.6% 
year-on-year driving the overall economic growth higher. 
In Q3-FY2024, growth in GFCF further surged to 10.6%, 
which increased GDP growth rate to 8.4%, while private 
consumption showed modest growth in all quarters. 
Advanced estimates suggest that GDP12 is expected to 
attain a robust growth rate of 7.6% in FY2024, up from 
7.0% in FY2023. Analyzing the trends in different sectors, 
the manufacturing industry witnessed a strong upturn 
in Q2-FY2024 and Q3-FY2024, while the service sector 
displayed resilience. However, the agricultural sector 
was relatively weak due to below-normal monsoons and 
discrepancies in spatial distribution.
The resilience of the Indian economy was also evidenced 
by the growth in credit. As of March 22, 2024, bank credit13 
growth stood at 16.3% year-on-year, indicating a stable 
economic activity. Industrial credit13, as of February 2024, 
recorded a growth of 9.1%, with micro and small13 
industries growing by 14.7%, medium-scale13 industries 
by 12.5%, and large industries13 by 7.1%. The India 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)14 index has exhibited 
a similar robustness and remained in the expansionary 
zone throughout FY2024. Both the manufacturing and 
services sectors contributed to this growth.

1.1.2 Financial markets
Central banks have signalled an end to rate hikes and are 
now contemplating a shift towards rate cuts, as concerns 
about inflation continue to wane. The Indian rupee has 
demonstrated remarkable resilience, emerging as one of 
the best performing currencies in recent times, with only 
a marginal depreciation of 1.4% from ` 82.2 in April 2023 
to ` 83.4 in April 2024 against dollar. 
The foreign exchange reserves15 have registered a 
notable increase of 11.7%, rising from USD 578 billion 
in March 2023 to USD 646 billion as of March 2024. 
The inclusion of India's sovereign bond in JP Morgan 
and Bloomberg Bond index, coupled with the emphasis 
on fiscal consolidation in the FY2025 interim budget, 
provides a compelling argument for a stronger rupee.
The average 10-year Government of India bond yield16 
eased to 7.1% in March 2024 from 7.4% in March 2023, 
supported by the Government's fiscal consolidation 
efforts, the Reserve Bank of India's liquidity management, 
and foreign portfolio investment inflows. In FY2024, 
major global equity markets witnessed a surge due 
to a decline in global inflation, coupled with optimism 
regarding anticipated rate cuts in the upcoming year. 
In the Indian equity market, the NIFTY 50 index17 gained 
28.6% during the same period, primarily due to robust 
domestic economic growth and strong earnings in 
Q1-FY2024. The market consolidated in Q2-FY2024 
and again rallied in Q3-FY2024 to achieve an all-time 
high, fuelled by strong domestic growth expectations, 
continued earnings momentum, and greater domestic 
and foreign participation. However, the market remained 
volatile in Q4-FY2024 due to budget and concerns 
raised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(SEBI) over mid and small cap stock valuations, but 
ultimately ended close to an all-time high. During the 
period, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)18 and Foreign 
Portfolio Investors (FPIs)18 injected around ` 2.1 trillion 
into the Indian equity market, while Domestic Institutional 
Investors (DIIs)18 invested around ` 2.1 trillion. Net Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI)19 into India in FY2024 till February 
stood at ` 1.3 trillion, a decline from ` 2.1 trillion during 
the same period in FY2023.
1.1.3 Financial savings
According to recent data, domestic savings20 in the 
Indian household sector demonstrated a 5.1% increase in 
FY2023, similar to the previous year, while its contribution 
to GDP declined to 18.4%. Moreover, gross financial 
savings21, expressed as a percentage of household 
savings, grew to 59.9% in FY2023.

1.1.4 Macroeconomic outlook
As per the Reserve Bank of India's projections, the Indian 
economy is anticipated to record a GDP growth of 7.0% 
in FY2025, supported by robust domestic demand, 
manufacturing, and investment. Furthermore, the RBI 
foresees inflation to decelerate and stabilize at an 
average of 4.5% in FY2025. The growth of exports may 
remain subdued due to the global economic slowdown. 
The services sector is expected to continue contributing 
to the country's economic growth, while the agricultural 
sector's output is expected to improve, assuming normal 
monsoon conditions and the emergence of La-Nina. 
A shift in the current bullish stance by the RBI and other 
central banks of advanced economies will bode well for 
economic growth.
1.2 Insurance industry structure and developments
The total life insurance premiums22 grew from ` 500.94 
billion in FY2002 to ` 7,825.04 billion in FY2023 (14.0% 
CAGR). Additionally, new business premiums (retail 
weighted received premium)23 grew from `116.00 billion 
in FY2002 to ` 1,089.75 billion in FY2024 (10.7% CAGR). 
As per Swiss Re, over CY2024‒CY2028, total insurance 
premiums will grow by 7.1% in real terms, well above 
the global (2.4%), emerging (5.1%) and advanced (1.7%) 
market averages. At this rate, India will have the fastest 
growing insurance sector of the G20 countries. 
The Indian life insurance industry has 26 companies 
including the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). 
LIC contributes to 32.2% of the market share & the top 
five private sector companies together have 46.1% of 
the market share.

1.2.4 Contribution of the life insurance industry
Life insurance is a critical societal requirement in India, 
particularly given the current social security structure 
available in the country. It is a one-of-a-kind financial 
planning tool that offers families a financial safety net 
while also allowing them to achieve their long-term 
financial objectives and protect their family in the 
event of unforeseen circumstances. The life insurance 
sector provides a wide range of products for long term 
wealth creation. It also provides annuities for retirement 
planning and protection plans to safeguard one from any 
unforeseen event. Thus, the life insurance sector serves 
as a risk manager by providing coverage for investment, 
longevity, mortality, and morbidity risks.
The industry has covered 247.7 million lives through 
individual policies and 467.7 million lives through group 
policies, providing a total insurance cover of ` 295.4 
trillion at March 31, 2023. The total death benefit paid 
to policyholders in FY2023 stood at ` 440.19 billion 
for the industry.
The Indian life insurance industry plays a key role in 
channelising household savings to the financial markets. 
The industry has been able to leverage its extensive 
distribution network throughout the country to provide 
long term funds to both debt and equity markets. The life 
insurance industry also provides long term capital that 
is needed for infrastructure projects. The details of 
investments made in the infrastructure sector by the 
industry are as below:

1.2.5 Regulatory updates and developments for FY2024
a)	
Policyholder 
	
The IRDAI notified a consolidated regulation on 
policyholder protection covering aspects pertaining 
to advertisement, issuance of insurance policies, 
servicing of policies, claim settlement, grievance, 
outsourcing activities, places of doing business etc. 
The regulation aims at reducing the processing time 
taken by insurers for issuance of policy and claim 
settlement. Additionally, the regulation mandates 
electronic issuance of policies. The IRDAI has 
also made amendments to the Master Circular on 
unclaimed amounts and requires a separate Board 
approved policy for the same. Further, the detailed 
operating guidelines on protection of policyholders’ 
interest are yet to be notified. 
b)	
Product
	
The IRDAI has extended the use-and-file approach 
to group life unit-linked, health, combi-insurance 
products and fund additions in unit-linked life 
insurance products. Additionally, modifications to 
withdrawn products including addition of riders, 
premium payment modes, payment frequencies for 
income benefit, reduction in interest rate for revivals/
policy loans have also been permitted under this 
approach. This has effectively enhanced speed-to-
market enabling insurers to offer products to 
address the evolving needs of customers. 
	
A new regulation on insurance products has also 
been notified consolidating six existing regulations 
including regulations pertaining to unit-linked 
insurance products, non-linked insurance products, 
health insurance, micro insurance, minimum limits 
for annuities and other benefits, and acquisition 
of surrender and paid-up values. Further, the 
requirement of filing of advertisements have been 
done away with and a board approved advertisement 
committee has been made responsible to oversee all 
the advertisements utilized by the insurers and its 
distribution channels. Additionally, insurers are also 
now permitted to offer index unit-linked and index 
linked annuity products.
	
With respect to health insurance products, the 
requirement of minimum policy tenure of one 
year and a maximum tenure of three years has 
been omitted. Further, the flexibility to review and 
modify the premium subject to the premium being 
unchanged for at least a period of every block of 
three years has also been omitted.
	
Master circular on products providing further 
operational guidelines is awaited.
c)	
Corporate Governance
	
The 
new 
Corporate 
Governance 
Regulations 
have been notified which require prior approval 
of the IRDAI for appointment of the Chairperson 
of the Board. Further, it also requires the Board to 
ensure that a Key Management Persons does not 
simultaneously hold more than one position that 
could lead to conflict of interest such as ‘business 
and control function’ or ‘two control functions’. 
The regulations further require the insurers to 
put in place a board approved Succession Plan 
and establish a comprehensive Climate Risk 
Management framework. Details with respect to 
operational aspects are expected to be notified.
d)	
Distribution
	
On the distribution front, IRDAI has increased the 
flexibility that the insurers have in managing their 
expenses of management including commissions 
paid to their agents and intermediaries vide board 
policies. While the expenses of management are 
required to be managed at an overall participating 
and non-participating product category level, the 
quantum of commissions paid may be decided 
subject to the overall allowable expenses of 
management limits. 
	
Further, in line with the vision of increasing insurance 
penetration in the country, IRDAI has notified the 
introduction of Bima Vahaks, a women centric 
dedicated distribution channel that is focused 
on enhancing insurance inclusion and creating 
awareness in every Gram Panchayat. These Bima 
Vahaks are permitted to sell Bima Vistaar product, 
a comprehensive insurance product with life, health 
and non-life benefits expected to be notified soon.
	
The IRDAI has also notified the revised obligations 
under rural and social sector based on the number of 
lives covered. This change is made, keeping in mind 
the objective of reaching the last mile and making 
insurance products accessible to every citizen. 
	
With respect to the annuity service business, 
the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development 
Authority (“PFRDA”) has issued a circular restricting 
Annuity Service Providers from deploying insurance

e)	
Digital ecosystem
	
In order to fully and efficiently utilise the digital 
ecosystems available, the IRDAI has initiated work 
on Bima Sugam, a common end-to-end platform 
for all insurance needs of the customer, wide range 
of participation from customers, insurers, agents, 
intermediaries, repositories and external databases/
ecosystem 
life 
payment 
interface, 
account 
aggregator, Central Registry of Securitisation Asset 
Reconstruction and Security Interest (“CERSAI”), 
Unique Identification Authority of India (“UIDAI”), 
government databases etc. This platform is aimed 
at being used for sales, servicing and claims 
settlement of insurance products which will be a 
welcome change in the distribution architecture. 
The incorporation of a non-profit company for this 
purpose is under process. It will have 11 founding 
members and ICICI Prudential Life is one of them.

Further, the IRDAI has also guided insurers to actively 
participate in the Account Aggregator Framework 
as Financial Information User. In addition to this, 
insurers have also been advised to capture ABHA 
number of proposers created by the National Health 
Authority, if already existing or help customers to 
create them for both new and existing customers. 
This ecosystem when utilised fully would help both 
during the underwriting and claims settlement stage.
	
Further, the Central Government has also notified 
the Digital Personal Data Protection (“DPDP”) Act to 
provide for processing of digital personal data in a 
manner that recognises both the right of individuals 
to protect their personal data and the need to 
process such personal data for lawful purposes. 
The Government further notified Prevention and 
Regulation of Dark Patterns to ensure protection of 
consumer’s interest.
f)	
Capital 
	
As a first step towards moving to a Risk Based 
Capital regime, the IRDAI had directed insurers 
to undertake a Quantitative Impact Study to 
assess the impact of the proposed framework for 
quantification of capital and solvency requirements 
following a Risk based approach. IRDAI is expected 
to undertake the next steps for further studies in this 
regard. Further, with the objective of aligning India 
with the global accounting standards, the Regulator 
has notified the phased implementation of IFRS/
Ind AS in the insurance sector. The Company has 
already implemented IFRS accounting for its foreign 
promoter and is ready to implement the same for 
India reporting whenever applicable.
g)	
Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
	
The Central Government notified amendments to 
the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance 
of Records) Rules, 2005. Further, IRDAI amended the 
Master Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering and 
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), 
2022. These amendments reduced the percentage 
of ownership of entitlement for a natural person to 
qualify as a beneficial owner for a partnership from 
fifteen to ten and provided for group-wide policies 
for sharing of information purposes of Customer Due 
Diligence (CDD) and AML/CFT risk management.
1.3	 Opportunities and Threats
1.3.1 Insurance under-penetration
The 
life 
insurance 
penetration, 
measured 
as 
a 
percentage of GDP, has increased from 2.1% in 
FY200224 to 3.0% in FY202325. At USD 70 in FY2023, 
the insurance density26 (premium per capita) in India 
remains very low as compared to global average of 
USD 354. The macroeconomic factors such as growth 
in GDP and rise in per capita income, coupled with 
India’s young and working population, higher financial 
saving as a percentage of GDP, increasing urbanisation, 
increase in digitalisation and regulatory developments 
would continue to aid the growth of the Indian life 
insurance sector.

According to the United Nations estimates, the working 
population is expected to increase by 14% by the year 
2030. With a median age of 28 years, India has a very 
young population. Both these factors are likely to fuel 
demand for life insurance products.

estimates, 
India’s

population 
is 
expected to increase by 25.7% by the year 2030.

improvement in the standard of living and provide better 
access to financial products such as life insurance.

1.3.4 Financial savings
India has a large pool of household savings and in FY2023, 
the ratio of household savings to GDP stood at 18.2%. 
The share of gross financial savings as a proportion of 
household savings was 59.9% in FY2023. The share 
of life insurance as a proportion of financial savings 
(including currency) in India was 18.0% in FY2023, 
aided by the improving customer value proposition of 
insurance products.
1.3.5 High protection gap
According to Swiss Re, the mortality protection gap for 
India is at USD 16.5 trillion which is relatively higher 
compared to the rest of the world. Protection coverage 
ratio which is the ratio between protection gap and 
protection needs is also very high for India. Sum assured 
to GDP ratio is significantly lower in India compared to the 
rest of the world. This provides a significant opportunity 
for Indian life insurance companies to address this gap 
and expand their protection business. 
Retail credit has been growing at a CAGR of 16.8% 
from FY2014 to FY2023. This provides an additional 
opportunity for the insurance industry for the credit 
life business by providing mortality and morbidity 
cover to borrowers.

1.3.6 Pension opportunity
India’s pension market is one of the lowest in the world 
with pension assets to GDP ratio at 6.5% in FY2023. 
There has been an increase in life expectancy27 for 
Indians from 70 years in FY2020 to 74 years in FY2040.
According to the NSO report 2021, India’s elderly 
population (aged 60 and above) is projected to touch 194 
million in FY2031 from 138 million in FY2021, a 41.0% 
increase over a decade. Only 23% of this population are 
either saving or planning to save for their retirement. 
This leaves 77% of Indians primarily dependent on their 
children instead of their own wealth, which is likely to 
create a significant deficit with the joint family system 
giving way to the nuclear family system. Additionally, 
with an increase in life expectancy, the post-retirement 
period for males has increased from 17 years during 
FY2000-FY2005 to 19 years in FY2012 and is further 
expected to increase to 20 years in FY2030. Given that 
the annuity product can be offered only by life insurance 
companies, it offers a significant business opportunity 
for the life insurance industry. While people may look at 
alternative ways to save for retirement, only an annuity 
product can provide a guaranteed income for life and 
hence should take priority in an individual’s retirement 
planning process.

continuously investing in building distribution 
capacity especially in the proprietary channel, 
continuous 
product 
& 
process 
innovation, 
digitalisation & data analytics geared to simplify 
the business operations, aimed at enhancing 
customer experience. The Company is also focused 
on expanding the distribution network through the 
acquisition of new partners as well investing in

will look to strengthen its distribution network 
through a closer mapping of distribution segments 
with customer segments and products.
•	
Growing annuity line of business: The Company 
would continue to cater to the retirement savings 
need of customers while managing the investment 
risk appropriately.
•	
Deepening penetration in under-served customer 
segments: The Company will continue to focus on

Protection Business Growth
The Company has been focused on expanding the 
protection business & believes it offers strong growth 
opportunities. This would be done by offering protection 
products across channels, penetrating the online term 
insurance market and partnering with loan providers 
to offer coverage against loans. Given the current 
levels of under-penetration, retail protection business 
growth presents a multi-decadal opportunity, while 
credit life and group term business also offer significant 
opportunities as the Company witness growth in credit 
and the economy.
Progress: The overall protection APE stood at ` 15.25 
billion in FY2024 with contribution from credit life 
business at 39.4%, retail protection at 31.4% and 
group term at 29.2%. The retail protection business has 
registered a strong year-on-year growth of 46.6% in 
FY2024 Credit life business has also grown by 25.2% 
year-on-year in FY2024 in line with the strong credit 
growth in the economy while the group term business 
has declined in FY2024.

Persistency Improvement
The Company believes persistency is probably the 
most effective indicator of the quality of sale and is a 
barometer of customer experience. This parameter tracks 
the percentage of customers renewing their policies. 
The Company has developed AI models which predict 
future persistency behaviour of the customer at various 
stages, and these enable them to take appropriate 
interventions. The Company will continue to invest in 
data science & customer-centric analytics engines to 
further improve the persistency.
Progress: The 13th month persistency ratio improved 
by 240 basis points to 89.0% in FY2024. Similarly, the 
49th month persistency ratio also improved by 430 basis 
points to 68.5% in FY2024.

Productivity Enhancement
The productivity improvement initiatives are targeted 
at improving cost ratios. Technology and process 
re-engineering have been at the centre of the efforts 
to drive productivity improvement. The Company 
would continue to leverage the digital platform to 
improve customer experience and efficiency of the 
service operations.
Progress: The total expenses grew by 21.6% for FY2024. 
The increase in new business commission is attributed 
to the redesign of commission structure pursuant to the 
flexibility provided in IRDAI (Payment of Commission) 
Regulations. Additionally, the Company has been 
investing in capacity creation to support future growth. 
The investments made, though front ended, are necessary 
to deliver long-term sustainable growth for the Company.
The overall cost to Total Weighted Received Premium 
(TWRP) stood at 24.0% and the cost to TWRP ratio for 
the savings business at 15.8% for FY2024. The Company 
monitors cost ratios for the savings line of business 
separately. The objective is to bring efficiency in the 
savings line of business while the Company continues to 
focus on growth in the protection business. The cost to 
average assets under management has been stable at 
2.7% for FY2024.

1.4.2 Value of New Business (VNB) 
For FY2024, Value of New Business (VNB) was ` 22.27 
billion and with an APE of ` 90.46 billion, VNB margin 
stood at 24.6%. The decline in VNB margin is primarily 
on account of the shift in underlying product mix 
towards unit-linked and participating business from 
non-participating business, decline in group term 
business and higher expense ratio for the current year. 
The contribution of FY2024 VNB from protection products 
is at 51.4%, non-linked saving products is at 36.9% and 
unit-linked products is at 11.7%.

1.4.3 Embedded Value
Embedded Value (EV) is a measure of the consolidated 
value of the Shareholders’ interest in the life insurance 
business. It is calculated as the sum of the Company’s 
adjusted net worth (ANW) and the value of in-force 
business (VIF). The VIF includes the present value of 
future profits attributable to Shareholders from the 
in-force business of the Company (which includes the new 
business written during the previous year). The calculation 
of VIF also reflects adjustments for various risks within 
the business. The Company’s EV grew by 18.8% year-on-
year from ` 356.34 billion at March 31, 2023 to ` 423.37 
billion at March 31, 2024. Value of Inforce (VIF) business 
grew by 14.5% year-on-year.

Embedded Value Operating Profit (EVOP) for FY2024 was 
` 50.17 billion in FY2024. Operating assumption change 
is a small positive ` 0.70 billion. Persistency variance is 
a negative ` 0.56 billion which is largely due to increase 
in later duration surrenders in the unit-linked portfolio 
because of equity market buoyancy. Total economic 
and investment variance is positive ` 16.91 billion due 
to shift in the yield curve and equity market movement.
1.5 Solvency
The Company’s solvency ratio at March 31, 2024 
was 191.8%, well above the regulatory minimum 
required level of 150%.
1.6 Company outlook
The life insurance industry has experienced significant 
growth over the past two decades, yet there remains 
substantial potential for further expansion and increased 
market penetration. The robust economic progress, rising 
disposable income, and favorable demographic trends 
in India, characterized by a burgeoning middle class, a 
youthful insurable population, and heightened awareness 
regarding the necessity for protection and retirement 
planning, are poised to underpin the advancement of the 
Indian insurance sector.

The large protection gap in India coupled with a low sum 
assured to GDP ratio suggests significant opportunities 
for the protection business. Retail credit growth provides 
further opportunity for the credit protect business. 
The Company expects to leverage both these trends 
to grow protection business at a rate higher than the 
savings business growth rate over a medium term. 
Customer centricity continues to be at the core of the 
strategy. The Company has worked on various building 
blocks of business with the efforts pivoted towards 
balancing growth, risk & prudence and profitability. 
The Company currently has the capability to provide 
the right product to the right customer and deliver it 
through the most appropriate channel. Going ahead, the 
Company will capitalise on the same to target untapped 
markets to expand the customer segments. 
Through various customer awareness initiatives, the 
Company expects to drive continued improvement in 
persistency and quality parameters that will ultimately 
help customers get the intended benefits from their 
policies. Additionally, data sciences, analytics and 
innovation have enabled the Company to leverage 
data and information, which helps in improving various 
processes such as distribution, operations, etc. and to 
identify new growth opportunity. The Company expects 
these initiatives to result in improving productivity. 
The Company will continue to invest in organisational 
capabilities such as People, Process, Technology & 
Analytics, Distribution & Product to ensure it delivers 
sustainable growth and profitability along with managing 
risk & prudence.
1.7 Risks and concerns
Indian life insurance industry is highly competitive with 
26 companies operating in the market. Indian consumer 
demands are changing continuously which requires 
companies to modify their offerings in alignment with 
customer needs. This poses an opportunity as well as risk 
to the industry as inability to meet the consumer demand 
would hamper the growth. 
Some of the macroeconomic and policy factors which 
could be risks for the industry are:
1)	
Higher interest rate creating stress on the global 
financial system
2)	
Slowdown in GDP and GDP per capita growth rates
3)	
Geo-political conflict worsening global economic 
and financial environment, exacerbating inflationary 
pressures globally
4)	
Global slowdown of the financial market and 
economies contributing to weakness in the Indian 
financial and economic environment
5)	
Weak credit environment and economic challenges 
leading to increased credit risk within fixed 
income portfolio
6)	
Superior return on physical savings 
7)	
Inferior fund performance in comparison to other 
savings instruments
8)	
Changes in tax rate structure for the industry 
and its products
9)	
Possibility of tax demands from the revenue 
authorities based on their interpretation of their 
findings during investigation / assessments on the 
Insurance companies
10)	 Highly coordinated cyber-attacks leading to loss of 
confidentiality and thereby causing adverse impact
The Company recognises that risk is an integral 
element of the business and controlled administration 
of risk is essential for generation of Shareholder 
value. The Company has instituted an enterprise risk 
management framework which details the governance 
and management of all aspects of risks. A detailed 
review of the Company’s risk exposures to market, credit, 
liquidity, insurance, operational, reputation and other 
emerging risks, as well as the key control processes is set 
out in the ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ section of this 
Report in page 184.

DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A.	 Overview of Lines of Business (LOB) 
The Company operates in various lines of business in retail and group segment. A brief description of the products 
under each line of business is given below:
1.	
Participating (Par) products – These are products 
where the policyholder is entitled to 90% share of 
the surplus emerging in the participating funds and 
the balance 10% share of surplus belongs to the 
shareholders. The participating fund is managed 
by the Company and the surplus emerging in the 
fund is added back to the policies in the form of 
bonuses. The shareholders’ profits arising from 
the participating business depend on the total 
bonuses declared to policyholders on an annual 
basis. Currently, shareholders' share of profit is 
one-ninth of the bonus declared to the policyholders. 
Any balance surplus in this segment is accumulated 
under the head ‘Funds for future appropriation’ in the 
Balance sheet, to be distributed to policyholders and 
shareholders in the future. The amount of bonuses 
declared to policyholders is influenced by the actual 
returns on investments and the expectation of future 
rates of return. The Company has participating life 
and participating pension lines of business.
2.	
Non-participating (non-par) non-linked products 
- These products provide pre-defined benefits 
at the policy’s inception for specified events and 
the policyholder is not entitled to any share in 
the surplus that arises from the investment fund. 
Any surplus that emerges in the non-participating 
business is transferred to shareholders' accounts 
based on the Appointed Actuary's recommendation. 
Non-participating 
non-linked 
products 
include 
non-participating life (savings and protection), 
non-participating 
pension, 
non-participating 
variable (life and pension), annuity, health, etc.
a.	
Non-participating life:
	
Non-participating savings – Non-participating 
savings plans are endowment assurance contracts 
that pay a benefit upon the life assured surviving 
the stipulated date or on the life assured’s death 
before maturity. These plans meet the long-term 
savings needs of customers and the life cover 
component ensures that the customer’s family is 
financially secure. 
	
Non-participating protection – Non-participating 
protection plans are contracts that pay a specified 
amount on the occurrence of certain events such as 
death, disability or critical illness during the policy’s 
term. These cost-effective protection plans provide 
a 360-degree financial safety net to customers and

their families by paying a lump sum amount when 
an event covered under the product occurs.
b.	
Non-participating pension – These products help 
customers build a retirement corpus and pay a 
specified benefit or interest from time to time.
c.	
Non-participating variable (Life & Pension) – These 
products offer benefits that are partially or wholly 
dependent on the performance of an approved 
external index or benchmark.
d.	
Annuity - Annuities provide a series of guaranteed 
payouts to the annuitant at regular intervals in return 
for a certain sum paid upfront or the option to pay 
premiums for a certain period. A deferred annuity 
is a contract to pay out regular amounts of benefit 
to the annuity holder at the end of the deferred 
period (the vesting date) when annuity payment 
commences for a specified period such as number of 
years or for life. An immediate annuity is a contract 
to pay out regular amounts of benefit wherein the 
contract commences payments immediately after 
commencement of the contract. 
e.	
Health – These products provide a fixed benefit on 
specified health events such as the diagnosis of a 
specified illness. 
	
Of the above, protection business includes term 
assurance and health line of business for both 
retail and group.
3.	
Non-participating (non-par) linked products - These 
products provide returns that are directly linked to 
the performance of an approved index or the value 
of the underlying assets. The investment risk in these 
products is borne by the policyholder. The products 
have a transparent charge structure, including the 
charge for either life cover or health cover. Any surplus 
that arises in the case of non-participating linked 
business is transferred to shareholders' accounts 
based on the recommendation of the Appointed 
Actuary. The Company has linked life, pension, 
health, and group line of business.
B.	 Standalone financial statements
a.	
Results from operations: 
	
The Company’s financial statements comprise 
two primary accounts - the Revenue account (also 
known as the policyholders’ account) and the Profit 
and loss account (also known as the shareholders’ 
account). The Revenue account contains the income 
and expenses related to policyholders, and the 
surplus generated in this account is appropriated 
to the Profit and loss account based on the 
recommendation of the Appointed Actuary. A deficit 
in any line of business in the Revenue account is 
funded from the Profit and loss account. Other than 
the transfers to and from the Revenue account, the 
Profit and loss account contains the income and 
expenses pertaining to shareholders. The surplus 
remaining in the Revenue account, which has not 
been appropriated to the Profit and loss account, 
is held as Funds for future appropriations (FFA) 
and is reflected in the Balance Sheet. Funds for 
Future Appropriation represent funds that have not 
been explicitly allocated to either policyholders or 
shareholders at the balance sheet date. 
	
The various lines of business disclosed in the 
Revenue account are as per the requirements of 
IRDAI regulations. However, for analysis of our 
Revenue account, it can be viewed from three broad 
lines of business as given above i.e., participating, 
non-participating (including non-participating life 
(savings and protection), non-participating pension, 
non-participating variable life, non-participating 
variable pension, annuity, health) and linked. 
Shareholders’ profits in participating lines of 
business depend on the total annual bonuses 
declared to policyholders. Currently, one-ninth of 
the bonus declared to policyholders is transferred 
to shareholders. In the non-participating line of 
business, profits arise primarily from premium and 
investment income net of expenses, claims, and 
policyholders’ liabilities. In the linked business, 
profits primarily arise from charges levied on the 
policyholders’ fund net of expenses, claims, and 
policyholders’ liabilities.

amounts to ` (5,959) thousand for the year ended March 
31, 2024 (` 5,436 thousand for FY2023)
	
Change in non-unit/mathematical reserves (net 
of amount ceded in reinsurance) increased from 
` 166.25 billion in FY2023 to ` 198.55 billion in 
FY2024 reflecting the new business written and 
change in valuation assumptions.
	
Change in fund reserve (including discontinued 
policies), which represents liability carried on account 
of units held by unit-linked policyholders, increased 
from ` (68.08) billion in FY2023 to ` 207.84 billion in 
FY2024 primarily due to higher investment income.
11.	  Provision for taxation (Revenue account)
	
The provision for taxation shown in the Revenue 
accounts represents tax charged on the total surplus 
(grossed up for bonus) of the participating line of 
business in the Revenue account, in line with the 
Company’s accounting policy and the directions 
issued by the IRDAI. The provision for taxation 
decreased from ` 1.84 billion in FY2023 to ` 1.08 
billion in FY2024 primarily on account of higher tax 
exemptions availed.
12.	 Surplus after tax (Revenue account) and Net 
transfer to shareholders’ account
	
As a result of the above changes in income and 
expenses, surplus after tax in the Revenue account 
decreased from ` 23.02 billion in FY2023 to ` 10.90 
billion in FY2024. 
	
The surplus generated in the Revenue account 
after setting aside funds for future appropriation is 
transferred to Profit and loss account (Shareholders 
account) based on the recommendation of the 
Appointed Actuary. The net transfer to/(from) 
shareholders’ account decreased from ` 2.14 billion 
in FY2023 to ` (3.21) billion in FY2024.

Participating business: The surplus in the Revenue 
account for the participating line of business is net of 
bonus and interim bonus. The surplus (grossed up for 
bonus) decreased from ` 12.97 billion in FY2023 to 
` 7.04 billion in FY2024. The shareholders’ profits in 
participating business depend on the total bonuses 
declared to the policyholders. Currently, one-ninth 
of the bonus declared to policyholders is transferred 
to shareholders. The transfer to shareholders 
for the participating line of business increased 
marginally from ` 1.01 billion for FY2023 to ` 1.09 
billion for FY2024.
	
Non-participating business: The surplus in the 
Revenue account for non-participating line of business 
arises primarily from premium and investment 
income net of expenses, claims, and policyholders’ 
liabilities. The deficit in the non-participating line 
of business before contribution from shareholders 
increased from ` 15.28 billion in FY2023 to ` 17.93 
billion in FY2024 primarily on account of higher new 
business strain in annuity business.

increased from ` 48.09 billion in FY2023 to ` 55.75 
billion in FY2024 on account of profit for the year.

to cover linked liabilities) at March 31, 2024 was 
56.89% of the total investment assets as against

The Company has seen a growth in loan against 
policies from ` 13.14 billion at March 31, 2023 to 
` 17.61 billion at March 31, 2024 primarily on account 
of the higher number of policyholders availing this

Fixed assets
	
Fixed assets increased from ` 5.96 billion at March 31,

1. Including due to holding company, expenses payable 
and payable towards investments purchased. 
	
2. Including interest on unclaimed amount of policyholders.
	
3. Including TDS payable and other deposits.
	
The 
explanation 
for 
key 
elements 
is 
as 
mentioned below:
	
Policyholders’ claims payable represents amounts 
payable to the policyholders for all claims (death, 
maturity, survival, surrender, foreclosure, annuity, 
etc.) that are intimated to the Company and are 
outstanding due to pending investigation as a part 
of the normal claims process or pending due to 
incomplete documentation from the policyholders. 
The increase in claims payable from ` 8.00 billion at 
March 31, 2023 to ` 10.36 billion at March 31, 2024 
is primarily on account of increase in death claims

Consolidated 
financial 
results 
and 
subsidiary 
performance
The Company has a wholly owned subsidiary, ICICI 
Prudential 
Pension 
Funds 
Management 
Company 
Limited (PFM). The PFM is licensed by the Pension Funds 
Regulatory and Development Authority as a Pension 
Fund Manager under the National Pension System (NPS). 
The PFM had also obtained registration as a Point of 
Presence (PoP) for NPS distribution and servicing.
Pension fund industry 
The total assets under management (AUM) of the pension 
fund industry has grown from ` 8,988.65 billion at 
March 31, 2023 to ` 11,726.51 billion at March 31, 2024, 
a growth of 30% in FY2024. Inflows largely comprise 
funds from the government sector, however, private 
sector grew at a faster pace as compared to overall 
industry. The AUM from the government sector, private 
sector, Atal Pension Yojana and National Pension System 
lite segments was ` 9,538.64 billion, ` 1,775.80 billion, 
` 356.48 billion and ` 55.60 billion respectively.
Business
The subscribers’ funds managed by the PFM increased 
from ` 164.66 billion at March 31, 2023 to ` 284.19 billion 
at March 31, 2024, an increase of 72.6% during the year.
The PFM has a market share of 16.0% in the private 
sector AUM at March 31, 2024.
The net worth of PFM at March 31, 2024 stands at ` 0.56 
billion (at March 31, 2023 ` 0.58 billion) on account of 
loss incurred during the period. 
For the year ended March 31, 2024, the PFM registered a 
loss primarily on account of increase in employee benefit 
expenses and other operating expenses reflecting the 
building up of capacity as part of the overall growth 
plan. The subsidiary is committed towards increasing its 
presence in the industry and is focused on scaling up the 
business and revenue.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared 
in accordance with the accounting standards notified

III.	 INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR 
ADEQUACY
The internal controls of the Company are commensurate 
with the business requirements, its scale of operation 
and applicable statutes to ensure orderly and efficient 
conduct of business. These controls have been designed 
to provide a reasonable assurance with regard to 
maintaining proper accounting controls, safeguarding 
of assets, prevention, and detection of frauds and errors, 
ensuring operating effectiveness, reliability of financial 
reporting, and compliance with applicable regulations.
The Company has a mechanism of testing the controls at 
regular intervals for design and operating effectiveness. 
Further, the auditors opine on the adequacy and 
operating effectiveness of internal financial controls over 
financial reporting. 
The key components of the internal financial control 
framework implemented by the Company include:
I.	
Entity Level Controls (ELCs) that operate at an 
organization level on which the control environment 
of the company relies on
II.	
Controls operating at process level with the objective 
of providing assurance at a transaction recording 
stage, in most aspects of operations and processes, 
the Company has deployed automation for control 
and efficiency 
III.	
Robust IT control environment with adequate 
controls focused on reconciliation between systems, 
auto checks to avoid any duplicate data upload, 
reconciliation of all jobs run at the beginning and 
end of day, matching of trial balance and ensuring 
no unposted entries in the system monthly 
IV.	 Control over third parties providing services focusing 
on due diligence, risk assessment, document 
review and periodic assessment to ensure controls 
over third-party service providers relevant from a 
financial reporting perspective. Further, the Board 
Risk Management Committee has oversight on 
the implementation of controls and monitors the 
performance of the outsourced vendors 
V.	
Controls over safeguarding of assets (comprising 
of 
investment 
assets, 
IT 
assets 
and 
other 
assets). These controls are based on value and 
custody of assets 
VI.	 Review 
controls 
which 
comprise 
of 
multiple 
levels of oversight over financial reporting by 
way of a strong reporting and review framework. 
There are senior management controls comprising 
of high-level controls (HLC) and management 
review controls (MRC) to monitor and identify any 
material misstatement 
VII.	 Fraud 
control 
framework 
which 
consists 
of 
preventive measures, incident management and 
awareness activities. 
These controls are covered under the IFC framework 
which is aligned with Internal Control Framework 2013 
given by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations 
(COSO) of the Treadway Commission and tested at 
regular intervals for design and operating effectiveness. 
There had been no material changes in the process level 
controls or activities conducted in the financial statement 
closing process of the Company. The Company had 
tested all material controls over financial reporting 
at March 31, 2024 and found them to be operating 
effectively. Further the Company has been compliant 
with the requirements, prescribed under amendments 
in the Companies (Account) Rules, 2014, of using 
accounting software which has a feature of recording 
audit trail and creating an edit log of each change made 
in the books of account. 
In addition, internal audits are undertaken to review 
significant operational areas regularly. The Audit 
Reports, submitted by the Internal Auditors, are reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and corrective action is initiated 
to strengthen the controls and enhance the effectiveness 
of the existing systems. Statutory and Internal Auditors 
are also invited to the Audit Committee meetings to 
ascertain their views on the adequacy of internal control 
systems. The management believes that strengthening 
internal controls is a continuous process and it will, 
therefore, continue its efforts to keep pace with changing 
business needs and environment.

The Company recognises that risk is an integral 
element of the business and managed acceptance of 
risk is essential for generation of shareholder value. 
The Company’s acceptance of risk is dependent on 
the return on risk-adjusted capital and consistency 
with its strategic objectives. Having accepted a risk, 
the Company may cede or hedge it where this is cost 
effective. In general therefore, the Company’s control 
procedures and systems are designed to manage risk, 
rather than eliminate it. However, at certain times, there 
may also exist some risks for which the Company has no 
tolerance and which are actively avoided.
The Company has in place a risk management framework 
with the following aims:
•	
Determining the risk profile of the Company i.e. 
the aggregate level of risks that the Company has 
undertaken in pursuit of profitable business.
•	
Identification, measurement, monitoring and control 
of risk for the purpose of protecting the interests of 
key stakeholders.
•	
Enhancing the Company’s ability to identify 
and pursue opportunities that offer attractive 
risk-adjusted returns by providing transparent, 
accurate and timely risk information.
•	
Embedding risk-based decision making in key 
management processes and fostering a culture of 
risk awareness.
•	
Limiting the Company’s exposure to adverse 
outcomes through risk limits.
•	
Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. 
•	
Focusing on ensuring that it possesses the 
appropriate capabilities and experience in managing 
and transferring risks.
•	
Minimising reputational risk.
RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The risk governance structure of the Company consists 
of the Board, the Board Risk Management Committee 
(BRMC), the Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and its 
supporting committees. 
The risks faced by the Company are classified into 
market, credit, liquidity, insurance, operational and 
reputation. In addition to these risks, the life insurance 
industry faces a number of emerging risks. Geo-political 
tensions and disruption to energy supplies continue to 
be additional sources of uncertainty for financial and 
commodity markets and trigger for inflation (which could 
impact credit quality of counterparties, as well as reduce 
real wages thereby impacting discretionary savings, 
insurance new business and persistency risk). 
There 
are 
also 
emerging 
risks 
related 
to 
ESG 
(environmental, social and governance) issues. For the 
Company, governance, ethics and sustainability are the 
overall responsibility of the Board, with its committees 
playing key roles in identifying, mitigating and managing 
ESG risks and other material issues. One of the most 
prominent ESG risks is that of climate change which could 
potentially have wide ranging implications including (but 
not limited to) adverse impact on economic growth and 
investment markets and higher than expected claims due 
to increased risk of future weather-related catastrophes, 
pandemics as well as possible changes in long-term 
mortality/morbidity rates. The Company continues to 
work towards developing its understanding of ESG 
risks, including climate change and remaining aware 
of industry best practice as it develops. The current 
industry consensus is for insurers to treat climate risk 
as an amplifier of existing risk categories rather than 
a new risk category. Accordingly, sustainability risks 
including climate-related risks are integrated in our 
risk management framework and are part of our Board 
approved Risk Policy (“the Policy”). For the impact of ESG 
risks on the asset side, the Company has implemented 
a framework for investment decisions that will support 
mitigation of risks due to climate changes as well as other 
environmental, social and governance risks by factoring 
these in its investment decisions. While climate change 
can also impact morbidity, mortality and persistency and 
thus, the Company’s liabilities, it is expected that the 
impacts will emerge gradually, and through a change 
in future assumptions earlier than through actual 
incidences. The longer-term impact to the Company 
should be managed by its ability to reprice contracts and 
develop new products if required. Apart from climate 
change, there are other emerging risks associated with 
public health trends such as increase in obesity related 
disorders and demographic changes such as population 
urbanisation and ageing. Another increasingly important 
ESG aspect is that of data privacy which could potentially 
have a material impact on the Company’s reputation. 
The risk management framework of the Company seeks 
to identify, measure and control its exposures to all these 
risks within its overall risk appetite. 
The risk philosophy of the Company is outlined in 
the Board approved risk policy (‘the Policy’) which is 
reviewed by the Board at least annually. The Policy 
details identification, measurement, monitoring and 
control standards relating to the various individual risks. 
The Policy covers aspects related to:

identifying risks and 
maintaining effective 
internal controls
•	Executing risk and 
control procedures on a 
day-to-day basis

1.	
RISK IDENTIFICATION
	
The Company identifies its risk exposure through a 
variety of techniques and processes, including:
	
1)	
Stress testing of the current financial condition 
of the Company. The Company periodically 
carries out stress testing of its assets and 
liabilities to identify impact on the regulatory 
and economic solvency position. Such testing 
is used as an aid in analyzing the Company’s 
resilience, assessing the effectiveness of risk 
controls and identifying significant existing or 
emerging risks to its financial position, such as 
severe economic shocks and catastrophic events 
like pandemics, which could materialize as a 
consequence of several risk factors including 
climate change and other emerging risks. 
	
2)	
Product development process by way of 
analysis of the sensitivity of profit margins and 
of profit patterns to market and insurance risks. 
Any liquidity or operational risk arising out of 
the new product or modification of an existing 
product is assessed prior to product launch.
	
3)	
Business planning process by way of analysis 
of the sensitivity of the projected solvency 
and emergence of profit to market and 
insurance risks. 
	
4)	
Tracking of key liquidity risk indicators.
	
5)	
The Board of the Company periodically 
reviews the potential impact of strategic risks 
such as changes in macro-economic factors, 
government policies, regulatory environment 
and tax regime on the business plan of the 
Company. The Company has a framework in 
place for identifying business concentration 
risk and it actively engages in diversification 
of business across various drivers including 
distribution partners and product segments.

6)	
Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) to 
identify and assess operational risks in terms 
of their likelihood and impact for each business 
unit within the Company. The RCSA activity is 
done with due cognisance to any loss events or 
audit findings.
	
7)	
The Company evaluates legal and regulatory 
risk by monitoring the implementation of 
relevant requirements and monitoring for 
any deviations.
	
8)	
Reputation risk is monitored based on trends 
in regulatory orders (if any), media mentions, 
customer complaints and legal cases.
2.	
RISK MEASUREMENT
	
The Company uses the following approaches to 
measure its risk exposure.
	
1)	
Economic capital requirement (ECR): ECR 
is an appropriate measure of risk exposure 
for 
market, 
credit 
and 
insurance 
risks. 
ECR is measured by calculating the reduction 
in available economic capital (market value of 
assets less realistic liabilities) under extreme 
economic 
and 
non-economic 
scenarios. 
The stresses are benchmarked to European 
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority 
(EIOPA) standards as they develop, subject to 
appropriate adjustments for local conditions 
and the Company’s stage of development.
	
2)	
Risk to the growth of the EV: The Company 
considers risks that impede future growth of 
the EV like insufficient new business profit 
growth and over-run in acquisition or renewal 
expenses, caused by adverse deviation of 
actual unit costs from planned unit costs.
	
3)	
Risk to the statutory position: The Company 
considers the impact of market risk on its 
statutory position and assesses the quality 
of its ALM by performing a resilience test 
periodically on the quasi-regulatory balance 
sheet. The quasi regulatory balance sheet is 
obtained by marking to market the assets on 
the regulatory balance sheet. The liabilities 
are determined with reference to the market 
value of assets and by preserving the margins 
for adverse deviation in accordance with 
applicable 
regulation 
and 
professional 
guidance. The quasi-regulatory balance sheet 
is subjected to economic shocks and the 
solvency ratios and free assets under the stress 
scenarios monitored.
	
4)	
Liquidity ratio of highly liquid assets to 
near-term liabilities is tracked in order to assess 
the liquidity position.
	
5)	
Operational and fraud losses are measured 
as a proportion of profit before tax to identify 
the extent of deviation from the agreed 
tolerance limit. In addition, key operational risk 
indicators are tracked.
	
6)	
Reputation risk score is calculated based on 
a methodology of rating various parameters 
impacting the risk such as regulatory concerns, 
media 
mentions, 
customer 
complaints 
and legal cases. 
3.	
RISK MONITORING
	
The ERC reviews all the risks and presents a risk 
report to the BRMC on a quarterly basis. The BRMC 
informs the Board of the key findings.
4.	
RISK CONTROL
	
Identified risks are managed by one or more of the 
following techniques
	
•	
Retention (acceptance);
	
•	
Avoidance;
	
•	
Transfer or;
	
•	
Reduction (mitigation).
	
The nature of the controls implemented and the level 
of control exercised are based upon the:
	
•	
Potential severity of the risk;
	
•	
Frequency of the risk occurring;
	
•	
Cost of implementing controls relative to the 
significance of the risk;
	
•	
Risk appetite.
	
a.	
Market risk:
	
1.	
Launching new products can significantly alter 
the risk profile of the Company’s balance sheet. 
Market risks inherent in the new products or 
significant modifications to existing products 
are identified at the product design stage 
and a risk report placed before the ERC and 
the Product Management Committee (PMC). 
The products are launched only after approval 
by the ERC and the PMC.
	
2.	
Asset 
Liability 
Management 
(ALM): 
Asset-liability management involves minimising 
the risk due to mismatches in assets and 
liabilities. Mismatches could arise either due 
to asymmetric changes in the value of assets 
and liabilities as a consequence of changes 
in macroeconomic factors such as interest 
rates, or due to asynchronous cash inflows 
and outflows. The Company has developed 
detailed investment specifications that govern 
the investment strategy and limits for each fund 
depending on the profile of the liability backed 
by those assets. For each category of products, 
the investment specifications specify limits to

permissible exposures to various asset classes 
along with duration guidelines for fixed income 
instruments. The investment specifications 
are designed to achieve the risk versus return 
objectives 
and 
policyholders’ 
reasonable 
expectations while maintaining the risk within 
the Company’s risk appetite and with due 
consideration 
of 
regulatory 
requirements. 
The mitigation strategies for different portfolios 
are as follows:
	
i.	
Category 1: Non-linked business where 
the benefits to policyholders are based on 
performance of the underlying investments
	
	
For these funds the Company’s asset allocation 
strategy, which includes investments in equities, 
is designed to achieve the twin objectives 
of managing risks arising from guarantees 
and optimising policyholder returns, subject 
to 
regulatory 
constraints. 
Asset 
Liability 
Management (ALM) is done through regular 
monitoring of the equity backing ratio and debt 
duration against limits as applicable. The bonus 
declaration 
mechanism 
for 
participating 
products also helps in the smoothing of the 
volatility of the investment returns.
	
ii.	
Category 2: Non-linked business where the 
benefits and premiums are fixed at the start 
of the contract
	
	
The liabilities for these lines of business 
are obligations to policyholders or to meet 
expenses and have to be met either at a fixed 
time or on the occurrence of a contingency. 
The Company manages the risk on such 
products by investing only in fixed income 
instruments. Further, a combination of duration 
matching and cash flow matching approaches 
is used to mitigate asset liability mismatches. 
The Company uses interest rate derivatives 
and separate trading of registered interest and 
principal securities (STRIPS) to hedge interest 
rate risk. In particular, a forward rate agreement 
(FRA), which is a particular type of interest rate 
derivative, allows the Company to lock in now 
the interest rates at which the future premiums 
would be invested.
	
iii.	
Category 3: Linked products with guarantees
	
	
The Company uses a mix of stochastic and 
deterministic approaches to calculate the cost 
for providing the guarantee and holds a reserve 
on this account. The Company manages the 
investment risk arising from these products 
by setting limits on the equity backing ratio 
and debt duration.
	
iv.	
Category 4: Linked products 
without guarantees
	
	
The linked portfolio without guarantees has 
minimal investment risk to the solvency of 
the Company. These funds are managed with 
respect to an appropriate benchmark index and 
do not require any active ALM.
	
b.	
Credit risk: 
	
	
The Company manages the credit risk of its 
investments through the following measures:
	
	
1.	
Exposure limits for companies, groups and 
industries in accordance with IRDAI norms 
and limits as per its own Investment Policy; 
	
	
2.	
Restricting 
investments 
primarily 
to 
securities rated AA and above;
	
	
3.	
Engagement with select and financially 
sound 
reinsurers 
as 
per 
internal 
guidelines for reinsurance. The credit risk 
on reinsurance contracts are reviewed 
when the Company plans to enter into 
a relationship with a new reinsurer, or in 
case of significant events like credit rating 
downgrades of existing reinsurers;
	
	
4.	
Approved counter-parties are used to 
minimize settlement risk
	
c.	
Liquidity risk:
	
	
The Company faces limited liquidity risk due to 
the nature of its liabilities. The Company has 
put the following mitigants in place:
	
	
1.	
The Investment Specifications as a part of 
the asset liability management framework 
provide guidelines to manage liquidity risk 
by specifying the minimum investment 
in highly liquid assets, taking account of 
constraints on the fungibility of assets 
among funds, and by specifying cash flow 
matching for certain funds.
	
	
2.	
The Company has a liquidity contingency 
plan, which addresses the following
	
	
	
a)	
Identifying mitigants to liquidity stress 
arising out of contingencies;
	
	
	
b)	
Communication and action protocol;
	
	
	
c)	
Restoring normality in the event of 
any contingency;
	
	
3.	
New products are launched only after 
approval by the ERC and the PMC.
	
	
	
The ERC also evaluates the impact of 
market liquidity on any hedging or asset 
allocation strategy required by the product.

d.	
Mortality, Morbidity and Longevity risks: 
	
	
The Company uses the following approaches to 
manage its mortality and morbidity risk:
	
1.	
Developing new products: The Company 
designs exclusions and terms and conditions 
in consultation with reinsurers and with 
due regards to market practices to manage 
the mortality, morbidity and longevity risks. 
In order to deal with a changing insurance 
landscape or emerging risks, new products 
could be developed with more suitable product 
features, policy wordings, exclusions and terms 
and conditions. 
	
2.	
Product approval process: Launching new 
products can significantly alter the risk 
profile of the Company’s balance sheet. 
Insurance risks inherent in the new products or 
significant modifications to existing products 
are identified at the product design stage and 
products are launched only after approval by 
the ERC and the PMC.
	
3.	
Reinsurance: The Company uses appropriate 
reinsurance 
arrangements, 
including 
catastrophe reinsurance, to manage insurance 
risk. Such reinsurance arrangements can 
support in risk transfer of emerging risks as 
well. The Company’s reinsurance exposures 
are 
considered 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
ERC periodically.
	
4.	
Re-pricing: The Company also reserves the 
right to re-price future new business with 
IRDAI approval in case of adverse experience, 
which could materialize due to various factors 
including sustainability risks. 
	
5.	
Underwriting 
and 
claims 
controls: 
Underwriting procedures and processes are in 
place to identify risk at the time of acceptance 
of the contract for different classes of business. 
A review of the underwriting strategy is carried 
out periodically. The underwriting strategy can 
be adjusted to allow for any changes in the 
insurance risk landscape or emerging risks. 
Claims procedures are also in place to assess 
and manage the risks at the claims stage, 
which are reviewed periodically. 
	
6.	
Experience analysis: The Company periodically 
reviews the actual experience relative to the 
expected experience for mortality, morbidity 
and longevity. Such a review will provide the 
Company insights on emerging risks if the 
Company faces any.
	
7.	
Review of bases: The Company conducts 
a review at least annually of the bases of 
assumptions, which are used for various 
purposes such as valuation, pricing etc. to assess 
any change in risk profile. A widespread 
increase in mortality or morbidity, for example 
as a result of climate changes or emergence 
on new diseases, may require the Company to 
re-evaluate its assumptions. 
	
e.	
Persistency risk: 
	
	
The Company uses the following approaches to 
manage the risk:
	
1.	
Experience analysis: The Company conducts 
its experience analysis regularly to ensure that 
corrective action can be initiated at the earliest 
opportunity and that assumptions used in 
product pricing and embedded value reporting 
are in line with experience.
	
2.	
Product features: The Company uses features 
like loyalty bonuses and additional allocation 
of units to encourage policyholders to continue 
with the policy.
	
3.	
Service 
initiatives: 
The 
Company 
uses 
a combination of proactive and reactive 
interventions 
to 
manage 
persistency. 
The interventions could include attaching direct 
debit or ECS mandates at new business stage, 
sending communication via different media 
such as emails to customers and distributors 
and reminders and telephonic interviews 
with customers.
	
4.	
Aligning 
key 
performance 
indicators: 
The Company uses different key performance 
indicators for different levels of hierarchy in 
sales and operations to align interests and 
ensure adequate focus on persistency.
	
f.	
Expense risk: 
	
	
The Company uses the following approaches to 
manage the risk:
	
1.	
Experience analysis: The Company actively 
monitors its expense levels, which are then fed 
back into new product pricing, calculation of 
reserves and management reporting. In case 
of any adverse deviations between actual 
unit costs and planned unit costs, mitigation 
measures are taken.
	
2.	
Aligning 
key 
performance 
indicators: 
The Company uses different key performance 
indicators to align interests and ensure 
adequate focus on expense.

RISK MANAGEMENT
	
The Company recognises that risk is an integral 
element of the business and the managed 
acceptance of risk is essential for generating 
shareholder value. 
	
The risk governance structure of the Company 
consists of the Board, the Board Risk Management 
Committee (BRMC), the Product Management 
Committee (PMC), the Executive Risk Committee 
(ERC) and its supporting committees. The risk 
philosophy of the Company is outlined in the 
Board approved risk policy which is reviewed by 
the Board at least annually. The Board risk policy 
details identification, measurement, monitoring and 
control standards relating to various individual risks, 
namely investment (market, credit and liquidity), 
insurance, operational (including fraud, legal, 
compliance, outsourcing, customer dissonance, 
business continuity, information and cyber security) 
and reputation. The Board periodically reviews the 
potential impact of strategic risks such as changes 
in macro-economic factors, government policies, 
regulatory environment and tax regime on the 
business plan of the Company.  	
	
In addition to these risks, the life insurance industry 
faces a number of emerging risks. Geo-political 
tensions and the potential for disruption to energy 
supplies are an additional source of uncertainty 
for financial and commodity markets and a trigger 
for inflation (which could impact credit quality 
of counterparties, as well as reduce real wages 
thereby impacting discretionary savings, insurance 
new business and persistency risk). There are also 
emerging risks related to ESG (environmental, 
social and governance) issues. One of the most 
prominent ESG risks is that of climate change which 
could potentially have wide-ranging implications 
including (but not limited to) adverse impact on 
economic growth and investment markets and 
higher than expected claims due to increased risk 
of future weather related catastrophes, pandemics 
as well as possible changes in long-term mortality/
morbidity rates. Apart from climate change, there 
are emerging risks associated with public health 
trends such as increase in obesity related disorders 
and demographic changes such as population 
urbanisation and ageing. Other important ESG 
elements include data privacy, which has an 
increasing material impact on Company’s reputation.
	
The risk management framework of the Company 
seeks to identify, measure and control its exposures 
to all these risks within its overall risk appetite. The 
Company periodically carries out stress testing 
of its assets and liabilities to identify impact on 
regulatory and economic solvency, statutory profits 
and liquidity position. Such testing is used as an 
aid in identifying significant existing or emerging 
risks to its financial position, including the potential 
impact of severe economic shocks and catastrophic 
events like pandemics, which could materialize as a 
consequence of several risk factors including climate 
change and other sustainability risks. The Company 
has a framework for information and cyber security 
as well as business continuity management to 
analyse emerging risks through regular monitoring 
of the external and internal environment which has 
been further augmented in the current situation. 
The Company also has a privacy policy to ensure 
protection of sensitive personal data or information 
collected. The  Company has updated the Board risk 
policy by integrating sustainability risks in the risk 
management framework. The key aspects of the 
Company’s risk management framework have been 
outlined below. Further information on the Company’s 
approach to risk management is available in the 
sections on ‘Enterprise Risk Management’ and ‘Risks 
and Opportunities’ of the Annual Report.
8.1. Investment risk
	
Investment risk is the risk arising out of variations in 
the level or volatility of market prices of assets and 
financial instruments, including the risk arising from 
any mismatch between assets and liabilities, due to 
external market and economic factors. The Company 
faces limited liquidity risk due to the nature of its 
liabilities. The key mitigation approaches for this risk 
are as follows:
(a)	 Product approval process: Launching new 
products can significantly alter the risk profile 
of the Company’s Balance Sheet. Investment 
risks inherent in new products or significant 
modifications to existing products are identified 
at product design stage and products are 
launched only after approval by the ERC and 
the PMC. 
(b)	 Asset 
Liability 
Management 
(ALM): 
The 
Company 
has 
detailed 
Investment 
Specifications that govern the investment 
strategy and limits for each fund depending on 
the profile of the liability backed by those assets. 
For each category of products, the Investment 
Specifications define limits to permissible 
exposures to various asset classes, duration 
guidelines for fixed income instruments and 
minimum investment in liquid assets. The 
Company uses derivatives to hedge interest 
rate risk.
(c)	 Exposure

has implemented a framework for investment 
decisions that will support mitigation of risks 
due to climate change as well as other ESG risks 
by factoring these in its investment decisions.
8.2. Insurance Risk
	
Insurance risk is the risk arising because of variance to 
the best estimate or because of random fluctuations 
in the frequency, size and timing of insurance 
liabilities. Insurance risk comprise the following 
components: mortality, morbidity, persistency and 
expense risk. These risks are mitigated through the 
following: 
(a)	 Product approval process: Insurance risks 
inherent in the new products or significant 
modifications to existing products are identified 
at product design stage and products are 
launched only after approval by the ERC 
and the PMC. The Company, in its product 
design, incorporates product features and 
uses appropriate policy wordings to mitigate 
insurance risk. 
(b)	 Reinsurance: The Company uses appropriate 
reinsurance arrangements, including catastrophe 
reinsurance, to manage insurance risk. Such 
reinsurance arrangements may be used to 
support risk transfer of sustainability risks as 
well. The arrangements are with select and 
financially sound reinsurers. The Company’s 
reinsurance exposures are considered and 
approved by the ERC periodically. 
(c)	 Underwriting 
and 
claims 
controls: 
Underwriting 
and 
claims 
policies 
and 
procedures are in place to assess and manage 
mortality and morbidity risks. The Company 
seeks to minimise these risks by diversifying its 
business portfolio and adhering to appropriate 
and segmented underwriting norms. The 
Company 
conducts 
periodic 
reviews 
of 
both underwriting and claims procedures. 
Adjustments to the underwriting strategy 
may be made to allow for any changes in the 
insurance risk landscape or emerging risks.
(d)	 Experience analysis: The Company conducts 
its experience analysis regularly in order to 
monitor trends, gain insights on emerging risks, 
if any and to ensure that corrective actions can 
be initiated at the earliest opportunity and that 
assumptions used in product pricing, reserving 
and embedded value reporting are in line with 
the experience. The Company actively monitors 
its claims experience, persistency levels and 
expense ratios.
(e)	 Aligning key performance indicators: The 
Company uses appropriate key performance 
indicators for different levels of hierarchy in 
sales and operations to align interests and 
ensure adequate focus on insurance risk 
especially, persistency and expense.
(f)	
Product contracts: The Company designs 
exclusions and terms and conditions in 
consultation with reinsurers and with due 
regard to market practices to manage insurance 
risk, especially mortality and morbidity risk. 
In order to deal with a changing insurance 
landscape or emerging risks, new products 
may be developed with more suitable product 
features, policy wordings, exclusions and terms 
and conditions.
(g)	 Repricing: The Company reserves the right 
to re-price future new business with IRDAI 
approval in case of adverse experience, 
which could materialize due to various factors 
including sustainability issues.
8.3. Operational risk: 
	
Operational risk is the risk of loss, resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. 
	
The Company uses the following approaches to 
manage operational risk:

plans for high risk items identified through the 
Risk and Control Self-Assessment (R&CSA) 
conducted for each business function, through 
analysis of, loss events and review of audit 
findings.  
(b)	 The Company continuously monitors internal 
loss events and ensures adequate mitigation 
for material impact events.
(c)	 The 
Company 
actively 
promotes 
a 
risk 
awareness culture by improving understanding 
through communication and education. It 
further engages with law enforcement agencies 
to create awareness on various insurance 
frauds and emerging issues
(d)	 Fraud Management: The Company has a 
fraud risk management policy that sets out 
the approach and guidelines for management 
of fraud risk. The Company follows both a 
proactive and reactive approach to manage 
fraud. Proactive management is done by using 
triggers to identify suspected frauds and through 
random sample checks. Reactive management 
is done through incident management. The 
Company ensures implementation of controls 
to prevent recurrence of such incidents, 
financial recovery whenever applicable and 
disciplinary action against involved employees 
in accordance with the Company’s Code of 
Conduct. It also initiates actions through law 
enforcement authorities based on severity of

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OPINION
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial 
statements of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company 
Limited (the “Company”), which comprise the Standalone 
Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2024, the Standalone 
Revenue Account (also called the “Policyholders’ 
Account” or the “Technical Account”), the Standalone 
Profit and Loss Account (also called the “Shareholders’ 
Account” or the “Non-Technical Account”) and the 
Standalone Receipts and Payments Account for the year 
then ended, and schedules annexed thereto including 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
standalone financial statements”).
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required in accordance with the Insurance Act, 1938 (the 
“Insurance Act”), as amended from time to time, including 
amendment brought by Insurance Laws (Amendment), 
Act 2015 the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority Act, 1999 (the “IRDA Act”), the Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority (Preparation of 
Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report of Insurance 
Companies) Regulations, 2002 (the “IRDA Financial 
Statements Regulations”), orders/ directions/ circulars 
issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (the “IRDAI”) and the Companies Act, 
2013 (the “Act”), to the extent applicable, in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 
March 2024, its net surplus, its profit and its receipts and 
payments for the year ended on that date.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and Rules 
thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in 
our audit of the standalone financial statements of the 
current year. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Information Technology (IT) systems and controls related to financial reporting process
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
The Company is highly dependent on its complex IT 
infrastructure 
comprising 
hardware, 
software, 
multiple 
applications, automated interfaces and controls in systems for 
recording, storing and reporting of financial transactions.
The Company’s key financial accounting and reporting 
processes such as premium income, commission, benefits 
paid, investments amongst others are highly dependent 
on IT systems including automated controls, to process and 
record large volume of transactions on daily basis as part of 
its operations, such that there exists a risk that gaps in the 
IT control environment could result in the financial accounting 
and reporting records being materially misstated.
	
We have involved our IT specialists in our assessment of the IT 
systems and controls with respect to financial statements, which 
included, but were not limited to the following:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Company’s General IT 
Control (GITC) over key financial accounting and reporting 
systems, and supporting control systems (referred to as in-
scope systems);
•	
On the in-scope systems, we have tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key IT general controls. This included 
evaluation of entity’s controls to ensure segregation of duties 
and access rights are based on duly approved requests, access 
for exit cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all 
users being re- certified during the period of audit, evaluation of 
password policies. Further, controls related to program change 
were evaluated to verify whether the changes were approved, 
tested in an environment that was segregated from production 
and moved to production by appropriate users;

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls related to financial reporting process
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
Due to the pervasive nature, complexity and importance of the 
impact of the IT systems and related control environment on 
the Company’s financial statements, we have identified testing 
of such IT systems and related control environment as a key 
audit matter for the current year audit.
•	
Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness 
for the audit period over the in-scope systems around system 
interfaces, reconciliations and system processing relevant to the 
audit of premium income, commission expense, benefits paid 
and investments, for evaluating completeness and accuracy
•	
Evaluated policies and strategies adopted by the Company in 
relation to security of key information infrastructure, data and 
client information management and monitoring
•	
Where deficiencies, if any, were identified, tested compensating 
controls or performed alternative procedures; and
•	
Obtained written representations from management on 
whether IT general controls and automated IT controls are 
designed and were operating effectively during the year.
Valuation and impairment determination of Investments (31 March 2024: INR 2,897,360,953, 31 March 2023: INR 
2,482,204,207) (INR in thousands)
Refer Schedule 8,8A and 8B of the standalone financial statements and refer schedule 16 note 2.12 on accounting 
policy
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
The Company’s investment portfolio consists of Policyholders 
investments (unit linked and non- linked) and Shareholders 
investments. Total investment portfolio represents around 99% 
of the Company’s total assets as at 31 March 2024
Investments are valued in accordance with the Board approved 
investment policy framed by the Company as per the provisions 
of the Insurance Act, the IRDA Financial Statements Regulations, 
IRDAI (Investment) Regulations, 2016 and the applicable orders/ 
directions/ circulars issued by IRDAI.
Investments in unit linked portfolio of INR 1,648,424,014 
thousands are valued based on observable inputs as per their 
accounting policy and gains/losses are recognized in Revenue 
account. These unit linked portfolio investments do not represent 
higher risk of material misstatement however, are considered to 
be a key audit matter due to their materiality to the standalone 
financial statements.
Investments in non-linked and shareholders portfolio of INR 
1,248,936,939 thousands are valued as per their accounting 
policy, based on which:
•	
the unrealized gains/ losses arising due to changes in fair 
value of listed equity shares and mutual fund units are 
recorded in the “Fair Value Change Account” in the Balance 
Sheet; and
•	
debt securities and unlisted equity shares are valued at 
historical cost.
Further, investments in the non-linked and shareholders portfolio 
are assessed for impairment as per the Company’s investment 
policy which involves significant management judgement. There 
is increased economic stress on account of external factors, 
which may impact the valuation of these investments.
Accordingly, valuation of investments (including impairment 
assessment) was considered to be one of the areas which required 
significant auditor attention and was one of the matter of most 
significance in the standalone financial statements.
Our audit procedures for this area included but were not limited to 
the following: 
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Company's process and 
controls over the valuation of investments. The understanding 
was obtained by performance of walkthroughs, which 
included inspection of documents produced by the Company 
and discussion with those involved in the pertinent process;
•	
Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of key controls over the valuation 
process, including the Company's assessment and approval 
of assumptions used for the valuation including key 
authorisation and data input controls thereof;
•	
Obtained independent external confirmations for investments 
as at balance sheet date from the Custodians and Depository 
Participants appointed by the Company to confirm the units 
of securities for the purpose of valuation re-computation;
•	
On a test check basis, recomputed valuation of different 
class of investments to assess appropriateness of valuation 
methodologies 
with 
reference 
to 
IRDAI 
Investment 
Regulations along with the Company's Board approved 
valuation policy;
•	
Examined movement and appropriateness of accounting in 
Fair Value Change account for specific investments. Further, 
in case of revaluation done for investment properties, 
examined the underlying valuation report for valuation 
for testing the reasonableness and also recomputed the 
movement in "Revaluation reserve".
•	
Ensured the appropriateness and reasonableness of 
methodology, assumptions and judgements used by 
management with reference to the valuation and impairment 
of investments as per the Company's Board approved 
valuation and impairment policy. Obtained third party 
valuation price reports as per the Company's policy as 
relevant and understood such methodology to conclude on 
the reasonableness.
•	
Obtained written representations from management on 
compliance of valuation of investments with the regulations 
and adequacy of impairment recorded for the year

The Company’s management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report, which is expected to be made available 
to us after that date.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the standalone 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained during 
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
MANAGEMENT’S AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR 
THE 
STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone 
financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs, net surplus/deficit, profit/loss and 
receipts and payments of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the provisions of the Insurance Act, the IRDA Act, 
the IRDA Financial Statements Regulations and orders/
directions/circulars issued by the IRDAI in this regard and 
Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of 
the Act, to the extent applicable. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the standalone financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management and Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing 
the Company’s financial reporting process.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT 
OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to the financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude 
on 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
Management and Board of Directors use of the 
going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the standalone financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as 
a going concern.

•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
standalone financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current year and are therefore, the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
OTHER MATTER
The actuarial valuation of liabilities for life policies in 
force and policies in respect of which premium has been 
discontinued but liability exists as at 31 March 2024 is 
the responsibility of the Company’s Appointed Actuary 
(the “Appointed Actuary”). The actuarial valuation of 
these liabilities for life policies in force and for policies 
in respect of which premium has been discontinued 
but liability exists as at 31 March 2024 has been duly 
certified by the Appointed Actuary and in his opinion,

Appointed Actuary’s certificate in this regard for forming 
our opinion on the valuation of liabilities for life policies 
in force and for policies in respect of which premium has 
been discontinued but liability exists in the standalone 
financial statements of the Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

CONTROLS 
WITH 
REFERENCE TO THE AFORESAID STANDALONE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER CLAUSE (I) 
OF SUB-SECTION 3 OF SECTION 143 OF THE 
COMPANIES ACT, 2013
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company 
Limited (the “Company”) as at and for the year ended 
31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements of the Company as at that date
MANAGEMENT’S AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS
The Company’s management and the Board of Directors 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under Insurance Act, 1938 (the 
“Insurance Act”), as amended from time to time, including 
amendment brought by Insurance Laws (Amendment), 
Act 2015, the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority Act, 1999 (the “IRDA Act”), the Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority (Preparation of 
Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report of Insurance 
Companies) Regulations, 2002 (the “IRDA Financial 
Statements Regulations”), orders/ directions/circulars 
issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (the “IRDAI”) and the Companies Act, 
2013 (the “Act”), to the extent applicable.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under 
section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements were established and maintained 
and whether such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit 
of internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS 
WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
standalone financial statements include those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management

and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the standalone financial statements.
INHERENT 
LIMITATIONS 
OF 
INTERNAL 
FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO 
STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
standalone 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
OPINION
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls system with 
reference to the standalone financial statements and 
such internal financial controls were operating effectively 
as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note.
OTHER MATTER
The actuarial valuation of liabilities for life policies in 
force and policies in respect of which premium has been 
discontinued but liability exists as at 31 March 2024 has 
been certified by the Appointed Actuary as per the IRDA 
Financial Statements Regulations, and has been relied 
upon by us, as mentioned in paragraphs “Other Matter” 
of our audit report on the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended 31 March 2024. Accordingly, our 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference 
to the standalone financial statements does not include 
reporting on the design and operating effectiveness of 
the management’s internal controls over the valuation 
and accuracy of the aforesaid actuarial valuation.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

2.13. Interest rate derivatives
Interest rate derivative contracts are used for hedging of

on Accounting for Derivative Contracts’ issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
and IRDAI Investment Master Circular as amended 
from time to time.

the relationship between the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item, the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge, nature of risk 
being hedged, identification of the instrument and the 
hedged item and the methods used to assess the hedge 
effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is the extent to 
which changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the 
hedging instrument offset changes in the fair value or 
the cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness 
is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and 
on each reporting date.
The Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) contract is 
valued at the difference between the market value 
of underlying bond at the spot reference yield taken 
from the SEBI approved rating agency and present 
value of the contracted forward price of underlying 
bond including present value of intermediate coupon 
inflows from valuation date till FRA contract settlement 
date, discounted by the INR-Overnight Index Swap 
(OIS) rate curve.
The Company follows cash flow hedge accounting for 
interest rate derivatives. The portion of the fair value 
gain/loss on the interest rate derivative that is determined 
to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in ‘Credit/
(Debit) Fair Value Change Account’ in the Balance Sheet 
under policyholders' funds and the portion that gets 
determined as ineffective hedge or ineffective portion 
of effective hedge, based on the hedge effectiveness 
assessment is recognized in the Revenue Account under 
head “Transfer/Gain on revaluation/Change in fair value”.
The accumulated gains or losses that were recognised 
directly in the ‘Credit/(Debit) Fair Value Change Account’ 
in the Balance Sheet are reclassified into the Revenue 
Account, in the same period or periods during which 
income on the investments acquired from underlying 
forecasted cash flow is recognized in the Revenue 
Account. In the event that all or any portion of gain or 
loss, recognised directly in the ‘Credit/(Debit) Fair Value 
Change Account’ in the Balance Sheet is not expected 
to be recovered in future periods, the amount that 
is not expected to be recovered is reclassified to the 
Revenue Account.
2.14. Loans
Loans are stated at historical cost less repayments, 
subject to provision for impairment, if any.
Loans are classified as short term in case the maturity is 
less than twelve months. Loans other than short term are 
classified as long term.
2.15. Fixed assets and Impairment
2.15.1. Tangible assets and depreciation
Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if 
any. Cost includes the purchase price net of any trade 
discounts and rebates, any import duties and other 
taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable from 
the tax authorities) any cost directly attributable to bring 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use 
and other incidental expenses incurred upto that date. 
Subsequent expenditure incurred on tangible assets is 
expensed out except where such expenditure results in 
an increase in future benefits from the existing assets 
beyond its previously assessed standard of performance.

Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 specifies the 
useful life of eight years for motor vehicles. As per 
Company policy, the motor vehicle is transferred to the 
employee on completion of five years or at written down 
value (WDV) in case of separation of employee before 
five years. Accordingly, the Company depreciates motor 
vehicles over five years. Assets costing upto ` 5,000 are 
considered to be immaterial in value and hence fully 
depreciated in the month of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method 
(‘SLM’) prorated from the date of being ready to use, upto 
the date of sale, based on estimated useful life for each 
class of asset.
The useful life of tangible assets are periodically reviewed. 
2.15.2. Intangibles
Intangible assets comprising software are stated at 
cost less amortisation. Significant expenditure on 
improvements to software are capitalised when it is 
probable that such expenditure will enable the asset 
to generate future economic benefits in excess of its 
originally assessed standards of performance and such 
expenditure can be measured and attributed to the asset 
reliably. Subsequent capital expenditures are amortised 
over the remaining useful life of the original software. 
Software expenses are amortised using SLM over a 
period of four years from the date of being ready to use.
The useful life of intangible assets are periodically reviewed.
2.15.3. Capital work in progress
Assets not ready for their intended use and other capital 
work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct 
cost and related incidental expenses.
2.15.4. Impairment of assets
Management periodically assesses, using external and 
internal sources, whether there is any indication that 
an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset 
unit is made. Impairment occurs where the carrying 
value of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling 
price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value 
of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from 
the continuing use of the asset and its ultimate disposal. 
If at the Balance Sheet date there is an indication that 
a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, 
the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset 
is reflected at the recoverable amount, subject to a 
maximum of depreciable historical cost.
2.16. Taxation
2.16.1. Direct taxes
Income tax expense comprises of current tax (i.e. 
amount of tax for the year determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961) and deferred tax 
charge or credit (reflecting the tax effects of timing 
differences between accounting income and taxable 
income for the year).
Current tax is the amount expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities after taking credit for allowances and 
exemptions in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The Company calculates tax for the participating 
lines of business in order to ensure that the expenses 
pertaining to and identifiable with a particular line of 
business are represented as such to enable a more 
appropriate presentation of the financial statements. 
Accordingly, tax charge/credit on surplus/deficit arising 
from the participating line of business is disclosed 
separately in the Revenue account.
2.16.2. Indirect taxes
Goods and Services tax liability on life insurance 
service is set-off against the respective input tax credits 
available from tax paid on input services for each state. 
Un-utilised credits, if any, are carried forward under 
“Advances and other assets” for future set-off, where 
there is reasonable certainty of utilisation. 
2.17. Provisions and contingencies
Provision is recognised when the company has a present 
obligation as a result of past event and it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are determined on the basis of best estimate 
of the outflow of economic resources required to settle 
the obligation at the reporting date. These estimates are 
reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimates. 
A disclosure of a contingent liability is made when there 
is a possible obligation or present obligations that may, 
but probably will not, require an outflow of resources or 
it cannot be reliably estimated. When there is a possible

obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision 
or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed. 
2.18. Segmental reporting 
Identification of segments
Based on the primary segments identified under IRDA 
(Preparation of Financial Statements and Auditors’ 
Report of Insurance Companies) Regulations 2002 (‘the 
Regulations’) read with AS 17 on “Segmental Reporting” 
notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 
and rules thereunder, the Company has classified 
and disclosed segmental information separately for 
Shareholders’ and Policyholders’. Within Policyholders’, 
the businesses are further segmented into Participating 
(Life and Pension), Non-Participating (Life and Pension), 
Non-Participating variable (Life and Pension), Annuity, 
Health and Linked (Life, Pension, Health and Group). 
There are no reportable geographical segments, since all 
business is written in India.
Allocation/ Apportionment methodology 
The allocation and apportionment of revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities to specific segments is done in the 
following manner, which is applied on a consistent basis.
•	
Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities that are 
directly identifiable to the respective segments, are 
allocated on actual basis;
•	
Other revenue, expenses (including depreciation 
and amortisation), assets and liabilities that are 
not directly identifiable to a respective segment are 
apportioned based on one or combination of some 
of the relevant drivers which includes:
•	
Number of policies
•	
Number of claims
•	
Annualised premium since inception
•	
Sum assured
•	
Premium income 
•	
Medical cases
•	
Funds under management
•	
Commission
•	
Total 
operating 
expenses 
(for 
assets 
and liabilities)
•	
Use of asset (for depreciation expense)
The accounting policies used in segmental reporting 
are the same as those used in the preparation of 
financial statements.
2.19.	 Foreign exchange transactions
Initial recognition: Foreign currency transactions are 
recorded in Indian Rupees, by applying to the foreign 
currency amount the exchange rate between the 
Indian Rupee and the foreign currency at the date of 
the transaction. 
Conversion: Foreign currency monetary items are 
translated using the exchange rate prevailing at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary items, which are 
measured in terms of historical cost denominated in a 
foreign currency, are reported using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items, which 
are measured at fair value or other similar valuation 
denominated in a foreign currency, are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date when such value 
was determined. 
Exchange differences: Exchange differences arising 
on such conversions are recognised as income or as 
expenses in the period in which they arise either in the 
Revenue Account or the Profit and Loss Account, as 
the case may be.
2.20.	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss after tax for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of 
calculating diluted earnings per share, the profit or loss 
after tax for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
and the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive 
potential equity shares which could have been issued on 
the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 
if their conversion to equity shares would decrease 
the net profit per share from continuing ordinary 
operations. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed 
to be converted as at the beginning of the period, unless 
they have been issued at a later date. The dilutive 
potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds 
receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair 
value. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined 
independently for each period presented.
2.21. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of Receipts 
and Payments account include cash and cheques in 
hand, bank balances, liquid mutual funds and other 
investments with original maturity of three months or 
less which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in

Investment Regulations, 2016 as amended from time to 
time. The Company maintains a single segregated fund 
to manage all unclaimed amounts.
Unclaimed amount of policyholders’ liability is determined 
on the basis of NAV of the units outstanding as at the 
valuation date.
Assets held for unclaimed amount of policyholders 
and unclaimed amount of policyholders’ liability are 
considered as current assets and current liabilities, 
respectively and are disclosed in Schedule 12 “Advances 
and Other Assets” and Schedule 13 “Current Liabilities”.

to the unclaimed fund and is accounted for on an accrual 
basis, net of fund management charges, and is disclosed 
under the head “Interest on unclaimed amounts” in 
Schedule 4 “Benefits paid” in Revenue account. 
The unclaimed of policyholders except litigation cases 
which are more than 120 months as on 30th September

3.3. Actuarial method and assumptions
The actuarial liability in respect of both participating 
and non-participating policies is calculated using the 
gross premium method, using assumptions for interest, 
mortality, morbidity, persistency, expense, inflation and in 
the case of participating policies, future bonuses together 
with allowance for taxation and allocation of profits to 
shareholders. These assumptions are determined as 
prudent estimates at the date of valuation including 
allowances for possible adverse deviations. 
The liability for the unexpired portion of the risk for the 
non-unit liabilities of linked business and attached riders 
is the higher of the liability calculated using discounted 
cash flows and the unearned premium reserve. 
An unexpired risk reserve and a reserve in respect of 
claims incurred but not reported is held for contracts 
wherein there is a possibility of lag in intimation of claims.
The unit liability in respect of linked business is the value of 
the units standing to the credit of policyholders, using the 
Net Asset Value (‘NAV') prevailing at the valuation date.
A 
brief 
of 
the 
assumptions 
used 
in 
actuarial 
valuation is as below:
a)	
The interest rates used for valuing the liabilities 
are in the range of 5.04% to 6.56% per annum. 
The interest rates used at March 31, 2023 were in 
the range of 4.99% to 6.58%per annum. 
b)	
Mortality rates used are based on the published 
“Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2012 – 2014) Ult.” 
mortality table for assurances and “Indian Individual 
Annuitant’s Mortality Table (2012-15)” table for 
annuities adjusted to reflect expected experience. 
Morbidity rates used are based on CIBT 93 table, 
adjusted for expected experience, or on risk rates 
provided by reinsurers.
c)	
Expenses are provided for at least at the current 
levels in respect of renewal expenses, with no 
allowance for any future improvement.
d)	
Per policy renewal expenses are assumed to 
inflate at 4.91% per annum. The expense inflation 
assumption used at March 31, 2023 was 4.90%.
e)	
The bonus rates for participating business to 
be declared in the future is consistent with the 
valuation assumptions.
f)	
The tax rate applicable for valuation at March 31, 
2024 is 14.56% per annum. The tax rate applicable for 
valuation at March 31, 2023 was 14.56% per annum.
Certain explicit additional provisions are made, which 
include the following: 
a)	
Reserves for additional expenses that the Company 
may have to incur if it were to close to new business 
twelve months after the valuation date.
b)	
Reserves for guarantees available to individual and 
group insurance policies.
c)	
Reserves 
for 
cost 
of 
non-negative 
claw 
back additions.
d)	
Reserves for free look option given to policyholders 
calculated using a free look cancellation rate of 2.00% 
as on March 31, 2024. The free look cancellation 
assumption used at March 31, 2023 was 2.30%. 
e)	
Reserves for lapsed policies eligible for revivals.
f)	
An additional reserve is held for incurred but not 
reported claims.
3.4. Funds for Future Appropriations (‘FFA’)
The balance of participating FFA of ` 12,865,780 thousand 
(March 31, 2023: ` 16,692,745 thousand) is not available 
for distribution to the shareholders. Such amount is 
classified under Funds for Future appropriations in 
the Balance Sheet.
3.5. Claims settled and remaining unpaid
Claims settled and remaining unpaid for a period of more 
than six months at March 31, 2024 is ` 68,652 thousand 
(March 31, 2023: ` 73,399 thousand). These claims remain 
unpaid awaiting receipt of duly executed discharge 
documents from the claimants or litigation pending.
3.6. Reconciliation of unclaimed amounts of 
policyholders
The unclaimed amount of policyholders is governed 
by the IRDAI Master circular no. IRDA/F&A/CIR/
Misc/282/11/2020 dated November 17, 2020 and 
Investment Regulations, 2016 as amended from time to 
time. The Company maintains a single segregated fund 
to manage all unclaimed amounts.
The amount in the unclaimed fund has been disclosed 
in schedule 12 as “Assets held for unclaimed amount 
of policyholders”. Investment income accruing to the 
unclaimed fund has been credited to the fund and

prudent 
compensation practices under the guidance of the Board

Board, and shall work in close coordination with the

assessment, it makes recommendations to the Board 
regarding compensation for MD & CEO and other

aligned to both pre-defined performance objectives of the 
Company as well as prudent risk parameters. In addition,

financial success of the Company through stock option 
grants/stock unit grants that vest over a period of time.

The 
Company 
follows 
prudent 
compensation 
practices under the guidance of the Board and the 
Board Nominations & Remuneration Committee 
(BNRC). The Company’s approach to compensation 
is based on the ethos of meritocracy and fairness 
within the framework of prudent risk management. 
The performance rating assigned to employees is 
based on an assessment of performance delivered 
against a set of defined performance objectives. 
These objectives are balanced in nature and 
comprise a holistic mix of financial, customer, 
people, process, quality, compliance objectives and/
or any other parameters as may be deemed fit.
•	
For the MD & CEO and other wholetime Directors 
and KMPs/SMPs, compensation is sought to be 
aligned to both pre-defined performance objectives 
of the Company as well as prudent risk parameters.
•	
For the MD & CEO and other wholetime Directors 
and KMPs/SMPs, the quantum of bonus does not 
exceed a certain percentage (as stipulated in the 
Compensation Policy) of total fixed pay in a year; a 
minimum of 50% (as stipulated in the Compensation 
Policy) will be under deferment. If the bonus amount 
is under ` 25 lakhs, the deferment shall not be 
applicable. The deferral period would be spread over 
a minimum period of three years (deferment period). 
The frequency of vesting will be on annual basis and 
the first vesting shall not be before one year from the 
commencement of deferral period. The vesting shall 
be no faster than a prorata basis. Additionally, vesting 
will not be more frequent than on a yearly basis.
•	
The deferred part of the variable pay (performance 
bonus and long term pay in the form of stock options/
stock units) for wholetime Directors and KMPs/SMPs 
is subject to malus, under which, the Company will 
prevent vesting of all or part of the variable pay in 
the event of an enquiry determining gross negligence 
or integrity breach.
•	
In malus clawback arrangements with wholetime 
Directors and KMPs/SMPs, the employee agrees to 
return, in case asked for, the previously paid variable 
pay to the Company in the events as stated in the 
Compensation Policy including gross negligence, 
misconduct, integrity breach, deterioration in financial 
performance.  
•	
Errors of judgment shall not be construed to be 
breaches.
Description of the ways in which the Company seeks to 
link performance during a performance measurement 
period with levels of remuneration.
The Company’s approach to compensation is based on the 
ethos of meritocracy and fairness within the framework of 
prudent risk management. The extent of variable pay for 
individual employees is linked to individual performance for 
sales frontline employees and to individual & organisation 
performance 
for 
non-sales 
frontline 
employees 
& 
employees in the management cadre. For the latter, the 
performance rating assigned is based on assessment 
of performance delivered against a set of defined 
performance objectives. These objectives are balanced in 
nature, and comprise a holistic mix of financial, customer, 
people, process, quality and compliance objectives and/
or any other parameters as may be deemed fit. For the 
MD & CEO , other wholetime Directors and KMPs/SMPs to 
ensure effective alignment of compensation with prudent 
risk parameters, the Company takes into account various 
risk parameters along with other pre-defined performance 
objectives of the Company.

Pursuant to IRDAI letter 100/2/Ind AS- Mission Mode/2022-23/1 dated July 14, 2022, a disclosure on the strategy for 
Ind AS implementation and progress in this regard is given below:
In January 2020, IRDAI issued a circular stating that the effective implementation date of Ind AS in the Indian insurance

In June 2020, IASB notified the amended IFRS 17 with an effective date on or after January 1, 2023. In February 2022, 
ICAI issued an exposure draft of amendments to Ind AS 117 – Insurance Contracts, aligning it with IFRS 17. The amended 
Ind AS 117 is currently awaiting formal notification.
Further, during FY2024, the company received communication from IRDAI regarding the phased implementation of 
IFRS/IND AS in the insurance sector and the Company has been identified under phase 1 Insurer Category to implement 
Ind AS from April 1, 2025.
The Company has implemented IFRS 17 as part of consolidation for its foreign promotor and has prepared the opening 
balance sheet at January 1, 2022 as well as the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 
December 31, 2023. The Company expects to leverage this experience to comply with any additional requirements that 
may be stipulated in the final notification of Ind AS 117 and Ind AS 109.

OPINION
We have audited the accompanying consolidatd financial

and Consolidated Receipts and Payments Account for the 
year then ended and the schedules annexed there to, a 
summary of the significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the

In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of report of the other auditor on 
separate financial statements of such subsidiary as were 
audited by the other auditor, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Insurance Act, 1938 (the “Insurance Act”), as amended 
from time to time, including amendment brought by 
Insurance Laws (Amendment), Act 2015 the Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 (the 
“IRDA Act”), the Insurance Regulatory and Development

and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of 
affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2024, its consolidated 
net surplus, its consolidated profit and its consolidated 
receipts and payments for the year then ended.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms 
of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act 
and Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and 
the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us along with the consideration of audit 
report of the other auditor referred to in sub-paragraph 
(b) of the “Other Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
We have determined the matters described below to be 
the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Information Technology (IT) systems and controls related to financial reporting process
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
The Holding Company is highly dependent on its complex 
IT infrastructure comprising hardware, software, multiple 
applications, automated interfaces and controls in systems for 
recording, storing and reporting of financial transactions.
The Holding Company’s key financial accounting and reporting 
processes such as premium income, commission, benefits 
paid, investments amongst others are highly dependent 
on IT systems including automated controls, to process and 
record large volume of transactions on daily basis as part of 
its operations, such that there exists a risk that gaps in the 
IT control environment could result in the financial accounting 
and reporting records being materially misstated.
We have involved our IT specialists in our assessment of the IT 
systems and controls with respect to financial statements, which 
included, but were not limited to the following:
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Holding Company’s General 
IT Control (GITC) over key financial accounting and reporting 
systems, and supporting control systems (referred to as in-
scope systems);
•	
On the in-scope systems, we have tested the design and operating 
effectiveness of key IT general controls. This included evaluation 
of entity’s controls to ensure segregation of duties and access 
rights are based on duly approved requests, access for exit cases 
being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being 
re-certified during the period of audit, evaluation of password 
policies. Further, controls related to program change were 
evaluated to verify whether the changes were approved, tested in 
an environment that was segregated from production and moved 
to production by appropriate users;

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls related to financial reporting process
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
Due to the pervasive nature, complexity and importance of the 
impact of the IT systems and related control environment on the 
Holding Company’s financial statements, we have identified 
testing of such IT systems and related control environment as 
a key audit matter for the current year audit.
•	
Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness 
for the audit period over the in-scope systems around system 
interfaces, reconciliations and system processing relevant to the 
audit of premium income, commission expense, benefits paid 
and investments, for evaluating completeness and accuracy;
•	
Evaluated policies and strategies adopted by the Holding 
Company in relation to security of key information 
infrastructure, data and client information management and 
monitoring;
•	
Where deficiencies, if any, were identified, tested compensating 
controls or performed alternative procedures; and
•	
Obtained written representations from management on 
whether IT general controls and automated IT controls are 
designed and were operating effectively during the year.
Valuation and impairment determination of Investments (31 March 2024: INR 2,897,279,225, 31 March 2023: INR 
2,482,157,761) (INR in thousands)
Refer Schedule 8,8A and 8B of the consolidated financial statements and refer schedule 16 note 2.13 on accounting 
policy
Key audit matter
How our audit has addressed the key audit matter
The Holding Company’s investment portfolio consists of 
Policyholders investments (unit linked and non-linked) and 
Shareholders investments. Total investment portfolio represents 
around 99% of the Holding Company’s total assets as at 31 
March 2024
Investments are valued in accordance with the Board approved 
investment policy framed by the Holding Company as per the 
provisions of the Insurance Act, the IRDA Financial Statements 
Regulations, IRDAI (Investment) Regulations, 2016 and the 
applicable orders/ directions/ circulars issued by IRDAI
Investments in unit linked portfolio of INR 1,648,424,014 
thousands are valued based on observable inputs as per their 
accounting policy and gains/losses are recognized in Revenue 
account. These unit linked portfolio investments do not represent 
higher risk of material misstatement however, are considered to 
be a key audit matter due to their materiality to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Investments in non-linked and shareholders portfolio of INR 
1,248,855,211 thousands are valued as per their accounting 
policy, based on which:
•	
the unrealized gains/ losses arising due to changes in fair 
value of listed equity shares and mutual fund units are 
recorded in the “Fair Value Change Account” in the Balance 
Sheet; and
•	
debt securities and unlisted equity shares are valued at 
historical cost.
Further, investments in the non-linked and shareholders portfolio 
are assessed for impairment as per the Holding Company’s 
investment policy which involves significant management 
judgement. There is increased economic stress on account 
of external factors, which may impact the valuation of these 
investments
Accordingly, valuation of investments (including impairment 
assessment) was considered to be one of the areas which required 
significant auditor attention and was one of the matter of most 
significance in the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit procedures for this area included but were not limited 
to the following
•	
Obtained an understanding of the Holding Company’s 
process and controls over the valuation of investments. 
The understanding was obtained by performance of 
walkthroughs, which included inspection of documents 
produced by the Holding Company and discussion with those 
involved in the pertinent process;
•	
Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of key controls over the valuation 
process, including the Holding Company’s assessment and 
approval of assumptions used for the valuation including key 
authorisation and data input controls thereof;
•	
Obtained independent external confirmations for investments 
as at balance sheet date from the Custodians and Depository 
Participants appointed by the Holding Company to confirm 
the units of securities for the purpose of valuation re-
computation;
•	
On a test check basis, recomputed valuation of different class of 
investments to assess appropriateness of valuation methodologies 
with reference to IRDAI Investment Regulations along with the 
Holding Company’s Board approved valuation policy
•	
Examined movement and appropriateness of accounting in 
Fair Value Change account for specific investments. Further, 
in case of revaluation done for investment properties, 
examined the underlying valuation report for valuation 
for testing the reasonableness and also recomputed the 
movement in “Revaluation reserve”;
•	
Ensured the appropriateness and reasonableness of 
methodology, assumptions and judgements used by 
management with reference to the valuation and impairment 
of investments as per the Holding Company’s Board 
approved valuation and impairment policy. Obtained third 
party valuation price reports as per the Holding Company’s 
policy as relevant andunderstood such methodology to 
conclude on the reasonableness.
•	
Obtained written representations from management on 
compliance of valuation of investments with the regulations 
and adequacy of impairment recorded for the year.

AUDITOR’S 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR 
THE 
AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, that could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls based on our audit.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Management 
and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing of consolidated financial

statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of such entities 
or business activities within the Group to express 
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of financial information 
of such entity included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entity included in the consolidated 
financial statements, which have been audited by 
other auditor, such other auditor remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities 
in this regard are further described in para (b) of the 
section titled ‘Other Matters’ in this audit report.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along 
with the consideration of audit report of the other auditor 
referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company of which we are the independent 
auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current year and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.
OTHER MATTER
(a)	 The actuarial valuation of liabilities for life policies in 
force and policies in respect of which premium has been 
discontinued but liability exists as at 31 March 2024 is 
the responsibility of the Holding Company’s Appointed 
Actuary (the “Appointed Actuary”). The actuarial 
valuation of these liabilities for life policies in force 
and for policies in respect of which premium has been 
discontinued but liability exists as at 31 March 2024 
has been duly certified by the Appointed Actuary and 
in his opinion, the assumptions for such valuation are 
in accordance with the guidelines and norms issued 
by IRDAI and the Institute of Actuaries of India in 
concurrence with the Authority. We have relied upon 
the Appointed Actuary’s certificate in this regard for 
forming our opinion on the valuation of liabilities for 
life policies in force and for policies in respect of which 
premium has been discontinued but liability exists for 
these financial statements.
(b)	 We did not audit the financial statements of a 
subsidiary company, whose financial statements 
reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) 
of Rs. 615,928 thousand as at 31 March 2024, total 
revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 
216,571 thousand, loss before tax (before consolidation 
adjustments) of Rs. 27,090 thousand and net cash 
outflow (before consolidation adjustments) amounting 
to Rs. 35,351 thousand for the year ended on that date, 
as considered in the consolidated financial statements. 
These financial statements have been audited by other 
auditor whose report has been furnished to us by the 
Holding Company’s Management, and our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates 
to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of 
such subsidiary and our report in terms of sub-section 
(3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the 
aforesaid subsidiary, is based solely on the audit report 
of the other auditor.
	
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and 
our Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
below, is not modified in respect of the above matters 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the 
report of the other auditor.

ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS OF ICICI PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 
MARCH 2024
Annexure A
INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S 
REPORT 
ON 
THE 
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE 
TO THE AFORESAID CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 
3 OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company 
Limited as at and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we 
have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements of ICICI Prudential 
Life Insurance Company Limited (hereinafter referred to 
as “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary company 
“ICICI Prudential Pension Funds Management Company 
Limited”, which is a company incorporated in India under 
the Companies Act, 2013 as of that date.
MANAGEMENT’S AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS
The respective Company’s management and Board 
of Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements based on the criteria 
established by the respective Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding 
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and 
errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under Insurance Act, 1938 (the 
“Insurance Act”), as amended from time to time, including 
amendment brought by Insurance Laws (Amendment), 
Act 2015, the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority Act, 1999 (the “IRDA Act”), the Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority (Preparation of 
Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report of Insurance 
Companies) Regulations, 2002 (the “IRDA Financial 
Statements Regulations”), orders/ directions/circulars 
issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (the “IRDAI”) and the Companies Act, 
2013 (the “Act”), to the extent applicable.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and 
the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements were established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding 
of 
internal 
financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that 
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of the internal 
controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor 
of the subsidiary in terms of their report referred to in 
the “Other Matters” paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS 
WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
A Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
A Company's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements includes those policies

and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the 
risk that the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
OPINION
In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary 
company incorporated in India, have in all material 
respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements and such 
internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 
31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to consolidated financial statements 
criteria established by such companies considering the 
essential components of such internal controls stated in 
the Guidance Note.
OTHER MATTER
a.	
The actuarial valuation of liabilities for life policies 
in force and policies in respect of which premium 
has been discontinued but liability exists as at 31 
March 2024 has been certified by the Holding 
Company’s Appointed Actuary as per the IRDA 
Financial Statement Regulations, and has been 
relied upon by us, as mentioned in “Other Matters” 
paragraph of our audit report on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended 31 March 2024. Accordingly, our opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements does not 
include reporting on the design and operating 
effectiveness of the management’s internal controls 
over the valuation and accuracy of the aforesaid 
actuarial valuation.
b.	
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness 
of the internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates 
to the subsidiary company, which is a company 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding 
report of the auditor of such subsidiary company 
incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides that eligible employees are granted options to

Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Intrinsic value is 
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair market price of 
the underlying shares over the exercise price on the grant 
date and amortised over the vesting period. The fair 
market price is the latest closing price, immediately prior 
to the grant date, on the stock exchange on which the 
shares of the holding company are listed. If the shares

settlement costs, if any.

intimation. Survival, maturity and annuity benefits are 
accounted when due. Withdrawals and surrenders 
under non linked policies are accounted on the receipt of 
intimation. Withdrawals and surrenders under unit linked 
policies are accounted in the respective schemes when 
the associated units are cancelled. Amount payable on 
lapsed/discontinued policies are accounted for on expiry of 
lock-in-period of these policies. Surrenders, withdrawals 
and lapsation are disclosed at net of charges recoverable. 
Claim settlement cost, legal & other fees form part of 
claim cost wherever applicable.

judicial authorities are provided for on prudent basis as 
considered appropriate by the management.
2.11. Policy liability valuation
The actuarial liabilities, for all inforce policies and policies 
where premiums are discontinued but a liability exists as 
at the valuation date, are calculated in accordance with 
the accepted actuarial practice, requirements of Insurance 
Act, 1938, as amended from time to time, regulations 
notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India, relevant Guidance Notes and Actuarial 
Practice Standards of the Institute of Actuaries of India.
The prescribed method of valuation is the Gross Premium 
Valuation (GPV). The reserve held represents the net 
present value of benefits and expenses less premiums. 
The following is the broad method of the valuation.
•	
The reserves are calculated on a per policy basis.
•	
Any negative reserves are zeroised, so that a policy 
is not treated as an asset.
•	
The minimum value of reserves is the higher of 
the guaranteed surrender value, non-guaranteed 
surrender value, and zero.
•	
For Linked business, unit liabilities are fully matched 
and a non-unit reserve is also held which includes 
provisions for any costs of guarantees provided 
under the products.
•	
GPV 
under 
non-linked 
participating 
policies 
have a reference to the asset share of policies at 
valuation date.
The liabilities for group one-year renewable policies are 
calculated on an unexpired risk premium basis. For non-
linked group savings products, account value is held 
as liabilities.
Valuation parameters are set prudently and include a 
margin for adverse deviation (MAD) as required under 
APS7 issued by Institute of Actuaries of India.
2.12. Funds for Future Appropriations (FFA)
The Funds for Future Appropriations (FFA), in the 
participating segment, represents the surplus, which is 
not allocated to policyholders or shareholders as at the

2.13.3. Valuation - Unit Linked Funds of the holding 
company
Debt securities (including Government securities):
Central and State government securities are valued as per 
the valuation price provided by Credit Rating Information 
Services of India Limited (CRISIL).
Debt securities other than government securities with a 
residual maturity over 182 days are valued on a yield to 
maturity basis, by using spreads over the benchmark rate 
(based on the matrix released by CRISIL) to arrive at the 
yield for pricing the security.
Debt securities with a residual maturity upto 182 days are 
valued at last valuation price plus the difference between 
the redemption value and last valuation price, based on 
effective interest rate method over the remaining period 
to maturity of instrument. (based on the matrix released 
by the CRISIL).
Securities with call option are valued at the lower of 
the value as obtained by valuing the security upto final 
maturity date or the call option date. In case there are 
multiple call options, the security is valued at the lowest 
value obtained by valuing the security at various call 
dates or upto the final maturity date (based on the matrix 
released by the CRISIL)
Securities with put option are valued at the higher of 
the value as obtained by valuing the security upto final 
maturity date or the put option date. In case there are 
multiple put options, the security is valued at the highest 
value obtained by valuing the security at various put 
dates or upto the final maturity date (based on the matrix 
released by CRISIL)
The securities with both put and call option on the same 
day would be deemed to mature on the put/call date and 
would be valued on a yield to maturity basis, by using 
spreads over the benchmark rate based on the matrix 
released by CRISIL. Investments in reverse repo and tri-
party repo are valued at cost plus interest accrued.
Money market instruments:
Money market instruments like commercial paper, 
certificate of deposits and treasury bills are valued at 
historical cost, subject to accretion of discount over 
the period of maturity/holding based on effective 
interest rate method. 
Equity shares, redeemable preference shares, equity 
ETFs and Mutual Funds:
Listed equity shares, redeemable preference shares 
and equity ETF are valued at market value, being the 
last quoted closing price on NSE (in case of securities 
not listed on NSE, the last quoted closing price on BSE 
is used). Equity shares lent under the Securities Lending 
and Borrowing scheme (SLB) continue to be recognised 
in the Balance Sheet as the holding company retains all 
the associated risks and rewards of these securities. 
Non-traded and thinly traded equity share are valued 
at last available price on NSE/BSE or the value derived 
using valuation principle of net worth per share, 
whichever is lower.
Mutual fund units are valued based on previous day’s 
Net Asset Value.
Venture funds:
Venture fund units are valued at the latest audited net 
asset value of the respective fund. 
Fixed deposits:
Fixed deposits with banks are valued at cost.
Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the 
Revenue Account as prescribed by IRDAI (Preparation of 
Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report of Insurance 
Companies) Regulations 2002.
2.13.4. Valuation – Subsidiary
Investments that are readily realizable and intended to 
be held for not more than a year from the Balance Sheet 
date are classified as current investments. All other 
investments are classified as non-current investments. 
Current investments are carried at lower of cost or 
fair value determined on an individual security basis. 
Non-current investments are carried at cost, subject 
to amortization of premium or accretion of discount 
over the remaining period of maturity/holding based 
on Yield to Maturity (effective interest rate method). 
Provision for diminution in value is made to recognize 
other than temporary decline in the value of investments. 
The provision shall be written back once the fair value of 
the investment reaches its original book value.
2.13.5. Transfer of investments (for holding company)
Transfer of investments from Shareholders’ account 
to the Policyholders’ account to meet the deficit in the 
Policyholders’ account is made at the cost price or market 
price, whichever is lower. In case of debt securities 
including money market instruments, all transfers 
are made at the lower of the market price and the net 
amortized cost.

2.13.6. Provision for Non-Performing Assets (NPA)
An asset is classified as an NPA if the interest and/ or 
installment of principal remain overdue for more than 
90 days at Balance Sheet date. Provision is made in the 
Revenue Account and Profit and Loss Account based on 
the guidelines prescribed by IRDAI investment regulations.
2.14. Interest rate derivatives (for holding company)
Interest rate derivative contracts are used for hedging 
of highly probable forecasted transactions on insurance 
contracts and investment cash flows in life, pension 
and annuity business. The holding company follows 
hedge accounting in accordance with the ‘Guidance 
Note on Accounting for Derivative Contracts’ issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
and IRDAI Investment Master Circular as amended 
from time to time.
At the inception of the hedge, the holding company 
documents the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, nature 
of risk being hedged, identification of the instrument and 
the hedged item and the methods used to assess the 
hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is the extent 
to which changes in the fair value or the cash flows of 
the hedging instrument offset changes in the fair value or 
the cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is 
ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and on 
each reporting date.
The Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) contract is valued at 
the difference between the market value of underlying bond 
at the spot reference yield taken from the SEBI approved 
rating agency and present value of the contracted 
forward price of underlying bond including present value 
of intermediate coupon inflows from valuation date till 
FRA contract settlement date, discounted by the INR-
Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate curve.
The holding company follows cash flow hedge accounting 
for interest rate derivatives. The portion of the fair value 
gain/loss on the interest rate derivative that is determined 
to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in ‘Credit/
(Debit) Fair Value Change Account’ in the Balance Sheet 
under policyholders’ funds and the portion that gets 
determined as ineffective hedge or ineffective portion 
of effective hedge, based on the hedge effectiveness 
assessment is recognized in the Revenue Account under 
head “Transfer/Gain on revaluation/Change in fair value”.
The accumulated gains or losses that were recognised 
directly in the ‘Credit/(Debit) Fair Value Change Account’ 
in the Balance Sheet are reclassified into the Revenue 
Account, in the same period or periods during which 
income on the investments acquired from underlying 
forecasted cash flow is recognized in the Revenue 
Account. In the event that all or any portion of gain or 
loss, recognised directly in the ‘Credit/(Debit) Fair Value 
Change Account’ in the Balance Sheet is not expected 
to be recovered in future periods, the amount that 
is not expected to be recovered is reclassified to the 
Revenue Account.
2.15. Loans
Loans are stated at historical cost less repayments, subject 
to provision for impairment, if any.
Loans are classified as short term in case the maturity is 
less than twelve months. Loans other than short term are 
classified as long term.
2.16. Fixed assets and Impairment
2.16.1. Tangible assets and depreciation
Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if 
any. Cost includes the purchase price net of any trade 
discounts and rebates, any import duties, other taxes 
(other than those subsequently recoverable from the tax 
authorities) and any cost directly attributable to bring 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use 
and other incidental expenses incurred upto that date. 
Subsequent expenditure incurred on tangible assets is 
expensed out except where such expenditure results in 
an increase in future benefits from the existing assets 
beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. 
The useful life of various category of assets is as below:
Asset
Useful life (years)
Office buildings on freehold land
60
Improvement to leasehold properties
60 years or lease period 
whichever is lower 
Furniture and fixtures
5 to 10
Office equipment
5 to 10
Information technology equipment
3
Communication networks and 
servers
6
Motor vehicles

Assets costing upto ` 5,000 are considered to be 
immaterial in value and hence fully depreciated in the 
month of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided the using straight-line method 
(‘SLM’) prorated from the date of being ready to use, upto 
the date of sale, based on estimated useful life for each 
class of asset.

Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013 specifies the 
useful life of eight years for motor vehicles. As per holding 
company policy, the motor vehicle is transferred to the 
employee on completion of five years or at written down 
value (WDV) in case of separation of employee before 
five years. Accordingly, the holding company depreciates 
motor vehicles over five years.
The useful life of tangible assets are periodically reviewed.
2.16.2. Intangibles
Intangible assets comprising software are stated at 
cost less amortisation. Significant expenditure on 
improvements to software are capitalised when it is 
probable that such expenditure will enable the asset 
to generate future economic benefits in excess of its 
originally assessed standards of performance and such 
expenditure can be measured and attributed to the asset 
reliably. Subsequent capital expenditures are amortised 
over the remaining useful life of the original software. 
Software expenses are amortised using SLM over a 
period of four years from the date of being ready to use.
The useful life of intangible assets are periodically 
reviewed.
2.16.3. Capital work in progress
Assets not ready for their intended use and other capital 
work-in-progress are carried at cost, comprising direct 
cost and related incidental expenses..
2.16.4. Impairment of assets
Management periodically assesses, using external and 
internal sources, whether there is any indication that 
an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset 
unit is made. Impairment occurs where the carrying 
value of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s net selling 
price and its value in use. Value in use is the present value 
of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from 
the continuing use of the asset and its ultimate disposal. 
If at the Balance Sheet date there is an indication that 
a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, 
the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset 
is reflected at the recoverable amount, subject to a 
maximum of depreciable historical cost.
2.17. Taxation
2.17.1. Direct taxes
Income tax expense comprises of current tax (i.e. 
amount of tax for the year determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961) and deferred tax 
charge or credit (reflecting the tax effects of timing 
differences between accounting income and taxable 
income for the year).
Current tax is the amount expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities after taking credit for allowances and 
exemptions in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The holding company calculates tax for the participating 
lines of business in order to ensure that the expenses 
pertaining to and identifiable with a particular line of 
business are represented as such to enable a more 
appropriate presentation of the financial statements. 
Accordingly, tax charge/credit on surplus/deficit arising 
from the participating line of business is disclosed 
separately in the Revenue account.
The deferred tax asset and liabilities are recognised 
using the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised  and carried 
forward only to the extent there is reasonable certainty 
that sufficient future taxable income will be available 
against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. 
However, deferred tax asset in respect of unabsorbed 
depreciation or carried forward loss are recognised 
only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation   of 
such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and written down or written up to 
reflect the amount that is reasonable / virtually certain 
(as the case may be) to be realised. 
2.17.2. Indirect taxes
Goods and Services tax liability on output services is set-
off against the respective input tax credits available from 
tax paid on input services for each state. Unutilised credits, 
if any, are carried forward under “Advances and other 
assets” for future set-off, where there is reasonable 
certainty of utilisation .  
2.18. Provisions and contingencies
Provision is recognized when there is a present obligation 
as a result of past event and it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are 
determined based on the basis of best estimate of the 
outflow of economic resources required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date. These estimates are 
reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimates. 
A disclosure of a contingent liability is made when there 
is a possible obligation or present obligations that may, 
but probably will not, require an outflow of resources or 
it cannot be reliably estimated. When there is a possible 
obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the 
likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision 
or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets are neither recognised  nor disclosed.

2.19. Segmental reporting 
Identification of segments
Based on the primary segments identified in accordance 
with AS 17 on “Segmental Reporting” notified under section 
133 of the Companies Act 2013 and rules thereunder 
and IRDAI (Preparation of Financial Statements and 
Auditors’ Report of Insurance Companies) Regulations 
2002 (‘the Regulations’) the Group has classified 
and disclosed segmental information separately for 
Shareholders’ and Policyholders’ in consolidated financial 
statements. Within Policyholders’, the businesses are 
further segmented into Participating (Life and Pension), 
Non-Participating (Life and Pension), Non-Participating 
variable (Life and Pension), Annuity, Health and Linked 
(Life, Pension, Health and Group). 
There are no reportable geographical segments, since all 
business is written in India.
Allocation/ Apportionment methodology 
The allocation and apportionment of revenue, expenses, 
assets and liabilities to specific segments is done in the 
following manner, which is applied on a consistent basis.
•	
Revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities that are 
directly identifiable to the respective segments are 
allocated on actual basis;
•	
Other revenue, expenses (including depreciation 
and amortisation), assets and liabilities that are 
not directly identifiable to a respective segment are 
apportioned based on one or combination of some 
of the relevant drivers which includes:
•	
Number of policies
•	
Number of claims
•	
Annualised premium since inception
•	
Sum assured
•	
Premium income 
•	
Medical cases
•	
Funds under management
•	
Commission
•	
Total 
operating 
expenses 
(for 
assets 
and liabilities)
•	
Use of asset (for depreciation expense)
The accounting policies used in segmental reporting 
are the same as those used in the preparation of 
financial statements.
2.20.	 Foreign exchange transactions
Initial recognition: Foreign currency transactions are 
recorded in Indian Rupees, by applying to the foreign 
currency amount the exchange rate between the 
Indian Rupee and the foreign currency at the date of 
the transaction. 
Conversion: Foreign currency monetary items are 
translated using the exchange rate prevailing at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary items, which are 
measured in terms of historical cost denominated in a 
foreign currency, are reported using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items, which 
are measured at fair value or other similar valuation 
denominated in a foreign currency, are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date when such value 
was determined.
Exchange differences: Exchange differences arising 
on such conversions are recognised  as income or as 
expenses in the period in which they arise either in the 
Revenue Account or the Profit and Loss Account, as 
the case may be.
2.21.	 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
the profit or loss after tax for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders by the weighted average number 
of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the 
purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, 
the profit or loss after tax for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders and the weighted average number 
of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for 
the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares which 
could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares.
Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only 
if their conversion to equity shares would decrease 
the net profit per share from continuing ordinary 
operations. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed 
to be converted as at the beginning of the period, unless 
they have been issued at a later date. The dilutive 
potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds 
receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair 
value. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined 
independently for each period presented.
2.22.	 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of Receipts 
and Payments account include cash and cheques in 
hand, bank balances, liquid mutual funds and other 
investments with original maturity of three months or less 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Consolidated receipts and payments account is prepared 
and reported using the Direct Method in accordance with 
Accounting Standard (AS) 3, "Cash Flow Statements".

disputing input tax credit (‘ITC’) being availed and utilised by The holding company. The holding company believes that ITC utilised is in compliance with 
the provisions of applicable laws and accordingly the holding company has submitted suitable reply to the said SCN. 
3.2.	 Pending litigations
The holding company’s pending litigation comprises of claims against The holding company primarily by the customers 
and proceedings pending with Tax authorities. The holding company has reviewed all its pending litigations and 
proceedings and has adequately provided for where provisions are required and disclosed the contingent liabilities 
where applicable, in its financial statements. The holding company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings 
to have a material adverse effect on its financial statements at March 31, 2024. Refer note 3.1 for details on 
contingent liabilities. 
In respect of litigations, where the management assessment of a financial outflow is probable, the holding company has 
made a provision of ` 1,218,562 thousand at March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023: ` 1,077,754 thousand).
3.3. Actuarial method and assumptions
The actuarial liability in respect of both participating and non-participating policies is calculated using the gross 
premium method, using assumptions for interest, mortality, morbidity, expense and inflation and, in the case of 
participating policies, future bonuses together with allowance for taxation and allocation of profits to shareholders. 
These assumptions are determined as prudent estimates at the date of valuation including allowances for possible 
adverse deviations. 
The liability for the unexpired portion of the risk for the non-unit liabilities of linked business and attached riders is the 
higher of the liability calculated using discounted cash flows and the unearned premium reserve. 
An unexpired risk reserve and a reserve in respect of claims incurred but not reported is held for contracts wherein 
there is a possibility of lag in intimation of claims.
The unit liability in respect of linked business is the value of the units standing to the credit of policyholders, using the 
Net Asset Value ('NAV') prevailing at the valuation date.
A brief of the assumptions used in actuarial valuation is as below:
a)	
The interest rates used for valuing the liabilities are in the range of  5.04% to 6.56% per annum. The interest rates 
used at March 31, 2023 were in the range of 4.99% to 6.58% per annum.

or death. Both employee and the holding company contribute an equal percentage of the basic salary, a part of which 
is towards Government administered pension fund and balance portion is contributed to the fund administered by 
trustees. The provident fund is managed by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Employees’ Provident Fund Trust.

08, pursuant to which shares had been allotted and listed in accordance with the in-principle approval extended by 
the stock exchanges. All six tranches under the pre-IPO Scheme stand lapsed as on March 31, 2024. The Scheme 
had been instituted vide approval of its Members at the Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (EGM) dated March 28, 
2005 and had been subsequently amended by the Members of the Company vide its EGM dated February 24, 2015. 
The Scheme was ratified and amended by the members of the holding company at its Annual General Meeting held on 
July 17, 2017 which is in compliance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014 (referred to as 
the ‘Revised Scheme’). 
The meeting of Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee (BNRC) and the Board held on April 24, 2019 had 
approved the amendment to the definition of “Exercise Period”. The revision to the definition was approved by the 
members of the holding company at its Annual General Meeting held on July 17, 2019. 
Further, the meeting of BNRC and the Board held on April 17, 2021 and April 19, 2021 respectively had approved the 
increase in the limit of the number of shares issued or issuable since March 31, 2016 pursuant to the exercise of any 
Options granted to the Eligible Employees issued pursuant to the Revised  Scheme or any other stock option scheme of 
the holding company, by 0.90% of the number of shares issued as on March 31, 2016, i.e. from a limit of 2.64% of the 
number of shares issued as on March 31, 2016 to 3.54%. The revision to the limit was approved by the members of the 
holding company at its Annual General Meeting held on June 25, 2021.

This report on Embedded Value Results (“EV Results”) as at March 31, 2024 has been prepared by the Company and 
the results presented in the report have been reviewed by Milliman Advisors LLP.
1	
BASIS OF PREPARATION
	
The Embedded Value (EV) is a measure of the consolidated value of the shareholders’ interest in the life insurance 
business. The EV Results have been prepared based on the Indian Embedded Value (IEV) methodology and 
principles as set out in Actuarial Practice Standard 101 (version 1.02) (APS10) issued by the Institute of Actuaries 
of India (IAI). As APS10 is applicable for the limited purpose of an Initial Public Offering (IPO), compliance with 
APS10 is limited to the methodology and principles used to develop the EV Results presented in this report. The EV 
methodology is broadly in line with the Market Consistent Embedded Value2 (MCEV) principles used in Europe.
	
A detailed description of the EV methodology is provided in section 3.

METHODOLOGY
	
The EV consists of the two following components:
	
•	
Adjusted net worth (ANW), consisting of:
	
	
•	
Free 
surplus 
(FS) 
allocated 
to 
the 
covered business; and
	
	
•	
Required capital (RC).
	
•	
Value of in-force covered business (VIF). 
3.1	 Covered business
	
The business covered under the EV Results (covered 
business) includes all business that has been written 
by the Company including the life assurance and 
pensions business, accident and health-insurance 
business and group business.
	
The business written by ICICI Prudential Pension 
Funds Management Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of ICICI 
Prudential which writes pensions fund management 
business, is not included as covered business. 
The value of ICICI Prudential Pension Funds 
Management Co. Ltd is reflected in ANW based on 
the value at which it is carried in the audited financial 
statements of the Company, which is ` 560.2 mn as 
at March 31, 2024.
3.2	 RC
	
RC is the value of assets attributed to the covered 
business over and above that which is required 
to back the liabilities for covered business, the 
distribution of which to shareholders is restricted.
	
The level of RC is set equal to the amount required 
to be held to meet supervisory requirements or 
otherwise encumbered by supervisory or legal 
restrictions that prevent its distribution. The amount 
of RC is presented from the shareholders’ perspective 
and is net of the funds for future appropriation 
(FFAs) and the book value of subordinated debt, to 
the extent allowed by the regulations to meet the RC.
3.3	 FS
	
The FS is the market value of any assets allocated 
to, but not required to support, the in-force covered 
business as at the valuation date. 
	
The FS has been determined as the adjusted net 
worth of the Company, less the RC as defined 
above. The adjusted net worth of the Company is 
calculated as the net shareholders’ funds as per 
the audited financial statements, adjusted so as 
to revalue to market value those assets and those 
liabilities that are dependent on asset values, which 
are not at market value in the audited financial 
statements. The mark to market adjustment is net of 
tax applicable.
	
In respect of the subordinated debt capital raised 
by the Company through a private placement of 
non-convertible debentures (NCDs), the difference 
between the book value and the market value of 
liability associated with the NCDs is reflected in the FS.
	
The FFA, which comprises all funds which have not 
been explicitly allocated either to policyholders or 
to shareholders at the valuation date, is reported 
under policyholder funds. The shareholders have 
a 10% interest in the non-linked FFA accrued in 
respect of participating business. The value of the 
shareholders’ interest in the FFA is included in the 
VIF, at its market value, and therefore does not form 
part of the ANW.
3.4	 VIF
	
The VIF represents the present value of the 
shareholders’ interest in the earnings distributable 
from the assets allocated to the covered business 
after sufficient allowance for the aggregate 
risks in the business. The VIF consists of the 
following components:

•	
the time value of financial options and 
guarantees (TVFOG); 
	
•	
the frictional costs of required capital (FC); and
	
•	
the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks 
(CRNHR).
	
PVFP
	
The PVFP is the present value of projected 
distributable profits to shareholders arising from the 
in-force covered business, determined by projecting 
the post taxation shareholder cash flows from the 
in-force covered business and the assets backing 
the associated liabilities. The distributable profits 
also include the release to shareholders of the 
amounts from the FFA. For one-year renewable 
group term business, any future profits arising from 
the expected renewals from existing members are 
included in the PVFP.
	
For products with reviewable rates and charges, 
the projection of future cash flows assumes that 
the rates and charges as at the valuation date 
remain unchanged. 
	
The projection of future distributable profits arising 
from the covered business is carried out using best 
estimate non-economic assumptions and market 
consistent economic assumptions. 
	
Distributable profits are determined by reference 
to liabilities determined in accordance with the 
statutory requirements for life insurance companies 
and relevant professional guidance issued by the IAI.
	
The Company holds ‘global reserves’ calculated 
outside of its actuarial models as at the valuation 
date. Wherever appropriate, the shareholders’ 
interest in the assets backing such global reserves 
is calculated by assuming a suitable release pattern 
of such reserves.
	
TVFOG
	
The TVFOG reflects the value of the additional cost 
to shareholders that may arise from the embedded 
financial options and guarantees attaching to the 
covered business. The intrinsic value of such options 
and guarantees is reflected in the PVFP. 
	
A stochastic approach is used to determine the 
TVFOG using methods and assumptions consistent 
with the underlying embedded value. The economic 
assumptions used in determining the TVFOG ensure 
that the projected cash flows are valued in line with 
the price of similar cash flows that are traded in the 
capital markets.
	
FC
	
The VIF includes an allowance for the FC of RC for 
the covered business. This FC represents investment 
management 
expenses 
and 
taxation 
costs 
associated with holding the RC. The investment 
costs have been reflected as an explicit deduction 
from the gross investment return. 
	
CRNHR
	
The CRNHR is an allowance for risks to shareholder 
value to the extent that these are not already 
allowed for in the TVFOG or the PVFP. In particular, 
the CRNHR makes allowance for: 
	
•	
asymmetries in the impact of the risks on 
shareholder value; and
	
•	
risks that are not allowed for in the TVFOG or 
the PVFP (e.g. operational risk).
	
The CRNHR reflects operational risk, catastrophe 
mortality/morbidity risk and mass lapsation risk. 
The CRNHR has been determined using a cost 
of capital approach. The CRNHR is the present 
value of a notional cost of capital charge levied 
on the projected capital in respect of the residual 
non-hedgeable risks. Allowance has been made 
for the benefit of diversification among the 
non-hedgeable risks, other than operational risk.
3.5	 New business and renewals
	
The 
VIF 
includes 
the 
value 
attributable 
to 
shareholders considering the expected renewal 
premiums on the in-force business, including any 
foreseeable variations in the level of renewal 
premiums, but excludes any value relating to future 
new business (i.e. the new business that may be 
written after the applicable valuation date). 
	
The VNB reflects the additional value to shareholders 
created through the activity of writing new business 
over the stated period ending on the valuation date, 
and includes the value from the expected renewal 
premiums on that new business. 
	
The new business comprises both individual and 
group policies sold during the reporting period, 
including the expected renewal premiums and 
expected future contractual alterations to those 
contracts. It also includes the non-contractual single 
premium payments received during the reporting 
period. New business for one year renewable group 
term business and group micro business includes 
business from new members that have joined an 
existing scheme or a new scheme during the financial 
year, and the VNB includes the value arising from 
the renewal premiums expected from new members. 
The VNB is calculated in the same way as the VIF, 
with appropriate allowance for changes in the ANW 
during the reporting period. Incremental premiums 
received for group linked business are treated 
as new business. 
	
The VNB is determined as at March 31, 2024 and 
takes into account acquisition commissions and 
acquisition expenses actually incurred in the full 
year to March 31, 2024. The VNB is computed 
without consideration of the intrinsic cost or benefit 
from the use of interest rate derivatives for hedging 
interest rate risk.

A brief description of the various components 
is provided below
Components
Description
Expected return on 
existing business
(1)	
Expected investment income 
at opening reference rate on 
VIF and ANW; and
(2)	
Expected excess ‘real world’ 
investment return over the opening 
reference rate on VIF and ANW.
Operating 
assumption 
changes
This is the impact of updating of 
non-economic assumptions, on both best 
estimate and statutory bases, to those 
adopted in the closing EV.
VNB added during 
the period
This is as described in section 3.5 above
Operating 
experience variance
The variance arising from discontinuance 
and mortality / morbidity is analysed 
at a policy level, by considering the 
actual change in the policy status from 
the opening EV to the closing EV dates. 
The operating experience variance 
captures the difference between the 
actual and expected experience and is 
calculated in the following order:
a. 	
Discontinuance rates
b. 	
Mortality / morbidity rates 
c. 	
Expenses 
Economic 
assumption 
changes and 
investment 
variance
Economic assumption changes reflect 
the update of the reference rate 
yield curve, inflation and valuation 
economic assumptions from opening EV 
to closing EV. 
The investment variance is the difference 
between the actual investment return and 
the expected ‘real world’ rates for existing 
business as at March 31, 2023 and the 
closing and opening reference rates (the 
reference rates at the end of each month 
during which the new business is sold) for 
new business written during FY2024.
Capital 
contributions / 
(dividends paid 
out)
These are the actual capital infusions / 
dividends paid out to the shareholders, 
including the dividend distribution tax 
incurred (if any) during the period.
3.7	 Sensitivities
	
Sensitivity analyses are carried out for one 
parameter at a time and do not include changes in 
other parameters not explicitly mentioned as part of 
the sensitivity. 
	
The key assumption changes represented by each of 
the sensitivities and their impact on EV and VNB are 
provided in section 2.
4	
ASSUMPTIONS
	
The projections of future shareholder cash flows 
expected to emerge from covered in-force and new 
business have been determined using best estimate 
assumptions. These assumptions (both economic 
and non-economic) are reviewed annually and have 
been updated as appropriate.
4.1	 Economic assumptions
	
Investment returns and discount rates used in 
the calculation of opening and closing EV are 
based on reference rates at March 31, 2023 and 
March 31, 2024 respectively. The PVFP before 
TVFOG is calculated assuming that assets earn, 
before tax and investment management expenses, 
the reference rates assumed, and by discounting 
all cash flows using the reference rates assumed 
which are gross of tax and investment management 
expenses. The reference rates are derived from the 
zero coupon yield curve as published on the Clearing 
Corporation of India Limited3 website, by adjusting 
the published yields so that they derive the market 
value of the Company’s government bond portfolio. 
The reference rates assumed in the calculation of EV 
are set out below: 
Tenor (years)
Reference rate (one year forward rates)

Investment returns and discount rates used in the 
calculation of VNB are based on the CCIL published 
yield curves for each month of sale of new business, 
adjusted so that they derive the then market value of 
the Company’s government bond portfolio.
4.2	 Non-economic assumptions
	
Demographic assumptions
	
The best estimate assumptions for persistency, 
mortality and morbidity have been derived based 
on the Company’s own experience. An allowance 
for future improvements in respect of mortality has 
been made for annuities.
	
Commission and Expense assumptions
	
The expense assumptions have been derived based 
on the Company’s actual expenses during FY2024 
with no anticipation of productivity gains or cost 
efficiencies. The fixed renewal expenses are inflated 
from FY2025 onwards using the best estimate 
inflation rate assumed.
	
The commission rates under different products are 
based on the actual commission payable (if any) to 
the distributors. 
	
Tax rates
	
In determining the EV Results, allowance has 
been made for future taxation costs expected to 
be incurred by the Company. This includes both 
corporate taxes and Goods and Services Tax (“GST”).
	
The taxation costs reflected in the EV Results make 
an allowance for the fact that the Company is 
allowed to reduce its taxable income by dividend 
income earned, subject to a maximum of the 
dividend declared and distributed4.

Re: Milliman’s opinion on the Embedded Value results as at 31 March 2024 (“Opinion”)
Dear Members of the Board
INTRODUCTION
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited (‘ICICI 
Prudential’, ‘the Company’) has prepared embedded 
value calculations following the methodology and 
principles set out in the Actuarial Practice Standard 
10 (version 1.02) (“APS10”) issued by the Institute of 
Actuaries of India. These calculations consist of the 
following (together referred to as the “Results”):
•	
Indian Embedded Value (“IEV”) as at 31 March 2024;
•	
the value of one year of new business (“VNB”) 
for new business sold during the year ending 
31 March 2024; 
•	
an analysis of the movement of IEV from 31 
March 2023 to 31 March 2024; and
•	
various sensitivity results on the IEV as at 31 
March 2024 and the VNB for business sold during 
the year ending 31 March 2024. 
The 
Results, 
along 
with 
the 
methodology 
and 
assumptions that have been used to prepare the Results, 
have been summarised by the Company in the Annual 
Report (“Report”) that accompany this Opinion.
SCOPE OF SERVICES
Milliman Advisors LLP (‘Milliman’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’) has been 
engaged by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company 
Limited (‘ICICI Prudential’, ‘the Company’) to carry out a 
review and certification of the Results. Our scope of work 
includes the following:
•	
a review of the methodology and assumptions 
used by the Company in developing the Results 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
principles 
set out in APS10; 
•	
a review of the Company’s actuarial models 
(covering the calculation of IEV, VNB, analysis of 
movement and sensitivity results) used to develop 
the Results for a selection of model points covering 
the more material products comprising the value of 
in-force business (“VIF”) and VNB; and
•	
a detailed review of the aggregation templates used 
by the Company to develop the Results, which also 
included a review of the process used to conduct 
the analysis of movement of IEV and various 
sensitivity analyses.
OPINION
Based on the work carried out and subject to the reliances 
and limitations mentioned below, I am of the opinion that 
the Results have been developed in all material respects 
in accordance with the methodology and principles set 
out in APS10. In particular:
•	
the methodology used to develop the Results is 
reasonable and in line with APS10;
•	
the assumptions (economic and non-economic) 
used to develop the Results have been developed 
materially in line with the requirements of APS10, 
using the Company’s operating experience (for 
non-economic assumptions), and are reasonable;
•	
the Results have been prepared materially in 
accordance with the methodology and assumptions 
described in the Report, and with the accounting 
information presented in the financial statements;
•	
the Results have been prepared materially in 
accordance with the requirements of APS10.

RELIANCES AND LIMITATIONS
This Opinion has been prepared solely for use by ICICI 
Prudential for inclusion in the Report for the year ending 
31 March 2024. It should not be relied upon for any other 
purpose. Milliman does not intend to create a legal duty 
to any third party recipient of its work.
We have relied on information supplied by the 
management and staff of ICICI Prudential. Reliance was 
placed on, but not limited to, the general accuracy of all 
the information provided to us.
We have obtained a management representation 
letter from ICICI Prudential, stating that, to the best of 
ICICI Prudential’s knowledge, the data and information 
provided to us is accurate and complete and that there 
are no material inaccuracies or omissions therein. 
To the extent that there are material inaccuracies or 
omissions in the information received, this Opinion may 
be rendered invalid.
An actuarial assessment of the components of value of a 
life insurance company will not necessarily be consistent 
with the value of a life insurance company or a portfolio 
in the open market and should not be interpreted 
in that manner.
The Results are based on a series of assumptions as 
to future operating experience. It should be recognised 
that actual experience will differ from these assumptions 
on account of changes in the operating and economic 
environment and natural variations in experience. 
To the extent that actual experience is different from the 
assumptions, the future projected profits from which the 
Results are derived will also differ. The Report includes 
various sensitivity results to illustrate how vulnerable 
the IEV and VNB results are to changes in assumptions 
for the key risks. The Results shown are presented at 
the valuation dates stated and no warranty is given by 
Milliman that future experience after these valuation 
dates will be in line with the assumptions made.
Milliman is not a tax expert and is not able to provide 
tax or accounting advice. Accordingly, it is acknowledged 
that no reliance will be placed on Milliman, its Partners, 
or employees with respect to any tax or accounting 
issue. The allowance for taxation reflected in the Results 
is based on the Company’s interpretation of applicable 
tax regulations. The Results do not reflect any allowance 
for withholding or other taxes (if any) that may apply 
to the payment of future shareholder dividends or on 
remittances out of India. 
The Results have been determined on a going concern 
basis, and assume a stable economic, legal and 
regulatory environment going forward. Any change in 
the general operating environment would add a high 
degree of uncertainty to the Results. 
Unless explicitly stated, the Results do not consider any 
external (including regulatory) developments after the 
valuation date of 31 March 2024. 
 Yours faithfully,
Richard Holloway FIAI

We are in the business of 
life insurance, a unique 
financial planning tool that 
directly provides families 
with financial protection in 
the event of exigencies like 
death or adverse health

enable families to save and 
invest to build a financial 
safety-net to secure their 
family’s financial future 
and thereby enable them 
to achieve their long-term 
financial goals and fulfil their 
dreams and aspirations. Life 
insurance is a key imperative 
for all citizens, and it is our 
endeavour to ensure that 
every Indian family has 
adequate financial protection 
while, also accomplishing our 
wider responsibilities to the 
society and the environment.

thereby enhance

sections of society; and Governance - transparent practices that promote trust amongst all our stakeholders.

financial tool to protect the financial future of citizens. Being in the business of life insurance, we offer unique financial planning 
opportunities for families to supplement their savings and achieve long term financial goals. We are committed to fulfilling

Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve 
the environmental and social impact of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments 
made by the Company. 
	
Considering the Company's nature of business, R&D outlay and capital expenditure were primarily to investments 
in information technology. Accordingly, investments were made by way of addition to capital assets in the form of 
IT infrastructure like equipment, software and communication networks to give impetus to the Company’s digital 
initiatives. The share of investments in R&D and capex on account of information technology was 51.6% (89.4% 
in FY2023) of total addition to fixed assets by the Company.
2.	
Does the Company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? If yes, what percentage of

business processes, the Company continually seeks out opportunities to recycle waste. E-waste such as computers, 
printers, switches, scanners have been the primary e-waste generated in the Company. Nearly 108,121 kgs of 
e-waste generated has been disposed through authorised recyclers since FY2020 and 56,568 kgs in FY2024. 
Re-cycling certificates have been received from selected government authorised e-waste vendors.
	
The Company has e-waste collection bins at 50 branches pan India for employees and visitors to deposit their 
e-waste so it can be disposed through certified E-waste vendors. 
	
The Company has taken multiple initiatives for minimising usage of single-use plastic water bottles, which have 
been replaced with reusable water jars and glasses, across our offices. The Company has also replaced plastic 
garbage bags with bio-degradable bags and plastic dustbins with steel ones. Re-usable plates are used at the 
cafeteria in the corporate and back office which house the largest number of employees to promote sustainability.

All employees of the Company undergo an annual performance appraisal process as determined by the Company. The Company has an 
established performance and talent management framework. The objectives of this framework are three-fold: a) To ensure alignment 
to the Company’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as set out by the Board and ensure clarity of purpose across levels b) To create a 
talent pipeline by nurturing high potential talent c) To enable differentiated rewards and capability development to help ring fence talent 
for the future. The Company has a structured performance management process aligned to the Company KPIs as set out by the Board. 
These are then cascaded in the form of functional KPIs and further as individual KPIs based on the nature of role and responsibilities.
	
The Company has a well-defined succession planning process to facilitate the development and career planning of high potential 
talent, mitigate vacancy risk arising from attrition and ensure business continuity. A framework is in place for identifying key roles and 
measuring the depth of leadership cover for each role by identifying successors who can move to the role either immediately or over a 
period of time or by restructuring the role to mitigate vacancy risk and ensure business continuity, where successors are not immediately 
available to fill the vacancy. Based on the number of successors identified, their readiness to move to the next level role and the feasibility 
of conducting restructuring in the event of the role holder’s exit, a score called the Leadership Cover Index (LCI) is derived for each key 
role. An annual exercise is carried out to identify the LCI for each key role along with the talent development actions, and is reviewed 
annually by the Board Nomination & Remuneration Committee.

branches monthly and is regularly reviewed internally. There are periodic checks on electrical and fire safety 
parameters by an external agency and the issues highlighted are rectified immediately. To provide a safe, 
secure, and supportive work environment, the Company has put in place a holistic well-being framework for 
employees focusing on physical, mental, and financial well-being. Various initiatives are undertaken around 
the three-pronged approach that involves building awareness, instituting enabling policies and facilitating 
habit formation.

smoking, but also inspired smokers to quit smoking through the sharing of stories by other employees who had 
stopped smoking. Multiple webinars were conducted for the employees who had signed up for the campaign 
to provide adequate knowledge & encouragement over a period of three months to facilitate their journey.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
The Company has several board approved policies and internal guidelines to redress grievances related to human 
rights issues. 
	
With regard to internal mechanisms centered around the policies, the Company has constituted the Governance 
team as a part of the Human Resources function to ensure that all employee related grievances are suitably 
investigated and action is taken as per due process stipulated in the Employee Service Rules. Employees are 
encouraged to register any grievance that they may have against any employee, agent, partner and customer or 
report any breach of the Code or any of the Company policies. 
	
The Company has instituted “egov” portal on the Company’s intranet for employees to record and register their 
grievance. The egov portal serves as the repository of all relevant information pertaining to each grievance and 
for purpose of monitoring and tracking of all grievances for timely resolution. Employees may also write their 
grievance over email to employeeassist@iciciprulife.com or raise their grievance through their line hierarchy or 
Human Resources. Anonymous grievances are also recorded in the egov portal. On receipt of the grievance, the 
Governance team examines the nature and type of the grievance and accordingly, classifies the same under 
five categories – Fraud, Behavior, Other Code violation, Policy or Process violation and Sexual Harassment. 
For grievances pertaining to sexual harassment, the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is constituted in line 
with the provisions of The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 
2013 to investigate the case.
	
The Company has a Board approved Grievance redressal policy for customers that includes the redressal 
framework for ensuring prompt and effective resolution of grievances. The service recovery team is responsible for 
investigating, evaluating and deciding on the resolution of grievances. The service recovery team operates as an 
independent central grievance redressal unit to ensure that the resolution provided for each and every grievance is 
done in a fair and impartial manner. The Company offers multiple channels to report grievances such as branches, 
e-mail/letter, website/mobile app, contact centre, sourcing intermediary and social media. The Company’s 
approach to grievance resolution includes a thorough review of the profile and concerns of the customer, the 
product offered, fact-finding and evidence gathering both from the customer and sourcing intermediary (as maybe 
applicable). The Company aims to offer the best possible solution to the customer after taking into account the 
findings of the investigation and extant policies, rules and guidelines. In case of dissatisfaction with the resolution, 
the customer has the option to escalate to the next level for redressal.

ESSENTIAL INDICATORS
1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback 
	
The grievance redressal policy for customers includes a redressal framework to ensure prompt and effective 
resolution of grievances. Our service recovery team, which is an independent central grievance redressal team, 
is responsible for investigation and evaluation of the grievance as well as taking the decision for resolution, in a 
fair and impartial manner. We offer multiple channels to report grievances such as branch, e-mail, letter, website, 
mobile application, contact centre, sourcing intermediaries and social media. Our process to manage a customer’s 
grievance includes a thorough review of the customer’s concern and investigation through fact-finding and 
evidence. We offer the best possible solution after a review of the customer’s profile and product offered after 
taking feedback from the sourcing intermediary (as applicable). If a customer is not satisfied with the resolution, he 
or she can escalate it to our Company touchpoint (level 01), Grievances Redressal Officer (level 02) and Grievances 
Redressal Committee (level 03). 
	
External avenues such as the Ombudsman office and the IRDAI are also available to the policyholder, details of 
which are made available on the Company website and in the policy document.
	
The Company has a digital grievance management platform to upload, respond and monitor disposal of 
customer grievances. 
	
The process of complaint redressal from grievance registration to resolution is as follows:
	
Registration of Complaint
	
The Company's digital complaint management platform collates the complaints received through emails, website 
or social media. The complaints are registered with the service recovery team, which is an independent central 
grievance redressal (GR) team. Complaints received through the IRDAI or National Consumer Helpline are also 
directed to the GR team.
	
Complaint acknowledgement
	
On registration of a complaint, an acknowledgement is sent to the customer informing that the complaint is being 
investigated and assuring that a response shall be provided within the regulatory turnaround time.
	
Assignment of Complaint
	
The GR team investigates the facts and the evidence. Depending on the complaint, the GR team also directs the 
complaint to the department concerned as part of its investigation efforts. Response received by the department 
is then evaluated.
	
Complaint Evaluation
	
The facts of the case are noted and the area of concern is reviewed. All complaints are handled by the GR team to 
ensure a prompt, fair and an effective resolution. The team analyses the problem and assesses the root cause of 
the conflict. The team takes a decision for the resolution of the complaint. Feedback is also provided to the relevant 
department to ensure that the same problem does not recur. 
	
Resolution
	
The customer is informed of the decision by the GR team and the steps for resolution. If a customer is not satisfied 
with the resolution, they can escalate the issue to the Grievances Redressal Officer and beyond that to the 
Grievances Redressal Committee.
	
The GR team monitors the redressal of all complaints and the quality of response provided to the customer. It also 
monitors pendency and regularly shares its analysis with the Company. The summary of grievances are reviewed 
by the Board Customer Service and Policyholders’ Protection Committee and reported to the Board of Directors 
of the Company.
