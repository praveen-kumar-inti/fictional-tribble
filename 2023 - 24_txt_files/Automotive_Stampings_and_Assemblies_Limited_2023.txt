Employee 
Health &

O
Employee productivity and wellbeing 
are crucial to the success of the 
business else it impacts Company’s 
reputation and consumer conﬁdence. 
Employee health & wellbeing eliminate

Economy
O
We regard the concept of a circular 
economy as highly valuable, as it 
provides a sustainable approach

Climate Action
R
Exposure to climate related risks 
and opportunities significantly affects 
the company’s long-term operations 
and financial sustainability. Without 
proper measurement, monitoring, and 
reduction of emissions, the company 
could be subjected to regulations like 
a carbon tax.
Our 
company 
prioritizes 
environmental 
protection 
by 
adhering to government regulations 
concerning water, air, and waste 
management. 
Additionally, 
we 
promote 
resource 
conservation 
among our employees. We have 
adopted measures to reduce our 
carbon emissions and invested in 
initiatives such as renewable energy 
sources,

c.	 Spending on measures towards well-being of employees and workers (including permanent and other

2.	 Details of retirement beneﬁts, for the current and previous ﬁnancial year:
3.	 Accessibility of workplaces:
	
Note: The Company is dedicated to implementing measures that facilitate the movement of differently abled 
          employees.
	
Note:  As a result of the escalation in remuneration for trainees and contractual personnel, individuals within 
	
 these categories have transitioned from temporary worker status to permanent employees. 
	
    Consequently, the proportion of employees eligible for gratuity coverage has diminished relative to the 
	
   Fiscal Year 2022-23. This decline stems from the exclusion of trainees and contractual workers from 
	
   gratuity benefits, thus affecting the overall percentage of staff covered under this provision.

regulatory and statutory bodies that ensure legal compliance. Moreover, it also includes local communities 
who might be impacted by the organization’s activities. This selection process requires the careful evaluation 
of each stakeholder’s role, interest, and inﬂuence on the organizational operations and strategic decisions.
