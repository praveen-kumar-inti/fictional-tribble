Energy 
Efficiency
and
Risk: Energy 
management has 
been identified 
as a key material 
issue under Climate 
change and 
environmental risk. 
Climate Change and 
Environmental risks 
are addressed to 
emphasize on the 
Company’s climate 
consciousness and 
its contribution 
towards mitigation 
action plans against 
climate change.
Opportunity: 
Comprehensive 
resource 
management plans 
in alignment with 
the Company’s 
environment 
conservation 
strategy will 
highlight the 
Company’s 
commitment 
for improving 
environment 
preservation and 
its contribution 
towards climate 
change mitigation 
action plans.
The Company focusses on four major 
areas related to climate change i.e. energy 
conservation, water conservation, use of 
renewable energy and waste minimization.  
The Company’s Environment, Health and 
Safety (EHS) Policy covers all employees 
and stakeholders across all manufacturing 
units. In Lighting manufacturing 
processes, high energy consumption 
equipment had been replaced with cost 
effective energy-efficient equipment.
The Company regularly monitors the 
operations and capacity optimization 
of pumps, motors and cooling tower 
operations, to take corrective actions. 
The Company is contributing towards 
global environment by complying with 
ISO Certification i.e., ISO 9001, ISO 14001 
& OHSAS 18001 under the Integrated 
Management System, in each and every 
process of the Company. The Company 
regularly assesses various environmental 
risk associated with its activities & its likely 
impact. The purpose of this procedure 
is to establish and maintain procedures 
for identifying environmental / hazard 
aspects of activities. The manufacturing 
units have embraced initiatives on 
clean technology and energy efficiency. 
Innovative technologies have been 
implemented to reduce the impact on the 
environment. The Company has installed 
solar panel at its manufacturing facilities at 
Bahadurgarh, and Malanpur Steel Plant and 
will be installing solar panel at all its other 
manufacturing units in time to come.
In the longer term, the Company aims to 
reduce CO2 emissions and generate energy 
at a lower cost at its factories in India. This, 
is in-sync with the Company’s approach 
towards ‘building a sustainable ecosystem 
through efficient energy consumption and 
optimum utilization of natural resources 
such as solar power and wind energy. 
Furthermore, this project will also enable 
significant operating cost-savings for 
the Company such as lower energy loss, 
reduced electricity bills and maintenance 
costs
Positive: The 
Company’s focus 
on strengthening 
climate and ESG 
specific initiatives 
bolsters long-term 
value-creation and 
enables the company 
to effectively respond 
to rising stakeholder 
demands.
Negative: Lack of 
robust initiatives 
and action plans to 
contribute to ESG 
awareness and 
climate change could 
adversely impact 
business operations 
and lead to workforce 
disruption.

Human Rights 
Practices
Risk: Absence of 
a comprehensive 
Human Rights 
governance 
structure from 
the aspects of 
parameters such as 
working conditions, 
child/ forced labor, 
fair remuneration, 
gender diversity, 
prevention of 
sexual harassment, 
freedom of 
association, and 
collective bargaining 
will impact the 
Company’s 
performance in the 
social domain from 
the perspective 
of the employee 
workforce as well as 
the community.
The Company respects human rights of all 
relevant stakeholders and groups within 
and beyond the workplace including that of 
communities, consumers and marginalised 
groups. All the practices and policies 
of the Company, including engagement 
with suppliers and contractors, among 
others, ensure that human rights are 
honored and protected. To respect the 
human rights of our employees, including 
non-discrimination, prohibition of child 
and forced labor, freedom of association 
and the right to engage in collective 
bargaining. Surya Roshni strives to 
ensure that there is no discrimination 
or harassment due to gender, religion, 
ethnicity and disability. We continuously 
work towards building a conducive work 
environment wherein merit in qualification 
and performance becomes the sole criteria 
for selection and performance appraisal 
and the work environment is free from all 
forms of harassment - physical, verbal, 
psychological, sexual etc. Integrating a 
strong governance structure for Human 
Rights from the aspect of Human Rights 
Policy, freedom of association policy 
and due diligence across the business 
operations extending to supply chain 
partners and vendors.
Positive: 
Comprehensive 
alignment of Human 
Rights principles 
in accordance 
with the guiding 
principles of national 
and international 
Human Rights 
standards amplifies 
the Company’s 
performance in 
the social aspect 
as well as reflects 
its commitment 
towards human rights 
integration within the 
Company’s business 
model.
Negative: The 
absence of a Human 
Rights governance 
structure could 
result in employee 
dissatisfaction, 
impacting the 
workforce productivity 
that could impact the 
Company’s long-term 
business growth plan. 
The lack of a strong 
redressal mechanism 
may result in 
non-compliance 
issues from a 
relevant regulatory 
perspective.

Board 
Diversity and 
Independence
Opportunity: 
The Company 
recognises and 
embraces the 
importance of a 
diverse Board in its 
success. We believe 
that a truly diverse 
board will leverage 
differences in 
thought, perspective, 
knowledge, 
skill, industrial 
experience, age, 
ethnicity, gender 
which will help 
us to retain our 
competitive 
advantage.
1.    Ensure a transparent nomination 
process for directors with the diversity 
of thought, experience, knowledge, 
perspective, excellence in their 
performance;
2.    The Board as recommended by 
Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee has adopted the Board 
Diversity Policy which set out the 
approach to diversity on the Board of 
Directors.
3.    As an employer committed to 
diversity, Surya Roshni recognizes 
that it’s success depends on creating 
a working environment which 
supports the diverse make-up of its 
employees with supporting policies 
and procedures to create a framework 
which promotes this policy.
Positive: Consistent 
efforts would lead to 
positive impact due 
to improvement in 
productivity, etc.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social 
topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
At Surya Roshni, the stakeholder engagement mechanism plays a vital role in strengthening and expanding stakeholder 
relationships, enabling the identification of key material issues impacting the Company’s growth. Governance, ethics, 
integrity, and transparency are the core values that drive the Company’s success. Engagement with stakeholders led 
to the prioritization of critical issues, the mapping of risks associated with each material topic, and the development of 
corresponding risk mitigation strategies. A key outcome of the stakeholder engagement process was the identification 
and prioritization of material concerns across environmental, social, governance, and economic dimensions, which were 
presented to the top leadership and the Board for their feedback and guidance in shaping the Company’s sustainable 
growth model. The stakeholder engagement process is reviewed regularly as part of the Company’s continuous effort

Risk Management Committee is responsible for identifying potential risks that could impact business operations and 
for implementing policies and strategies to manage and mitigate those risks.
