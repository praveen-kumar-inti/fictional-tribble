Director’s Message 
Good health is at the heart of a sustainable future, as 
healthy people are the foundation of prosperous societies, 
strong economies and a thriving planet. And yet, from the 
lasting impacts of COVID-19 to the mounting impacts of 
the climate on health, health systems around the world are 
under-resourced and overburdened. We must act now to 
strengthen health systems, ensuring they are fit to respond 
to the needs of today and tomorrow.
At AstraZeneca, we are working towards a future where:
•	
Resilient health systems are able to respond and adapt 
effectively to crisis while managing ongoing population 
health needs;
•	
Equitable health systems ensure everyone has the 
opportunity to live their healthiest life, removing barriers 
to early disease detection, accurate diagnosis, access 
to clinical trials and high-quality therapies; and
•	
Net zero health systems improve patient outcomes and 
limit the environmental impact of care.
Our holistic approach puts health at the centre of a 
sustainable future by advocating for more strategic 
investment in health, earlier action on disease and enhanced 
use of digital, data and technology. As with the COVID-19 
crisis, where we learned what can be achieved when 
we collaborate at speed and at scale, partnering with 
stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem is key to our 
shared success. Recognising that a healthy population is 
vital to growth and prosperity, we must invest in health as 
a ‘strategic asset’ that delivers positive returns for people, 
society and the planet.
Together, we can ensure a healthier, more sustainable future.
Last year we took an important step towards ‘transparency’ 
with you all by adding the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) for the first time to our annual 
report. This year we continue to share with you some of the 
pertinent aspects of our commitment to society, people and 
planet in India through the next few pages. At AstraZeneca, 
we see these themes as deeply interconnected. In fact, 
strengthening the resilience of our health systems will only be 
possible if we also address the climate crisis, which is harming 
human health, fuelling pressures on health workers, and 
disproportionally affecting underserved population groups.
Our science-based sustainability targets are directing 
us to take some of the pertinent actions that can benefit 
the community and our next generations. As a strategic 
approach, we are not only working with several partners 
to make a difference externally but also took some BOLD 
actions internally as well so that we can impact and 
influence behaviors. While we are proud of our progress, we 
recognise that there is still much work to be done. We remain 
committed towards the agenda and will continue to do more 
Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report
meaningful work and together with our stakeholders, we can 
create a brighter, more resilient and sustainable future for all.
Together with others, we have a responsibility to innovate 
and accelerate the delivery of sustainable healthcare in 
order to ensure a brighter future. We are committed to taking 
action and advancing purpose-driven partnerships to build a 
healthy future for all. Thank you for your ongoing support and 
partnership as we continue our sustainability journey.
About this Report
We seek to create value for society beyond the impact of 
our life-changing medicines. Sustainability is part of our 
organisational DNA, embedded into everything we do from 
the lab to the patient, and delivered thanks to the efforts 
of employees. At AstraZeneca, we recognise that taking 
action to drive sustainability is fundamental and by using 
a science-led approach and ensuring we act with integrity 
and in accordance with our AstraZeneca Values, we are 
transforming the future of healthcare and making a positive 
impact.
Our sustainability strategy is built around three (3) pillars that 
put health at the heart of our work.

Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
1.
Access to 
healthcare
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for the Company to provide 
and working towards:
1.	
Equitable Access: health should 
not be determined by who you 
are, where you live or where you 
were born. We are working to 
remove barriers to healthcare and 
give everyone the chance to be 
as healthy as possible. Economic 
and supply barriers, as well as 
geographic impediments, inhibit 
universal access to high quality, 
evidence-based healthcare. We 
are playing our part to address 
health inequities and eliminate 
discrimination from the delivery of 
healthcare.
Everyone should 
have access to 
healthcare, no 
matter who they 
are or where they 
live. Therefore, 
we are working to 
identify barriers 
to access and 
are innovating 
to deliver our 
life-changing 
medicines in a 
sustainable and 
equitable way, 
through global, 
regional and local 
partnerships.
Not 
Applicable
Positive: Access to healthcare, motivate the 
Company to innovate sustainable healthcare 
solutions which are essential to improving 
global health outcomes.
Further, the positive impacts towards 
specific opportunities are delineated below:
1.	
Equitable Access: We are committed 
to improving equitable access to 
healthcare for patients globally, 
including to our innovative product 
portfolio. Our approach includes 
integrating programmes into local 
systems and delivering affordable 
medicines to patients.

Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive or

2.	
Affordability and pricing: We are 
committed to addressing barriers 
to access and affordability. Our 
industry, policymakers and payers 
need to work together to identify 
solutions. Through collaborations, 
partnerships and stakeholder 
coalitions we are working to 
ensure essential and innovative 
medicines become more widely 
available.
3.	
Health system resilience: The 
shifting burden of disease, 
geopolitical fragmentation and 
the frequency of extreme weather 
events linked to the climate 
emergency all put pressure on 
health systems. The COVID-19 
pandemic tested health systems’ 
ability to respond to sudden 
shocks and crises while ensuring 
continuous access to healthcare 
services for patients. Health 
system capacity remains under 
pressure at global, regional and 
local levels, with outbreaks of 
infectious diseases as well as the 
increasing prevalence of NCDs, 
exacerbated by the growing 
impacts of climate change and 
ecosystem degradation on human 
health
2.	
Affordability and pricing: We are 
committed to addressing barriers to 
access and affordability. Our industry, 
policymakers and payers need to work 
together to identify solutions. While we 
are thoughtful in our pricing approach, 
we understand the challenges that 
healthcare systems and patients face 
in terms of equity and affordability. 
Recognising our shared responsibility, 
we take a broad, flexible approach 
to pricing to reflect the variation in 
healthcare systems. We are committed 
to working in partnership with patients, 
policymakers, payers and the wider 
healthcare community to ensure 
access is as equitable, widespread and 
as sustainable as possible.
3.	
Health system resilience: We are 
working towards a future where 
resilient health systems can respond 
and adapt effectively to crises while 
managing ongoing population health 
needs. Sustainable healthcare for all 
requires investment in strengthening 
health systems with the infrastructure 
required to be responsive to population 
needs. Our integrated approach puts 
health at the center of a sustainable 
future by advocating for more strategic 
investment in health, earlier action on 
disease and enhanced use of digital, 
data and technology.
2.
Environmental 
Protection
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for our company to meet 
our ambition – Accelerating the delivery 
of net-zero healthcare, proactively 
managing our environmental impact 
across all activities, and investing in 
nature and biodiversity.
Further, our focus areas as part of the 
identified material issue are:
1.	
Ambition Zero Carbon
2.	
Product Sustainability
3.	
Natural resources
Supporting 
a healthy 
environment 
improves health 
outcomes and 
helps prevent the 
onset of certain 
diseases likely 
to become more 
prevalent in a 
changing climate
Not 
Applicable
Positive: Beyond the benefits of our 
medicines to patients, our contribution to 
society must respect our environment and 
ensure the sustainable use of the planet’s 
finite natural resources. We know that a 
healthy environment is critical for human 
health.
Further, the positive impacts towards 
specific opportunities are delineated below:
1.	
Ambition Zero Carbon: (i) Achieve net-
zero by avoiding GHG (Green House 
Gas) emissions through our facility and 
product design, maximising our energy 
efficiency, shifting to renewable energy 
sources, transitioning to an electric 
vehicle (EV) fleet, and investing in 
nature-based removals to compensate 
for any residual GHG footprint; and 
(ii) build resilience by managing the 
physical (sites, supply chain) and 
transitional (regulatory, market and 
product) risks and opportunities arising 
from climate change in the value 
chain through adaption and business 
continuity planning.

2.	
Product Sustainability: People and the 
planet benefit from those medicines 
which have the smallest possible 
environmental impact yet maintain 
the highest medical efficacy and 
safety standards. Therefore, we are 
following processes through the life 
cycle of our products with the aim of 
understanding and addressing their 
environmental impact; from discovery 
through development and production, 
to launching a new product and to the 
end of product life.
3.	
Natural Resource: The conservation 
and sustainable use of natural 
resources and the protection and 
restoration of ecosystems is vital to 
shape a healthy future with resilient 
people and communities, building 
harmony between society and the 
natural environment. Therefore, we 
see this as an opportunity to meet our 
commitment towards – (i) Reducing 
our impact on the planet through the 
efficient, circular use of water and other 
natural resources across the value 
chain to ensure responsible sourcing, 
consumption production, and disposal; 
(ii) protecting and restoring ecosystems 
to improve health outcome and tackle 
environmental drivers of disease 
such as water and air quality, through 
our focus on water stewardship and 
biodiversity.
3.
Ethics and 
Transparency
The identified material issue is an 
opportunity for our company to ensure 
ethical, open, and inclusive behavior 
across our organisation and value 
chain.
It guides the 
Company in 
fostering a culture 
of doing the right 
thing across our 
value chain and 
promotes health 
and wellbeing.
Further, we seek 
to create positive 
societal impact 
and embed ethical 
behavior in all our 
business activities, 
markets, and 
value chain. We 
promote ethical, 
transparent, and 
inclusive policies 
internally and with 
our partners and 
suppliers.
Not 
Applicable
Positive: It is important for us to create 
value beyond the impact our medicines 
have on patients. We need to ensure that 
we retain and increase trust across all our 
stakeholders’ groups in order to continue to 
deliver life-changing medicines to patients. 
The positive impact of the material issues, 
includes:
1.	
Ethical Business Culture: We strive to 
drive the highest standards of conduct 
and accountability beyond compliance 
including, but not limited to, anti-
bribery and anti-corruption, product 
safety, human rights and building 
supplier capabilities to uphold high 
social standards.

Ethics and

The identified material issue is an

It is important 
that we create

2.	
Inclusion and Diversity (I&D): Our 
approach to I&D prioritises efforts 
in areas where we can drive lasting 
systemic change for our organisation 
and for society. Our I&D strategy 
includes three strategic focus areas 
that guide how inclusion, diversity, 
and belonging are embedded within 
our entire ecosystem– from our 
employees to our patients and to local 
communities and beyond.
3.	
Workforce safety and health: To 
continue to deliver medicines 
to patients, we must foster an 
environment where people feel safe, 
energised, and inspired. The resources 
we put into supporting the physical 
and mental health and safety of our 
workforce are an investment in society 
at large, the communities where we 
operate and their long-term economic 
health. Contributing to a safe and 
healthy environment is the right thing to 
do and can also have positive business 
impacts in terms of productivity.
