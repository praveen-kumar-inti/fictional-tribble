What is the contribution of exports as a percentage of the total turnover of the entity?
	
In FY 2024-25, Polycab achieved export revenue of INR 13,452 million, accounting for 6% 
of the Company’s total turnover. This reaffirmed our position as one of India’s largest 
cables exporters, with a footprint spanning 84 countries across key regions, including 
the Americas, Australia, Europe, and the Middle East which remained major demand 
centres. The global shift toward clean energy infrastructure accelerated by government-
backed decarbonization targets and renewable investments continues to open significant 
avenues for cable deployment in solar, wind, and grid-modernization projects. Over and 
above that, continued investments in infrastructure growth across emerging markets 
provide continuous long-term demand visibility. Polycab is well-positioned to meet this 
transformation with offering technically robust, high-performance cables that support 
safe and efficient power transmission in complex environments.
	
Our focused export strategy is anchored in Project Spring, which has been implemented 
following the success of Project LEAP. Project Spring encompasses structured initiatives 
to drive global market expansion, accelerate new product development, and align with 
international certifications. This approach has allowed us to continue penetrating new 
geographies, while strengthening customer trust, and building capabilities tailored to 
international compliance and technical standards. By consistently delivering quality-
assured, performance-driven products, backed by strong logistics and service, Polycab 
is advancing toward its ambition of becoming a preferred global partner for cabling 
solutions. Looking ahead, we will continue to scale our export operations by expanding 
geographic reach, increasing business from existing clients and deepening our presence in 
future-forward sectors such as renewables, electric mobility, and digital infrastructure.

At Polycab, sustainability is an integral part of our mission advancing responsible living while generating long-lasting value for all our stakeholders. Building on the strong 
foundation laid in previous years, we have seen significant momentum in our sustainability journey, deepening its integration across our operations, governance, and 
organizational culture.
This year, we are excited to share our long-term sustainability goals, which will guide us as we transition to a low-carbon, inclusive, and resilient business model designed 
to accelerate our transition to renewable energy, scale up green sourcing initiatives, and drive innovation in environmentally responsible product development. Our 
sustainability goals anchored in three core pillars: ensuring planetary health, enhancing human well-being, and fostering an inclusive society. We remain committed to 
advancing environmental stewardship with a focus on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, improving water management, and minimizing waste. In parallel, we 
are strengthening our social commitments by fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, investing in the development and well-being of our employees, and engaging 
with communities in meaningful and impactful ways. Strengthening supplier relationships through an ESG lens and continually raising the bar on ethical leadership 
are also integral to our roadmap. In addition to looking at the environmental impact of products, we are also conscious of the effects product packaging can have on 
environmental metrics. Subsequently, packaging remains an element of our broader sustainability strategy, and we are actively exploring ways to reduce its environmental 
impact through more sustainable materials and designs. We aim to streamline packaging processes, minimizing waste and resource consumption, and contributing to a 
circular economy.
A significant enabler of our progress has been the increased engagement of our employees. We are nurturing a culture where sustainability is a shared responsibility, 
empowering teams across all levels of the organization to make meaningful contributions to our goals.
We have established strong governance practices by embedding sustainability-related risk management and oversight at the Board level. This ensures sustainability is 
fully integrated into our decision-making processes, promoting transparency and driving long-term value creation. Our ESG awareness programs continue to evolve, and 
we are working closely with our value chain partners to ensure they are aligned with our sustainability objectives, advancing ethical and sustainable practices across the 
entire supply chain.
Our commitment to social impact remains unwavering. Through initiatives focused on diversity, equity, inclusion, and robust health and safety standards, we are building 
a workplace and partner ecosystem that is people-first, compliant, and supportive of every individual.
Looking forward, we remain deeply committed to sustainability as a core business strategy. It is through this commitment that we will continue to drive innovation, build 
resilience, and secure long-term value for all stakeholders, ensuring that sustainability continues to be the foundation of Polycab’s growth and success in the years ahead.

to fostering a culture of transparency, integrity, and ethical business conduct across all 
aspects of its operations. These values guide our decisions, stakeholder engagement, and 
long-term trust-building.
	
The Company has adopted a robust Anti-Bribery Policy that clearly defines expectations 
for ethical behavior and reinforces our zero-tolerance stance against bribery and 
corruption. This policy applies to all employees (permanent, temporary, or contractual), 
directors, officers, subsidiaries, joint venture partners, associate companies, and third 
parties such as vendors, agents, and contractors. It explicitly prohibits all forms of bribery, 
including facilitation payments and improper gifts, whether offered directly or indirectly.
	
To uphold this policy, Polycab has implemented internal mechanisms for reporting, 
investigation, and disciplinary action. We ensure that employees and business partners 
are not only empowered to report violations but also protected through our commitment 
to zero fear of retaliation. All concerns raised in good faith are treated confidentially and 
investigated with impartiality. Violations of the Anti-Bribery Policy may result in strict 
disciplinary measures, including termination of employment or business relationships, 
depending on the nature and severity of the breach.
	
Regular training and awareness sessions are conducted to ensure that all stakeholders 
understand their responsibilities under the policy. Stakeholders are encouraged to register 
unethical business practices, if any, encountered during their dealing with the Company 
and mention their details therein or register anonymously. We also expect our suppliers

This effort reflects our genuine commitment to making sustainability a shared 
responsibility, not just within our own operations, but across every part of our extended 
network. To institutionalize these expectations, Polycab has formulated a Supplier 
Code of Conduct. This document outlines the Company’s standards related to business 
ethics, legal compliance, labour practices, and environmental responsibility. As part of 
its ongoing efforts, Polycab is also in the process of implementing a formal mechanism 
to ensure suppliers acknowledge and adhere to the Code periodically, thereby 
reinforcing accountability across its supply chain. With an intent to achieve the optimum 
propagation of the ESG advocacy, the Company is exploring options for incentivizing its 
dealers, distributors, intermediaries and customers for completing training on ESG and 
voicing their opinions and suggestions on the material topics identified by the Company.
	
To further embed these principles into our operations, Polycab has formed an ESG Council, 
comprising of Senior Management Personnel (SMP) and other management personnel. 
The ESG Council plays a guiding role in aligning supply chain practices with broader ESG 
objectives. This includes setting expectations related to ethical labour, environmental 
standards and compliance, all of which are reinforced through regular tracking and review 
mechanisms. The Council also supports cross-functional collaboration to ensure that ESG 
considerations are integrated into day-to-day supplier interactions and sourcing decisions. 
2. 	 Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of 
interest involving members of the Board/KMPs? (Yes/No) If yes, provide 
details of the same.
	
Yes. The Company has put in place a Conflict-of-Interest Policy to manage conflicts 
across the organization, including subsidiaries and joint ventures. A conflict of interest 
arises when personal, financial, or other outside interests, whether direct or through 
immediate family, could influence an individual’s ability to act in the Company’s 
best interest.
	
This framework applies to all Directors, SMPs, and employees, and extends to entities in 
which the Company holds a significant stake. Each year, all employees of the Company 
and its subsidiaries, including SMPs and people in leadership, are required to confirm in 
writing that they have disclosed any potential or actual conflicts. This annual declaration 
reinforces a culture of accountability and transparency.
	
Conflicts, where identified, are addressed through institutional processes and are 
reviewed appropriately, including at the time of the agenda setting for Board and 
Committee meetings, to ensure impartial decision-making. To support compliance 
and awareness, regular training programs and learning modules are rolled out, to 
help individuals recognize and manage conflicts. These initiatives are aligned with the 
Company’s Code of Conduct and ethical standards.
	
The Company has also adopted a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under 
the Conflict-of-Interest Policy, which provides stepwise guidance on identification, 
reporting, review, and resolution of such conflicts. Where applicable, matters may be 
escalated to the Disciplinary Committee consisting of at least 3 SMPs, which functions 
under a defined Terms of Reference (ToR) and mechanism for addressing disciplinary 
related issues to ensure fair and consistent application of disciplinary measures in 
accordance with governance standards.

emissions, and waste. They are also encouraged to manage and report the 
environmental risks associated with their products throughout their lifecycle.
	
	
Polycab organized a value chain workshop involving various value chain partners to 
raise awareness on different sustainability matters. Additionally, the Company is 
developing a structured framework to evaluate the sustainability performance of 
these partners.
	
	
Polycab’s commitment is reflected in the products it manufactures which 
comply with RoHS and REACH standards. The Company actively avoids the use 
of restricted and harmful materials and sources predominantly from trusted 
international suppliers known for their practices, responsible and long-standing 
dedication to sustainability. Acknowledging that suppliers vary in their ESG 
maturity, Polycab supports MSMEs with guidance and resources to foster 
responsible growth.
	
	
The Company is also certified under ISO 50001, ISO 45001, ISO 14001, and

As of March 2025, more than 80% of our procurement comes from ESG-compliant 
suppliers, demonstrating Polycab’s strong commitment to sustainability at every 
level of our business. We intentionally collaborate with suppliers who not only meet 
ESG standards but also actively advocate for sustainable and ethical practices. 
These partners are leading the way in shaping responsible supply chains, and we are 
proud to stand with them.
3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, 
recycling, and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including 
packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) Other waste
	
Polycab has implemented well-defined systems and protocols for the collection, 
segregation, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated across 
its operations. The Company remains committed to advancing its framework for 
identifying, assessing, and safely managing waste, including post-consumer product 
disposal, by continuously aligning with evolving environmental standards and 
stakeholder expectations.
	
(a)	
Plastic waste, including packaging, are dealt with through recyclers authorized by 
the Pollution Control Board (PCB). Additionally, Polycab has partnered with vendors 
who collect plastic packaging waste on its behalf to meet annual Extended Producer 
Responsibility (EPR) compliance targets.
	
(b)	
E-waste, particularly arising from end-of-life FMEG products and defective spare 
parts, is channeled through authorized e-waste recyclers registered with the Central 
or State Pollution Control Boards. A formalized system is in place to ensure that 
e-waste is processed in an environmentally sound manner.
	
(c)	
Hazardous waste generated at manufacturing facilities is managed in strict 
accordance with national and state regulatory frameworks. Such waste is securely 
collected, stored, and disposed of through vendors and recyclers who hold 
appropriate authorizations from Pollution Control Boards.
	
(d)	
Other waste streams, including wood scrap, metal scrap, and cardboard/paper 
scrap, are handled through compliant channels with certified recyclers, ensuring 
adherence to waste tracking, transportation, and disposal norms under applicable 
environmental regulations.
	
In parallel, Polycab has sharpened its emphasis on circular design principles, focusing 
on product lifecycle strategies that reduce environmental impact at every stage. The 
Company has conducted LCAs for six key products, based on a cradle-to-gate model, 
to better understand material and emission hotspots. For core product categories, we 
follow an end-to-end approach, ensuring that input materials can be reused, recycled, 
or repurposed indefinitely. This shift supports both waste minimization and long-term 
resource efficiency, while reinforcing our alignment with national sustainability goals and 
global circular economy practices.
4. 	 Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the 
entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in 
line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to 
Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, EPR is applicable to Polycab. The Company complies with the Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB) guidelines and all relevant EPR rules and regulations. We have 
aligned waste management processes with the EPR guidelines and relevant targets 
across the applicable categories and integrated them into our internal ambitions for the 
circular economy. 
	
Accordingly, the Company has entered into arrangements / agreements with the 
authorized parties to purchase EPR credits. While we have met our target for F.Y. 2024-25, 
we actively endeavor to exceed our recycling targets. In the current financial year, the 
Company was assigned a 100% EPR plastic waste recycling target, which we achieved 
advancing our progress towards circular economy. Similarly, for E-Waste and Battery 
Waste, the Company achieved 100% of the target set by the CPCB.
	
Building on this compliance framework, we are strengthening our waste collection and 
channelization strategy to ensure alignment with national EPR regulations. Our approach 
prioritizes not only effective execution, but also continuous improvement in monitoring via 
the CPCB Portal, reporting, and collaboration with authorized recyclers and handlers.
	
In parallel, we remain committed to raising awareness among the public and business 
partners on responsible disposal. These initiatives form a core part of Polycab’s broader 
environmental stewardship goals and support our transition toward a more circular and 
sustainable materials economy.

10. 	 Health and Safety management system:
	
a. 	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been 
implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such a system?
	
	
Yes. Polycab has developed Occupational Health, Safety & Environment Policy 
and implemented a formal Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
(OHSMS) across all its manufacturing facilities. This system is certified under ISO 
45001:2018 and independently verified by TÜV NORD CERT GmbH.
	
	
The OHSMS was adopted not only to meet statutory obligations under Indian 
laws but also to build a culture of zero harm and continuous improvement. This 
includes the integration of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle as prescribed 
by ISO 45001:2018, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 50001:2015. Additional Indian 
standards such as IS 14489:2018 and IS 17893:2023 are incorporated into our system 
design. The system applies to all direct employees and contract workers whose 
workplace is controlled by Polycab, ensuring 100% workforce coverage under the 
certified framework.
	
	
Polycab has voluntarily implemented this management system to ensure a 
structured and proactive approach to health and safety beyond legal compliance. 
We conduct awareness sessions and regular training on topics such as Hazard 
Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), 
equipping our teams to prevent and manage risks on the ground.
	
	
Senior management leads periodic operational reviews with themes linked to Key 
Result & Responsibility Areas, supporting safety performance tracking and audit 
outcomes. Events such as National Safety Week, Road Safety Week, Fire Safety 
Week, mural competitions, “Walk with Fire Extinguishers,” and the 3-Men Hose Drill 
also reflect our commitment to employee involvement and wellness.
	
b. 	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on 
a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
Polycab has instituted a comprehensive framework to proactively identify and 
mitigate work-related hazards, ensuring the safety and well-being of all personnel 
across its operations.
	
	
Structured Risk Assessment Protocols:
	»
HIRA: Polycab employs the HIRA methodology to systematically identify 
potential hazards and assess associated risks. This process involves evaluating 
the likelihood and severity of potential incidents, enabling the implementation 
of appropriate control measures.
	»
Permit to Work (PTW) System: For non-routine or high-risk activities, such 
as maintenance or confined space entry, a stringent PTW system is in place. 
This ensures that all necessary precautions are taken before commencing such 
tasks, safeguarding workers from unforeseen hazards.
	
	
Employee Engagement and Continuous Monitoring:
	»
Behavioral Safety Initiatives: Regular safety briefings, hazard spotting tours 
and suggestion schemes are conducted to foster a culture of safety awareness 
among employees. These initiatives encourage proactive identification and 
reporting of potential risks.
	»
Monthly HSE Audits: Comprehensive audits are carried out monthly 
to evaluate compliance with safety standards and identify areas for 
improvement. The outcomes of these audits help shape well-defined safety 
initiatives, ensuring a safer and more secure work environment for all.
	»
Toolbox Talks: Daily Toolbox Talks are conducted at the start of shifts across 
all units. These sessions are tailored to specific operational tasks and highlight 
potential hazards, preventive measures, and safe work practices.
	»
Visual Impact Tools: Safety posters, banners, floor markings, hazard signs, and 
“Do’s and Don’ts” displays are prominently placed in work areas to reinforce 
safe behavior and support real-time hazard identification. These visual cues 
are continually updated and aligned with current safety campaigns or specific 
site risks.
	
	
Integration of HSE in Project Lifecycle:
	»
Design and Construction Phases: Health, Safety, and Environment 
considerations are integrated at the design stage of all new projects. During 
construction, adherence to HSE protocols is ensured through dedicated project 
management systems, aligning with international best practices.
	»
Operational Phase: In the operational phase, established HSE management 
systems, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, govern safety practices 
across all units, warehouses, offices, and plants.
	
	
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of these risk assessments, cross-functional 
teams, including safety officers, line managers, and trained personnel regularly 
review the methodology and its implementation. HIRA findings are verified during 
internal audits, and any control measures identified are subject to follow-up for 
completion and effectiveness.
	
	
All findings from hazard identification exercises feed into Polycab’s risk registers, 
enabling leadership to prioritize high-risk areas and allocate resources accordingly. 
These registers are updated periodically and reviewed during HSE Committee 
meetings to align with changes in operations or emerging risks. Polycab’s leadership 
is deeply committed to fostering a safe work environment. This commitment is 
reflected in the Company’s OHSE Policy, which emphasizes continuous improvement 
and adoption of international standards. The Company’s efforts in health and 
safety have been recognized through various national awards and certifications, 
underscoring its dedication to employee well-being.
	
	
Additionally, job safety analysis (JSA) is conducted, and the monthly safety audit 
results are directly linked with individual Key Result Areas to enhance accountability. 
Unified safety standards are maintained using checklists that help flag actionable 
items with turnarounds. 
	
c. 	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and 
to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)
	
	
Yes. Polycab ensures that every worker has both the right and the means to speak 
up about unsafe conditions and step away from them when necessary. This is 
embedded not just in policy, but in day-to-day practice across facilities.
	
	
Safety is a collective responsibility across all levels of the organization, rather 
than a top-down directive. Workers actively participate in identifying hazards, 
with joint shop floor inspections routinely conducted alongside factory managers. 
These walkthroughs help catch potential risks early and form the basis for timely 
corrective actions.
	
	
Channels to raise concerns are built into the Company’s structure. The Safety 
Committee, where worker representation is equal to that of management meets 
regularly to discuss safety issues from the ground level. For more confidential 
matters, employees can turn to the Company’s Whistleblower Policy framework. 
Additionally, Forums such as departmental open discussions and periodic HSE 
meetings promote honest conversations, ensuring concerns are not just heard, but 
acted on.
	
	
To reinforce this right in practice, employees receive explicit instruction during 
onboarding and refresher sessions on their entitlement to refuse unsafe work 
without retaliation. All such cases are reviewed by the respective unit’s safety officer 
and documented for corrective follow-up. In addition, sign-off on the whistleblower 
policy is taken from all employees on a half-yearly basis. In the event of immediate 
withdrawal from hazardous tasks, interim risk control measures are promptly 
implemented to ensure safe resumption of work.
	
	
The effectiveness of this system is regularly reviewed through feedback loops built 
into Polycab’s HSE monitoring framework. Reports of hazard identification or refusal 
to work due to unsafe conditions are logged, investigated, and tracked to resolution 
in the central safety dashboard, which is reviewed during internal safety audits and 
committee meetings.
	
	
Furthermore, we have internal processes and platforms for supporting safe 
withdrawal and feedback mechanisms, helping the management act faster and 
customize system solutions. Risk removal protocols are embedded in the OHSE 
policy, and all cases are logged for trend analysis and systemic corrections.
	
d. 	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical 
and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)
	
	
Yes. Polycab provides its employees with access to a range of healthcare services 
that go beyond work-related medical needs. All team members are covered under 
a group health insurance policy or Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), 
ensuring access to essential healthcare support for themselves and their families.
	
	
Routine health is monitored through regular medical camps held across 
manufacturing sites, while preventive care is prioritized especially for employees over 
40, who are eligible for sponsored screenings through certified diagnostic partners. 
The corporate office also maintains on-site medical support and a means to handle 
minor health concerns and provide immediate relief.
	
	
The Company runs a series of year-round initiatives focused on preventive health 
and awareness ranging from yoga sessions and mental well-being campaigns to 
specialized drives like breast cancer screenings and blood donation camps. These 
programs aim to foster a healthier, more resilient workforce inside and outside 
the workplace.
	
	
In addition, contract workers and third-party personnel at Company-controlled 
sites are also provided with access to primary healthcare services and included in 
site-level medical check-ups and awareness campaigns wherever feasible. New 
employees are provided with a thorough orientation on the full range of medical 
and wellness benefits, including instructions on accessing services both on-site 
and externally.
	
	
Effectiveness of these healthcare initiatives is periodically reviewed through 
participation data, health outcomes tracked at the facility level, and feedback 
collected from employee wellness surveys. Identified gaps, such as in stress 
management or occupational fatigue, are addressed through the implementation 
of targeted programs.
	
	
To ensure timely and accurate monitoring of health data, Polycab has digitized 
its Health, Safety, and Environmental management systems, allowing real-time 
analytics and quick prioritization of healthcare needs. These digital systems have 
significantly improved accuracy, response time, and reporting efficiency. Health 
screenings conducted in FY 2024–25 included a comprehensive panel of tests and a 
physician-led physical exam. Follow-up consultations were arranged where needed 
to ensure employees received personalized care based on screening results. These 
efforts reflect Polycab’s commitment to not only occupational safety, but total 
worker wellness.

An independent assurance has been carried out by TUV India Pvt Ltd on the FY 2024-25 and by KPMG 
Assurance and Consulting Services LLP on the FY 2023-24 indicators in the above table.
12. 	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and 
healthy workplace.
	
At Polycab, workplace safety is deeply embedded in operational philosophy. The 
Company continues to enhance its safety framework through structured policies, 
awareness programs, and proactive systems aimed at preventing incidents and 
fostering a healthy work environment. The goal is not only regulatory compliance but the 
creation of an environment where everyone can perform their duties without health or 
safety concerns.
	
Polycab’s OHSE Policy serves as the backbone of its safety culture, reinforcing a 
commitment to continuous improvement and employee engagement. Every facility 
is governed by a robust safety management system that enables early identification, 
control, and elimination of occupational risks. Emergency response protocols and 
contingency plans are in place to handle unforeseen situations.
	
A data-driven approach ensures transparency by displaying statistical information 
related to incidents, near misses, and safety KPIs on the shop floor, promoting visibility 
and accountability. Employees are actively encouraged to participate in health and 
safety efforts through regular campaigns, training sessions, and structured interactions. 
Visual reminders such as safety signs, “Do’s and Don’ts” boards, and banners support 
day-to-day awareness.
	
The Company aligns its operations with ISO 45001 standards for Occupational Health 
and Safety. This international certification reflects Polycab’s intent to adopt globally 
accepted best practices and ensure operational consistency.
	
In cultivating a zero-harm culture, lean principles like ‘5S’ (Sort, Set in order, Shine, 
Standardize, Sustain) are fully integrated into factory operations. These practices 
contribute to cleaner, safer, and more efficient workplaces. Employee involvement is 
central; workers are included in safety decision-making and implementation across units. 
Safety Committees have been formed at each manufacturing facility with participation 
of at least 50% workers, and meetings are held every month to review concerns, analyze 
incidents, and implement action plans.
	
In addition to internal efforts, Polycab also works with contractors, vendors, and service 
providers to ensure alignment with its health and safety requirements. All third-party 
workers are required to undergo site-specific safety orientation before being deployed 
at any Company-controlled location. Hazards and occupational safety risks linked to 
suppliers and other business partners are assessed and mitigated using controls such as 
administrative procedures, PPE, and engineering interventions.
	
Periodic internal and cross-functional safety audits are a cornerstone of Polycab’s 
safety assurance process. Safety events, including National Safety Week, National 
Fire Week, and Road Safety Week, are observed on a large scale, featuring activities 
such as fire drills, emergency preparedness exercises, safety quizzes, and hazard 
identification contests.
	
Key safety domains are addressed through specific measures:

Lighting systems maintained as per Indian Safety (IS) standards for visibility 
and safety.
	
As part of its broader health and safety framework, Polycab has embedded 
comprehensive safety training modules into its employee development cycle. These 
include role-specific training on hazardous materials, machine operation, PPE use, and 
fire response. Both permanent and contract workers are trained during onboarding and 
receive periodic refreshers. Awareness initiatives such as safety quizzes, exhibitions, and 
on-ground demonstrations ensure continuous engagement.
	
The Company’s digitized safety management system, supported by the internal 
platforms, helps track safety incidents, audit outcomes, and improvement areas. This 
digital infrastructure enables immediate visibility into safety performance and enhances 
decision-making at both plant and corporate levels.
	
All employees and workers whose work or workplace is controlled by Polycab (100%) are 
covered under the certified Occupational Health and Safety Management System. This 
coverage extends to third-party workers on site. The system is internally audited across 
all units, and a third-party certification body validates compliance and effectiveness, with 
no exclusions.

The majority of our manufacturing locations are covered under the ISO 45001/2018: 
Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. Additionally, all our 
manufacturing facilities have been audited for IS 14489:2018 by competent third parties. 
Complying with safe working conditions is an essential aspect of Employee Health and 
Safety management systems. In addition, our units undergo periodic Environment, 
Health & Safety audits at all divisions to verify compliance with Standards.
15. 	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address 
safety-related incidents (if any) and on significant risks / concerns arising 
from assessments of Health & Safety practices and working conditions.
	
Polycab maintains a strong internal mechanism to identify, address, and learn from 
safety-related incidents. Regular safety audits are conducted across all manufacturing 
facilities to assess adherence to prescribed standards. When gaps or non-conformities 
are found, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are promptly implemented. These 
actions are documented, tracked, and followed up to ensure long-term effectiveness.
	
Every near miss, regardless of scale, is thoroughly investigated to understand its 
root cause. Comprehensive reports for significant near misses are submitted to the 
Management Committee and Board, ensuring leadership oversight and accountability. 
Learnings from such incidents is shared across all sites to enable systemic improvements 
and prevent recurrence.
	
Polycab conducts root cause analyses using the hierarchy of controls: firstly elimination 
and substitution of hazards, followed by engineering and administrative controls, and 
finally, use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Training sessions are conducted to 
ensure proper PPE usage and understanding of risk control measures by employees and 
contract workers alike.
	
To enhance visual communication and foster day-to-day awareness, Polycab has 
increased safety placards, posters, and signage at strategic locations across all sites. 
These materials reinforce procedural reminders, key hazard warnings, and emergency 
protocols, contributing to a consistent visual language of safety and reinforcing the 
message that safety is a collective responsibility.
	
Polycab’s health and safety team proactively conducts assessments to uncover potential 
hazards, occupational risks, and environmental concerns linked to day-to-day operations. 
Each process is evaluated not only for its risks but also for its opportunities to improve 
safety and operational efficiency. To this end, the Company maintains and periodically 
reviews both risk-opportunity and aspect-impact registers. These tools serve as living 
documents, helping teams prioritize actions based on criticality and recurrence.
	
Corrective actions arising from these risk evaluations and root cause analyses are 
circulated throughout all manufacturing units to ensure uniform implementation. The 
aim is not just to solve an issue locally but to embed preventive practices throughout the 
Company. To ensure accountability and sustained impact, CAPA actions are reviewed 
during internal safety committee meetings and verified through on-site walkthroughs 
and spot audits. In cases involving high-risk incidents, third-party validation or external 
safety consultants may be engaged to assess effectiveness and close the loop.
	
Incident investigations and reviews are logged into the Company’s digitized HSE 
platform, SPARSH, allowing real-time tracking of issues, assignment of responsibilities, 
and analytics for recurring trends. This digital system also supports site heads in 
prioritizing corrective actions and enhances visibility for senior leadership.
	
Workers and supervisors are also involved in the post-incident review process, particularly 
in high-risk areas. This bottom-up engagement ensures that local insights contribute to 
the refinement of safety controls and that improvements are practical and grounded in 
daily realities. Regular worker participation in incident reviews is part of the broader HSE 
governance model and helps in continuous improvement of occupational safety systems.
	
Ongoing efforts to build a resilient safety culture include regular drills, targeted training 
sessions, and awareness programs designed to keep employees alert, informed, and 
engaged in safety as a shared responsibility. Fire drills are conducted every 2 months, and 
mock drills are conducted every 6 months. We ensure that, in these drills, there is 100% 
participation of our workers.
Leadership Indicators
1. 	
Does the entity extend any life insurance or any compensatory package in 
the event of death of (A) Employees (Y/N) (B) Workers (Y/N)
	
Polycab is deeply committed to the welfare of its employees (A), workers (B), and their 
families, including support during times of personal loss. To provide financial security in 
such situations, the Company offers group life insurance coverage to all employees and 
workers. This ensures that, in the unfortunate event of their passing, their families receive 
the necessary financial support.
	
In addition to life insurance, Polycab has implemented a Demise Policy to support families 
of employees who pass away during service. The Company ensures all employees are 
informed about the policy’s benefits and procedures. Beyond formal policies, Polycab may 
also extend additional support based on the needs of the bereaved family, reflecting a 
thoughtful and compassionate approach. This comprehensive support system highlights 
the organization’s strong sense of responsibility and its ongoing commitment to the 
security and well-being of its people and their loved ones.
2. 	 Provide the measures undertaken by the entity to ensure that statutory 
dues have been deducted and deposited by the value chain partners.
	
As part of our overarching Governance Framework, ethics and compliance are upheld to 
the highest standards, wherein our value chain partners are expected to adhere strictly 
to these principles. Polycab’s Supplier Code of Conduct emphasizes on our expectations 
from our value chain partners. The Company primarily sources materials from suppliers 
who are actively advancing in their ESG journey and demonstrate strong governance 
practices, thereby ensuring compliance with the Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct, 
including diligent adherence to statutory obligations and timely payments.
	
Also, the Company has taken the following additional steps to ensure that our value chain 
partners promptly deduct and deposit statutory dues to ensure their compliance with 
laws and regulations:
	
a) 	
Monitoring PF & ESIC: The Human Resource team monitors PF and ESIC contributions 
for contract laborers working with our supply chain partners at Polycab premises. 
Service Charge Release Letter is submitted by the labour contractors along with 
their compliance certificate and document. The HR team verifies the document and 
compliance with the laws and forwards it to the finance department for processing.
	
b) 	
Vendor Engagement: We engage with our suppliers during onboarding, requiring 
them to declare compliance with statutory dues. We also emphasize the importance 
of timely payments.
	
c) 	
Goods and Services Tax (GST) Checks: Our Finance Team verifies GST payments 
from our supply chain partners using the GST portal every quarter. Any non-
compliance is escalated to the relevant purchase manager for action.
	
d) 	
Event for termination of contract with Vendors and deficiency of service included 
non-compliance with human rights and other ESG parameters.
3. 	 Provide the number of employees / workers having suffered high 
consequence work related injury / ill-health / fatalities (as reported in Q11 
of Essential Indicators above), who have been rehabilitated and placed 
in suitable employment or whose family members have been placed in 
suitable employment:
	
There were no cases of employees/ workers having suffered high consequence 
work-related injury/ ill-health/ fatalities, needing rehabilitation or placement in 
suitable employment.
4. `	 Does the entity provide transition assistance programs to facilitate 
continued employability and the management of career endings resulting 
from retirement or termination of employment? (Yes/ No)
	
Yes, Polycab provides transition assistance programs to support employees as they 
approach retirement or transition out of the organization. The Company is deeply 
committed to ensuring that its people are supported not only during their active years of 
service but also as they move into the next phase of their professional or personal lives.
	
In addition, Polycab conducts thoughtfully designed sessions for retiring employees to 
facilitate this transition. These sessions offer a platform for individuals to reflect on their 
careers, share valuable experiences, and receive guidance on financial planning, helping 
them prepare for retirement with confidence and clarity. The retiring personnel are 
encouraged to provide training sessions to the new entrants and team members.
	
In recognition of the knowledge and dedication that long-serving employees bring, 
Polycab also offers opportunities for continued engagement through advisory or full-time 
consultancy roles. In such cases, while the employment status may shift from regular 
staff to fixed-term contracts, these individuals continue to enjoy benefits similar to full-
time employees. Fixed term contracts are evaluated and offered to retiring employees 
based on predetermined criteria and HR policies. This not only allows the company to 
retain valuable institutional knowledge but also ensures that retiring employees remain 
connected and involved in a meaningful way.
5. 	 Details on assessment of value chain partners:
	
Polycab places strong emphasis on responsible and ethical business practices across its 
supply chain. At the core of this approach is the Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires 
all business partners to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to fully 
comply with local Occupational Health and Safety regulations. This includes securing the 
necessary licenses, permits, and approvals from relevant authorities.
	
To support this journey, Polycab is providing training and encouraging suppliers and 
customers to commit to shared ESG goals, helping create a more responsible and aligned 
value chain. To uphold high standards, the Company conducts thorough evaluations of 
its suppliers, focusing on their ESG performance. These assessments cover a range of 
criteria, including carbon footprint, labour practices, diversity and inclusion, and ethical 
conduct. During the current financial year, Polycab assessed more than 80% of its input 
material suppliers (by value), most of whom are reputable international companies with 
well-established sustainability practices, using publicly available reports.
	
Polycab is also working to build awareness across its wider network of partners. The 
Company has launched a range of initiatives some formal, others more informal to help 
its value chain better understand their role in advancing responsible practices. Efforts 
are underway to assess other key stakeholders, including dealers, distributors, business 
associates, and even customers, focusing on issues related to environment, health, safety, 
and human rights. As part of these efforts, the Company has conducted awareness 
workshops with both suppliers and customers and is establishing processes for data 
sharing. Additionally, the Company is developing a structured framework to evaluate 
the sustainability performance of these partners. These initiatives are designed not only 
to help the Company meet its own sustainability objectives, but also to inspire its value 
chain to embrace sustainable practices with equal commitment.
6. 	 Provide details of any corrective actions taken or underway to address 
significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health and safety 
practices and working conditions of value chain partners.
	
No significant impact / risks have been observed.
Principle 4: Businesses should respect the interests of and be responsive to all 
its stakeholders.
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity.
	
Polycab employs a systematic and inclusive approach to identify and engage with its key 
stakeholder groups, recognizing that stakeholder trust and collaboration are essential 
for sustainable growth. The process begins with mapping individuals and entities that 
significantly influence or are influenced by Polycab’s operations. This includes internal 
stakeholders like employees and management, as well as external parties such as 
customers, suppliers, investors, regulatory bodies, and community members. The 
identification process is guided by the principles outlined in our Governance Policy , 
emphasizing ethical conduct, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness.
	
Polycab maintains ongoing dialogues with stakeholders through various channels:
	»
Surveys and Feedback Forms: Regularly distributed to capture stakeholder 
perceptions and expectations.
	»
Consultations and Interviews: Conducted with key stakeholder groups to delve 
deeper into specific concerns and suggestions.
	»
Stakeholder Forums and Meetings: Organized to facilitate direct communication 
and collaborative problem-solving.
	»
Third-party consultants are appointed to evaluate the stakeholders identified and 
formulate mechanism to build sustainable relationships with them.
These mechanisms ensure that stakeholder insights are integrated into decision-making 
processes, aligning business strategies with stakeholder interests. Insights gathered from 
stakeholder engagements are systematically analyzed and incorporated into Polycab’s 
strategic planning. This ensures that the Company’s objectives and initiatives are aligned with 
stakeholder expectations, fostering mutual value creation.
Our commitment to stakeholder-centric governance is further reinforced by our adherence 
to international frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Polycab recognizes that stakeholder 
dynamics are ever evolving. Therefore, we review and refine our stakeholder identification and 
engagement processes, when required, to remain responsive to changing needs and to uphold 
our commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth.

Leadership Indicators
1.	
Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the 
Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is 
delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
	
Polycab firmly believes that meaningful and ongoing stakeholder engagement is a 
cornerstone of resilient and responsible business leadership. Our engagement strategy 
goes beyond communication; it is a structured, two-way process that informs governance, 
shapes strategy, and drives long-term value creation across environmental, social, and 
economic dimensions.
	
We engage regularly with all key stakeholder groups: employees, customers, dealers, 
distributors, suppliers, investors, communities, regulatory bodies, vendors (including 
MSMEs) to understand evolving expectations, assess impacts, and build mutual trust. 
This engagement is carried out through a combination of formal mechanisms (e.g., 
surveys, reviews, assessments, feedback, audits, consultations) and informal dialogue (e.g. 
dealer meets, supplier interactions, customer discussions, product reviews, expos, over 
the counter sessions), ensuring we remain responsive and adaptive to stakeholder needs. 
At the governance level, our Board of Directors provides oversight through dedicated 
structures, particularly the Audit Committee, the CSR and ESG Committee and the Risk 
Management Committee. These committees play a pivotal role in:
	»
Evaluating the Whistle complaints
	»
Evaluating ESG and climate-related risks and opportunities
	»
Overseeing sustainability strategy alignment with business objectives
	»
Monitoring performance of statutory CSR programs and ESG initiatives
	
In line with the best global practices, Polycab has strategically expanded the scope of its 
CSR Committee, reconstituting it as the CSR and ESG Committee to reflect the growing 
relevance of Environmental, Social, and Governance factors in corporate decision-making 
in the past year. The Committee now supports broader strategic goals such as resource 
efficiency, inclusive development, sustainable innovation, and ethical supply chain 
governance, ensuring that ESG is embedded across the Company’s business lifecycle. 
The Risk Management Committee, in parallel, is tasked with identifying emerging risks 
that may impact the Company’s operations, including those related to climate change, 
regulatory shifts, labour standards, and environmental compliance and developing 
mitigation strategies that align with our enterprise-wide risk framework.
	
To further strengthen ESG oversight, Polycab has also established a dedicated ESG 
Council that meets regularly to discuss key ESG-related matters. The Council serves as 
an internal advisory body, facilitating cross-functional collaboration and driving ESG 
integration across operations.
	
Engagement is not limited to the boardroom. Business and Functional Heads actively 
gather insights from frontline stakeholder interactions, bringing real-time feedback into 
strategic planning processes. This insight flows into Board familiarization programs, 
quarterly reviews, and long-range planning cycles helping inform decisions around 
innovation, expansion, and sustainability initiatives. We also maintain regular dialogue 
with communities, especially around our CSR focus areas. Inputs from local stakeholders 
directly shapes our annual social impact planning, ensuring that interventions are 
contextually relevant, participatory, and measurable.
2.	
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification 
and management of environmental and social topics (Yes / No). If so, 
provide details of instances as to how the input received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
	
Yes. Polycab maintains ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to understand what matters 
most to them and the business. This includes structured engagements like surveys, ESG 
training sessions, and feedback forums as well as informal interactions with employees, 
suppliers, and customers. These conversations shape our materiality assessments and help 
ensure our policies and programs stay relevant.
	
Our sustainability framework is designed to create long-term stakeholder value, and 
stakeholder input central to identifying material topics and evolving our sustainability 
strategy. These material topics are reviewed and updated through structured 
consultation, which are elaborated in detail on pages 53 of the report.
	
We conduct regular awareness and training sessions on environmental and social topics, 
for internal teams and external partners. These sessions not only build knowledge but also 
serve as a two-way forum for sharing and implementing feedback. For instance, supplier 
input during onboarding led to refinements in our ESG assessment criteria.
Our major customers are also increasingly invested in our sustainability progress. Many of 
them share detailed ESG questionnaires that help us understand their evolving expectations. 
Responding to these has helped us sharpen our disclosures and align better with global 
benchmarks. We also track broader global standards and frameworks which provide valuable 
insights into international expectations, enabling us to recalibrate internal practices where 
needed. They have played a role in guiding improvements in areas like energy efficiency, 
emissions tracking, and responsible sourcing.
Stakeholder input has directly influenced updates to several of our key policies, including those 
related to human rights, responsible supply chain, and waste management. This responsive 
approach ensures our ESG roadmap reflects both on-the-ground realities and emerging 
global standards.
Based on our value: winning together we place emphasis on stakeholder inputs. We gather 
input on Board composition, diversity and refreshment, leadership structure, long-term strategy, 
corporate purpose and sustainability issues, good governance practices and ethical corporate 
culture, human capital management, compensation discussion and analysis and shareholder 
and stakeholder engagement. The inputs are analyzed and actions taken / implemented to the 
extent reasonable in best interest of all key stakeholders.

4. 	 Do you have a focal point (Individual/ Committee) responsible for 
addressing human rights impacts or issues caused or contributed to by the 
business? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. Polycab India Limited maintains a clear and structured approach to safeguarding 
human rights across its operations and value chain. At the centre of this governance 
structure is the Company’s Whistle Committee, which is designated to handle any concerns, 
violations, or adverse impacts related to human rights. The Whistle Officer, as part of this 
committee, is specifically responsible for ensuring that credible information is acted upon 
promptly and that appropriate steps are taken to investigate and resolve issues raised in 
good faith.
	
The Company has embedded human rights protection into its governance structure through 
formal policies such as the Human Rights Policy, the Equal Opportunity Policy, and the 
Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy. These documents establish clear expectations and 
standards to protect the dignity, rights, and safety of not just employees, but also vendors, 
contractors, suppliers, and other partners connected to Polycab’s operations.
	
Issues addressed under this governance structure encompass a varied range, including but 
not limited to sexual harassment, discrimination, abuse of authority, child and forced labour, 
human trafficking, harassment, bullying, safety, and inclusion. These matters fall within 
the purview of the Whistle Committee, the Internal Committee (for POSH), or designated 
officers depending on the nature of the concern. Polycab enforces a zero-tolerance policy on 
human rights violations and ensures all allegations are handled with fairness, confidentiality, 
and accountability.
	
To build awareness and strengthen compliance, the Company organizes regular training 
sessions that cover the scope, implications, and procedures related to human rights issues. 
Employees and stakeholders are encouraged to report violations through a protected 
disclosure mechanism, accessible via the official reporting channel: speakup@polycab.com.
	
Polycab remains committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical conduct and 
continues to enhance its systems for redressal and prevention, reinforcing a workplace 
culture grounded in respect, fairness, and equal opportunity.
5. 	 Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to 
human rights issues.
	
Polycab is deeply committed to upholding human rights across all levels of its operations 
and encourages all stakeholders to ensure compliance thereto. To support this, the 
Company has put in place a clear and accessible Human Rights Policy, applicable not only 
to employees, directors, and officers, but also to subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated 
companies. Rooted in globally recognized frameworks like the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the ILO Declaration, the policy covers a broad range of issues including 
sexual harassment, misuse of authority, workplace safety, dignity and respect, child and 
forced labour, equality, and protection against bullying and harassment. Human Rights 
violations are considered with zero tolerance, and stakeholders are informed of termination 
of relationship if found guilty of human rights violation. Affirmation is sought from 
key stakeholders.
	
Polycab believes that fostering a safe, fair, and respectful work environment is a shared 
responsibility. The Company actively engages with employees, communities, and 
stakeholders to ensure these standards are consistently upheld. To address serious 
misconduct, a Disciplinary Action Policy is in place, outlining clear steps for resolution. A 
senior-level disciplinary committee carefully reviews cases and ensures fair action is taken. 
Anyone within the organization can raise concerns confidentially via speakup@polycab.com.
	
Further strengthening its commitment to ethical conduct and employee protection, Polycab 
has also established the Whistle Blower Policy and Sexual Harassment Redressal Policy. 
These frameworks provide safe and structured avenues for stakeholders to raise concerns at 
any time, with complaints managed by designated officers or internal committees (including 
the Whistle Committee) to ensure fairness, confidentiality, and timely resolution.

Polycab actively promotes a culture of open communication to address human rights 
concerns within the organization. We strive to create an environment where employees 
feel empowered to raise issues and contribute to the continuous enhancement of the 
Company’s human rights practices.
6. 	 Number of complaints on the following made by employees and workers:
	
During FY 2024-25, one complaint related to sexual harassment was reported and is 
being investigated in line with the Company’s established redressal. No complaints were 
received concerning workplace discrimination, child labour, forced or involuntary labour, 
wage-related concerns, or other human rights violations. However, the complaints related 
to misconduct, insubordination, and violations of the Company’s code of conduct were 
duly addressed in accordance with established procedures.
7. 	
Complaints filed under the sexual harassment of women at workplace 
(Prevention, Prohibition and redressal) Act 2013 in the following format.
	
During FY 2024-25, one complaint was received under the Sexual Harassment of Women 
at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH), which is 
being investigated as per the prescribed procedures. In comparison, no complaints were 
reported under the POSH Act during FY 2023-24.
8. 	 Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in 
discrimination and harassment cases.
	
At Polycab, creating a safe, inclusive, and respectful work environment is not just a policy 
but a deeply held value. The Company is committed to ensuring that all employees 
feel supported and protected, especially when it comes to addressing misconduct 
or harassment.
	
To uphold this commitment, Polycab has implemented a Whistleblower Policy that 
allows individuals to raise concerns in a secure and confidential way. People can choose 
to remain anonymous, and the policy provides full protection against any form of 
retaliation. Whether it is the fear of losing a job, being denied a promotion, or facing 
unfair treatment, the policy ensures that no one who brings forward a genuine concern 
will face negative consequences. Complaints can be submitted directly to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, and each case is handled with care, fairness, and complete 
confidentiality. The Company harnesses a ‘Zero fear of retaliation’ Policy to encourage the 
reporting of incidences without fear of adverse action against the discloser for engaging 
in protected activity.
	
Alongside this, the Company’s Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy reflects its 
zero-tolerance approach to workplace harassment. Polycab has set up an Internal 
Committee to investigate such matters, made up of a woman presiding officer, two 
internal members with experience in legal or social work, and one external member from a 
relevant professional background. This committee is responsible for conducting impartial 
inquiries, recommending suitable actions, and ensuring that those who come forward 
are not subjected to any form of discrimination. All parties involved are advised not to 
communicate during the investigation to maintain objectivity, and the entire process is 
kept confidential to protect the dignity of everyone involved. Together, these policies show 
Polycab’s deep-rooted belief in putting its people first. The focus remains on building a 
workplace culture where fairness, trust, and safety are at the heart of every interaction.
9. 	 Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and 
contracts? (Yes/No)
	
At Polycab, responsible business conduct extends across the entire supply chain. To 
ensure that all partners operate with the same level of integrity and commitment to 
ethical practices, the Company has embedded its Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) into 
every business agreement, purchase order, and contract.
	
The SCoC applies to all entities that engage with Polycab, including suppliers, service 
providers, vendors, contractors, dealers, distributors, agents, consultants, joint venture 
partners, and other third parties. This also includes their employees, representatives, and 
anyone who provides or seeks to provide goods or services to the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries, affiliates, or business units.
	
Our respective agreements with stakeholders provides for termination of business 
relation in the event the stakeholders violate any human rights. Further, the Company 
reserves the right to deduct such an amount as it deems necessary for such violations.
	
Polycab expects every supplier to follow the principles outlined in the Code, which are 
aligned with both legal requirements and international standards. These include key 
environmental, social, and governance areas such as fair working conditions, anti-
harassment policies, and ethical labour practices. The Company places a strong emphasis 
on ESG performance when evaluating suppliers and actively promotes awareness and 
understanding of the Code. To support this, Polycab has launched supplier awareness 
programs and requires formal acknowledgment of the SCoC to ensure clear and 
consistent compliance.
	
Through these efforts, Polycab reinforces its commitment to building a responsible and 
sustainable value chain, where ethics and accountability guide every partnership.

awareness and education. We actively conduct ongoing sensitization and awareness 
programs to educate our employees and workers on critical societal issues such as child 
labour, forced or involuntary labour, and discrimination in employment. Our aim is to 
foster a culture where dignity, fairness, and human rights are upheld at every level of our 
operations and value chain. We’re proud to report that no complaints related to child 
labour, forced labour, involuntary labour, or discriminatory practices were received during

The Company maintains strong risk management practices through well-defined 
policies and structured employee training. These initiatives ensure that employees are

assessments, and adherence to ISO standards reinforce our commitment to proactive risk 
identification and mitigation.
Leadership Indicators
1. 	
Details of a business process being modified / introduced as a result of 
addressing human rights grievances/complaints. 
	
Polycab places a strong emphasis on protecting and promoting human rights across 
its operations and partnerships. While there have been no specific complaints reported 
this year, the Company takes a proactive approach to this important issue. Employees 
receive mandatory training on essential topics such as the Code of Conduct, workplace 
diversity, and fostering an inclusive environment. These efforts help create a culture of 
respect and awareness. In addition, Polycab’s whistleblower mechanism is available 
to all stakeholders, offering a safe and confidential way to report any concerns about 
misconduct or inappropriate behaviour.
	
Through its Supplier Code of Conduct, the Company sets clear expectations for all 
suppliers and partners, requiring them to follow ethical business practices and respect 
human rights. The vendor onboarding process is designed to assess environmental, social, 
and governance factors, with special focus on choosing suppliers who demonstrate strong 
human rights performance and are transparent about their ESG commitments. Zero 
tolerance to non-compliance and zero retaliation for whistleblowing with a single door 
mechanism through speakup@polycab.com.
	
When selecting suppliers, Polycab gives preference to those who openly disclose their 
sustainability practices and show a clear commitment to upholding human rights. The 
Company’s Human Rights Policy reflects this broader vision. It is built on internationally 
recognized frameworks, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Labour Organization’s fundamental principles. The 
Company further demonstrates zero tolerance and takes adverse actions in the form 
of show cause / termination notice for non-compliance with the policies laid down by 
the Company.
2. 	 Details of the scope and coverage of any Human rights due 
diligence conducted.
	
At Polycab, creating a safe, fair, and respectful workplace is a priority. Most of the 
Company’s facilities are certified under ISO 45001, a standard that helps ensure 
strong practices around employee safety, working conditions, and respect for human 
rights. Further, MMJC has reviewed the policies and procedures together with the 
implementation and effectiveness of the processes and confirmed that the policies and 
procedures are adequate and functioning well.
	
Several of Polycab’s international clients conduct regular audits at its facilities, expecting 
compliance not only with local regulations but also with global human rights standards 
and good governance practices. In response, Polycab provides comprehensive assurances 
across a broad spectrum of areas, including the prevention of discrimination, child and 
forced labour, protection against sexual and workplace harassment, adherence to fair 
working hours, and towards minimum wage payments.
	
By aligning with these expectations and going beyond compliance, Polycab continues to 
build a workplace culture grounded in responsibility, care, and respect for every individual.
3. 	 Is the premise/office of the entity accessible to differently abled visitors, 
as per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2016?
	
In line with our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, Polycab has taken meaningful 
steps to create a barrier-free environment for all. Our head office is equipped with 
ramps at entry points and in lobbies to support individuals using wheelchairs, and our 
washrooms are fully accessible to ensure comfort and convenience for differently abled 
individuals. While we continue to enhance accessibility across our other locations, we are 
actively working to upgrade infrastructure in workspaces, restrooms, common areas, and 
circulation zones to better accommodate the needs of differently abled employees and 
visitors. As part of this ongoing effort, we have also identified and modified a new office 
location in Noida, ensuring it is fully equipped with inclusive infrastructure to support 
people with disabilities, underscoring our dedication to building a truly diverse and 
welcoming workplace.
4. 	 Details on assessment of value chain partners:
	
Polycab places strong emphasis on responsible and ethical business practices across its 
supply chain. At the core of this approach is the Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires 
all business partners to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to fully 
comply with local Occupational Health and Safety regulations. This includes securing the 
necessary licenses, permits, and approvals from relevant authorities.
	
To support this journey, Polycab is providing training and encouraging suppliers and 
customers to commit to shared ESG goals, helping create a more responsible and aligned 
value chain. To uphold high standards, the Company conducts thorough evaluations of 
its suppliers, focusing on their ESG performance. These assessments cover a range of 
criteria, including carbon footprint, labour practices, diversity and inclusion, and ethical 
conduct. During the current financial year, Polycab assessed more than 80% of its input 
material suppliers (by value), most of whom are reputable international companies with 
well-established sustainability practices, using publicly available reports.
	
Polycab is also working to build awareness across its wider network of partners. The 
Company has launched a range of initiatives some formal, others more informal to help 
its value chain better understand their role in advancing responsible practices. Efforts 
are underway to assess other key stakeholders, including dealers, distributors, business 
associates, and even customers, focusing on issues related to environment, health, safety, 
and human rights. As part of these efforts, the Company has conducted awareness 
workshops with both suppliers and customers and is establishing processes for data 
sharing. Additionally, the Company is developing a structured framework to evaluate 
the sustainability performance of these partners. These initiatives are designed not only 
to help the Company meet its own sustainability objectives, but also to inspire its value 
chain to embrace sustainable practices with equal commitment.

of a broader strategy aimed at minimizing environmental impact while supporting 
responsible growth.
	
In the financial year 2024-25, Polycab made significant progress by increasing its use 
of renewable energy. Out of the Company’s total electricity consumption, 43.76 million 
kilowatt-hours were sourced from renewable energy, accounting for 17 percent of overall 
usage. This shift led to a substantial reduction of 31,336 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
emissions. Of this, close to 14,285 tonnes were reduced using 19.95 million units from solar 
and wind captive sources. An additional 17,051 tonnes were saved using 23.81 million units 
from bilateral renewable energy agreements.
	
The Company has also invested in rooftop solar installations to further enhance its 
clean energy capabilities. Two key facilities have benefited from these additions, with a 
1.972-megawatt system installed at the Daman unit and a 1.273-megawatt system at 
the Halol unit. These solar projects are making a significant contribution to reducing the 
Company’s carbon footprint.
	
To expand its renewable portfolio further, Polycab entered into bilateral agreements for 
wind energy and wind-solar hybrid arrangement. These agreements are helping diversify 
the Company’s energy mix and increase its access to sustainable power.
	
In addition to these initiatives, Polycab has installed a windmill with a capacity of 8.1 
megawatts and a solar plant with a capacity of 9.535 megawatts. The energy generated 
from these sources is used directly to power manufacturing operations. Together with 
bilateral power sources, Polycab’s total renewable energy capacity now stands at 32.755 
megawatts. Looking ahead, we are planning to deepen our decarbonization efforts by 
initiating projects that address Scope 3 emissions. This includes advancing green sourcing 
practices and strengthening collaboration with suppliers to reduce emissions across our 
value chain. These initiatives are designed to further align our sustainability goals with 
global best practices and contribute meaningfully to our long-term climate objectives.

manufacturing, risk-mitigation protocols, and real-time communication systems. Health 
and safety measures are embedded into site operations, while insurance coverage 
safeguards key assets against natural calamities and other disruptions. The Company’s 
continuity planning focuses on minimizing downtime, protecting employee welfare, and 
securing supply chains. Polycab also integrates risk management into strategic decisions, 
regularly reviewing site-specific vulnerabilities and updating response plans accordingly.
	
In addition to physical infrastructure continuity, Polycab has developed an IT Continuity 
and Information Security framework that ensures the uninterrupted functioning of digital 
systems. The framework is designed to:
	
(1)	
Maintain business contingency for critical IT processes,
	
(2)	
Provide structured training to IT personnel on disaster recovery and incident 
response,
	
(3)	
Communicate IT resilience capabilities to internal stakeholders, reinforcing 
organizational readiness.
	
Polycab’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) is aligned with globally 
accepted standards, and the Company has undertaken initiatives toward compliance 
with frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001. These efforts focus on the protection of sensitive 
data, securing digital infrastructure, and continual improvement of security controls 
through stringent compliances, risk assessments and internal audits.

Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such

Polycab’s Supplier Code of Conduct encourages its partners to take thoughtful steps to 
reduce their environmental impact. This includes adopting energy-efficient methods, 
using cleaner technologies, and actively working to minimise deforestation, emissions, 
and waste. At the same time, suppliers are expected to follow all environmental 
regulations, whether local, national, or international.
	
To make sure these values are reflected across its supply chain, Polycab regularly reviews 
its suppliers on key environmental, social, and governance aspects. These evaluations 
consider factors such as carbon footprint, labour practices, diversity and inclusion, and 
overall ethical behaviour. In the current financial year, the Company reviewed more 
than 80 percent of its input material suppliers by value. Most of these are established 
international companies with a solid track record in sustainability, assessed using their 
publicly available reports.
	
Polycab is also working to build awareness across its wider network of partners. The 
Company has launched a range of initiatives some formal, others more informal to 
help its value chain better understand their role in advancing responsible practices. 
Efforts are underway to assess other key stakeholders, including dealers, distributors, 
business associates, and even customers, focusing on issues related to environment, 
health, safety, and human rights. As part of these efforts, the Company has conducted 
awareness workshops with both suppliers and customers and is establishing processes 
for data sharing. These initiatives are designed not only to help the Company meet its 
own sustainability objectives, but also to inspire its value chain to embrace sustainable 
practices with equal commitment. To support this journey, Polycab is providing training 
and encouraging suppliers and customers to commit to shared ESG goals, helping create 
a more responsible and aligned supply chain.

touchpoints for identifying and recording grievances. Each concern is reviewed by the 
respective project teams and, where necessary, escalated to the CSR & ESG Committee 
for further resolution. It is with humility to say that no grievances were reported in 
relation to program commitments, with most feedback reflecting a strong interest in the

within their own communities but also became advocates for improved animal husbandry practices. They conducted awareness 
sessions in neighboring villages, focusing on better feeding, breeding, hygiene, and overall livestock care. This grassroots initiative 
helped bridge critical service gaps while building local capacity and awareness around livestock health and productivity.

Construction of 
Medical College
NA
NA
NA As the Marathwada region has very few state-of-the-art medical colleges, establishing a medical college in the region would 
help increase the number of available seats. We supported a 33 year old trust focused on inculcating ethics and values in medical 
students in setting up a Medical College cum Hospital in Aurangabad with an objective to provide society with committed and 
dedicated Doctors for the service of Humanity. Around 150 students are expected to benefit in the first academic year  2025-2026.

NA
NA This initiative was launched to tackle grassroots challenges in rural communities through direct Village Community Interactions 
involving local leaders, government officials, and communities. Key issues identified included animal menace, water 
management, renewable energy, fair crop pricing, malnutrition, and environmental concerns. To connect youth innovation 
with community development, a college-level competition was held where students proposed viable, feasible, replicable, and 
sustainable solutions. Winning projects were recognized by the Collector and District Magistrate and implemented in villages, 
enabling students to create real-world impact while addressing critical local needs.
	
At Polycab, we believe true progress is inclusive. That is why we focus our efforts on 
reaching the most vulnerable and underserved communities. By engaging with them 
directly and listening to their lived experiences, we design initiatives that reflect their real 
needs and create change that truly matters.
	
Through these abovementioned ongoing community engagement and targeted 
interventions, Polycab has made meaningful strides in improving access to essential

Principle 9 Businesses should engage with and provide value to their consumers in a responsible manner
Essential Indicators
1. 	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer 
complaints and feedback.
	
Polycab has implemented a structured and responsive customer service framework that 
allows consumers to share their grievances and feedback through multiple accessible 
channels. The Company’s complaint management process is designed to ensure prompt 
resolution, transparency, and continuous improvement in service delivery.

connect on 7304485540
	
Once a complaint is received, it is registered in the Company’s centralized CRM platform, 
which generates a unique ID for tracking. Dedicated customer care executives promptly 
assess the issue, reach out to the customer to collect any additional information if 
needed, and aim to offer remote resolutions wherever feasible. If a technical visit is 
required, an engineer is deployed to the site. Throughout this process, customers are kept 
informed at each stage. In line with Polycab’s service policy, most consumer complaints 
are addressed and resolved within 24 to 48 hours. If dispatches or product replacements 
are involved, actions are initiated within the stipulated timelines defined by internal 
service standards. In EPC-related cases, customers are first advised to engage with the 
EPC team; unresolved matters are escalated through joint evaluation determining the 
appropriate solution whether repair, replacement, or a site visit.
	
The final step in the complaint lifecycle involves obtaining the customer’s confirmation 
via the “HAPPY” code, which signifies closure and satisfaction. To ensure accountability 
and track service quality, outbound calls are made post-resolution to collect structured 
feedback. Polycab systematically reviews customer feedback to identify recurring issues, 
monitor satisfaction levels, and implement product or service-level improvements. This 
closed-loop mechanism strengthens customer trust while supporting the Company’s 
broader commitment to operational excellence.
	
Polycab also actively monitors and engages with customers through its official social 
media platforms, allowing for real-time feedback collection via Facebook, Twitter (X), 
and Instagram. These additional touchpoints ensure that customer voice is heard 
across digital channels, supporting brand transparency and accessibility. To ensure 
accountability and track service quality, outbound verification calls are made post-
resolution to collect structured feedback. Polycab systematically reviews this feedback to 
identify recurring issues, monitor satisfaction levels, and implement product or service-
level improvements. These insights feed into design, quality, and operations teams to 
enhance future customer experience.
