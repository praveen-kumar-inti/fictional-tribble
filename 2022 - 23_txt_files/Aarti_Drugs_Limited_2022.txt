practices. Here are some of the key benefits:
1.	
Improved Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction: Investments in boiler smoke tube replacement and condenser 
equipment have enhanced the overall efficiency of operations, reducing fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas 
emissions. This contributes to mitigating climate change and supports global efforts towards a low-carbon future.
2.	
Solvent Recovery and Waste Management: The implementation of solvent recovery units and solid waste sheds has 
resulted in reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds and hazardous waste. This environmentally responsible 
approach conserves natural resources, minimises pollution, and promotes a healthier and more sustainable environment.
3.	
Fire Hydrant and Stack Monitoring Systems: By ensuring reliable fire hydrant systems and stack monitoring, the Company 
effectively safeguards against potential environmental damages and harmful pollutant emissions. These measures aid in 
compliance with environmental regulations, maintaining air quality control, and improving public health.
4.	
Closed System Operations and Ultrasonic Cleaning: Adoption of closed SCADA systems and ultrasonic cleaning baths 
reduces the emission of volatile organic compounds and conserves water resources. These eco-friendly practices align 
with environmental standards and foster sustainable water usage.
5.	
Efficient Co-Generation Boiler and Chimney Design: Co-generation boilers allow simultaneous heat and electricity 
production, utilising waste heat to increase overall efficiency. Chimneys designed for higher altitude emission disperse 
harmful gases, reducing their immediate impact on the local environment and human health.
6.	
Reverse Osmosis for Water Conservation: Implementation of 
reverse osmosis systems not only reduces water consumption but 
also minimises chemical usage, protecting water resources and 
promoting responsible water management.
7.	
Air Preheaters and Scrubbers for Cleaner Air: Air preheaters recover 
waste heat from flue gases, leading to reduced fuel consumption. 
Scrubbers effectively absorb pollutants, improving air quality, 
mitigating global warming, and promoting better health for workers 
and the community.
8.	
Social Benefits: The Company’s investments in occupational health 
centres and safety equipment, such as SCBA sets, demonstrate a 
commitment to employee well-being. This contributes to improved 
worker health, reduced healthcare costs, and fosters a more 
productive and socially responsible work environment.
In conclusion, the Company’s capex investments have yielded a wide 
array of environmental and social benefits. By implementing sustainable 
practices and advanced technologies, the Company is making positive 
contributions to environmental protection, resource conservation, and 
social well-being. These initiatives not only align with ESG principles but 
also position the Company as a responsible corporate citizen, gaining the 
trust and support of stakeholders and investors.

Aarti Drugs is committed to going beyond compliance in its waste management practices. We have taken 
numerous steps to minimise waste generation and to ensure that our waste is managed in an environmentally 
responsible manner. Our waste management practices are based on the following principles:
	
	
Minimisation: We strive to minimise waste generation at the source through the use of efficient processes 
and technologies.
	
	
Recovery: We recover and recycle as much waste as possible.
	
	
Treatment: We treat waste that cannot be recovered or recycled in a manner that minimises its environmental 
impact.
	
	
Disposal: We dispose of waste in a secure manner that protects human health and the environment.
	
	
We are continuously reviewing and improving our waste management practices. We believe that these 
practices are essential to our commitment to sustainability and to our responsibility to the environment. 
Here are some specific examples of our waste management practices:
	
	
We have installed a solvent recovery unit at our manufacturing facility. This unit recovers spent solvent, 
which is then recycled.
	
	
We send process residues that have high calorific values to a cement plant for energy recovery.
	
	
We send waste that cannot be recovered or recycled to a Common Hazardous Waste Disposal Facility for 
secure landfilling.
	
We believe that our waste management practices are a model for other companies. We are committed to 
continuing to improve our practices and to leading the way in sustainable waste management.

Global warming 
potential is due to 
the use of fuel i.e. 
Coal & Electricity.
Given that we currently utilise natural gas as fuel for one of the 
boilers on our premises and will persist with this approach, it 
becomes impractical to transition the entire system to a more 
environmentally friendly fuel source due to elevated costs and the 
limited accessibility of natural gas. Furthermore, we have integrated 
pollution abatement equipment at strategic points to effectively 
mitigate the impact of potential pollution sources.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity. 
	
Our company has a process for identifying key stakeholder groups that is based on the following steps:
	
a.	
We define the Company’s business and its operations. This helps us to identify the groups of people who are 
most directly affected by the Company’s activities.
	
b.	
We identify the groups of people who have a vested interest in the Company’s success. These groups of 
people are likely to be the most important stakeholders, as they have the potential to impact the Company’s 
performance.
	
c.	
We assess the influence and impact of each stakeholder group. This helps us to prioritise our stakeholder 
engagement efforts.
	
d.	
We develop a stakeholder engagement strategy. This strategy helps us to build relationships with our 
stakeholders and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.
We have identified the following key stakeholder groups:
	
Employees: Employees are the lifeblood of our company, and they play a critical role in our success. Employees 
are also the most directly affected by the Company’s activities, so they are likely to be one of the most important 
stakeholder groups.
	
Customers: Customers are the people who buy our products or services. Customers are also the ones who are 
most affected by the quality of our products or services. Therefore, customers are another important stakeholder 
group that we need to consider.
	
Suppliers: Suppliers provide us with the raw materials and other inputs that we need to produce our products 
or services. Suppliers are also affected by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s 
demand for their products or services.
	
Investors and shareholders: Investors and shareholders are the people who own the Company. They are interested 
in the Company’s performance, as they want to see their investment grow in value. Therefore, investors and 
shareholders are another important stakeholder group that we need to consider.
	
Communities: The communities in which we operate are also important stakeholders. These communities are 
affected by the Company’s activities, as they may be impacted by the Company’s pollution or its impact on the 
local economy.
	
Government and regulatory bodies: Government and regulatory bodies are also important stakeholders, as they 
have the power to regulate the Company’s activities. We need to work with government and regulatory bodies to 
ensure that we are in compliance with the law.
We believe that these stakeholder groups are the most important to our company’s success. We will continue to 
engage with these groups in order to build strong relationships and to ensure that we are meeting their needs.

Waste - to - energy - Various hazardous waste generated at our factory is having high calorific value are 
segregated at site and sent to cement industry for energy recovery through incineration.
	
	
Landfilling - The HW having low calorific value and other parameters within the limit of landfilling criteria are 
sent for CHWTSDF facility & then safely dispose of material by burying in to land and covered by soil usually.
	
	
Recycling - The waste which are having the potential reusable content that can be recovered and reused
	
	
Incineration - Some of the hazardous waste that require incineration in a controlled condition are sent to the 
CHWTSDF facility where they dispose the hazardous waste through incineration.

Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be 
provided along-with summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Segregation of 
hazardous waste 
generated according 
to their Calorific 
value.
Hazardous waste generated are segregated on the 
basis of calorific value. 
Low CV material is disposed off through landfilling. 
High CV material is disposed off through co-
processing / pre-processing in cement kilns.
High calorific Value material is used in 
cement kilns as a fuel.
Utilisation of hazardous waste by co-
processing in cement Kiln is considered as 
an effective and sustainable option. There 
is dual benefit in co-processing of wastes 
in cement kilns, in terms of utilising the 
waste as a supplementary fuel as well as an 
alternative raw material.
Wastes contain, materials that have the 
potential for use as an alternative raw 
material or as a supplementary fuel for 
energy recovery.

MEE
We have installed Three & two stage multiple effect 
evaporators in our units for effluent treatment to 
achieve zero liquid discharge. It has around 60% 
lower energy requirement than conventional 
evaporation set up.
MEE has much higher steam economy than 
conventional evaporators.
3
Boiler
We have converted external furnace coal fired to 
semi fluidised boiler to improve steam to coal ratio.
Improved steam to fuel ratio as well as 
minimise fuel consumption. Also minimise 
immission
4
Boiler & Thermopack
Tuning of boilers / thermopacs for optimum Air–
Fuel ratio to increase efficiency
Improved boiler efficiency
5
Condensate recovery Condensate recovery improved to reduce fuel 
consumption. 
Improved steam to fuel ratio as well as 
minimise fuel consumption.
6
Solvent recovery & 
yield
We have conducted pilot trials on ATFD to remove 
residual solvent from feed and improve the yield of 
product. This has improved solvent recovery and 
product quality.
Improved yield and solvent recovery
7
Efficient motors
We are using Energy efficient motors (high power 
factor motors) which saves around 3-5% energy.
Power saving
8
Membrane filter 
press
Use of membrane type filter press for corrosive 
products instead of ANF and centrifuge. Product 
coming from it has less moisture content and use 
of nitrogen is also reduced. Energy required for 
operation is also less.

12
Boiler   
Interchanged position of air pre-heater and 
mechanical dust collector in briquette fired boiler. 
APH fouling issue is now reduced and due to clean 
flue gas to APH overall heat transfer coefficient 
has improved, results in lesser fuel consumption
Heat recovery from flue gas, so increased 
boiler efficiency Also fuel saving
13
Co-generation boiler 
We have started back pressure turbine for 10 TPH 
co-generation boiler
We get around 0.16 MW of power which can 
be effective towards cost savings amid, now 
we are utilise for in-house consumption.
14
Co-generation boiler
Installation of high pressure co-generation boiler 
is under process. From this we will get around 
1.6 MW of power which can be effective towards 
cost savings amid, we can utilise for in-house 
consumption.
