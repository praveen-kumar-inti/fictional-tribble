Reporting boundary: Are the disclosures 
under this report made on a standalone 
basis (i.e. only for the entity) or on a 
consolidated basis (i.e. for the entity and 
all the entities which form a part of its 
consolidated financial statements, taken 
together).
The disclosures under this report are made on a consolidated basis. Vedanta Group 
comprises of Vedanta Limited, its Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures, the 
details of which are given in point No. 23 of Section A of Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report (BRSR) and on page 349 of the Integrated Report and

Financial Consolidation of the Group; however, for the purpose of reporting data 
and information in BRSR, the following categories of Entities/Sites have not been 
considered for the purpose of this report:
	•
Newly incorporated Entities or Entities/Sites operational for less than 12 months;
	•
Non-operational/ intermittent operational Entities/Sites; and entities/sites 
discontinued or outsourced.
	•
Further, the GHG footprint, Water footprint, Energy footprint and details of the 
Waste Management with respect to the following have not been considered, 
based on our assessment of being immaterial to the Group’s reporting:
	•
The Corporate Offices with respect to the Entities as considered under the 
Reporting Boundary.
	•
Guesthouses and Colonies being owned and maintained by the Group.
	•
Furthermore, for the purpose of BRSR reporting, following methodology has 
been used:

The financial numbers used in some of the indicators of the BRSR are extracted 
from the Integrated Report and Annual Accounts FY 2024-25.
	•
While the financial numbers related to certain entities include inter-company 
consolidation adjustments as per the applicable financial reporting framework 
(net figures), the nonfinancial data used in some of the indicators of the BRSR 
related to these entities are given without adjustments (gross figures). Further, 
some of the Entities/ Sites are considered for the purpose of said financial 
numbers, which may have been excluded from the Reporting Boundary.
	•
Some of the Entities are considered for the purpose of preparation of the BRSR 
on full consolidation method, without adjusting for minority interest in the relevant 
group entity, based on operational control, as per our assessment

26.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues
	
	
In this reporting cycle, we carried out a renewed double materiality assessment with support from an external 
partner. This year’s assessment has built further upon our materiality assessment in FY 2022-23. We adopted 
the principles of double materiality established by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to 
identify and prioritise issues that are financially material to our business operations while also having significant 
environmental and social impacts on our stakeholders. The key focus of our materiality assessment in this cycle 
was to identify impacts (positive and negative), risks, and opportunities associated with the material topics. This 
approach allowed us to dissect and understand material topics at a deeper level.  This analysis will enable us to 
align our sustainability strategy and disclosures with stakeholder expectations in a way that creates and preserves 
long-term value for Vedanta Group.

(R/O)
Rationale for Identifying  
the Risk / Opportunity
In-case of Risk, Approach to  
Adapt or Mitigate
Financial implications of the risk 
or opportunity (Indicate positive  
or negative implications)
1.
Health Safety & Well-
Being
Risk
Multiple risks have been identified under this topic, financial 
(injury-related costs), operational (downtime), reputational 
(public perception), and investor-related (performance 
indicators).
Implement strong health & safety policies, regular 
audits, training, emergency response plans, and 
transparent disclosures per European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS). Vedanta employs a 
critical risk management approach focussing on 
proactive identification, technology integration, 
leadership accountability, and community 
engagement to ensure the health, safety, and well-
being of its workforce.
Negative: Potential costs from 
legal fees, insurance premiums, 
reputational damage, downtime, 
and investor divestment due to poor 
performance indicators.
2
Air Emission & Quality
Risk
Breach of emission limits, regulatory non-compliance, and 
outdated technologies can lead to fines, halted operations, 
reputational harm, and withdrawal of license to operate. 
Stricter regulations may impose new capital costs and 
financial losses due to obsolete emission control systems.
Upgrade to emission control technologies, enhance 
monitoring systems, and ensure strict compliance 
with emission thresholds. Adopt proactive 
investment planning to mitigate future regulation 
risks.
Negative: Fines, capital investment 
burdens, stranded assets, license 
revocation, loss of reputation, and 
disruptions to operational continuity.
3
Business Ethics & 
Corporate Governance
Risk
Weak governance, corruption exposure, tax non-compliance, 
and lack of transparency in financial transactions may lead 
to reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, legal penalties, 
and loss of investor confidence.
Strengthen corporate governance through  
anti-corruption policies, tax compliance,  
digital oversight tools. Implement transparent 
disclosure and grievance mechanisms.
Negative: Legal and regulatory 
penalties, increased compliance 
costs, reduced investor trust, 
reputational harm.
Opportunity
Embedding ethical practices in governance boosts 
stakeholder trust, secures long-term licenses, improves 
compliance efficiency, and strengthens corporate resilience. 
ESG integration in governance drives positive stakeholder 
perception.
 
Positive: Strong stakeholder 
relationships, reduced compliance 
costs, higher investor interest, long-
term license security, and improved 
brand reputation.
4
Climate Change and 
Energy Transition
Risk
Climate-related risks include regulatory penalties for non-
compliance with emissions targets, operational disruptions 
from extreme weather, loss of competitiveness due to 
lagging adoption of low-carbon technologies, reputational 
harm from greenwashing, and potential for stranded assets 
in fossil-heavy portfolios.
Invest in resilient infrastructure, adopt proven  
low-carbon technologies, conduct scenario analysis, 
monitor emerging regulations, and communicate 
credible climate action progress  
to stakeholders.
Negative: Regulatory fines, 
operational downtime, reputational 
damage, decreased market share, 
and financial losses from stranded 
assets or obsolete operations.
Opportunity
Shifting to low-carbon energy sources and production 
processes creates strategic opportunities: cost reduction, 
resilience to energy price volatility, increased investor 
interest, and access to new markets driven by demand for 
cleaner materials and technologies.
 
Positive: Reduced long-term energy 
costs, improved stakeholder trust, 
stronger market position, access 
to climate-aligned capital, and 
enhanced competitiveness.

Waste and Wastewater 
Management
Risk
Equipment failures or poor water management can cause 
spills or contamination events, operational disruptions, and 
reputational damage. Regulatory non-compliance, climate-
related droughts, or conflicts over local water use can lead 
to sanctions or shutdowns.
Maintain robust infrastructure, conduct regular 
system audits, implement contingency plans, and 
monitor rainfall/water availability to anticipate 
shortages. Ensure compliance with local and 
international discharge regulations.
Negative: Fines, operational 
downtime, legal penalties, increased 
water costs, and potential loss of 
social license to operate.
Opportunity
Advancements in water management technologies 
offer opportunities to reduce water withdrawal, recycle 
process water, and optimise operations using sensors, 
AI, or biological treatment. The waste is also utilised as 
an additional revenue stream. These innovations improve 
compliance, save costs, and reduce environmental impact.
 
Positive: Reduced input costs, 
increased efficiency, compliance 
assurance, long-term savings, 
and enhanced environmental 
stewardship reputation.

Risk Management & 
Controls
Risk
Failure to integrate ESG risks into enterprise risk 
management may lead to financial penalties, investor 
scrutiny, reputational damage, and reduced access to 
capital. Inadequate controls can also cause operational 
disruptions.
Strengthen integration of ESG into enterprise risk 
frameworks, conduct regular risk assessments.
Negative: Financial penalties, 
reputational risk, limited investor 
confidence, and increased cost of 
capital.
Opportunity
Proactive risk controls such as spill containment and 
third-party audits enhance operational resilience and 
ensure compliance. Strengthened frameworks also build 
stakeholder trust and business continuity.
 
Positive: Reduced liabilities, 
improved business continuity, 
investor confidence, and 
reputational gains from strong 
governance.
7
Community 
Engagement & 
Development
Risk
Lack of proportional socio-economic benefits, land 
disputes, inadequate engagement, and unmet community 
expectations can lead to conflict, reputational damage, and 
jeopardise the company’s social license to operate.
Engage communities early, ensure equitable benefit-
sharing, establish clear grievance mechanisms, and 
maintain transparency to avoid disputes and build 
trust.
Negative: Risk of project delays, 
financial outlays for grievances, 
export restrictions, and loss of 
access or rights to operate.
Opportunity
A strong community engagement strategy can enhance 
local goodwill, improve project success rates, support 
workforce development, and foster long-term social 
license through trust, co-creation, and grievance redressal 
mechanisms.
 
Positive: Enhanced social 
license, local workforce access, 
reduced conflict risk, stronger 
brand reputation, and long-term 
operational continuity.
8
Tailings Management
Risk
Catastrophic failures in tailings storage facilities (TSFs) 
lead to severe consequences for adjoining communities 
and impact the environment. Risks include operational 
disruptions, legal penalties from non-compliance, and 
financial strain due to costly upgrades or failed innovations.
Strengthen TSF design and maintenance protocols, 
adopt tested and reliable technologies, ensure 
regulatory compliance, and invest in contingency 
planning to reduce environmental and legal risks.
Negative: Fines, penalties, 
legal action, increased capital 
expenditure, reputational damage, 
and diverted resources from core 
business due to costly failures.

in compliance with the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI Listing Regulations. Each Director, Key Managerial Personnel 
(KMP), and Senior Management Personnel (SMP) is required to promptly disclose any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest, along with any subsequent changes, to the Board. These disclosures are formally recorded and reviewed in 
the following Board meeting. The Board evaluates and, where necessary, grants approval for managing such conflicts. 
In cases where a conflict arises, the concerned Director refrains from participating in discussions or voting on the 
matter in question. Additionally, the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBCE) provides comprehensive 
guidelines for identifying and addressing conflicts of interest. The policy ensures transparency and accountability in 
decision-making by mandating strict adherence to ethical governance principles. As part of the governance framework,

environmental improvements including the installation of a dust conveying system 
from the coke feeder to the silo/GAP, an emulsion oil filtration system in the WRM 
area in CH2, and ventilation improvements in the CH Ventilation-P2 area to enhance 
operational efficiency and environmental controls.
Cairn Oil & Gas undertook an R&D project in collaboration with IIT-Kharagpur to 
eliminate the need for Post Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) for weld joints exposed to 
25,000 ppm alkaline solutions, contributing to process efficiency improvements and 
reducing energy use.
These focused investments underline Vedanta’s commitment to driving technological 
innovations that deliver positive environmental and social outcomes across its 
operations.

In FY 2024-25, Vedanta Limited invested a portion capital expenditure (capex) in 
specific technologies aimed at improving the environmental and social impacts of its 
products and processes across its business units.
The investments were made in the capture and reuse of excess heat generated 
during furnace operations to reduce moisture in coal, which contributes to a 
reduction of 1,845 tCO₂ equivalent quarterly. Additionally, the establishment of a 
600 m³/hr Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) addresses environmental concerns by 
treating hexavalent chromium from mining operations, ensuring the safe reuse 
of water.
At Vedanta Aluminium - Jharsuguda, capex was directed towards projects such as 
the development of an ash loading platform, installation of Scaleban technology in 
CPP Unit 5, establishment of a 50 KLD Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) for the old 
Sepco colony, and installation of online flow analyzers at FTP Carbon-P2, enhancing 
water management and emission monitoring capabilities.
These targeted investments represent Vedanta’s ongoing commitment to embedding 
sustainability within its operational processes through focused technological 
advancements.
2.	
a.	
Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes, Vedanta has implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to ensure sustainable sourcing through its 
Supplier Sustainability Management Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC), which is mandatory for all suppliers, 
vendors, and contractors. The SCOC covers critical sustainability areas including labor rights, health and safety, 
environmental protection, ethical business practices, and anti-corruption measures. To promote ethical sourcing and 
compliance with human rights laws, critical suppliers must commit to the Modern Slavery Act. Vedanta conducts 
third-party risk assessments to evaluate suppliers’ adherence to regulatory and sustainability standards.
	
	
The Supplier Code of Conduct clearly defines expectations for environmental stewardship. Suppliers are required to 
implement sustainable practices throughout their operations and supply chains. Vedanta also enforces strict anti-
bribery, anti-corruption, and fair-trade policies, prohibiting unethical behaviour. Suppliers must establish effective 
grievance redressal mechanisms for their employees and partners. To support these initiatives, Vedanta provides 
training to internal teams and/or buyers, strengthening the company’s sustainable sourcing efforts and ensuring 
ongoing compliance. Link-https:/www.vedantalimited.com/uploads/corporate-governance/policies_practices/
Supplier-Code-of-Conduct.pdf
	
b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?
	
	
Out of the total spend on procurement, 85.37% of the material are sourced sustainably. 
3.	
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, 
for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste
	
This indicator is not applicable to Vedanta Limited as our business is primarily a B2B business where our products are 
sent ahead to various industries as raw materials. 
	
Hence there is no possibility of reclaiming any of the products.  However, we do take care to ensure circularity in our 
business and reduce wastage.
	
Vedanta Limited’s Waste to Wealth philosophy focuses on minimising landfill waste and integrating circularity into 
production processes. In line with its ESG vision, the company is actively working towards becoming a Zero Waste 
organisation, with several initiatives aimed at maximising the utilisation of mineral and non-mineral waste.
	
As part of its Sustainability Governance, Vedanta has implemented the Technical Standard – Resource Use and 
Waste Management, which supports its Environmental Policy and applies to  its businesses. This standard aligns 
with international frameworks such as the Basel Convention, International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), and 
IFC Performance Standards, ensuring adherence to global best practices. It is structured around the waste hierarchy 
principles—avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle, treat, and dispose—to drive responsible waste management across all 
operations. Vedanta is committed to designing and operating its processes efficiently to minimise resource consumption 
and to continuously explore and implement viable opportunities for waste reduction.
	
(a)	 Vedanta’s product offerings primarily comprise metals and minerals, which are delivered to customers without any 
packaging. Any plastic waste generated from supplier activities is systematically managed and disposed of through 
certified third-party agencies. Meenakshi Energy follows a structured approach to plastic waste management 
by collecting materials in a designated scrap yard and ensuring their responsible recycling through authorised 
recyclers. Furthermore, Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL), BALCO, and TSPL have implemented a strict prohibition 
STATUTORY REPORTS

Integrated Report and Annual Accounts 2024-25
on single-use plastics, while TSPL and Cairn have been awarded Single-Use Plastic-Free certification by the 
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) as per its Plastics-Use Protocol: Verification and Certification
	
(b)	 E-waste is not a significant aspect of Vedanta’s operations. However, any e-waste generated is managed in 
compliance with E-Waste Management and Handling Rules and is responsibly disposed of through certified third-
party agencies. Additionally, Jamkhani Coal Mine has implemented a buy-back agreement with its supplier to 
ensure the proper handling and disposal of e-waste.
	
(c)	
Vedanta has identified various types of hazardous waste in accordance with the Basel Convention and the 
Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, which are generated at 
different operational stages. These include used/spent oil, waste refractories, spent pot lining, and residual sludge 
from smelters. The Company follows multiple end-of-life treatment processes, including internal reprocessing, co-
processing at cement plants, treatment by registered recyclers, and disposal at authorised Treatment, Storage, and 
Disposal Facilities (TSDF). Additionally, hazardous waste is disposed of through authorised OSPCB vendors, while 
used oil is sold to certified recyclers for responsible management.
	
(d)	 Vedanta generates non-hazardous waste, including fly ash (from captive and merchant power plants), red mud (a 
by-product of aluminium refineries), jarofix (from zinc smelting), slag, lime grit (process residues from smelters and 
aluminium refineries), and phosphor gypsum (from phosphoric acid production). These wastes are categorised as 
High-Volume-Low-Toxicity (HVLT) waste and are securely stored in tailings dams, ash dykes, or designated landfill 
structures before being repurposed as raw materials for various industries, thereby promoting recycling. Other 
non-hazardous waste materials undergo processes such as recycling, disposal, or incineration. Additionally, TSPL 
utilises a composter for biodegradable waste, converting it into manure for horticultural purposes, while Jamkhani 
Coal Mine ensures that overburden (OB) generated during coal mining is systematically stacked in designated areas 
for future backfilling applications.
4.	
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the 
waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control 
Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to specific Business Units within Vedanta, including, BALCO, Cairn, 
VAL-Jharsuguda, MEL Nickel, and ESL Steel Limited. Each of these units has developed or is in the process of developing 
and implementing a waste collection plan that aligns with EPR guidelines.
	
Yes, wherever applicable the waste collection plan is in line with EPR plan which is submitted to the Pollution 
Control board. 
	
For instance, BALCO has enforced a ban on single-use plastic within its plant premises and collaborates with a third-
party recycler to collect plastic waste generated within the township. This waste is routed to the cement industry for 
co-processing. 
	
BALCO and Silvassa are currently in the process of obtaining formal EPR registration to further strengthen compliance. 
Additionally, HZL has incorporated EPR measures for managing plastic packaging materials as part of its operations.

Vedanta has a structured process for identifying and assessing work-related hazards and risks on both routine 
and non-routine bases. In alignment with ISO 45001:2018, the Company follows established methodologies such 
as Hazard Identification Study (HAZID), Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Quantitative Risk Assessment 
(QRA), and Job Safety Analysis (JSA) to identify facility-specific occupational risks. Once hazards are identified, 
management plans are developed, and a structured approach is adopted to eliminate or control risks through 
measures such as safety interactions, Visible Felt Leadership (VFL) visits, and Contractor Safety Field Audits 
(CSFA). Additionally, data from Enablon, a unified digital platform for HSES processes, is used to assess site 
conditions and implement action plans accordingly.
	
	
Vedanta has also implemented a Critical Risk Management (CRM) program, based on the International Council 
for Metals and Mining’s (ICMM) 9-step methodology, to identify, evaluate, and control critical risks. The Company

Additionally, each site is assigned a healthiness score, which is continuously monitored to improve safety controls 
and infrastructure.
	
	
To further enhance workplace safety, Vedanta mandates safety interactions, scheduled hazard tours, and critical 
risk verifications for all employees, enabling proactive hazard identification and reporting. The Company also 
utilises AI-based surveillance systems, such as T-Pulse cameras, to monitor and report unsafe acts or conditions in 
real time. Furthermore, Vedanta upholds the right to refuse work if an employee feels unsafe, with regular training 
sessions conducted to promote this practice. The ‘Safety Pause’ protocol ensures that work is halted immediately if 
an unsafe situation arises, allowing for risk mitigation before any incident occurs.”

enhances productivity and performance.
	
	
Vedanta has implemented various employee support programs and well-being initiatives, such as access to well-
equipped hospitals across all Business Units, annual health check-ups and awareness sessions, and an Advanced 
Life Supporting Ambulance system with trained professionals for medical emergencies. ESL Steel Limited, has 
partnered with Apollo for managing Occupational Health Centre (OHC) and Air Ambulance services, offering

12. 	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
Vedanta ensures a safe and healthy workplace through a comprehensive health and safety framework that governs all 
organisational activities. The framework is implemented through technical, management, and safety standards, ensuring 
a structured approach to workplace safety. Recognising the inherent risks associated with its operations, the Company 
remains committed to achieving a zero-harm work environment. By leveraging insights from past incidents, Vedanta

All operational sites are ISO 45001:2018 or OHSAS 18001:2007 certified and undergo third-party audits 
every three years for certification renewal. Additionally, the Vedanta Sustainability Assurance Process 
(VSAP) is implemented to ensure compliance with the Vedanta Sustainability Framework (VSF) across 
all Business Units. These audits are conducted regularly by an independent third-party organisation to 
assess adherence to sustainability standards.
Working Conditions
100%
As part of the VSAP Module assessment, labour practices, including working conditions, are a key 
focus area. All operational sites undergo annual third-party audits to evaluate and verify compliance 
with these labour standards, reinforcing Vedanta’s commitment to ethical and sustainable workplace 
practices.
15. 	 Provide details of any corrective action taken or underway to address safety-related incidents (if any) and on 
significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
	
During the year, Vedanta experienced near-miss incidents, injuries, and fatalities at its operational sites, with 7 fatalities 
recorded in FY25. Workplace safety remains a critical priority for the management, and the Company is committed 
to continuous improvement in this area. A comprehensive review of safety strategies was conducted to identify 
opportunities for strengthening safety measures across all operational levels. Every reported incident undergoes a 
thorough investigation, with High-Potential Incidents (HiPos) and fatalities receiving the most detailed scrutiny. Key 
insights and learnings from these investigations are shared across the organisation to foster a culture of knowledge-
sharing and continuous improvement.
	
To address safety-related incidents and mitigate future risks, various corrective actions have been undertaken:
	
Across all the business units Enablon tool is used for investigating safety incidents and tracking action plan closure. 
Health and safety assessment findings are uploaded onto the GAT portal, with compliance monitored daily to ensure 
timely risk mitigation. Committed to improving safety performance through targeted initiatives. Incident investigations 
are conducted by trained investigators, with Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) implemented based on findings. 
Additionally, Critical Risk Management (CRM) has been rolled out for seven critical risks, following an in-depth analysis of 
past fatal incidents. VSAP CAPA Compliance monitoring is in place to ensure the effective implementation of corrective 
measures across the unit.
	
Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL): Implemented a documented two-way communication protocol between operators 
and pedestrians for underground and opencast mines, integrated into transport rules. Comprehensive training on this 
protocol is being conducted and included in induction programs.
	
Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL - TPP): Investigates all incidents to determine Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and 
assigns dedicated action plan owners to implement corrective measures
	
By implementing these corrective actions, Vedanta aims to prevent future incidents, enhance workplace safety, and 
create a zero-harm environment across all operations.

1 suppliers in compliance with national regulations. All contracting agreements clearly define the contractor’s obligation 
to fulfil statutory requirements, including the payment of wages, Provident Fund (PF), Employee State Insurance (ESI), 
and Goods and Services Tax (GST). Vendors are mandated to submit wage registers and PF challans monthly, serving 
as proof of compliance before processing invoices. Additionally, regular internal audits are conducted across various 
establishments and work centres to ensure adherence to labour laws and statutory regulations. Some business units 
have adopted enhanced due diligence measures by partnering with external agencies to monitor statutory compliance 
through public record checks, ensuring prompt action against non-compliant partners.
	
Several business units have implemented additional controls:
	
Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL): Conducts due diligence on statutory compliance by partnering with an external agency 
to oversee PF, ESIC, and GST payments. Any non-compliance results in stringent actions against the defaulting 
business partner.

partners. These mechanisms are designed to ensure prompt reporting, resolution, and communication of outcomes to 
all stakeholders, including business partners and contract workers.
	
Additionally, we have a streamlined grievance redressal process ensures every employee is assigned an HR Business 
Partner (HRBP) who is always accessible. Employees can escalate concerns directly to senior leadership and a public 
grievance domain is being developed for broader accessibility.

monthly to resolve issues. Grievances are collected through Employee Connect sessions, suggestion boxes, 
whistleblower mechanisms, and more, ensuring inclusivity across all employee categories.
	
VAL–Lanjigarh, each business partner employee has access to a designated grievance committee. Grievances 
are reviewed weekly or fortnightly, resolved within 45 days, and formally closed with documentation and

or contributed to by the business? (Yes/No)
	
Vedanta has a well-defined governance structure and designated focal points responsible for addressing human 
rights impacts caused or contributed to by the business. The company’s Human Rights Policy, approved at the highest 
level by the Board, outlines its commitment to respect human rights across all operations, suppliers, contractors, and 
business partners. Oversight is provided by the Board ESG Committee, which reviews human rights policies annually and 
recommends necessary updates.
	
Vedanta: Ensures that all units have a Grievance Redressal Committee and a structured grievance-handling process, 
with accessible grievance submission mechanisms, including grievance boxes, allowing employees and stakeholders

5.	
Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
	
Vedanta has established an internal grievance mechanism to address human rights-related concerns effectively and 
transparently. The grievance process is designed to be accessible, culturally appropriate, and free of cost or retaliation 
for complainants. Complaints can be submitted verbally or in writing through multiple channels, including face-to-face 
meetings, phone calls, letters, and dedicated email addresses.
	
The grievance system operates on a tiered approach:
	
•	
First Order Mechanism: Attempts to resolve complaints directly between the company and the complainant, with 
formal acknowledgment within two business days and regular updates every 15 days.
	
•	
Second Order Mechanism: For unresolved complaints, cases may be referred to an independent third party 
(excluding judicial systems) for mediation.
	
•	
Third Order Mechanism: Complaints that remain unresolved may be escalated to judicial processes.
	
A dedicated Grievance Response Committee comprising the General Manager (or delegate), Social Performance 
Manager, and relevant department heads oversees investigations, corrective actions, and reporting. All grievances are 
registered, documented, tracked, and analysed in a secure system to identify trends and ensure timely resolution.
	
Vedanta also maintains specialised committees such as Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) to handle specific 
issues like sexual harassment, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and providing safe channels for employees.
	
The company emphasises confidentiality, protection from retaliation, and continuous stakeholder engagement to build 
trust and ensure effective redressal. This grievance mechanism aligns with international standards, including the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and supports Vedanta’s commitment to respecting and protecting 
human rights across its operations.

is safe, inclusive, and free from intimidation or exploitation. The Company has implemented an Anti-Harassment Policy 
and a Policy on the Prevention and Prohibition of Sexual Harassment (POSH) to safeguard employees from any form 
of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. In line with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, 
Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, Vedanta has constituted Internal Complaints Committees (ICC) at all locations 
to address complaints related to both sexual and non-sexual harassment. Employees can report grievances directly 
to the ICC or via email at sexualharassment@vedanta.co.in, ensuring a structured and confidential resolution process. 
To further strengthen protection, Vedanta maintains strict confidentiality during investigations and enforces a non-
retaliation policy, ensuring that complainants and witnesses are not subjected to any adverse consequences. To ensure 
widespread awareness and sensitivity, Vedanta conducts regular sensitisation and training programs, coordinated 
by Human Resources and other relevant functions, ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive approach to preventing

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and 
implementation.
	
Many of Vedanta’s plants are located in areas where water is scarce, so managing water carefully is very important. 
Most of Vedanta’s business units-such as BALCO, ESL, Hindustan Zinc Ltd., Fujairah, Sesa Iron Ore, Silvassa, TSPL, 
and Vedanta Aluminium at Jharsuguda and Lanjigarh-have adopted Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems. These 
systems make sure that no wastewater is released outside the plant boundaries. They use real-time monitoring tools 
like piezometers and PTZ cameras to keep a close watch on water discharge. All wastewater is treated to meet legal 
standards, and the discharge data is shared live with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for proper monitoring. 
This careful approach helps Vedanta use water responsibly and protect the environment, especially in water-
stressed areas.
	
Key details of Vedanta’s ZLD implementation include:
	•
Commissioned 4,000 KLD zero liquid discharge plant in Zawar, facilitating water recovery and ensuring reduction in 
fresh-water dependency.
	•
Vedanta Aluminium is the first company in India to achieve Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) by extracting and recycling 
the entire volume of water from bauxite residue slurry. The residual bauxite residue is safely stored in a scientifically 
managed, concretised reservoir to prevent groundwater contamination. At the Jharsuguda plant, ZLD is maintained 
through the use of flow meters and Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras installed at outlets of smelters and captive power 
plants. Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) across all operational units treat 
process wastewater, which is then recycled back into the plant operations. Effluent quality monitoring systems ensure 
compliance with regulatory standards.
	•
At TSPL - TPP, the entire Thermal Power Plant operates under ZLD. The unit has treatment systems for coaly 
wastewater, oily wastewater, Industrial Wastewater (IWWS), and Sewage Treatment Plants (STP). Treated water is 
recycled into operations, while cooling tower blowdown is treated and reused for cooling tower makeup.
	•
ESL Steel Limited has Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP) and STPs, with a 650 cubic meters per hour ETP capacity 
and four STPs totalling 575 kL/day by mid-2024. The effluent is treated with advanced wastewater technologies and 
recycled for in-house use. Across the plant, five pumping stations connect effluent lines to the ETP for treatment 
and reuse.

Describe the mechanisms to receive and redress grievances of the community.
	
Vedanta has a well-defined grievance redressal mechanism to address concerns raised by communities, ensuring 
transparency, accessibility, and timely resolution. The process is managed at the site level, where grievances can 
be submitted through multiple channels, including Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) and grievance boxes placed 
outside plant gates, allowing stakeholders to submit concerns in the local language. The grievance resolution follows a 
structured seven-step approach: Receive, Acknowledge, Assess and Assign, Investigate, Respond, Resolve/Recourse, 
and Close-out. Complaints are acknowledged within 24 hours or a maximum of two business days, and updates are 
provided every 30 days. If a resolution is not achieved at the initial level, the grievance may be escalated to a second-
order mechanism involving a third-party mediator, and if necessary, legal action may be pursued as a last resort.
	
At Hindustan Zinc Ltd., grievances must be resolved within 15 days; if unresolved, they are escalated to senior 
management. Each company location has a Social Performance Steering Committee (SPSC), consisting of 
representatives from key functions and chaired by the Social Performance Manager, ensuring grievances are discussed 
and resolved in a timely manner. This approach strengthens community relationships, mitigates risks, and fosters trust 
with stakeholders.
	
At TSPL - TPP, the CLO acknowledges grievances within 24 hours, records and assigns them for investigation, and 
ensures resolution within 30 days. If unresolved within this period, bimonthly progress updates are provided to the Social 
Performance Manager (SPM) and the complainant. In cases where a grievance is rejected, the SBU Director directly 
oversees the investigation and closure process, particularly in human rights-related grievances.
	
At Vedanta Aluminium - Jharsuguda, if a grievance requires higher-level intervention, a Grievance Response Committee—
comprising the CLO, Social Performance (SP) Manager, and General Manager—determines the company’s response 
within five days of receiving investigation findings. The proposed resolution is communicated to the complainant both 
verbally and in writing, ensuring a dialogue-based approach rather than a one-way decision. If the first-order mechanism 
does not lead to an amicable resolution, the complainant is informed of the second-order mechanism, where further 
steps are taken.
	
All business units maintain detailed records of complaints to analyze patterns, identify training needs, and improve 
community engagement processes. Through these structured grievance redressal mechanisms, Vedanta ensures 
that community concerns are addressed effectively, strengthening stakeholder relationships and promoting 
sustainable development.

1.	
Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
	
Vedanta has established a Technical Standard for Grievance Mechanisms, which defines the process for addressing 
concerns raised by external stakeholders, including customers. The company provides multiple platforms for consumers 
to voice complaints and feedback. One of the primary channels is the "Vedanta Metal Bazaar" portal, where customers 
can submit their concerns. Once a complaint is logged, the system generates an automatic ticket, notifying relevant 
teams via email. A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is conducted, followed by necessary corrective actions. Customers can 
track the status of their complaints and provide consent for closure.
	
Across all business units, Vedanta also proactively gathers consumer insights through satisfaction surveys and regular 
meetings to identify potential service gaps. Contact details, including email, address, and phone numbers, are made 
easily accessible on the company's website. All complaints and feedback, along with their resolutions, are documented 
for continuous learning and service improvement.

Corrective Actions Undertaken by Vedanta on Product Delivery, Quality, Cybersecurity, and Regulatory Compliance
	
Vedanta is committed to ensuring the highest standards in product quality, delivery, customer data security, and 
regulatory compliance. The company has implemented several corrective actions and ongoing measures to address 
issues related to product handling, delivery, and customer trust, as outlined below:
	
1. 	
Product Delivery and Quality Improvements
	
•	
Enhanced Packaging and Securing of Coils: To prevent coil loosening during transit, Vedanta has introduced the use 
of secure interlocks (seals) between straps and increased the number of straps for coils 9mm and above. Additional 
cushioning layers and separators are being added to absorb shocks, with some cost implications.
	
•	
Vehicle Loading Adjustments: For 40ft vehicles with extra space causing coil movement, wooden blocks will be 
placed at the ends to minimise shifting and potential damage.
	
•	
Real-time Monitoring: Transporters are required to share images of loaded vehicles with the logistics team before 
delivery to customers, ensuring transparency and proactive issue identification.
	
•	
On-site Performance Monitoring: Vedanta will deploy representatives at customer plants for a minimum of two days 
to study coil performance and validate the effectiveness of corrective measures.
	
•	
Strapping and Inspection Enhancements: A strapping solution partner has been deputed on-site for rebinding loose 
coils. Coils will be blocked in SAP after release and only cleared post QA inspection. Continuous monitoring of coil 
length (below 1600mm) is enforced to avoid strap breakage.
	
•	
Stock and Size Control: Stock size checking frequency has been increased (from every 15 billets to 5 billets), with 
backend ring discards adjusted based on actual size measurements. Diameter rechecking after trimming will be 
implemented moving forward.
	
2.	
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy
	
	
Vedanta maintains a robust cybersecurity framework to protect customer data and ensure privacy. While no 
specific incidents are reported, the company continuously enhances its information security protocols, including 
secure data handling, access controls, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
	
3.	
Regulatory Compliance and Product Safety
	
•	
Vedanta ensures compliance with all regulatory requirements related to product safety and delivery. Any penalties 
or actions by authorities are promptly addressed through corrective measures and process improvements.
	
•	
For material traceability, Vedanta has revised the Material Test Certificate (MTC) to align with buyer requirements, 
removing unnecessary modes of killing from SAP to avoid confusion and maintain transparency.

2.	
Steps taken to inform and educate consumers about safe and responsible usage of products and/or services
	
Vedanta is committed to ensuring that all customers are well-informed about the safe and responsible use of its 
products. To achieve this, the company provides comprehensive Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) containing all 
relevant information on product characteristics, handling, and usage. These MSDS documents are shared with buyers 
during sales agreements and updated periodically. Additionally, the MSDS is accessible online on Vedanta’s official 
website for easy reference.
	
To further educate and engage customers, Vedanta conducts regular webinars and disseminates informative mailers. 
The webinar process includes:
	
1.	
Sending formal invitations to stakeholders well in advance to ensure maximum participation.
	
2.	
Assigning a dedicated company Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to assist stakeholders with any difficulties in 
attending or engaging during the webinar.
	
3.	
Collecting post-webinar feedback to understand participants’ experiences, identify areas of improvement, and tailor 
future sessions accordingly.
	
Moreover, Vedanta undertakes continuous studies on product applications across various sectors to develop value-
added products and improve services, thereby enhancing customer safety and satisfaction.
3.	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
Vedanta has established clear communication protocols to inform consumers about any potential service disruptions or 
discontinuations. In the event of breakdowns, low productivity, or quality variations, customers are notified in advance via 
email communication, allowing them to plan alternative contingencies. Additionally, all contracts include a force majeure 
clause, ensuring that both Vedanta and its customers have a structured approach to managing unforeseen disruptions 
beyond their control.
	
At Cairn Oil & Gas, the Marketing & Operations team is responsible for promptly notifying buyers of any risks related to 
service disruptions. These communications are delivered through email, ensuring that customers remain well-informed 
and can take necessary precautions. Through these mechanisms, Vedanta ensures transparency and proactive risk 
management, minimising disruptions for its consumers.
	
Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) communicates with customers by issuing market circulars and sending emails to notify 
them of any potential disruptions. Similarly, other business units like IOB (Nandihidi mine) keep customers informed 
about the production and availability status of auction-grade materials.
4. 	
Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? 
(Yes/No/Not Applicable) If yes, provide details in brief. Did your entity carry out any survey with regard to consumer 
satisfaction relating to the major products / services of the entity, significant locations of operation of the entity or 
the entity as a whole? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. Vedanta, through its subsidiary Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL), implements tailored strategies to meet the specific 
needs of its zinc and silver customers, ensuring comprehensive product information and transparency beyond 
mandated norms. This includes proactive communication and engagement with customers to address their preferences 
and concerns.
	
Vedanta regularly conducts customer engagement activities across its business units. For instance, HZL undertakes 
periodic customer satisfaction surveys and maintains regular interactions with customers via senior management and 
dedicated teams to gather feedback and resolve issues. Other units like FACOR hold regular team meetings to discuss 
and address customer concerns, while IOB conducts grievance redressal meetings involving root cause analysis (RCA) 
and corrective action plans (CAPA) with relevant stakeholders. These initiatives reflect Vedanta’s commitment to 
continuous improvement and customer-centric service delivery.

5.
The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and
can affect comparability between entities.
6.
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG footprint, water footprint, embracing circularity
(waste management), energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our
opinion/ conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and attributes.
Our Independence and Quality Cont rol

We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Code of
Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the SEBI Circular No.
SEBI/ HO/ CFD/ CFD-SEC-2/ P/ CIR/ 2023/ 122 dated July 12, 2023, and its clarifications thereto and have
the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement.
8.
We apply Standard on Quality Control (SQC) 1, “ Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and
Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements” ,
and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and
procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal
and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibilit y
9.
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability
Information listed in Appendix 1 and limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability
Information (Other than BRSR Core) based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have
obtained.
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance
Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “ Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information” , issued by the
Sustainability Reporting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This
standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the Identified Sustainability Information are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the Reporting Criteria and to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability
Information is free from material misstatement.
A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the risks of material misstatement of the
Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as
necessary in the circumstances.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s
use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing
the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or
error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is
substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk
assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed
in response to the assessed risks.
10. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries,


Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key processes and
controls for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information on
sample basis of different sites. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to
the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls.

Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information
may be materially misstated, we determined the nature, timing and extent of further
procedures.

At each site visited, performed substantive testing on a sample basis of the Identified
Sustainability Information to verify that the data had been appropriately measured with the
underlying documents recorded, collated and reported. This includes reconciling the Identified
Sustainability Information with the underlying records and recalculation on a sample basis.

Where applicable, for the Identified Sustainability Information in the BRSR, we have relied on
the information in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year
ended March 31, 2025 and the underlying trial balance.

Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant estimates and judgements
made by the management in the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information.

Obtained representations from Company’s management.
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
Below is the informative summary of the procedures performed by us for obtaining limited assurance:

assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the entity in preparing the information subject to
limited assurance;

interviewed relevant staff at corporate and selected sites, concerning policies on environmental
and social aspects and the implementation of these across the business;

through inquiries, obtained an understanding of the control environment, processes and
information systems relevant to the preparation of the information subject to limited assurance,
but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their
implementation or test their operating effectiveness;

inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of samples as appropriate to check the accuracy
of the data

applied analytical procedures, as appropriate; and made inquiries of management to obtain
explanations for any differences we identified

recalculated the information subject to limited assurance based on the criteria;

evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to limited assurance to determine
whether it is consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience
with, the entity’s operations.
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in
extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had
we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance
opinion about whether the Identified Sustainability Information have been prepared, in all material respects,
in accordance with the Criteria.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
reasonable assurance opinion and limited assurance conclusion.
Exclusions
11. Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on the same:

Operations of the Company other than the Identified Sustainability Information;

Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., April 01, 2024 – March 31, 2025;

The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future
intentions provided by the Company.
