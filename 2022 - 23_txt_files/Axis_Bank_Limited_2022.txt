Winning Together
Dear Shareholders, 
With our ‘dil se open’ approach to 
serving the needs and aspirations 
of our customers, we at Axis Bank 
believe that we will win when our 
customers and stakeholders win. 
‘Open’ has been the driving force 
behind our GPS journey. We have 
now created a strong platform with 
multiplicative forces through our 
One Axis approach along with the 
unification of digital platforms, 
partnerships and transformational 
projects to win across businesses.
MD & CEO's Statement
Annual Report 2022-23
16
The fiscal 2023 has been a historic 
year in our GPS journey as we made 
remarkable strides towards our 
ambition of attaining the leadership 
position in India's banking space.  
We delivered a solid performance as 
we lifted the growth momentum with 
meaningful upward shift in profitability, 
led by market share gains and several 
other accomplishments through 
the year. 
We witnessed strong growth across 
our focus segments, completed 
successful acquisition of Citibank 
India Consumer Business and retained 
our leadership position in specific 
businesses like payments, wealth 
management and Digital.  
Our steady progress towards delivering 
distinctiveness in our chosen areas 
namely Customer Obsession, Bharat 
Banking, Digital Bank and ‘One 
Axis’ has further provided us agility, 
innovation and synergies to win across 
business segments.
We are now consistently 
surpassing our GPS 
aspirational target of 
18% ROE and have 
fundamentally improved 
net interest margins to 
deliver earnings that 
are more predictable 
and consistent. The 
strength of our franchise 
is further visible through 
our self-sustaining 
capital structure.
Our consolidated ROE (excluding 
exceptional items) for the fiscal 
2023 was 18.84% led by all round 
outperformance across NIMs, fees, 
costs and asset quality metrics. We 
delivered growth of 68% in Profit After 
Tax (excluding exceptional items) on 
the back of 30% growth in net interest 
income and 25% growth in fee income. 
Our NIMs for the entire year improved 
by 55 bps y-o-y to 4.02%, while the 
credit costs declined by 32 bps y-o-y 
to 0.40%. Our organic businesses net 
accreted 69 bps of CET 1 (excluding 
exceptional items) in fiscal 2023 as 
compared to net consumption of 
176 bps in previous five years. These 
metrics provide us confidence to carry 
this momentum ahead as we continue 
to focus on the three core areas 
of execution: 
•	 Deepening a performance-
driven culture 
•	 Strengthened the balance sheet and 
organisational core significantly 
•	 Building for the future 
with relentless focus on 
driving distinctiveness
Improved Growth Metrics Led by  
a Performance-driven Culture 
We accelerated the growth 
momentum in fiscal 2023 led by 
continued executional excellence 
and transformation across various 
businesses of the Bank while setting 
new benchmarks in our focus areas 
to deliver improvement in key 
operating metrics.
During the fiscal, we witnessed strong 
growth in deposits and advances led 
by our focus on improving quality and 
granularity across businesses. Our 
granular CASA deposits grew 21% 
y-o-y. On advances, we continued to 
grow faster than the industry with 
domestic loan book growth of 23% 
y-o-y. Our focus segments comprising 
Mid Corporate, SME and Small 
Business Banking (SBB), grew at a much 
higher pace of 32% y-o-y and now 
constitute 20% of overall loan book.
Strong growth momentum in Retail 
across our businesses 
The Retail franchise delivered 
strong growth led by improvement 
in the quality of our deposits and 
higher market share across our key 
businesses. We delivered several  
all-time yearly highs as we added 10.8 
million new liability relationships and 
achieved record loan disbursements 
across the retail and rural segments.
Our focus on building a quality and 
granular liability franchise continued 
to progress well with 870 bps y-o-y 
increase in the share of premium 
segment in Retail SA deposits portfolio 
and 550 bps y-o-y reduction in 
the overall deposits’ outflow rates. 
Our wealth management business 
‘Burgundy’ continues to be among the 
largest in India with combined assets 
under management of H3.6 trillion and 
30 of the top 100 richest Indians as our 
Burgundy Private clients. 
Our well-diversified retail advances 
book grew 22% with higher growth in 
focus segments with SBB (50% y-o-y) 
and Rural (26% y-o-y), aided by several 
large transformation and technology 
initiatives. We also strengthened 
our market share in retail cards and 
payments businesses led by our 
innovative product propositions and 
partnerships led KTB (Known to Bank) 
strategy. We witnessed strong growth 
momentum across key metrics with 
all time high issuances of 4.2 million 
new credit cards, 63% y-o-y growth in

Welcome to Axis Bank

By successfully 
completing the 
acquisition of Citibank's 
India Consumer Business, 
we have achieved a 
new landmark in the 
Indian banking industry. 
This provides us an 
opportunity to further 
accelerate our retail 
business growth while 
strengthening our 
positioning across key 
business segments.
The acquisition of Citibank India 
Consumer Business to accelerate 
our journey of creating a premier 
retail franchise
Our positioning in the credit cards 
business has strengthened with 
our card advances market share 
improving by 450 bps to 16.3% led 
by the acquisition of a quality and 
complementary credit card franchise. 
Our liability franchise received a boost 
with over 100 bps improvement in 
CASA ratio and access to over 1,600 
Suvidha corporate relationships.
In wealth management business, we 
gained highly affluent Wealth customer 
base that would further accelerate our 
growth ambitions. 
The integration of Citibank India 
Consumer Business remains well on 
track with ~3,200 Citi employees now 
integrated into the Axis organisation 
structure. Early traction from the 
Citibank customer base has been 
quite positive. Our interactions 
with several high-value customers 
suggest their acknowledgment of the 
seamless transition, continuation of 
highest levels of service, access to 
Axis Bank’s extensive network of 
branches, and wide product portfolio 
under the One Axis umbrella. We 
have already started incremental 
onboarding of erstwhile ‘Suvidha’ 
salary accounts on Axis Bank 
platform for additional locations 
across the country where Citi was 
hitherto not present. 
While the acquired Citi business 
being entirely retail runs at a higher 
cost, it comes with higher return 
ratios and is ROE accretive post 
integration. It does not impede our 
ability to deliver our aspirational 
ROE. We have identified 60+ 
synergy initiatives across the Bank 
as we look to drive revenue and 
cost benefits. We believe that this 
integration between two highly 
complementary institutions will 
enable us to create the gold standard 
in the retail space.
Reinforced our proposition as a 
relationship-led sustainable and 
profitable Wholesale Bank
We have the best and most 
comprehensive Wholesale Banking 
franchise today. Our strategic focus 
in this segment has been to deliver 
relationship RAROC focused growth 
leveraging our ‘One Axis’ and Digital 
capabilities to provide holistic banking 
solutions to corporates. We stepped 
up growth across the coverage 
segments in fiscal 2023 with domestic 
corporate loan book up 24% y-o-y. 
MSME segment continues to remain 
a key growth driver for the Bank. 
The combined loan portfolio of Mid 
Corporate and SME has doubled 
in the last three years, with 1,100 
bps improvement in contribution 
to overall Wholesale book, thereby 
bringing higher granularity and aiding 
the PSL agenda of the Bank.  
We continued to engage with our 
corporate client across their capital 
structure to be their ‘transaction 
Bank of choice’. We won significant 
mandates across the transaction 
banking segments led by our 
technology-led solutions that  
resulted in the transaction banking, 
forex and trade related fees 
contributing 78% to overall Wholesale 
Banking fees. We strengthened our 
leadership positioning across products 
with market share of ~31% in IMPS, 
20% in Bharat Bill Payment ecosystem 
and 11% in foreign LC. We also 
improved our positioning in NEFT from 
4th to 2nd rank with market share of 11% 
in fiscal 2023. 
Our key group entities delivered 
significant value led by  
‘One Axis’ strategy
We have over the last four years 
scaled up the businesses across our 
subsidiaries significantly led by our ‘One 
Axis’ strategy. The domestic subsidiaries 
delivered yet another year of good 
performance with total profits of 
H1,304 crores and contributed 46 bps to 
the Bank’s consolidated ROE (excluding 
exceptional items) of 18.84%. 
Axis Finance, our full-service customer-
focused NBFC franchise delivered 30% 
y-o-y growth in net profit with ROE of 
16.9%, healthy capital adequacy ratio 
of over 20% and superior asset quality. 
Axis AMC delivered PAT growth of 
16% y-o-y, while our retail brokerage 
subsidiary delivered PAT of H203 crores 
in a volatile market environment. 
Axis Capital continued to maintain its 
dominance in equity capital markets. 
We continued to focus on offering 
holistic investment and financial 
solutions to our customers as we added 
retirement solutions with the launch of 
Axis Pension Fund during the year. 
Freecharge remains among the major 
fintechs in India with strong growth in 
Payments and Merchant Business and 
scale up in lending products segment. 
Our digital invoice discounting platform 
‘Invoicemart’ continues to set new 
benchmark as it facilitated financing of 
MSME invoices of more than  
H55,600 crores since its inception 
in 2017.

Max Life Insurance, India’s fourth 
largest insurance company where we 
are a co-promoter, also delivered strong 
performance with expansion in margins 
and 28% y-o-y growth in Value of New 
Business (VNB). We remain committed 
to the long-term association with Max 
Life as its promoter and bancassurance 
partner. With the far-reaching 
regulatory changes in insurance sector 
of late and the significant long term 
growth aspects, we believe that Max 
Life offers enhanced value creation 
opportunities for us.
The oversight on Bank’s subsidiaries 
remains an essential element of our 
‘One Axis’ strategy. We have taken 
several initiatives to strengthen 
our well-established and integrated 
Subsidiaries Governance framework 
under the supervision of the Subsidiary 
Management Committee (SMC). We 
also realigned and strengthened the 
leadership teams across our capital 
markets facing subsidiaries during the 
year to drive our next phase of growth.
Fostering a winning mindset
Our wining mindset is reflected in 
multiple external recognitions that the 
Bank received for its performance. 
The Bank was adjudged #1 on the 
Quality Index for both Large Corporate 
and Middle Market Banking in the 
Greenwich Banking Survey for the 
second year in a row. The Bank’s project 
NEO that signifies our aspiration to 
become the leading Digital Wholesale 
Bank in India, received several 
accolades including the ‘Best BFSI 
Customer Experience award’ for NEO 
API Banking Suite, ‘Best BFSI MSME 
Support award’ for NEO Connect at 
the prestigious Dun & Bradstreet BFSI 
& Fintech Summit 2023 and the Asset 
Triple A Digital Award. 
The various awards won by the 
Bank during the year including ‘Data 
Engineering Excellence award’ at 
Cypher 2022 for our personalisation 
project, ‘The Retail Banker’s 
International Asia Trailblazer award’ 
for trailblazing use of AI and Machine 
Learning in Financial Services space and 
Economic Times DataCon award for 
‘Modern and Agile Data Architecture 
and Infrastructure’ further validated 
our leadership position in new-
age technologies. 
I am also pleased to share that we were 
ranked in the Top 10 of the Kincentric 
Best Employers in India survey and 
we were certified a ‘Great Place to 
Work’ for the second consecutive year. 
These external recognitions reflect the 
positive culture change in the Bank and 
the investments we have made in our 
people and technology. 
Strengthened the Balance Sheet 
and Core Significantly 
Built a strong balance sheet with 
self-sustaining capital structure 
Our balance sheet remains resilient 
with healthy capital position and best-
in-class asset quality metrics. During 
the year, we increased our provision 
coverage ratio by 600 bps to 81% 
while maintaining significant additional 
non NPA provisioning buffers of over 
H11,900 crores, that translated to 
standard asset coverage ratio of 1.42%, 
among the highest in the industry. The 
Bank’s asset quality too remains among 
the best-in-class with net NPA declining 
further by 34 bps to 0.39%. The Bank 
has also maintained amongst the lowest 
standard COVID-19 restructuring 
portfolios that stood at 0.22% of Bank's 
gross customer assets. 
The Bank’s self-sustaining capital 
structure with overall capital 
adequacy ratio at 17.64% and CET 
1 ratio of 14.02% ensures that we 
are well capitalised to drive our 
growth ambitions.
Building next-generation  
technology architecture
In a rapidly evolving financial 
landscape, technology and product 
innovation with ‘openness and agility’ 
to adapt to evolving customer needs 
remain critical to achieve success.
 
In the last three years, 
our IT team strength 
has more than doubled 
with over 2.5x increase 
in total technology 
spends, as we continue to 
focus on building critical 
capabilities and best-in-
class resilience across our  
business operations.
We have been a leader in cloud 
adoption with our multi cloud-first 
strategy and cloud-native micro 
services-based architecture that has 
helped us to deploy over 75 initiatives 
on cloud. We have also accelerated the 
delivery across businesses by investing 
in emerging technologies with creation 
of nearly 3,000 RPA bots and 1,480+ 
automated processes. 
Our investments in new-age data 
science and engineering platforms like 
Big Data Lake, Micro Services-based 
Architecture, etc. continue to deliver 
value as we have now deployed 100+ 
diverse use cases in 10+ business 
domains to make data-driven business 
decisions. We continue to leverage our 
strength in Data Analytics to further 
drive distinctiveness in customer 
experience, as we took personalisation 
to next level with 10,000+ hyper-
personalised nudges across 2,500+ 
customer features. Our initiative on 
universal underwriting where our goal 
is to provide credit access for every 
eligible Indian leveraging alternate data, 
continues to scale up well. We also 
improved our BitSight rating, a key risk 
indicator of overall cybersecurity to 
800 from 770 last year, highlighting our 
strong focus on risk and governance.

Organisation-wide transformation 
projects have accelerated our GPS journey
The multiple large-scale transformation 
projects that we have been running across 
the Bank have started yielding positive 
outcomes across the key businesses. 
Project ‘Triumph’ has been instrumental 
in improving the productivity of liability 
sales channel and improving the quality 
of deposits with 870 bps increase in 
share of premium segment in Retail SA 
balances. On the retail assets side, projects 
like ‘Unnati’ and ‘SBB Sankalp’ have 
been instrumental in improving TAT and 
driving higher growth, respectively. On 
the payments side, the projects ‘Zenith’ 
and ‘Kanban’ have helped to improve our 
market positioning in cards and merchant 
acquiring businesses. 
We have also made strong progress in 
Project NEO towards our ambition of 
building a world class Digital Wholesale 
Bank. Our path-breaking digital banking 
platform NEO witnessed strong adoption 
from corporates with 1,000+ client 
engagements since its launch. Our market-
leading transaction banking API suite 
and best-in-class corporate developer 
portal offers a strong product market 
fit that resulted in 3x y-o-y growth in 
transaction volumes.
The fiscal year 2023 was 
a breakout year for our 
digital banking platform 
Axis 2.0. Our early 
leadership in building 
proprietary in-house digital 
native capabilities with full 
stack engineering, product 
and a design team of 
400+ people have started 
yielding results.
Building a Future-ready 
Organisation 
Digital continues to be an area of 
relentless focus for us
Our ‘Axis Mobile’ app today is the world’s 
highest rated app at scale with 4.8 
rating on Google Play Store and nearly 
2 million+ reviews. It also serves as the 
largest branch for the Bank with over 20 
million customer registrations, ~12 million 
monthly active users, 250+ services 
and over 67% of the service requests 
serviced digitally. 
Axis 2.0, our end-to-end digital business 
unit, is now operating at scale with over 
20 products across liabilities, loans, 
investment products, insurance and 
forex accounting for 15% to 85% of 
incremental sales for these products. 
It also contributed to our customer 
obsession journey with Net Promoter 
Scores (NPS) for Axis 2.0 products being 
10-30 percentage points higher than 
their physical equivalents. 
Our API (Application Programming 
Interfaces) Developer Portal, that has 
been the 1st in industry to facilitate 
simplified end-to-end digital developer 
onboarding journeys, now boasts of 
strong and wide suite of over 400 
open APIs for Retail, Wholesale and 
Connected banking solutions. The Bank 
now has 95+ strategic partnerships in 
the digital space offering true end-to-end 
digital experience to customers across 
the spectrum.
In the current integrated environment, 
Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem 
and Open Credit Enablement 
Network (OCEN) are likely to make 
significant impact in digital lending 
to underpenetrated segments across 
Retail and MSME. We were the 
first Bank to launch digital lending 
through AA framework in fiscal 2022 
and have since scaled our AA-linked 
business significantly.
Bank-wide programmes to build 
distinctiveness 
We continue to invest in technologies to 
empower our employees to increase their 
productivity and drive customer delight. 
Our multiyear distinctiveness programme 
‘Sparsh’ continues to progress in the right 
direction as we strive to become India’s 
most customer-obsessed Bank. Several 
initiatives taken across the Bank through 
combined approach of embedding critical 
behaviours and building institutional 
capabilities through Personalisation 
and Digital, have resulted in upto 33% 
improvement in our Net Promoter Scores 
across the Retail and Wholesale Bank. 
This is a multi-year journey and we will 
continue to invest with the aim to cover 
the entire Bank in this Financial Year.
During the year, we went live with 
‘Siddhi’ – a super app that’s built on 
modern tech stack with cloud native 
development integrates 35+ backend 
systems to empower our colleagues 
to engage more meaningfully with 
customers and offer them instant 
solutions. This is a multiyear journey, 
and our vision of Siddhi app is to actually 
personalise it for every employee of 
the Bank. 
Our distinctiveness initiative around 
Bharat Banking continues to make 
strong progress. Multiple macro factors 
including improvement in physical and 
digital infrastructure, evolution of the 
technology stack, efficient delivery of 
various government schemes in the retail 
and MSME space, etc. have provided 
strong tailwinds to the Rural and Semi 
Urban (RuSu) or ‘Bharat’ markets.
We scaled up the distribution footprint 
in this segment to 2,137 branches 
complemented by a large CSC (Common 
Services Centres) network of 60,600+ 
VLEs (Village Level Entrepreneurs) that 
grew 50% y-o-y. We also collaborated 
with marquee rural-focused customer 
and fintech players, launched eKYC 
based CASA platform through 
partnership ecosystem and went live 
with five partners on digital  
co-lending platforms to further penetrate 
rural supply chains and access new 
customer segments. 
As a result of our focused initiatives 
across products, processes and 
partnerships, we achieved the highest 
ever yearly disbursements, 26%

growth in rural advances and a 15% 
y-o-y growth in deposits from ‘Bharat’ 
branches. The growth has been across 
all the major product lines backed by 
improving margins, PSL asset accretion 
and lower credit cost. We are confident 
of continuing the growth momentum 
and creating distinctiveness in 
Bharat markets. 
We have built a 
fair, diverse and 
performance-driven 
culture, guided 
by the principles 
of transparency, 
meritocracy and our 
five Core Values that 
drive our behaviour and 
actions at work. 
Our deep-rooted organisation culture 
and ESG-aligned commitments 
continue to get external recognition
We also remain fully committed to 
strengthen and enhance the Risk and 
Compliance culture of the Bank in 
order to build long-term sustainability 
and trust with our customers and 
other stakeholders.
We have redefined conventional 
workplace practices with over 
3,700 employees and freelancers 
working from anywhere under GIG-
A-Anywhere and majority of the 
employees in our large offices being 
part of the hybrid working model. We 
also continued to invest in building 
their skills and provided them avenues 
for progressing their careers through 
our flagship talent management 
initiatives and internal job programmes.
The community continues to be a 
critical stakeholder for us. The Axis 
Bank Foundation, under its Sustainable 
Livelihoods Program, crossed the 
significant milestone of supporting  
1.3 million households as part of 
its mission to reach 2 million rural 
households by the year 2026. 
We made strong progress in our  
ESG-aligned commitments that we had 
published last year by surpassing the 
targets we had set for ourselves for 
the fiscal across Retail and Wholesale 
Banking to sectors with positive social 
and environmental outcomes. We 
also surpassed the overall diversity 
ratio target for the year with women 
employees representing 25.7% of the 
overall workforce. 
The progress made in our ESG 
commitments continue to reflect in 
Bank’s steady performance at key 
ESG assessment and recognition 
platforms. The Bank featured on the 
prestigious FTSE4Good Index for the 
sixth consecutive year in 2022 while 
improving its ratings across platforms 
like S&P Dow Jones, MSCI and CDP.
Strong Progress Made across 
our Focus Segments Backed by 
Distinctiveness and Execution 
Excellence, Giving us the Right 
to Win 
We, at Axis Bank, remain confident on 
the growth opportunities in the Indian 
economy. The banking industry is 
currently well placed with loan growth 
being strong across the key segments, 
margins and asset quality being the 
best in recent years along with healthy 
capital position. As India heads towards 
a $5trillion economy, the opportunity to 
leverage some of the emerging trends 
like China plus 1, MSME and ‘Bharat’ 
acting as engines of growth, rapid 
evolution of the next-gen public digital 
infrastructure like account aggregator, 
OCEN and ONDC in financial services 
space is immense. 
We believe that the large banks with 
stronger balance sheets, innovative and 
holistic product propositions, robust 
technological infrastructure and digital 
capabilities to deliver better customer 
experience would continue to gain 
higher market share. 
We are well positioned to take 
advantage of these trends. 
In the last four years, 
we have transformed 
the Bank to a stronger, 
more consistent and 
sustainable franchise. 
Our building blocks 
are firmly in place with 
robust growth in our 
focused businesses, 
strong operational 
performance, healthy 
capital and balance sheet 
position to continue 
delivering sustained 
profitable growth. 
Given the powerful integrated platform 
we are building, we will continue to 
grow 400 to 600 bps faster than the 
industry, in the medium to long term. 
The significant strides we made during 
the year on our customer obsession 
journey, digital capabilities, Bharat 
Banking and successful acquisition 
of Citibank India Consumer Business 
further give us the confidence in 
sustaining this performance. 
I thank our internal and external 
stakeholders for their continued 
support and faith in our strategy, 
the chosen areas of distinctiveness 
and our relentless approach to 
execution excellence. We as a Bank 
remain committed to our ‘Open to 
Win Together’ tenet while working 
hard towards building an all-weather 
institution that will stand the test 
of time.

the premium paid till date with interest. 
Becoming India's Most Customer-obsessed Bank 
We aspire to become India's most customer-obsessed bank, and hence, we 
are measuring NPS across all our customer journeys. We have implemented 
organisation-wide change-management programmes to institutionalise Sparsh 
by working on four pillars, i.e. craft delightful journeys, create employees 
as delight advocates, build institutional capabilities and measure and act on 
customer feedback.
These initiatives have resulted in positive increase in NPS in all the customer 
journeys to 133 on the baseline of 100.

Accelerating Growth  
and Profitability 
Our pursuit of becoming a growth 
and profitability engine is trending in 
the right direction with disbursals and 
book growing strongly across retail and 
institutional lines, declining credit cost 
and maintaining a healthy risk adjusted 
return on capital. The book continues 
to be highly PSL-accretive and a key 
pillar in achieving PSL self-sufficiency 
at a bank level. In our endeavour of 
Open to Win Together, we have worked 
across the Bank to deliver on several 
initiatives such as scaling up multi 
product architecture significantly 
through ‘Deep Geo’ initiative and 
partnerships such as CSC, enabling 
more branches to source products 
such as gold loans and increasing 
intensity of cross-sell from the sales 
architecture. To create distinctiveness 
in RuSu markets, the business is 
building digital journeys across 
products, strengthening processes 
and governance, building several 
ecosystems, improving propositions to 
promote credit flow in RuSu markets 
and enhancing the brand through 
local and vernacular marketing. We 
are primed to secure our position as 
a preferred banking partner for the 
RuSu customers.

Inviting a Workforce More 
Representative of India
In February 2023, we launched the 
ARISE initiative with an intention to 
tap into the abundant talent in India 
and encourage recruitment practices 
to focus on skills over education. 
The programme was designed to 
establish an equitable environment 
where graduates and postgraduates 
with up to five years of experience 
can showcase their skills and gain 
employment at Axis Bank.
ARISE has had successful outcomes, 
as evidenced by the feedback 
received from those hired and their 
managers who appreciate having 
varied perspectives and understand 
the benefit it can bring to various roles 
within the organisation.
#ComeAsYouAre 
Our DE&I agenda focuses on 
delivered metrics of representation, 
in line with Axis Bank's credo of 
inclusion: "The onus of inclusion 
lies with those who are included, 
not on those who are excluded". 
Through Pause for Bias, our signature 
DE&I training module, Axis Bank 
employees learn to identify and look 
beyond their biases.

Seamless Integration of Citi Bank’s 
Employees in Axis Bank
We completed acquisition of Citibank 
India Consumer Business and 
welcomed ~3,200  Citi colleagues on 
March 1, 2023. We achieved a 97%+ 
retention of critical talent from Citi and 
their seamless integration through:
•	 A ‘No Less Favourable’ offer to all 
Citi employees
•	 Efficient query resolution 
and sharing of other relevant 
information through a dedicated 
mobile app
•	 Comprehensive HR induction on 
Axis values and culture, DE&I

initiatives, AHEAD and ASTROS
Experiences that Matter
India's financial services sector is 
growing at a rapid pace and we identify 
the need to capitalise on this gain to 
give our employees the opportunity 
to build successful careers. We have 
deployed a position management 
system in our HR technology suite—a 
first for an Indian Bank—that allows 
all active requisitions to be listed 
on Catalyst, our internal job portal, 
before external recruitment begins. 
The portal helps our employees 
redefine their career journey within the 
Bank, by opting for new roles across 
departments and subsidiaries.
In fiscal 2023, 46% of our vacant 
positions were filled by internal 
transfers across the Bank 
and subsidiaries.
A Culture that Focuses on 
Delighting Customers 
We drive a values-driven culture 
transformation through Axis Value 
Realisers (AVRs), who serve as 
ambassadors of culture and change. 
We have a Values Scorecard in 
place that measures and monitors 
the adoption of values and is done 
via engagement survey data and 
customer experience metrics. Our 
high scores on social media and in 
internal surveys reflect employee 
pride and advocacy.

took the lead to bring together 
and collaborate with various 
stakeholders – Axis Capital,

a well-diversified and granular MSME loan book to manage risks leveraging 
the One Axis approach. We have created specialised units within the Bank 
to address sub-segments within the MSME portfolio.

Best Private Bank for Client Acquisition 
in Asia in the 5th Annual Wealth 
Tech Awards.
Gaining Market Share in Payments
Our credit card issuance increased by 
57% to 4.2 million cards in fiscal 2023, 
aided by Known to Bank relationships 
and strategic partnerships. This 
resulted in a 17% incremental CIF

we continue to strengthen our 
positioning with a 17% market share in 
UPI, 15.7% in mobile, 10.6% in NEFT 
payments and 18.6% in merchant 
POS terminals.
Building on Cards and

by our One Axis approach, innovative 
product offerings such as small ticket 
loans, quick overdrafts and equipment 
finance, Cards and Payments.

customer obsession was followed in 
true spirit.

Performance for the Year
43
As a key vector of the GPS strategy, 
we are on a journey to create one of 
the best and premium retail banking 
franchises in India. During the year, 
we made good progress towards the 
same with improvement in quality 
of our deposit franchise, sustained 
momentum in retail loan book with 
strong growth in our focus segments 
like Rural and Small Business Banking, 
and leadership in cards, payments and 
wealth management businesses. Our 
CASA deposits grew 21% y-o-y, Retail 
loan book (constituting 58% of overall 
Bank advances) grew 22% y-o-y on the 
back of all-time high disbursements, 
credit card spends touched new 
yearly highs and Retail fees grew 33%, 
contributing 68% to the overall Bank 
fee income. 
Further, the successful acquisition of 
Citibank India Consumer Business, 
a landmark in the Indian banking 
industry, strongly positions us 
for accelerated premium market 
share growth.
Granularisation of Liability 
Franchise with Sharp Improvement 
in Quality of Deposits
We have significantly improved the 
quality of our liability franchise led by 
focus on granularisation and deepening 
of deposits base. Our micro market 
focused strategy backed by analytics-
driven market scoping continues to 
play out well. In the last three years, 
we have steadily gained higher market 
share across districts with over 33% 
increase in number of districts with 
deposits market share of over 5%. 
We added 10.8 million new liability 
relationships with ~4.7 million new SA 
relationships in fiscal 2023, 8% higher 
than the previous year.
We continued to work towards 
leveraging our relationships with 
leading corporates to gain a higher 
share in the salary segment. We saw 
33% y-o-y increase in new salary labels 
acquired and added 1.8 million new 
salary accounts with 23% y-o-y higher 
NTB (New to Bank) balances from 
them, a reflection of growth in both 
quality and quantity.
During the year, the Branch Banking 
team worked closely with different 
parts of the Bank – Bharat Banking, 
Commercial Banking, Government 
Coverage among others to drive higher 
growth in granular deposits.
As part of our various planned 
interventions to increase the share 
of LCR-accretive retail deposits, we 
delivered higher growth in deposits 
from retail and small business segments 
that resulted in nearly 550 bps 
reduction in outflow rates.
Strengthened our Positioning in 
Wealth Management in Line with 
Bank's Premiumisation Strategy
Premiumisation of the liabilities 
franchise continues to be an important 
imperative for the Bank. Our focus on 
offering ‘right fit’ solutions and new 
product propositions like ‘Priority 
Banking’ programme, ‘Ultima Salary’

and ‘Silver Linings’ with several 
value-added features helped us 
garner new premium relationships. 
The share of premium segments in 
our retail SA franchise improved by 
870 bps y-o-y to over 55% led by 
our focus on premiumisation and the 
recent acquisition of Citibank India’s 
Consumer Business portfolios.
Our wealth management business 
‘Burgundy’ is among the largest in 
India with combined assets under 
management of H3.6 trillion across  
~2.5 lakhs affluent and ultra-HNI 
clients. Our seasoned team of 700 
RMs and wealth specialists with 
vintage of 12 to 18 years, strong 
research capabilities across asset 
classes and robust and modular open 
API architecture have helped us build 
deep relationships with the clients. 
‘Burgundy Private’ proposition that 
we launched three years ago crossed 
the milestone of H1.37 trillion in assets 
under management. We have built a 
truly premium proposition with 30 
of the top 100 richest Indians as per 
Forbes list banking with us on the 
Burgundy Private platform.
NRI segment has been of strategic 
focus at Axis. In the past year, we 
have revamped our digital acquisition 
journey, launched UPI for NRI 
customers, and introduced Portfolio 
Investment Scheme services through 
digital channels. The faith of our 
customers is evidenced by the strong 
acquisition momentum.
During the year, we continued to 
leverage our ‘One Axis’ capabilities 
across Axis Group to provide be-
spoke wealth management services 
along with the power and stability of 
a leading Bank to our private banking 
clients. Our ‘3i’ approach – ‘integrity’ in 
all our customer interactions, ‘intellect’ 
and ‘innovation’ in our product 
offerings and solutions continues to be 
recognised externally, with the Bank 
winning the award for ‘Best Private 
Bank for Client Acquisition, Asia’ at 
the PWM Wealth Tech Awards 2022 
organised by Financial Times, UK and 
‘Outstanding Marketing Campaign 
by a Private Bank/Family Office’ at 
the Annual Global Private Banking 
Innovation Awards by Global Private 
Banker, Singapore.
Acquisition of Citibank India 
Consumer Business has Further 
Accelerated our Growth Ambitions
The successful completion of 
acquisition of Citibank India Consumer 
Business during the year provided us 
access to large, affluent and profitable 
consumer franchise, in line with 
our ambition to become a premium 
retail franchise.
The acquisition provided us a quality 
credit card franchise with one of the 
highest wallet shares in premium 
cards, which is complementary and 
has strengthened our presence in top 
8 metros. We have consolidated our 
position in the credit cards business 
with our market share improving by 
450 bps to 16.3% in terms of credit 
card advances and nearly 20% addition 
to the cards in force base.
The acquisition of sizable premium 
and granular customer base also 
strengthened our liability franchise 
with over 100 bps improvement 
in CASA and access to over 1,600 
Suvidha corporate relationships. In 
wealth management business, we 
got access to highly affluent Wealth 
customer base that would accelerate 
our growth ambitions.
We believe that the Citi’s affluent 
clientele backed by global best 
practices in client servicing and 
operations will not only complement 
Axis Bank’s strong product 
propositions but also offers us huge 
cross-sell potential to further deepen 
relationships leveraging our strong 
platforms. The clients will now be 
able to benefit from our combined 
‘One Axis’ proposition, avail an even 
wider product offerings, and Bank 
seamlessly using our wider branch and 
ATM network. There are significant 
synergies that we expect to realise over 
the coming quarters to deliver higher 
value to customers.
Delivered Strong Growth across 
our Focused Retail Segments 
Our retail lending franchise continues 
to deliver sustained growth across 
segments with higher growth across 
higher yielding focus segments. We 
delivered strong performance with 
retail disbursements touching new 
all-time high in fiscal 2023 that led to 
strong growth in retail advances, which 
now constitute 58% of the overall 
Bank advances.
We continued to focus on delivering 
profitable growth led by business-mix 
optimisation towards higher yielding 
loans within secured segment. For 
instance, within the mortgage segment, 
we grew Loan against property and 
affordable home loans faster than the 
home loan and in wheels, the used car 
vehicle loans have grown substantially 
in the last few years. The rural and 
small business banking loan portfolios 
delivered strong y-o-y growth of 26% 
and 50%, respectively.
Further, we continue to leverage 
our best-in-class data analytical 
capabilities around proprietary database 
programmes, alternate data, KTB 
(Known to Bank) scorecards and hyper 
personalisation to drive higher growth 
across our unsecured retail product 
segments. During the year, the Bank’s 
database programmes contributed 
66% of Personal Loan sourcing and 
79% of new cards sourcing. The Bank 
won ‘Trailblazer in Next Generation 
Technology Award’ for use of Artificial 
Intelligence & Machine learning in 2022.
In line with our strategy on building 
ecosystems, we launched a co-branded 
home buyer ecosystem, entered into 
partnerships and MOU with several

auto manufacturers to provide 
financing to dealers and customers. 
The acquisition of Citi Consumer 
Business, and our early leadership in 
Universal Underwriting and Account 
Aggregator framework provide us an 
opportunity to further cross-sell and 
drive growth in Retail loan book.
Bharat Banking – Our 
Distinctiveness Initiative 
Continues to Scale Up Well
Our strategy to drive higher business 
growth and increase market share 
from rural and semi urban (RuSu) 
markets made strong progress during 
the year. As a result of our focused 
initiatives across products, processes 
and partnerships, we achieved the 
highest ever monthly disbursement 
in March 2023 across all the major 
product segments, 26% growth in rural 
advances and a 15% y-o-y growth in 
deposits from ‘Bharat’ branches. The 
growth has been across all the major 
product lines backed by PSL asset 
accretion and lower credit cost.
The Bharat Banking vertical continues 
to work together with other parts of 
the Bank to provide customer-centric 
solutions related to products which 
largely cater to agri, rural and farm 
to fork supply chain segments while 
driving deeper penetration with other 
Retail Assets and liability products in 
the RuSu markets.
We have scaled up the distribution 
footprint in this segment to 2,137 
branches complemented by a large 
CSC (Common Services Centers) 
network of 60,600+ VLEs (Village 
Level Entrepreneurs), that grew 50% 
y-o-y. We continue to significantly 
expand the partnership ecosystem & 
pursue co-lending opportunities as we 
collaborated with marquee names such 
as India Post Payments Bank, Airtel 
Payments Bank, ITC, etc. to further 
penetrate rural supply chains and 
enhance our distribution.
Digital continues to be the key theme 
to build distinctiveness by providing 
best in class customer journeys and 
giving strong impetus to the low-cost 
and customer-centric business model. 
We launched eKYC based CASA 
platform, enabling deepening of our 
liabilities’ products through partnership 
ecosystem. We also went live with 
five partners on digital co-lending 
platform that will provide access to 
new customer segments and augment 
the PSL portfolio.
We continue to focus on building 
an array of ‘Bharat centric’ products 
for better segmental coverage and 
penetration. We launched and scaled 
up several new propositions to 
enhance our offerings on the retail and 
institutional side such as used tractor 
financing, agri-infra financing, lease 
rent discounting, Farmer Producer 
Organisation (FPO) financing, etc. We 
also enabled several policy changes 
and process enablements across 
product categories such as widening 
collateral coverage to facilitate credit 
flow in deep markets. The Bank’s 
first branch with a new rural-centric 
design went live in fiscal 2023 and we 
intend to replicate the same in order 
to significantly improve our visibility in 
RuSu markets.
We are confident of continuing the 
growth momentum and creating a 
strong distinction in RuSu markets 
backed by our deep distribution, 
comprehensive product suite, 
investment in digital initiatives, robust 
partnership ecosystem, and proven 
expertise in lending to RuSu customers.
Improved Productivity and 
Customer Experience  
across the Channels
We continue to follow calibrated 
branch expansion strategy with 
emphasis on improving the productivity 
of our relationship manager and sales 
channels. Over the past 3 years, we 
have enhanced the efficiency across 
the channels and segments led by 
multiple transformational projects and 
institutionalisation of daily operating 
rigour and rhythm.
Project Triumph has been instrumental 
in improving the productivity of liability 
sales channel, deepening and improving 
the quality of deposits. On the retail 
assets side, projects like Unnati and 
SBB Sankalp have been instrumental in 
improving TAT and simplifying the loan 
origination journeys while the projects 
Zenith and Kanban have helped to 
transform the customer life cycle 
management in cards and merchant 
acquiring businesses. As part of our 
‘Branch of the Future’ initiative, over 
67% of customer service requests are 
now fulfilled digitally.
Our significant investments in Digital 
and Technology towards building 
curated digital onboarding journeys, 
upgrading the core cards platform, 
enabling the front line staff with varied 
digital tools on BYOD platform, etc. 
have started making impact.
Digital continues to be a distinctiveness 
area for driving growth in retail assets 
and liabilities. In fiscal 2023, 48% of the 
individual retail term deposits by value 
were sourced digitally. On the assets 
side, 55% of the personal loans, 48% of 
the unsecured business loans and 30% 
of two wheeler loans were disbursed 
end to end digitally as part of Maximus 
24x7 digital lending.

We believe that our omnichannel 
presence via our strong 4,900 branch

Mobile’ app which for us is the largest 
branch, Axis Virtual Centre (AVC) 
channel with over 1,500 VRMs, strong 
network of CSC VLEs and business 
correspondents, along with strong 
partnerships across products would 
help us to continue serving our 
customers ‘Dil Se’.
Gained Market Share in Cards 
and Payments Aided by Strong 
Product Propositions and  
Strategic Partnerships
During the year, we continued to 
witness strong traction across credit 
card issuances, spends and advances. 
We issued 4.2 million credit cards 
in fiscal 2023, highest ever for the 
year led by our best-in-class product 
offerings, strong data analytics and 
partnerships led KTB (Known to Bank) 
partnership strategy. Our co-branded 
card ‘Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card’ 
crossed yet another significant 
milestone to end the year with 3.58 
million cards in force, making it one 
of the fastest growing co-branded 
portfolios since its launch in July 2019. 
During the year, we also entered into 
a strategic partnership with Indian Oil, 
Samsung and others to drive higher 
customer engagement.
We continue to invest in improved 
sourcing and offer propositions like 
Wednesday Delights, Grab Deals and 
others to deepen spends. The credit 
card spends for the year grew 63% 
y-o-y to touch new yearly highs of 
`1.35 lakh crores. Our ‘Axis Mobile’ 
app that has the highest rating of 4.8 
on Google Play Store with over  
2 million+ reviews, continues to drive 
growth in card advances. Our card 
advances for the year grew by 97% 
aided partly by the acquired Citi Card 
advances portfolio.
In the merchant acquiring space, we 
continue to be the second-largest in 
the country with an installed capacity 
of over 1.4 million terminals. We 
gained an incremental market share 
of 26% in fiscal 2023 led by our ‘One 
Axis’ approach towards empowering 
merchants with innovative offerings 
and integrated ecosystem solutions like 
Digital Dukaan and MicroPay that we 
launched during the year.
In the UPI payments space, we 
continue to partner with new fintech 
players to drive higher payment 
volumes. We have more than doubled 
our customer VPA (Virtual Private 
Addresses) base in last fiscal to  
644 million and continue to maintain 
our strong positioning with 17% market 
share as Payer PSP by volumes.
Our investments towards building a 
robust IT infrastructure and upgrading 
capabilities have helped us to achieve 
one of the lowest technical decline 
rates in the industry.
Our Aspiration is to Set a New 
Gold Standard in Consumer  
Banking in India
We have over the years built a strong 
risk management architecture in Retail 
with well-defined risk appetite and 
retail lending policies across product 
segments. The asset quality in Retail 
remained stable with low net slippages 
and decline in net NPA ratio by 8 bps 
y-o-y to 0.49%.
The customer demand has been 
resilient even as higher interest rates 
pose a near-term threat. The retail 
growth momentum in India continued 
to improve through the year to inch 
closer to the pre-pandemic highs led 
by higher customer discretionary 
spending. While the retail banking 
sector loan growth was broad based 
across segments, the non-mortgage 
sector loan growth improved 
considerably led by credit cards, 
customer durables, auto loans and 
personal loans.
We believe the trend of rising 
consumerism and urbanisation in 
India with better access to credit will 
continue to drive strong growth in 
retail business. Further, the banks 
with large distribution network, better 
technological capabilities and customer 
experience will continue to gain higher 
market share. We, at Axis Bank, are 
well placed to leverage these trends on 
back of our extensive reach, strategic 
partnerships and our leadership in data 
analytics. With focus on customer-
centricity, innovation in product 
offerings, deeper presence in RuSu 
markets, higher resource productivity 
led by improvement in operational 
processes and digital prowess, our 
aspiration is to set a new gold standard 
in Consumer Banking in India.
Our strong performance in fiscal 
2023, gives us confidence that we 
are on track to achieve our strategic 
objectives of sustainable and profitable 
growth while strengthening our market 
leadership across our key businesses.

grow and gain market share in fiscal 
2023. The business sees a generous 
PSL contribution, adding to the 
development of a reliable current 
account portfolio with steady Trade

This relation-led approach is reflected 
in the 17% growth in CA deposits and 
14% in fees from CBG in fiscal 2023, 
from a year ago.
Strong momentum in  
CBG business
The CBG asset portfolio was ₹92,723

Fostering a Powerful 
Corporate India
The fiscal 2023 was yet another 
remarkable year for Corporate India 
as it weathered uncertain global 
macro environment to pursue its 
growth ambitions. With corporate 
balance sheets at their healthiest 
in more than a decade and several 
domestic macro levers in place, the 
new private capex cycle has well and 
truly begun. The increase in export 
demand, rebound in consumption, and 
public capex contributed to an uptick 
in the manufacturing activities of the 
corporates and their spending plans.
Our strategic focus in Wholesale 
Bank has been to deliver relationship 
RAROC-focused growth within 
our risk framework, leveraging our 
distinctiveness around ‘One Axis’,

Delivered Disproportionately 
Higher Growth in Our Focus 
Segments
We believe that MSME (medium 
and small and medium enterprises) 
lending will be the growth driver for 
the banking industry over the next 
decade, just like how retail was in the 
previous decade. The MSME segment 
remains strategic priority for us as it 
brings granularity to the wholesale 
book, offers high RAROC and is PSL 
accretive business.
Given the diversity of MSMEs in India, 
one of the strengths that we bring to 
this segment is our ability to recognise 
the different segments and provide 
customer-specific solutions. Our 
distinctive ‘One Axis’ approach towards 
leveraging our capabilities across the 
Bank, be it Branch Banking, Wholesale 
Banking Products, Treasury, Wealth 
Management and our subsidiaries like 
A.TReDS, Axis Capital and Axis Finance 
allows us to offer comprehensive 
solutions to these enterprises and get 
the maximum share of their wallet.
The concerted efforts resulted in the 
strong growth performance in our 
focused segments like CBG and Mid 
Corporate that together have nearly 
doubled in book size in last three years. 
The share of Mid Corporate and SME 
advances in overall Wholesale book 
has increased from 30% in fiscal 2019 
to 36% in fiscal 2023 end, thereby 
bringing in a greater level of granularity 
to the overall portfolio while 
contributing to the PSL agenda.
Our strategy to expand geographical 
footprint to accelerate new customer 
acquisition, and ability to offer multiple 
products to existing customers 
backed by analytics and technology, 
continues to play out well in these 
segments. During the year, new credit 
relationships in CBG segment grew by 
69% with the NTB (New to Bank) book 
balances up 34% y-o-y.
A combination of our differentiated 
approach towards customer and 
product selection, our well-diversified 
book and strong credit underwriting 
has helped us to keep the risks under 
control in MSME segment. The asset 
quality and risk metrics in CBG segment 
continue to hold up quite well for us 
with net slippages of `282 crores in 
fiscal 2023. The net NPAs in CBG 
segment further declined by 23 bps 
y-o-y to 0.33% with provision coverage 
at 71%.
We also remain focused on the MNC 
and New Economy segment where 
we see vast available opportunity to 
cater to growing banking needs of 
start-ups across working capital loans, 
transaction banking, employee banking, 
forex, among others. Today, we have 
about a 30% market share, and we bank 
60% of unicorns in the country led by 
our integrated coverage approach.
During the year, we continued to focus 
on serving Indian corporates with global 
operations through our consolidated 
overseas branch operations in Dubai, 
Singapore and GIFT City, India, offering 
them an entire spectrum of financial 
services. Our overseas book continues 
to be dominated by high rated Indian 
conglomerates and PSU entities.  
The Bank’s Dubai International 
Financial Centre (DIFC) won the 
‘Customer Service Excellence’ award at 
the Middle East International Business 
Performance for the Year
53
Awards. It also received the much 
acclaimed Excellence in Banking and 
Innovation" award at the "Le Fonti 
International Awards 2023".
Our Solution-oriented 
Approach Helped Us to Retain 
Our Dominant Position in 
Government Business
We retained our strong positioning 
in the Government business led by 
our strong relationship management 
and a solution-oriented approach 
across deposits, payments, collections 
and liquidity management. Our 
endeavour has always been to 
provide the best-in-class technology 
platform through our beyond banking 
solutions as we stand committed 
towards the beneficiaries, community, 
and the society by working 
closely with the Central and State 
Government organisations.
During the year, as part of the Fund 
Disbursement Management Solution 
(FDMS), we went live with our  
end-to-end digital payment solution 
tailored for fund management, 
tracking and payments for various 
Government projects and schemes 
under Central sponsored, Central 
sector and State schemes. We 
also launched Integrated Financial 
Management System (IFMS), that 
involved direct Integration of State 
Treasury with Axis Bank Payment 
solution under agreed model of 
Single Nodal Account (SNA), for 
payment to beneficiaries and MIS 
of transaction status for the various 
schemes launched under the Central 
Sponsored Schemes.
Strengthened Our Proposition as 
a Transaction Bank and Gained 
Scale Across Product Segments
One of the big pivots that has also 
happened on the profitability side 
over the last four years is the change 
in fee profile from majorly credit-
linked fees to a more sustainable 
transaction banking fee franchise.
We have invested significantly 
in talent and expertise to build a 
cohesive Transaction Banking and 
Treasury franchise, with focus on 
simplification, innovation and growth. 
During the year, we engaged with 
the customer across their capital 
structure and captured multiple non-
credit revenue streams to become 
their ‘transaction Bank of choice’. 
We won significant mandates across 
current account, cash management, 
trade finance, sector specific smart 
solutions and government businesses 
driven by our technology-led 
offerings. Resultantly, the transaction 
banking, forex and trade-related 
fees constituted 78% of Wholesale 
Banking fees in fiscal 2023, up 
nearly 10 percentage points in last 
four years.
We continued to maintain leadership 
position across products with market 
share of ~31% in IMPS, 20% in the 
Bharat Bill Payment ecosystem and 
11% in foreign LC. During the year, 
we won MeitY's DigiDhan Award 
for on-boarding the highest number 
of billers on BBPS for the third 
consecutive year. We also improved 
our positioning in NEFT from 4th to 
2nd rank with market share of 11% in 
fiscal 2023.
Made Strong Progress Towards 
Becoming Best in Class Digital 
Wholesale Bank
Our path-breaking digital banking 
platform NEO continued to witness 
strong adoption from corporates.  
Our market-leading transaction 
banking API suite and best in class 
corporate developer portal offers 
a strong product market fit with 
1,000+ client engagements since 
launch with 3X y-o-y growth in 
transaction volumes.

Annual Report 2022-23

We continued to maintain leadership position 
across products with market share of ~31% in 
IMPS, 20% in the Bharat Bill Payment ecosystem 
and 11% in foreign LC. During the year, we won 
MeitY's DigiDhan Award for on-boarding the 
highest number of billers on BBPS for the third 
consecutive year.
The efforts put in by teams across 
Wholesale Banking products, Digital 
Banking and IT over the last two 
years to launch innovative banking 
and beyond NEO propositions have 
been widely acknowledged by 
the Industry. During the year, the 
Bank received multiple external 
recognitions including the ‘Best BFSI 
Customer Experience award’ for 
NEO API Banking Suite and the ‘Best 
BFSI MSME Support award’ for NEO 
Connect at the prestigious Dun & 
Bradstreet BFSI & Fintech Summit 
2023. Project NEO also won the 
Asset Triple A Digital Award and ET 
BFSI Excellence Award for Customer 
Engagement Initiative of the year. 
In fiscal 2024, we expect significant 
uptick in customer adoption 
and subsequent monetisation of 
this platform.
We continue to maintain rigour 
around risk management and have 
now expanded ESG risk coverage 
in credit appraisal under our ESG 
Policy for Lending that has been in 
place since fiscal 2016. We are also 
incrementally scaling down exposure 
to carbon-intensive sectors in our 
wholesale lending portfolio. As part 
of our efforts to drive positive climate 
action and achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals, we have 
committed to incremental financing 
of `30,000 crores under Wholesale 
Banking to sectors with positive social 
and environmental outcomes by 
fiscal 2026.
Benign Credit Environment 
and Improvement in Pricing to 
Support Broad Based  
Credit Growth
The corporates have de-levered 
significantly in the last seven years 
and the corporate cash flows continue 
to remain strong. While the banking 
system has not lent to corporates in 
a meaningful way over the last 3 to 5 
years, I believe the new credit growth 
cycle has just started. The overall 
capacity utilisation in manufacturing 
sector has now exceeded the  
long-term averages and there is strong 
demand from companies across sizes 
and sectors.
We witnessed better pricing 
environment in the large corporate 
segment towards the second half of 
the year. The rising yields on corporate 
bonds, and higher interest and 
hedging costs on External Commercial 
Borrowing (ECB) too played a part in 
relatively higher banking sector credit 
to industry. The pricing environment 
remains quite conducive at this point 
for banking industry to be able to 
continue to support credit growth 
across sectors and industries.
The corporates have consolidated their 
banking relationships with top 5-6 
banks in the last few years and we at 
Axis Bank continue to be at the table 
for all the large deals. I remain bullish 
on our ability to push pedal on growth 
in this segment.

Building Future-ready Banking
Dear Shareholders, 
In fiscal 2023, we continued our 
efforts in-line with our GPS (Growth, 
Profitability and Sustainability) 
strategy that aims to make the Bank 
an all-weather franchise, that keeps 
customers at its core and remains 
ahead of the curve when it comes to 
technology. This, we believe will make 
our Bank resilient and future-ready. 
Towards this aim, we invested heavily 
in technology, while leveraging data 
and enabling our people with the right 
tools to serve our customers better. 
Some of our areas of focus include 
building digital capabilities, improving 
the technology framework, leveraging 
advanced analytics, enhancing 
customer experience, increasing 
‘premiumisation’ of the franchise, and 
working to become a corporate citizen 
admired by our stakeholders.
I would like to share with you 
illustrative details on what we are doing 
across focus areas to translate our 
strategy into tangible transformation.
Subrat Mohanty

& Transformation
Message from Management – Operations and Transformation
Building Digital Capabilities 
Our digital strategy is focused on 
reimagining propositions for our retail 
and wholesale customers, along with 
empowering employees to effectively 
engage with them. 
On the retail front, Digital continues 
to be an important acquisition and 
servicing engine for the Bank with a 
share of over 94% in individual financial 
transactions, 67% of term deposits 
and 81% credit cards issued through 
digital/phygital modes. We achieved 
these outcomes through our initiatives 
driving digital-first products and hyper-
personalisation. We are also leveraging 
the tech stacks of agritech and fintech 
companies to serve the retail customer 
in Bharat. 
On the wholesale front, Project NEO 
reflects our ambition to build India’s #1 
digital corporate Bank. We have made 
large investments into this project that 
has begun to show early impact.
On the employee front, we have 
created ‘Siddhi’, the super app that 
empowers Axis employees to engage 
seamlessly with customers. All the 
capabilities required by employees 
are being built into Siddhi and 
progressively rolled out to customer-
facing employees across the Bank.  
So far, Siddhi has led to ~15% 
additional leads generated per day with 
>35% higher lead conversions. 
Improving the Technology 
Framework 
With respect to enhancing the 
technology framework, our key 
priorities have been to achieve faster 
time to market, to widely adopt Agile/ 
DevSecOps, and to invest in the right 
team with the right talent.
In order to improve our speed to 
market, we launched a wide range of 
API banking solutions for our retail and 
corporate customers/partners.  
We remain committed to our 
transformation programme and we 
believe that our continued focus 
on the GPS strategy will enable us 
to achieve sustained, consistent 
performance across business 
lines, while delivering exceptional 
customer experience.
Annual Report 2022-23

Our API suite now has over 400 
APIs out of which 285+ are retail 
banking APIs. 
We are leaders among our peers 
to take the cloud-first approach 
and 75+ applications have already 
been implemented on cloud. The 
DevSecOps Build Farm for Axis is 
capable of handling multi-cloud CI/CD 
(continuous integration and continuous 
deployment) and agile is being 
embedded into the culture of the Bank.
Lastly, one cannot have a strong 
technology backbone without 
appropriate investments in technology 
talent. In line with this, we have 1,750+ 
people dedicated to our technology 
agenda of which 390+ form the 
inhouse Digital Banking team.
Leveraging Advanced Analytics
We have been leveraging our 
strong data analytics capabilities 
across business functions for not 
only improving cross-sell, customer 
experience, risk management 
and collections, but also in fraud 
detection, operational optimisation, 
and budgeting. 
So far, 150+ use cases have been 
deployed across credit, fraud and 
marketing analytics on our cloud 
decisioning platform. We have built 
best-in-class personalisation capability 
(10K+ nudge variants live) and scaled 
up our customer-centric franchise 
through 100+ alternate data features. 
These capabilities have enabled 
us to achieve 79% of the sourcing 
in new cards and 100% portfolio 
exposure increase through a data-
driven strategy.
We have also initiated work to scale up 
universal underwriting using alternate 
data, data science and technology 
for ETB (Existing to Bank), NTB (New 
to Bank) as well as KTB (Known to 
Bank) segments.
Enhancing Customer Experience 
We began the Sparsh journey with the 
aspiration to be ‘India’s most customer-
obsessed Bank, ranked #1 on NPS’. 
To govern this journey, we set up a 
‘Sparsh Board’, with nine senior leaders 
empowered to make the aspiration a 
reality. We have also been developing 
our 91K+ strong staff as ‘delight 
advocates’ and have been creating a 
common understanding of customer 
obsession and a way of life through 
rituals. As part of this programme, 
one of the things we introduced for 
our customers is the Axis Promise, 
a ‘unique to banking’ express 
service guarantee.
We are confident that our journey 
is in the right direction with the last 
year seeing us get more customers as 
promoters, resulting in upto 33 points 
improvement in our Retail NPS.
Increasing ‘Premiumisation’  
of the Franchise
Increasing ‘premiumisation’ has been 
core to our strategy and we have 
taken a major step in that direction 
by acquiring Citibank’s Consumer 
Businesses in India.
The acquisition has strengthened 
Axis Bank’s market position with a 
high-quality credit card portfolio of 
2.0 million cards in force, addition of 
aggregate deposits of H413 billion of 
which 75% is CASA as on March 2023 
and access to a large Wealth & Private 
Banking franchise.
We have also retained a key talent pool 
of ~3,200 Citi consumer employees 
trained in global best practices, 
and an experienced leadership with 
deep domain expertise. We expect 
our customers to experience the 
value of this integration with newer, 
innovative products and world-class 
customer practices.
Working to Become a Corporate 
Citizen Admired by Our 
Stakeholders 
Axis Bank aims to be a corporate 
citizen that is universally admired and 
our ESG programme is key to realising 
this objective. We have made steady 
progress in establishing an ESG culture 
at the Bank and aspire to be an ESG 
leader, both, in India and globally.
To achieve this, we have established 
leadership-driven ESG governance 
through building ownership at the 
business level, ESG oversight at the 
leadership level and making ESG as part 
of the Board level agenda. And with 
these efforts, our ESG performance 
continues to get recognition. We 
are among top 10 constituents of 
MSCI India ESG Leaders Index and 
S&P BSE 100 ESG Index. We also 
featured among FTSE4Good Index 
constituent for the 6th consecutive year 
in 2022 and the Nifty100 ESG Sector 
Leaders Index. 
As an organisation, we remain 
committed to consciously managing 
the environmental footprint of our 
operations and adopting practices that 
maximise resource efficiencies and 
deliver greater customer satisfaction.
We remain committed to our 
transformation programme, and we 
believe that our continued focus on the 
GPS strategy will enable us to achieve 
sustained, consistent performance 
across business lines, while delivering 
exceptional customer experience.

by offering opportunities for small 
farmers, the landless and youth in rural 
and semi-urban areas to improve their 
incomes through agriculture,  
agri-allied work, natural resource 
management, livestock and skill 
development. The programme's vision 
is to create resilient communities with 
self-sustaining ecosystems managed 
by the beneficiaries themselves. 
To achieve this, various entities 
such as NGO partners, government 
departments and community 
institutions are involved in designing 
and implementing initiatives that align 
with the specific requirements and 
aspirations of each community.

We have taken proactive steps to 
develop a robust culture of compliance 
and ethics in the Bank. We have 
implemented polices and frameworks 
such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy, Conflict-of-Interest Policy, 
Whistleblower Policy and Gifts Policy.  
We have focused programmes and 
training sessions covering areas such 
as Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption and 
Anti-Money Laundering to highlight 
our commitment to zero tolerance. Our 
Code of Conduct Policy and training 
programmes encourage employees to 
uphold values of customer centricity, 
team work, ownership, transparency 
and ethics.
Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy 
aims to improve the compliance culture 
within the organisation. The Code of 
Conduct and Ethics Policy outlines the 
accepted standards of behaviour for 
all employees at our Bank, ensuring 
that everyone takes the right course of 
action in their roles. During induction, 
all employees are expected to read and 
sign the policy document. Additionally, 
each year, employees have to read 
the Code and submit a declaration 
statement to HR confirming the same. 
Conflict of Interest Policy
We have implemented a Conflict 
of Interest Policy which aims to 
identify, prevent and manage conflict 
of interest between employees and 
other stakeholders such as customers, 
vendors and business partners of the 
Bank. As a general rule, our employees 
are advised to avoid conducting 
Bank’s business with any relative of 
the employee. The employees are 
expected to act in the best interest of 
the Bank and refrain from engaging 
in transaction(s) where a conflict of 
interest exists and are also encouraged 
to report instances of conflict of 
interest that may become aware of. 
Whistleblower Policy
We follow an open and transparent 
framework which encourages all 
stakeholders to report protected 
disclosures of any suspected or actual 
illegal, unethical or inappropriate 
actions, behaviours or practices 
without fear of retaliation or 
harassment of any kind. The Bank’s 
Whistleblower Committee can be 
contacted for an anonymous complaint 
which contains specific and verifiable 
information with respect to any such 
misdemeanours committed by any 
Bank personnel. 
Staff Accountability
We have implemented a framework 
which makes employees liable for 
violations of Bank’s policies such 
as the Code of Conduct and Ethics 
Policy, Prevention and Sexual 
Harassment Policy, Conflict of 
Interest Policy, Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy. The level of 
severity of the offence is determined 
by the respective Committees and 
penalties commensurate with the 
offence committed are levied on erring 
Bank personnel. 
Information Technology and  
Cybersecurity
We have in place a holistic Information 
and Cybersecurity Programme, 
supported by the Information 
Security Policy, Cybersecurity Policy 
and standards based on industry 
best practices, with compliance to 
regulatory guidelines and in alignment 
to regulatory directives on information 
and cybersecurity.
No customer was affected due 
to any data breach. There are no 
fines/penalties paid in relation to 
information security breaches or 
other cybersecurity incident.
Customer Privacy and  
Data Security
We have enhanced our customer 
privacy trust framework based 
on preparedness for emerging 
regulations such as the Data 
Protection Bill in India. Our 
Privacy Policy was updated in 
2021 and includes key aspects of 
data privacy and security in our 
privacy framework.
Human Rights Policy
We are dedicated to complying with 
internationally accepted human 
rights principles and standards, as 
well as implementing appropriate 
control measures to prevent any 
human right violations in our 
activities. We are guided by the 
Human Rights Policy framed with 
references from key global human 
rights frameworks and principles 
of the UN (United Nations), ILO 
(International Labor Organisation) 
and OECD (Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and 
Development).
Governance

Risk identification and mitigation
RMD, as part of its role, identifies 
risks and uncertainties that are 
faced by the Bank as and when they 
emerge. Material risks within these 
are covered in the various reporting 
frameworks of the RMD vis-à-vis the 
Board and the RMC, including the 
ICAAP and quarterly Risk Dashboards. 
RMD participates in risk mitigation at 
strategic, policy, and operational levels 
and works collaboratively with business 
teams to build consensus and ensure 
ownership of risk in the first line of 
defence (LOD).
Risk culture
We have adopted a two-pronged 
approach for embedding a robust Risk 
& Compliance Culture across all the 
verticals and levels in the Bank. At the 
governance level, the Board of Directors 
and Senior Management act as the anchor 
points of the Risk & Compliance Culture, 
while, at the operational level, the 
Compliance Department and RMD drive 
the culture across the Bank. This is being 
reinforced through an accountability and 
responsibility framework and cascade of 
values across the Bank. 
Risk Management 
Mitigating Risks. Ensuring Stability.
We have 
implemented a robust 
Comprehensive 
Risk Management 
Framework to enhance 
our ability to identify 
and mitigate risks. 
Our Board serves as 
the highest governing 
body responsible for 
overseeing all aspects 
of risk management, 
and they are supported 
by an independent risk 
function.
Risk Governance Framework
At the apex of our three-tier risk 
governance framework is the Board 
and its Committees governing risk 
management. The Risk Management 
Department (RMD), headed by 
the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), takes 
responsibility for implementing and 
driving the policies, procedures, 
and frameworks approved by RM 
and executive risk committees 
of the Bank. In accordance with 
the RBI guidelines, the roles and 
responsibilities of the CRO are 
approved by the Board.  
The CRO reports to the MD & CEO 
of the Bank. Further, RMD has no 
business targets, it participates 
in major decision-making forums, 
and is empowered to form its 
independent views.
Risk Management Approach
The risk management processes are guided by well-defined policies appropriate for 
various risk categories, independent risk oversight, and periodic monitoring through 
the sub-committees of the Board of Directors. Our risk management approach is 
underpinned by four pillars, namely:
Risk philosophy
Our Bank’s risk philosophy states 
that risk management is the collective 
responsibility of all employees. 
When making decisions, regulatory 
compliance and reputation should be 
factored in, as compliance is non-
negotiable and safeguarding reputation 
has equal weight in protecting 
financial losses.
Risk appetite
It is ensured through Risk Appetite 
statement that business decisions are 
in line within approved risk dimensions. 
Risk policies are approved by the Board 
and then cascaded for action by business 
departments. Executive Committees 
lay down specific instructions around 
business decisions to address risk issues. 
New Product/Process or review of the 
same are vetted by Risk Department.

Integrated Approach to  
Managing Risk 
Under our risk management approach, 
the RMD works closely with business 
and operations units in the 1st LOD 
(Line of Defence), compliance and 
finance functions in the 2nd LOD 
and internal audit in the 3rd LOD to 
bring together  a 360-degree view of 
the risks.
One example of this approach is the 
Risk Appetite of the Bank.
Risk Appetite refers to the level and 
type of risk that the bank is willing 
to accept in pursuit of its business 
objective. We have a Risk Appetite 
Statement (RAS) which articulates 
the Bank’s stance on select risks and 
cascades them to the operational units 
i.e., be translated into limits coherently.
RMD monitors and reports adherence 
to RAS limits to the respective 
reporting/approving authorities as part 
of its role as the 2nd LOD.
Key Material Risks 
•	 Credit risk comprises 
traditional default, recovery, 
and concentration risks as well 
as emerging risks like country, 
digital, and fraud risk.  
•	 Trading risk is largely an interest 
rate risk from participation 
in government securities, 
derivatives, and bond markets.
•	 Interest rate risk in the banking 
book is due to mismatch 
between the interest rate 
exposures of its assets 
and liabilities.
•	 Liquidity risk includes risk under 
stress as covered by the LCR 
regulations, structural liquidity, 
and concentration risk. 
•	 Operational risk results from 
inadequate processes/systems 
and human factors. Emerging 
areas include outsourcing, fraud, 
continuity, data privacy, and 
legal risks.
At a Bank level, key material risks 
include strategy and business, 
compliance, regulatory and 
reputation risks.
Citi Consumer Business 
Acquisition: Project Myrtle 
Axis Bank, with the Citi Consumer 
Business acquisition, expanded 
not only the scope and scale of 
business but also the complexity. 
The acquisition posed some key 
risks, including the need to integrate 
systems for customer experience, 
credit monitoring, and regulatory 
reporting, maintain our credit 
standards, and integrate employees.

4.  
Provide the executive summary along with web-link(s) of impact assessment of CSR projects carried out in pursuance 
of sub-rule (3) of rule 8, if applicable:
	
In pursuance of sub-rule (3) of rule 8, impact assessment by a third party was conducted during the year for  one project­ i.e. 
financial literacy program. A summary of the assessment is provided below, and the assessment has been provided on the 
Bank’s website at https://www.axisbank.com/csr/social-responsibility.
	
The program is aimed at promoting financial literacy and raising awareness about health among economically poor women, 
through the use of topical videos, with the training programs available to all women in the locality where they are conducted. 
In fiscal 2021, close to one million women took part in the training sessions. The impact assessment of the project was 
carried out through an extensive survey conducted between January and February, 2023.
	
The survey found that 98% of the women participants who had seen the modules on financial Iiteracy under  the program 
remembered having watched it, compared to only 5% of  the  respondents in the  control group who  had attended any 
training program on financial literacy. The video had a positive impact on the participants’ attitude, with 88% stating that 
they thought financial planning, saving and investing are important to meet the long-term goals of their family as compared 
to 68%  of the respondents in the  control group. Additionally, 75% of the participants have  stated  that they  track their 
household incomes and expenditures as compared to 36% of the control group respondents.
	
A significantly higher  proportion of  participants at 55% have  stated that they  have  obtained the  services of  business 
correspondents (Bank Sakhis) as compared to 35% of the  control group respondents. The participants group  had 23% of 
respondents investing in fixed  deposits compared to 14% in the  control group, and  26% investing in recurring deposits

Policy) Rules, 2014]

compared  to 14% in the control  group. Furthermore, 28% of the  participant group invested  in long term  schemes of 
insurance companies, while  only 2% of the control  group  did so. 23% of the participant group respondents invested in 
livestock as compared to 16% in the control group. 12% of the participants group invested in land or gold compared to 1% 
in the control group.
	
Among the participants, 74% had some form of health insurance as against 60% among the control group respondents. 
48% of the participants had some form of life insurance (apart from credit life insurance) compared to only 24% of the 
control group respondents. Additionally, 35% of participants had applied for a microenterprise loan as compared to 23% 
of the control group respondents.
	
An important observation from  both the surveys and the field discussions is that while  delivering social messages using 
video as a medium appears intuitive, it has not been widely used for the purpose of spreading financial literacy. The evidence 
in this research suggests that good quality videos can indeed be effective for spreading financial literacy.
	
In addition to the financial literacy video, participants were shown video on covid-19 and sanitation, with 94% 
participants having a high recall. Additionally, participants had a high recall of messages related to sanitation related to 
food and cooking.
	
Overall,  the  program  appears  to  have been  successful in increasing  financial  literacy  and health  awareness  among 
women participants.

(b)	
Cloud adoption: The Bank is the first amongst peers to create 3 cloud landing zones (AWS, Azure and GCP) to support 
its multi-cloud strategy and has an architectural cloud-first, cloud-native approach. The rapid pace of cloud adoption, 
driven by a dedicated cloud COE, has helped the Bank to drive business innovation at a faster pace. Using automation 
and SOPs, the Bank reduced its infrastructure provisioning TAT by approximately 90% compared to comparable on-
premises solutions. With 100+ containerized environments and 2,700+ virtual machines, the Bank has been able to 
run its core applications in any environment from a private data centre to the public cloud. The Bank has 76 critical 
applications on cloud as on 31 March, 2023 and is targeting to take 70% of its applications on cloud by 2025.

and gained leadership position in UPI payer PSP category. Additionally, Hollowing-the-Core initiatives are undertaken 
on areas such as general ledger, lending, inquiring, BNPL, and account opening to increase capacity and improve 
performance of the core systems.
	
(e)	
Emerging technologies: The Bank continues to build capabilities in emerging technologies of AI, ML, automation, 
and data analytics. The Bank has 2990+ RPA bots in action and 1440+ automated processes, and is targeting best in 
class efficiency for RPA, voice, and IOCR. During the year, the Bank continued to introduce, and scale new products 
driven by its zero-based redesign philosophy. The redesigned customer centric journeys enable minimum to no data 
entry with automated underwriting.
	
(f)	
Infrastructure resiliency: The Bank has two primary data centres located in Mumbai (co-located) and Bengaluru 
(owned). Both data centres have n+1 redundant architecture for power and cooling distribution. Business applications 
are strategically spread between the two data centres for active setup at one DC and resiliency at other DC. Both 
data centres are located in different seismic zones and are connected through a redundant wide-area network 
which is connected to all branches and office locations. Additionally, the Bank has set up a refreshed near disaster 
recovery (DR) for critical applications with improved Infra availability at 99.99% at its data center in Bengaluru. The

its strong positioning in the UPI space with a market share of 17% as payer payment service providers (PSP) (by 
volume) and approximately 11% in UPI person-to-merchant (P2M) acquiring (by throughput). The Bank has 553 
million cumulative virtual payment address (VPA) base and caters to approximately 50 lakh merchant transactions 
per day on its stack. The Bank was the first bank to hollow the core for elite merchants on UPI and its dedicated IT 
cloud infrastructure to exclusively handle high volume UPI transactions resulting in the Bank achieving one of the 
lowest decline rates as a remitter when compared to peer banks. In fiscal 2023, the Bank added UPI capabilities for 
international transactions and UPI foreign inward remittances ( FIR ), e-Rupi – V2.0, and NPS D-remit via UPI PFRDA.

enhance its core infrastructure and applications to cater to increasing volumes. 
	
(j)	
Core upgrades: The Bank continues to refresh its core applications and upgrades to latest software. Some of the key 
platform upgrades done in fiscal 2023 are: FinnOne, CRM 7.2, Tallyman Upgrade, and OFSAA Upgrade – Phase I & II. 
Additionally, the Bank is migrating from Enterprise Payments Hub (EPH) to Global Payment System (GPS). 
	
(k)	
Cyber security: The Bank is committed to the highest standards of data security and privacy and continues to 
invest to enhance its capabilities. The Bank follows a holistic cyber security program with a comprehensive cyber 
security policy and standards based on industry best practices in compliance with regulatory guidelines. The Bank 
has deployed its cyber security structure and framework based on National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Board’s Report
102

Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. The Bank is compliant to ISO27001 and PCIDSS standards, and 
the Bank has recently acquired ISO27017 cloud security certification for its AWS and Azure cloud, which is a first 
in the Indian Banking sector and demonstrates an enhanced cyber security resilience and security controls on the 
Bank’s cloud assets.
	
	
The Bank has a 24x7 security operations centre and cyber security operations system. 100% of the digital products 
of the Bank are under Dark Net / Deep Web monitoring. The Bank has a Bitsight rating of 800 out of 900 indicating a 
well-controlled internet facing security posture. The Bank’s current Bitsight score is higher than 90% of the banking

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Macro-economic Environment
Fiscal 2023 turned out to be an intensely volatile year, characterised by extreme uncertainty. The year started with continuing 
disruptions in supply chains, shipping and transport, aggravated by China’s Zero Covid Policy. The outbreak of hostilities in Europe 
inter alia caused a massive surge in energy and commodities prices. This combined with the pandemic caused supply shocks and 
resulted in a surge in inflation in developed markets, which they had not experienced over the past 40 years. The major global 
central banks had to respond with synchronised, aggressive, front-loaded policy rate hikes. This resulted in heightened volatility 
in global financial markets and tightened financial and credit conditions, inevitably spilling over into emerging markets.
India has largely weathered this economic storm, its macroeconomic fundamentals surprisingly resilient. India’s fiscal 2023 real 
GDP growth is officially forecast to be 7.0% YOY. However, the channels of transmission of global shocks via commodities prices 
and exchange rates had resulted in high and persistent inflation, which compelled the Monetary Policy Committee to start raising 
the policy repo rate early in fiscal 2023. Policy repo rate increased by 250 bps in fiscal 2023.
One of the striking developments over the course of fiscal 2023 was a divergence between high bank credit growth (15.4% YOY) 
and a more muted deposits accretion (9.6% YOY). The high credit offtake resulted largely from retail and services sector loans, 
but has been robust across all segments, with a mix of both term loans and working capital. The more muted deposits growth was 
mainly due to draining of the surplus system liquidity injected by RBI during the pandemic. 
Prospects for fiscal 2024
RBI forecasts India’s growth to moderate in fiscal 2024 to 6.5%. The IMF has slightly lowered its 2023 growth forecast, and global 
trade in goods and services is likely to further slow, both as the result of the monetary policy efforts to cool inflation with high 
interest rates. However, the G-10 central banks appear to be approaching the peaks of their respective hike cycles, and this will 
have a beneficial impact on the Rupee.
Overall, while merchandise growth is likely to slow – as has already been seen with an exports contraction in Q4 of fiscal 
2023, services exports have remained robust. This, together with very high remittance inflows, had resulted in a manageable 
Current Account Deficit – expected at 2.4% of GDP in fiscal 2023, and this is forecast to moderate even further in fiscal 2024. 
Consequently, we expect net Balance of Payments to turn surplus, which will further help a stable Rupee, while allowing RBI to 
replenish its foreign exchange reserves. Inflation is also projected to moderate steadily, with RBI expecting CPI inflation to average 
5.1% (down from 6.6% in fiscal 2023). Overall, India’s macroeconomics fundamentals remain robust, and is acknowledged to have 
become a bright spot in an uncertain global environment. While risks to the growth inflation balance still remain, the ongoing 
structural reforms and economic resilience will help to buffer India’s economy from potential shocks.
The Union government’s ongoing focus on capital expenditure will help to gradually crowd in private sector investment. However, 
in line with the slowdown in the broader economy, bank credit growth is likely to moderate in the year ahead, with the divergence 
between credit and deposit growth coming down. Deposit growth is likely to shade up slightly, with higher interest rates as an 
incentive, and with an expected improvement in system liquidity conditions in the second half of the year.
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Acquisition of Citibank India consumer Business
The Bank has acquired on a going concern basis the business assets and business liabilities of Citibank’s India Consumer Business 
from Citibank N.A. (acting through its branch in India) (“CBNA”) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) 
Limited (“CFIL”) collectively referred to as Citi India Consumer Business, effective beginning of day 1 March, 2023 (referred to as 
Legal Day One) without values being assigned to individual assets and liabilities.
The transaction comprises the sale of the consumer businesses of Citibank India, which includes loans, credit cards, wealth 
management, commercial vehicle, construction equipment loans and retail banking operations. The acquisition provides the 
Bank with access to a premium customer segment, is a good strategic fit and is completely aligned with Axis Bank’s GPS 
(Growth, Profitability & Sustainability) strategy. The Bank has gained access to the large, affluent and profitable customer 
franchise of Citibank, which aligns well with its Premiumization strategy.
In accordance with the Business Transfer Agreements (BTAs), the Bank has on Legal Day One paid an Estimated Adjusted 
Purchase Price aggregating `11,602.53 crores based on the position of business assets and business liabilities acquired as at 
end of day January 31, 2023, and the Bank without prejudice to any of its rights under the said BTAs estimates a further payable

of `346.55 crores as Purchase Price True Up Amount based on its best estimate of the position of business assets and business 
liabilities acquired as at beginning of day March 1, 2023. The Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and estimated Purchase Price 
True Up Amount aggregating to `11,949.08 crores are attributable to (i) various intangible business and commercial rights viz. 
Customer relationship (including contracts), Co-branding arrangements, Business processes/ information, Non-compete rights 
(collectively “Intangibles”) and (ii) Goodwill pertaining to the Citibank India Consumer Business.  Based on the report of an 
independent valuer, Intangibles (excluding Goodwill) were recognized at `8,714.24 crores and Goodwill at `3,234.84 crores in 
the financial statements of the Bank. As a prudent measure and to protect its ability to pay dividends, the Bank has fully amortised 
the said Intangibles and Goodwill through the Profit and Loss account in fiscal 2023.

NII constituted 72% of the operating revenue and increased by 30% from `33,132 crores in fiscal 2022 to `42,946 crores in fiscal 
2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in yield on assets by 90 bps and a lower increase in cost of funds of 42 bps. As 
a result the NIM improved 55 bps on a year on year basis to 4.02% in fiscal 2023.
During this period, the yield on interest earning assets increased from 7.06% in fiscal 2022 to 7.96% in fiscal 2023, due to rising 
interest rate environment, pricing discipline and mix change undertaken by the Bank. The yield on advances increased by 97 bps 
from 8.03% in fiscal 2022 to 9.00% in fiscal 2023. 68% of the loans of the Bank are floating rate loans, linked to external/internal 
benchmark rates. RBI increased the repo rate from 4.00% in fiscal 2022 to 6.50% in fiscal 2023 which led to an increase in the 
lending rates. The yield on investments also increased by 21 bps during fiscal 2023.
The increase in benchmark rates has also led to tightening in the liquidity conditions and consequently cost of funds for the 
banking industry also increased. However, the increase in cost of funds has been slower as compared to the increase in yield on 
assets, partially due to timing difference in repricing of deposits, resulting in strong growth in NII in fiscal 2023 for the Bank.
Cost of funds increased by 42 bps from 3.86% in fiscal 2022 to 4.28% in fiscal 2023. The Bank continued its focus on both CASA 
plus Retail Term Deposits (RTD) as part of its overall deposit growth strategy. Cost of deposits increased to 3.94% from 3.68% last 
year mainly due to increase in funding cost of term deposits. Daily average CASA ratio as a proportion to deposits improved by 66 
bps in fiscal 2023 to 43.57% from 42.91% in fiscal 2022 which also partly aided in containing the pace of growth of cost of deposits.
Performance against the drivers for the NIM improvement journey of the Bank in fiscal 2023 is as follows:
•	
Improvement in Balance sheet mix: loans and investments comprised 86% of total assets as at the end of fiscal 2023, 
improving 242 bps YOY;
•	
INR denominated loans comprised 95% of total advances at the end of fiscal 2023, improving 340 bps YOY;
•	
Retail and CBG advances comprised 69% of total advances at March 2023, improving 150 bps YOY; 
•	
Balance outstanding in low-yielding priority sector shortfall deposits declined by `11,089 crores YOY with priority sector 
short fall deposits comprising 2.3% of total assets at 31 March, 2023 as compared to 3.5% at 31 March, 2022;
•	
Composition of liabilities measured through average CASA% improved 66 bps YOY.
Reported NII included a one-time interest recovery on restructuring of an existing NPA account aggregating to `149 crores.
The Bank also earned interest on income tax refund of `85 crores in fiscal 2023 as compared to `17 crores in fiscal 2022. The 
receipt, amount and timing of such income depends on the nature and determinations by tax authorities and is hence neither 
consistent nor predictable.

Retail Banking fees constituted 68% of the total fee income of the Bank in fiscal 2023 and grew strongly at 33% on a year on 
year basis. Fees from retail cards grew 51% on a year on year basis in fiscal 2023 while retail non-card fees registered a strong 
growth of  23%.
Fee income derived from the Wholesale Bank group accounted for 28% of the Bank’s total fee income for fiscal 2023 as against 
32% in fiscal 2022. Within Wholesale Banking, granular transaction banking fees grew 24% on a year on year basis. Fee income 
from the Bank’s CBG (Commercial Banking Group) that lends to small and medium enterprises accounted for 4% of the Bank’s 
total fee income for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
During the year, trading profits without considering impact of provision for depreciation decreased by 74% to `353 crores from 
`1,363 crores last year mainly on account of lower profits on the SLR portfolio in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, impacted 
by the rising interest rate environment. Provision for depreciation in value of investments was `596 crores in fiscal 2023 mainly 
on account of Mark-to-Market (MTM) losses recognized on the corporate bond portfolio due to rate movements, as compared to 
a write-back in provision of `264 crores in fiscal 2022. The Bank does not expect an economic loss on the corporate bond book. 
84% of the standard corporate bond book is rated AA+ and above and 99% is rated A- and above.
The Bank’s miscellaneous income in fiscal 2023 stood at `527 crores compared to `593 crores in fiscal 2022, comprising mainly 
income from sale of Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLC) amounting to `173 crores in fiscal 2023 and income from display 
of publicity material amounting to `243 crores.
Operating revenue
The operating revenue of the Bank increased by 23% to `59,447 crores from `48,353 crores last year. The core income streams 
(NII and fees) constituted ~100% of the operating revenue, reflecting the stability of the Bank’s earnings.

YOY growth rate in operating expenses moderated to 16% in 
fiscal 2023 as compared to 28% in fiscal 2022 with  operating 
expenses increasing to `27,398 crores from `23,611 crores last 
year. The Bank continued to invest in technology and human 
capital for supporting the existing and new businesses.
38% of total cost increase was on account of investments in 
technology and future growth, 22% of the total cost increase 
was volume linked, 6% of the total cost increase on account 
of integration expenses and balance 34% was business as 
usual expenses.
Staff cost increased by 16% from `7,613 crores in fiscal 2022 to `8,797 crores in fiscal 2023, primarily due to annual wage revision 
and a 7% increase in employee strength during fiscal 2023 from 85,815 as at end of fiscal 2022 to 91,898 as at the end of fiscal 
2023. Further,  it is pertinent to note that the staff cost includes only one month expenses relating to 3,200+ employees who have 
joined the Bank on 1 March, 2023 as part of the acquisition of the Citibank India Consumer Business.
Other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased by 16% from `14,990 crores in fiscal 2022 to `17,456 crores in 
fiscal 2023. The increase is primarily due to increase in volume linked costs coming from rising business volumes, investments in 
technology to support future business growth, higher collection expenses and integration expenses relating to acquisition of Citi 
India consumer business.
Operating expenses pursuant to the transitional services agreement and other integration expenses to be incurred by the Bank 
for acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business will be recognised in the profit and loss account over the period in which the 
services will be received.  The current best estimate of the transitional period is 18 months commencing from 1 March, 2023

and current best estimate of the transitional costs and integration expenses is ~ `2,000 crores.  During fiscal 2023, the Bank has 
recognised integration expenses of `217 crores.
The Operating Expenses to Assets ratio increased to 2.25%, higher by 8 bps compared to 2.17% last year. It is again important to 
note that Citibank acquisition is a pure play retail business which runs at higher operating expenses to assets ratio.  The Operating 
Expenses to Assets ratio for fiscal 2023 does not fully reflect this, as the business was owned by the Bank for one month.  The 
Bank remains committed to consciously invest in its focus business segments. The lower credit cost over the past few quarters has 
provided some headroom to run operating costs at a slightly elevated level.
Operating profit
During the year, the operating profit of the Bank (excluding exceptional items) increased by 30% to `32,048 crores from 
`24,742 crores last year on account of strong growth in operating revenues and partially offset by a moderated growth in 
operating expenses.

During fiscal 2023, provisions (other than provisions for tax) declined 64% YOY to `2,653 crores from `7,360 crores last year. Key 
items of provisions are explained below -
Provisions for NPAs:
The Bank provided `6,025 crores towards non-performing assets compared to `7,549 crores last year. The decrease in provision 
for non-performing assets is primarily on account of lower net slippages at `3,680 crores in fiscal 2023 as compared to `5,760 
crores in fiscal 2022. 
Recoveries from written off accounts:
The Bank’s recoveries from written off accounts in fiscal 2023 increased 22% YOY to `2,885 crores from `2,367 crores 
in fiscal 2022.
Provisions for standard assets:
The Bank provided `452 crores for standard assets including unhedged foreign currency exposure compared to `126 
crores last year.  
•	
During the year, the Bank made a provision for standard assets of `418 crores as against a provision of `188 crores made in 
fiscal 2022. The increase in standard asset provision is largely on account of book growth.
•	
Further, during the year the Bank had created provision of `34 crores as against a write back of `62 crores made in fiscal 
2022 for unhedged foreign currency exposure.
Provision for other contingencies:
Provisions for other contingencies for fiscal 2023 had a write-back of  `913 crores as compared to incremental provision of `2,032 
crores in fiscal 2022. The reduction is mainly on account of following–
•	
During fiscal 2023, there was a write-back of `599 crores in provision for COVID-19 and MSME restructuring mainly on 
account of slippages and recoveries. As against the same, there was a provision of `912 crores made in fiscal 2022 upon 
implementation of restructuring under these schemes.
•	
Further, during fiscal 2023, there has also been a reversal in provision for delay in implementation of resolution plan of `180 
crores, pursuant to implementation of resolution plan in certain accounts and slippage of certain accounts to NPA.
•	
Provision for other contingencies in fiscal 2023 also comprised provision on probable legal cases amounting to `47 crores. 
As compared to the same, provision for probable legal cases amounted to `215 crores in fiscal 2022.
The Bank has not utilised during the year and continues to hold provisions of `5,012 crores as at 31 March, 2023 against the 
potential impact of COVID-19.

Amortisation of Intangibles and Goodwill
The Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and estimated Purchase Price True Up Amount aggregating to `11,949.08 crores for 
acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business are attributable to (i) various intangible business and commercial rights viz. 
Customer relationship (including contracts), Co-branding arrangements, Business processes/ information, Non-compete rights 
(collectively “Intangibles”) and (ii) Goodwill pertaining to the Citibank India Consumer Business.  Based on the report of an 
independent valuer, Intangibles (excluding Goodwill) were recognized at `8,714.24 crores and Goodwill at `3,234.84 crores in 
the financial statements of the Bank. As a prudent measure and to protect its ability to pay dividends, the Bank has fully amortised 
the said Intangibles and Goodwill through the Profit and Loss account in fiscal 2023, though the Bank continues to have access 
to the business use for the intangibles.
Impact of harmonisation of policies recognised in provisions and contingencies
During fiscal 2023, the Bank made a one-time provision of `232.14 crores mainly arising from non-recurring impact of day 1 
cross NPA slippages from acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business and harmonisation of provisioning policies on portfolio 
acquired from Citibank India Consumer Business. The same has been recognised under provisions and contingencies in the Profit 
and Loss Account for fiscal 2023.
One-time acquisition cost and impact of harmonisation of policies recognised in operating expenses
The Bank has recognised `129.33 crores arising from impact of harmonisation of various accounting policies and estimates 
relating to operating expenses for Citibank India Consumer Business.  The Bank has also recognised  `179.27 crores relating to 
stamp duty and registration cost in relation with acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business as one-time acquisition cost. 
The aforementioned expenses are recognised under operating expenses in the Profit and Loss Account for fiscal 2023.
Provision for tax
Provision for tax for fiscal 2023 stood at `7,326 crores as compared to `4,357 crores for last year. The Bank has chosen not to 
create deferred tax asset on intangibles acquired during the year which were fully amortised through the Profit & Loss Account. 
Further the current tax expense for the year is also higher on account of non-deductibility of goodwill. These have mainly led to 
the increase in provision for tax for the fiscal 2023. The effective rate of tax during fiscal 2023 was 43.34%.
Net profit
Net profit excluding exceptional items for the year ended 31 March, 2023 increased strongly by 68% YOY to `21,933 crores 
as compared to the net profit of `13,025 crores last year. Net profit for the year ended 31 March, 2023 after exceptional items 
declined and stood at `9,580 crores.
Asset Quality Parameters
The asset quality metrics continued to improve during the fiscal, with reduction in NPA ratios year on year. The Bank added 
`14,249 crores to Gross NPAs during the year with the ratio of Gross NPAs to gross customer assets declining to 2.02%, at the 
end of March 2023 from 2.82% as at end of March 2022. The Bank added `3,680 crores to Net NPAs after adjusting for recoveries 
and upgradations of `3969 crores and `6,601 crores respectively and the Bank’s Net NPA ratio (Net NPAs as percentage of net 
customer assets) decreased to 0.39 % from 0.73%. The Bank’s provision coverage ratio excluding prudential write-offs increased 
further during the fiscal and stood at 81%. The Bank’s accumulated prudential write-off pool stood at `38,015 crores as at end 
of fiscal 2023.
Statutory Reports

During the fiscal, the quantum of low rated pool of BB and 
below accounts (excluding investments and non-fund based 
exposure) decreased and stood at `3,478 crores as compared 
to `5,778 crores at the end of fiscal 2022. The aggregate 
outstanding in low rated pool of BB and below investments 
and non-fund based accounts was `673 crores and `1,371 
crores respectively as at the end of March 2023.
The fund based outstanding of standard loans under COVID 
-19 resolution scheme at 31 March, 2023 stood at `2,047 
crores or ~ 0.22% of gross customer assets. The linked non 
fund based outstanding for which there has been no change in 
original terms stood at `925 crores. Linked non-restructured 
fund based outstanding stood at `186 crores. Outstanding 
restructured loans under the MSME scheme stood at `454 
crores. The Bank holds a provision of `812 crores on these 
restructured assets.

key initiatives undertaken by the Bank is visible and we continue to invest in these bank-wide transformation initiatives whose

agriculture productivity and integration of the country through both physical and digital infrastructure. Agriculture, the backbone 
of the RuSu markets, is also witnessing tailwinds backed by higher adoption of technology, better use of data,  efficient delivery of 
government schemes to boost farmer’s income, penetration of alternate distribution such as CSC in deeper markets and the rise 
of Agritech companies. These structural changes are accelerating demand for financial services, giving the Bank an opportunity 
to deliver at scale, profitably in the RuSu markets.

Customer Experience and Transformation (CXT)
With a vision to become India’s most customer-centric bank, the Bank is committed to deliver world-class customer experiences 
by intervening across four interrelated layers – listening to customers, optimizing all customer journeys, enabling employees to 
engage with customers, and transforming the core operations supporting all customer experiences.
A. 	
Listening to customers:  The Bank’s Voice of Customer program is designed on the three pillars of “Listen”, “Learn”, and “Act”. 
In fiscal 2023, we launched a customer feedback management platform which enabled us to send and monitor feedback in 
real time, ensuring the learnings from customer feedback is embedded within the Bank, raising the bar by challenging what 
is perceived as the norm, and delivering delight through our customer conversations.
	
Listen: As a part of the Voice of customer program, we now cover journeys that encompass all critical lines of business in 
retail and wholesale banking. A well-established metric, Net Promoter Score is used to track and measure the success of 
enhancements made for products and services.
	
Learn: Through artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Bank continues to enhance its ability to extract insights by 
analysing all forms of written and verbal customer feedback.
	
Act: Drawing on these insights, actions are triggered to allow near real time response by relevant colleagues to customers 
providing feedback – this is tracked and reported at all levels of disaggregation, down to every individual.
B.	
Optimising all customer journeys: The Bank continues to delight customers by re-crafting all key onboarding and servicing 
journeys at every touchpoint. Multiple customer journeys across the Bank have been reimagined using customer feedback, 
disruptive technology and deep insights. We continue to see positive results - digital onboarding of merchants via an

on document simplification for Large corporates by rationalising the sanction letter length.
C.	
Enabling employees to engage with customers:  Providing a great customer experience requires empowering, motivated 
colleagues with the time and capability to engage in deep, meaningful conversations with customers.
	
For example, the Bank has completely digitised the way of working for frontline employees through analytics driven, mobility 
app. This platform has key features such as customer 360 view, simplified product journeys, action-oriented analysis of 
entire portfolio, contextual nudges continuously optimised through machine learning. This platform is live for Premium 
Banking frontline employees and at different stages of implementation for other business functions within the Bank.
	
The Bank has freed up employees’ time by eliminating operational activities and digitising key processes. Wholesale Banking 
Relationship Managers and branch colleagues, for instance, now have additional time to spend understanding their clients’ 
needs and designing and delivering the right solutions
D. 	
Transforming core operations that support all customer experiences: The Bank continues its journey to transform core 
operations this year through a digital-first approach by incorporating emerging and trending technologies into its core 
operations. Leveraging intelligent automation (Robotic Process Automation, Intelligent Optical Character Recognition), 
analytics (e.g. route optimisation for cash handling) and digitisation in addition to core simplification and process re-
engineering, processes continue to become more efficient, effective and scalable.
	
As a means of scaling up further, the Bank will use Cognitive Bots to make decisions and reduce processing times, Intelligent 
Document Processing for unstructured documents for a paperless environment along with conversational AI for risk-free 
& effective customer communication.

monitored and governed in order to build mass movement and focused efforts have been taken for large channels like Branches, 
Relationship Managers and Inbound voice channel.
The Bank continues to strengthen and build more granular measurements of the critical metrics which captures customer voices, 
like NPS (Net Promoter Scores), complaints, social media sentiments and various operational process efficiency metrics. NPS is 
measured for all important journeys of the Bank. Under Sparsh framework, efforts are being taken to fix hygiene and also build

RISK
The Bank continues to focus on strengthening the risk management capabilities by working on six dimensions – comprehensive 
coverage of risks, enhance models for measuring and monitoring risk, driving actioning to address risks, building technology and 
data capabilities, strengthening the people front and building a robust risk culture.
Statutory Reports
127
The risk management objective of the Bank is to balance the trade-off between risk and return and ensure that the Bank 
operates within the Board approved Risk Appetite Statement. An independent risk management function ensures that the risk is 
managed through a risk management architecture composed of policies approved by the Board of Directors and an independent 
identification, measurement and management of risks across the various businesses of the Bank.  The Bank’s risk management 
function strives to proactively anticipate vulnerabilities at the transaction as well as at the portfolio level, through quantitative or 
qualitative examination of the embedded risks.
The Bank continues to focus on refining and improving its risk measurement systems including automation of processes, not only 
to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, but also to ensure better risk-adjusted return and optimal capital utilisation. 
The Board reviews the risk profile of the Bank at periodic intervals and ensures that risk levels are within the defined risk appetite.
Risk Governance 
The Board is the Apex Governance body on all matters of risk management. The Board of Directors exercises its oversight over 
risk management both directly and through its Committees, namely the Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee of 
the Board, the Special Committee on Large Value Frauds and the IT & Digital Strategy Committee.
Executive Risk committees are constituted to look at specific areas of risk and are mandated by the Risk Management Committee of 
the Bank. These are: Credit Risk Management Committee (CRMC), Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO), Operational 
Risk Management Committee (ORMC), Information Systems Security Committee (ISSC), Central Outsourcing Committee (COC), 
BCP & Crisis Management Committee (BCPMC), Apex Committee and Subsidiary Management Committee (SMC).
Risk Architecture
The overall risk appetite and philosophy of the Bank is defined by its Board of Directors. The Risk Appetite framework provides 
guidance to the management on the desired level of risk for various types of risks in the long term and helps steer critical 
portfolio decisions.
Further, the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) of the Bank assesses all the significant risks associated with 
various businesses.
The independent risk management structure within the Bank is responsible for managing the credit risk, market risk, liquidity 
risk, operational risk, other Pillar II risks like reputational risk and strategic risk and exercising oversight on risks associated with 
subsidiaries. The risk management processes are guided by well-defined policies appropriate for the various risk categories 
supplemented by periodic validations of the methods used and monitoring through the sub-committees of the Board.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer, borrower, issuer of securities that the Bank holds, or any other counterparty 
fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises from all transactions that give rise to actual, contingent, or potential 
claims against any counterparty, customer, borrower or obligor. The goal of credit risk management is to maintain asset quality 
and concentrations at individual exposures as well as at the portfolio level.
Internal rating forms the core of the risk management process for wholesale lending businesses with internal ratings determining 
the acceptability of risk, maximum exposure ceiling, sanctioning authority, pricing decisions and review frequency. For the retail 
portfolio including small businesses and small agriculture borrowers, the Bank uses different product-specific scorecards. Credit 
models used for risk estimation are assessed for their discriminatory power, calibration accuracy and stability independently by 
a validation team.
Both credit and market risk expertise are combined to manage risks arising out of traded credit products such as bonds and 
market related off-balance sheet transactions.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of losses in ‘on and off-balance sheet’ positions arising from the movements in market price as well as the 
volatilities of those changes, which may impact the Bank’s earnings and capital. The risk may pertain to interest rate related 
instruments (interest rate risk), equities (equity price risk) and foreign exchange rate risk (currency risk). Market risk for the Bank 
emanates from its trading and investment activities, which are undertaken both for the customers and on a proprietary basis. The 
Bank adopts a comprehensive approach to market risk management for its banking book as well as its trading book for both its 
domestic and overseas operations. The market risk management framework of the Bank covers inputs regarding the extent of 
market risk exposures, the performance of portfolios vis-à-vis the market risk limits and comparable benchmarks which provide 
guidance to the business in optimizing the risk-adjusted rate of return of the Bank’s trading and investment portfolio.
Market risk management is guided by clearly laid down policies, guidelines, processes and systems for the identification, 
measurement, monitoring and reporting of exposures against various risk limits set in accordance with the risk appetite of the Bank. 
Annual Report 2022-23
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Annual Report 2022-23
Risk Department independently monitors the Bank’s investment and trading portfolio in terms of risk limits stipulated in the Market 
Risk Management Policy and board approved Market Risk Appetite and reports deviations, if any, to the appropriate authorities as 
laid down in the policy and in the Risk Appetite Statement. The Bank utilises both statistical as well as non-statistical measures for the 
market risk management of its trading and investment portfolios. The statistical measures include Value at Risk (VaR), stress tests, 
back tests and scenario analysis while position limits, marked-to-market (MTM), stop-loss limits, trigger limits, gaps and sensitivities 
(duration, PVBP, option greeks) are used as non-statistical measures of market risk management.
The Bank follows a historical simulation approach to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) with a 99% confidence level for a one-day holding 
period in a time horizon of 250 days. VaR models for different portfolios are back tested on an ongoing basis and the results are used 
to maintain and improve the efficacy of the model. VaR measurements are supplemented with a series of stress tests and sensitivity 
analyses as per a well laid out stress testing framework.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity is a bank’s capacity to fund increase in assets and meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral obligations 
at a reasonable cost and without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk is the inability of a bank to meet such obligations as 
they become due, without adversely affecting the bank’s financial condition.
The Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy of the Bank stipulates a broad framework for liquidity risk management to ensure 
that the Bank is in a position to meet its liquidity obligations as well as to withstand a period of liquidity stress from bank-level 
factors, market-wide factors or a combination of both. The ALM policy captures the liquidity risk appetite of the Bank and related 
governance structures as defined in the Risk Appetite Statement. The ALM policy is supplemented by other liquidity policies 
relating to intraday liquidity, stress testing, contingency funding plan and liquidity policies for each of the overseas branches.
The liquidity profile of the Bank is monitored for both domestic as well as overseas operations on a static as well as on a dynamic 
basis by using the gap analysis technique supplemented by monitoring of key liquidity ratios and conduct of liquidity stress tests 
periodically.  Periodical liquidity positions and liquidity stress results are reviewed by the Bank’s ALCO and the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board.
The Bank has integrated into its asset liability management framework the liquidity risk management guidelines issued by 
RBI pursuant to the Basel III framework on liquidity standards. These include the intraday liquidity management and the 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The Bank maintains LCR /NSFR in accordance with the RBI guidelines and the defined risk 
appetite of the Bank.
Operational Risk
Operational risks may emanate from inadequate and/or missing controls in internal processes, people and systems or from 
external events or a combination of all the four. The Bank has in place an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy to manage 
the operational risk in an effective, efficient and proactive manner. The policy aims at assessing and measuring the magnitude of 
risks, monitoring and mitigating them through a well-defined framework and governance structure.
All new products and processes, as well as changes in existing products and processes are subjected to risk evaluation by the 
Operational Risk team. The overall responsibility of new products is vested with the Risk Department through the Bank’s Product 
Management Committee and Change Management Committee. Outsourcing arrangements are examined and approved by the 
Bank’s Outsourcing Committee after due recommendations from the Operational Risk team. The Information System Security 
Committee of the Bank provides directions for mitigating operational risk in the information systems. The Bank has set up a 
comprehensive Operational Risk Measurement System for documenting, assessing, and periodic monitoring of various risks 
and controls linked to various processes across all business lines.  Over the year, the Bank has focused on strengthening the 
operational and information security risk frameworks by implementing several initiatives.
Business Continuity Plan
The Business Continuity Planning Management Committee (BCPMC) exercises oversight on the implementation of the approved 
Business Continuity Plan (BCP) framework which has been put in place to ensure continuity of service to its large customer base. 
The effectiveness of the approved Business Continuity Plan (BCP) framework is tested for all identified critical internal activities 
to ensure readiness to meet various contingency scenarios. The learning from the BCP exercises are used as inputs to further 
refine the framework. With effective Business Continuity Plan in place, the Bank has effectively managed to run its operations by 
adapting to various continuity / mitigation plans. 
Information and Cyber Security Risks
The Bank pursues a holistic Information and cyber security program with a comprehensive Information Security policy, 
Cyber Security policy and standards based on industry best practices with compliance to regulatory guidelines. These 
policies are aligned with the regulatory directives on Information and Cyber security and with global best practices like NIST, 
ISO27001:2013, PCI DSS etc.
Statutory Reports

The governance framework is in place at executive level with Information System Security Committee constituting key business 
functions meeting at least once in a quarter to assess the threat landscape and validate the controls enforced in the Bank 
commensurate with the cyber risks.
The Bank has invested in strong technical and administrative controls to proactively prevent, detect and contain and respond any 
suspicious activity. Bank is compliant to ISO27001 standard and PCI DSS standard. The Bank conducts various assessment to 
identify and remediate risks before any application and/or IT infrastructure component is deployed. These assessments include 
Application security, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, security architecture review data security assessment etc. 
Bank also has adopted defense in depth methodology to protect its valuable assets from intrusion by malicious actors. The Bank 
has 24 x 7 Security Operation Center (SOC) to keep vigil on its digital assets and coordinates with RBI, Indian Computer Emergency 
Response Team (CERT-IN), National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), National Payments 
Corporation Of India (NPCI) etc. for implementation of their recommendation to strengthen its defense against cyber-attacks.
Strategic initiatives undertaken in fiscal 2023
The Bank has invested in strengthening the risk infrastructure across multiple dimensions. During fiscal 2023, the Risk Department 
enhanced its coverage of risks by comprehensively strengthening the model risk framework. The Department also initiated steps 
to build toolkits that would help assess emerging risks such as ESG as well as support emerging areas of distinctiveness for the 
Bank like Bharat Banking. It also strengthened toolkits around Credit EWS.
Further, it conducted an organisation wide exercise around training mid-level officers in cyber security so as to cascade the cyber 
security awareness to the frontline.
The Bank also continued to focus on actioning around its operational risks and put in place timebound plans to address the 
top critical risks facing the Bank. A digital risk framework was also put in place and continually enhanced to enable the Bank to 
buildout its digital strategy in a risk – sensitive manner.
The Risk team remains focused on supporting the Bank in implementing its GPS strategy in a risk – sensitive manner. To that end, 
the team has identified five most critical initiatives for fiscal 2024 around ESG risk, Bharat Banking, cyber security, universal 
underwriting and risk & compliance culture. These will contribute to a credit – led growth thrust in retail and rural space while 
balancing those with considerations of ESG and cyber security, as well as building sustainability through a robust risk culture. The 
plan also includes undertaking other initiatives around subsidiary risk, operational risk, vendor risk, fraud risk and digital risk.
Successful implementation of these initiatives will help the Bank to achieve its GPS objectives in a sustainable manner.
Subsidiary Governance
Axis Bank oversees its subsidiaries to ensure adherence to corporate governance principles. The Bank is committed towards 
continuously improving internal controls and overseeing its subsidiaries as a financial conglomerate (FC).
To ensure the alignment of governance practices at the Group (Axis Bank and its subsidiaries) level and to positively engage the

The Bank follows Board approved policies to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements, which are updated annually to 
factor in the changing and increasing regulatory and supervisory requirements and expectations, as well as other good practices. 
The Board and senior management spend a significant amount of time to monitor level of compliance across verticals in business 
& operations, while emphasizing zero tolerance for non-compliance to regulatory requirements. The Board has mandated 
compliance and risk culture related metrics to be an important part of the performance appraisal of the whole-time directors &

Internal Audit
The Bank’s Internal Audit function provides an independent view to its Board of Directors and Senior Management on the quality 
and efficacy of the internal controls, risk management systems, governance systems and processes in place on an on-going basis. 
This is provided to primarily ensure that the business and support functions are following compliance with both internal and 
regulatory guidelines.
In line with the RBI’s guidelines on Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA), the Bank has adopted a robust internal audit policy. The Risk 
Based Internal Audit has been designed after factoring regulatory guidelines and also international best practices. The policy has 
a well-defined architecture for conducting Risk Based Internal Audit which articulates the audit strategy in terms of a concerted 
focus on strategic and emerging business risks. These inputs form a key step in the identification of the audit universe for the 
audit planning exercise. The audit frequencies are in sync with the risk profile of each unit to be audited. This is in alignment with 
guidelines relating to Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA). The scope of RBIA includes examining the adequacy and effectiveness of 
internal control systems, external compliances and also evaluating the risk residing at the audit entities. Further to augment the 
internal audit function, concurrent audit, off-site audit and thematic audit reviews have been integrated into the internal audit 
process in order to make the function more robust.
Keeping pace with digitalisation in the Bank, the Internal Audit function has also undertaken several technological initiatives for 
providing enhanced efficiency and effectiveness through technology driven audits. The Internal Audit function has an effective 
mix of resources with technology and functional skill sets for effectively conducting technology driven audits. The Audit function 
is continuously enhancing the skill sets of the audit resources towards technology driven audits, for making the Internal Audit 
Function agile and responsive towards the emerging and strategic risks.
The Internal Audit function of the Bank operates independently under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board, that 
reviews the efficacy of the internal audit function, effectiveness of the internal controls laid down by the Bank and compliance 
with internal and regulatory guidelines.

The Bank remains steadfastly committed towards making the principle of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) a key 
element of its long-term strategy and activities; and continues to work towards aligning its overall organizational strategy and 
decision-making to its Purpose Statement - ‘Banking that leads to a more inclusive and equitable economy, thriving community 
and a healthier planet’.
In 2021, The Bank’s CSR Committee formally began to oversee ESG as a topic, supported by the management-level ESG Steering 
Committee comprising senior leaders. In fiscal  2022, Axis Bank became the first Indian bank to establish a standalone ESG 
Committee at the Board level. Under the Committee’s oversight, the Bank also announced a series of ESG-aligned commitments 
with its business and non-business activities, which are being driven by the pertinent verticals across the organization. The 
Bank’s commitments are aligned to pertinent Sustainable Development Goals and to India’s climate commitments under the Paris 
Agreement. In fiscal 2023, the ESG Committee of the Board met 4 times, wherein it also reviewed the Bank’s progress towards 
achieving its ESG-aligned commitments. The Bank has been publishing its performance towards achieving its commitments 
annually, primarily through its annual sustainability reports.
Towards its commitment of achieving incremental wholesale lending of `30,000 crores in sectors with positive sustainable 
impact by 2026, the Bank has achieved `20,400 crores of lending as of 31 March, 2023. During the year, under the oversight of

activities, the Bank has automated the internal tagging and tracking process for all such eligible transactions. As a part of its 
commitments, the Bank has also been actively planning towards scaling down its exposure to highly carbon intensive sectors. 
Thereunder, the Bank has identified four such sectors, including thermal power generation and coal mining, and has finalized a 
glide path over the decade that has been reviewed by the ESG Committee.

As a part of its commitments, the Bank has also been working towards strengthening its climate risk management capabilities at 
the enterprise level, under the oversight of the ESG Committee. In fiscal 2022, the Bank crossed its first milestone by embedding 
ESG risks into the ICAAP. In the same year, as a part of its initiative, the Bank also significantly strengthened its ESG Policy for 
Lending that integrates environmental and social risk assessment into its credit appraisal for Wholesale Banking. Significantly, 
the key proposals discussed at the Board level now include frequent discussions around their assessment under the ESG Policy 
for Lending. During the year, the Bank successfully designed and launched a pilot ESG Rating model, which is undergoing internal 
testing and validation. In addition, the Bank also published its first ESG Risk dashboard that was also presented to the Bank’s Risk 
Management Committee.

achieve 30% representation of women in its workforce by fiscal 2027, the Bank has strived to scale up its hiring diversity across all 
verticals and launched new initiatives that not only support its #ComeAsYouAre Charter of commitments but also help expand its 
talent pool. The Bank’s #HouseWorkIsWork campaign was especially focused on qualified women who were keen to return to the 
workforce. In the first year itself of the campaign, the Bank received over 3,000 eligible resumes prompting the Bank to scale up 
its planned hiring from the program. During the year, the Bank launched an internal initiative – Pause for Bias, that aims to address

understands that it is the employees, those in the frontline and those supporting them that drive its promise of being ‘Dil Se Open’.
During the year, we as a Bank strengthened our capabilities and leadership team as we welcomed 3,200+ colleagues who joined 
us from Citibank. We have now embarked on a journey of creating an institution that will be respected by all and that will outlive 
us all.  In order to achieve this, we continue to challenge ourselves to design unique initiatives and practices, with a goal to provide 
an enriching environment to our people.
Redefining conventional workspace 
Axis Bank was the first among Indian Banks to adopt the concept of ‘future of work’ in full swing with the launch of GIG-A 
Opportunities in 2020. Under GIG-A 2.0, a pilot for 500 employees was launched in February 2021 in conjunction with our select 
teams to test and scale up the hypothesis that, work can be successfully done from anywhere. After a successful pilot, the Bank is 
now operating with this program in full swing with about 3500+ GIG-A employees associated with the Bank. Additionally, there 
are 200+ freelancers delivering niche skills across the Bank. In this model, the Bank has ensured to maintain a gender diversity 
ratio of 1:1 and have hired about 35% of freelancers from non-metro cities. The Bank continues to follow ‘Hybrid way of working’ 
with majority of the employees at large offices required to visit office twice a week and are advised to work from home on the rest 
of the days. Since the time large offices opened up after the pandemic, the Bank has successfully run rosters for every department 
in the Bank. Both employee and manager feedback remains positive in the hybrid model of working.
Driving the Bank’s deeply rooted culture
The Bank focuses on building a fair, diverse, and performance-driven culture, guided by the five Core Values - Customer Centricity, 
Ethics, Teamwork, Transparency and Ownership. A network of 956 Axis Value Realizers serve as ambassadors to achieve Bank’s

the Bank’s strategic objectives. The second edition of the ‘Ahead’ Internal talent management program was launched in April 2022 
where a group of 30 employees was selected. In this edition, Ahead Management Trainees have also been mapped to mentors 
from the previous Ahead batch to support them in their first year and help them navigate through the journey. ‘Astros’ is the 
Bank’s signature talent development program that aims to craft new career avenues for our employees in middle management. 
The selected employees underwent 6 days of formal learning sessions, worked on live projects with leaders and also participated 
in a peer knowledge sharing platform. The second edition of the mentoring program with Management Committee was launched 
in August 2022 with a wider scope and coverage for fiscal 2023 including 21 mentors (all presidents & above included) and 111 
mentees across VP to president grade. The Bank offers flexibility to employees to redefine their career journey within the Bank

person-hours for all employees. Out of all training given to employees, 72% of trainings were conducted online and remaining 
28% were classroom-based training.
Maintaining a performance driven culture through meritocracy and transparency
Employees reflect on their performance twice every year through self and supervisor evaluation and feedback. Mid-Year check-in 
conversations ensure that managers are accountable for their team member’s performance and there are transparent discussions 
between manager and employee not just during appraisals, but through the year. In an effort to control attrition at various levels, 
the Bank introduced a KRA focused on team retention for all AVP and above team leaders with a team size of more than 4. So far, 
the same has been implemented across more than 90% leaders.
Welcoming young minds to kick-start their banking careers

the D,E,&I efforts visible and conducive to exist for every member in the organization.
‘Pause for Bias’ training is a part of the induction program, and so far, the team has conducted 104 ‘Pause for Bias’ sessions 
covering 20,080 employees across the Bank.
Staying true to the credo of inclusion – “The onus of inclusion lies on those who are included, not on those who are excluded”, 
the Bank periodically introduces unique programs to break through from traditional patterns of hiring. #HouseWorkIsWork was 
launched in February 2022, welcoming homemakers who had taken a break from their corporate jobs to manage household chores 
and other added responsibilities of family and children.  Axis Bank looks at it through a different lens, where the experience they 
gain at home is seen a valuable in the Bank’s growth journey. The team received an overwhelming response of 3,437 applications 
for the campaign.
The policy infrastructure of the Bank was upgraded post launch of #ComeAsYouAre charter on 6 September, 2021. This 
ensures that all policies are gender inclusive and step beyond heteronormativity. The leave policy saw significant changes in the 
nomenclature where maternity leave was renamed as ‘Leave for birthing parents’ to include transmen who could be birthing 
parents, adoption leave is now gender inclusive, paternity leave up from 15 days to now 30 days a year.
The inclusive hiring policy mandates all job descriptions to have the following prompt - #ComeAsYouAre - Women, LGBTQIA+ 
and PwD candidates of all ages are encouraged to apply. This focused approach has led to a 25% of women hires up from 19% 
in the previous year.
Axis Bank also ensures a regular pulse check on DE&I agenda in the larger society by engaging with different cohorts. Women 
In Motion (WiM) is an outreach initiative run by senior most leaders for women students across the country. Last year, the team 
had a chance to interact with 20,032 students from 53 institutes across the length and breadth of the country. The team also 
conducts a 6-hour long interactive certification course for all DE&I enthusiasts who are keen on becoming strong advocates for 
participation of underrepresented groups in the workforce. This reported a coverage of 226 students across 3 institutes till date. 
Axis VIBE, launched on September 2022, celebrates the idea of pride and diversity equity and inclusion in the business ecosystem. 
This is a platform where Axis Bank employees get a chance to interact with prominent leaders from varied industries to learn 
about policies and practices of businesses that put inclusion as a priority in their agenda.

The Bank has formulated and adopted a whistleblower policy to inquire / investigate / commend necessary action against

a Bank official.
	
To ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained on an ongoing basis and to provide safeguards 
to various stakeholders (including shareholders, depositors, and employees), the Bank has formulated a ‘whistleblower 
policy'. The policy provides all stakeholders with the opportunity to address serious concerns arising from irregularities, 
malpractices and other misdemeanors committed by the Bank’s officials by approaching a Whistleblower Committee 
set up for the purpose, without fear of retribution or vengeful action from the persons against whom the complaint was 
submitted. If the offences are committed by senior management, the policy enables the Bank’s staff to report the concerns 
to the ACB. It complies with the relevant provisions of Section 177(9) of the Act, rules made thereunder and Regulation 4(2)
(d) and Regulation 22 of the SEBI Listing Regulations.
	
To ensure smooth flow and management of complaints under the whistleblower policy, a web-based application - ‘https://
whistleblower.axisbank.co.in’ has been set up, providing an option for anonymous reporting, thereby enabling lodging of 
complaints online over a secure platform without fear of revelation of identity. This would create a business culture of 
honesty, integrity, and compliance and encourage speaking up to initiate preventive action.
	
The Bank has not denied access to any of its employees to the Chairperson of the ACB and that the policy contains adequate 
provisions for protecting whistleblowers from unfair termination and other unfair prejudicial and employment practices.

land, (2) set forth basic parameters of ethical and acceptable social behaviour, and (3) establish a system for detection and 
reporting of known or suspected ethical or violations of regulations.

However, as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank has been focusing on maximising its resource consumption 
efficiency, reducing waste generation while focusing on improving its process efficiency and productivity. Even as 
digitization of products and services has been reducing the requirement of paper, it remains a significant resource 
consumed during the Bank’s normal course of business, and it has focused on reducing its paper consumption further 
by scaling up recycling, procuring paper from more sustainable sources, and rationalizing printing requirements

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices

Given the nature of the Bank’s business activities, which is providing banking products and services to serve its customers 
and stakeholders, it largely consumes resources for running its banking operations. This includes purchased electricity and 
the use of diesel gen sets at its branches, and use of paper in its banking forms, statements, and other such documents that 
the Bank uses to conduct its banking activities. The Bank has in place its Policy on Environmental Management that provides 
a strategic guidance to its activities aimed at enhancing resource use efficiency and waste reduction while improving 
productivity and efficiency. Through varied initiatives, the Bank works towards reducing its resource consumption, as well 
as focus on enhancing energy efficiency. In addition, the digitization of its internal processes has aided its efforts, such as 
by replacing the need for paper. The Bank also engages with authorised waste recycling vendors empanelled with SPCBs 
(State Pollution Control Boards) and CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) for disposal of e-waste in compliance with 
pertinent government regulations. The waste paper and plastics are given to local scrap dealers for recycling purposes. 
In general, the Bank does not utilise any hazardous and toxic chemicals in its products and processes, thus, it does not 
generate any hazardous or toxic by-product or waste as an outcome.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under  Section 143 (10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters prescribed below to be the key audit matters:

Key Audit Matters
How the Matter was addressed in our report
1
Acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business
Refer Note No. 1 of Schedule 18 relating to acquisition of the 
consumer business of Citibank N.A. (CBNA) and Citicorp Finance 
(India) Ltd (CFIL) as going concerns without assigning values 
to individual assets and liabilities with effect from beginning of 
March 01, 2023 (Legal Day One/LD1) by the Bank.
The Assets and Liabilities are recognized in the books of the 
Bank on LD1. The initial purchase consideration was determined 
and recognized based on the position of business assets and 
business liabilities acquired as at end of day January 31, 2023. 
Subsequently, on best estimate of the position of business 
assets and business liabilities acquired as at beginning of day 
1 March, 2023 the purchase consideration was trued up to 
record a further payable to CBNA at March 31, 2023. These 
amounts are subject to review of the final closing statement in 
FY 2023-24, which will also be verified by an independent 
practitioner.
Based on the report of an independent valuer, the estimated 
adjusted purchase price of Rs 11,949.08 crores is attributed 
to various intangible  business and commercial rights such 
as Customer Relationship (including contracts), Co-branding 
arrangements, Business processes/ information, Non-compete 
rights (collectively “Intangibles”) and goodwill. The purchase 
price allocation between various intangible assets and goodwill 
involves a significant amount of judgement by the valuer and the 
Management. The Bank has continued use of the intangible assets 
for the business purposes.  The Bank, as a prudent measure and 
to protect its ability to pay dividends, has fully amortised these 
intangible assets and goodwill in the Profit and Loss account for 
the year.
Our approach included understanding the structure of the 
acquisition, determining the nature, timing and extent of audit 
procedures, and conducting the same. 
We have performed following audit procedures for verification of 
the accounting of acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business: 
•	
Review of the Business Transfer Agreements, Transitional 
Services Agreement, regulatory approvals and other related 
documents to obtain an understanding of the structure and 
terms of the acquisition. 
•	
Verification of the preliminary closing statement prepared 
by Citibank India for transfer of assets and liabilities based 
on the position of January 31, 2023 on LD1, best estimates 
position as on March 1, 2023 as prepared by the Bank’s 
Management and subsequent integration post LD1.
•	
Verification of the integration of Citibank’s India Consumer 
Business accounting records into the financial reporting 
system of the Bank including verification of the general 
ledgers mapping between Citibank’s India Consumer 
Business and Axis Bank trial balances, and the process of 
opening new control accounts.

Key Audit Matters
How the Matter was addressed in our report
The value of the purchase consideration, other intangible assets, 
goodwill and the amounts payable to CBNA are subject to 
changes based on the final closing statement which is subject to 
verification by a jointly appointed independent practitioner and 
independent review by the Bank and CBNA. 
  
Though the Bank has continued use of the intangible assets 
for business purposes, as a prudent measure, the depreciation 
on such intangibles fully amortized through the Profit & Loss 
Account is not considered for tax purpose in the books.
As per the Business Transfer Agreements executed with CBNA 
and CFIL, till final migration, the Bank will rely on the Information 
Technology systems of CBNA/CFIL and data residing therein. 
The accounting of the acquisition has been determined as key 
audit matter due to the following:
•	
Materiality and complexities of the said transaction 
including the estimations involved in recognising the 
assets and liabilities acquired. 
•	
Assumptions, estimates and judgements used by the 
Bank and the independent valuer for the purchase price 
allocation at the time of initial recognition and true-up 
based on estimated position as on March 01, 2023.
•	
Changes expected, if any, based on the verification 
of final closing statement by the Bank, CBNA and 
independent practitioner. 
•	
Reliance placed by the Bank on IT system and internal 
controls at CBNA/CFIL during the transition period. 
•	
Evaluation of the fair value of the assets acquired along with 
the valuation methodology and key assumptions applied. 
We also evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions 
and estimates used in the valuation based on our knowledge 
of the business and industry.   
•	
Verification of the accounting treatment for other 
intangible assets and goodwill and tax impact arising out of 
the allocation of the purchase consideration based on the 
valuation report accepted by the Management of the Bank.
•	
Understanding and testing the process of resulting 
accounting effect on various areas such as alignment of 
accounting estimates and policies, NPA identification, 
classification 
and 
provisioning, 
employee 
benefits, 
operating expenses, taxation and related disclosures.
•	
Assessment of the internal controls in relation to financial 
reporting for the accounting and reporting on the said 
acquired consumer business and reviewing the Bank’s 
disclosures on the same.
•	
Evaluation of testing carried out by the Management on 
existence and operating efficiency of internal control at 
Citibank India Consumer Business.  
•	
Evaluation of Management’s assessment on treatment 
of amortisation of intangible assets and goodwill for 
taxation purposes.

Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s financial accounting and reporting systems 
are highly dependent on the effective working of the Core 
Banking Solution (CBS) and other IT systems linked to the 
CBS or working independently. Considering the extensive 
volume, diverse nature and complexity of transactions that 
are processed daily, there is a risk that automated accounting 
procedures and related internal controls may not be accurately 
designed and operating effectively. There exists a risk that 
gaps in the IT control environment could result in the financial 
accounting and reporting records being materially misstated. 
Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that the IT 
applications perform as planned and the changes made are 
properly authorized, tested and controlled. Such controls 
contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data. The 
audit outcome is heavily dependent on the robustness of IT 
systems and controls.
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit Matter 
as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on technology. The 
IT environment of the Bank is complex and the design and 
operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct impact on 
its financial reporting process. Review of these controls allows 
us to provide assurance on the integrity and completeness of 
data processed through various IT applications which are used 
for the preparation and presentation of financial reports.
•	
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit 
procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration 
the IT systems of the Bank. For this purpose, we obtained an 
understanding of the Bank’s IT environment. As part of our IT 
controls testing, we have tested IT General Controls (ITGC) as 
well as IT Automated Controls (ITAC) for select applications.
•	
The procedures adopted by us are, in our opinion, adequate to 
provide reasonable assurance on the adequacy of IT controls 
in place. Critical areas for improvement, if any, as and when 
noticed are communicated to the Bank’s Management and 
the adequacy of action taken by the Bank where necessary, is 
reviewed by us periodically as part of our audit procedures.
•	
IT audit specialists are an integral part of our engagement team.

Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting
•	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by 
Internal Audit department, and also the audit of Internal 
Financial Control over Financial Reporting conducted by 
Operations Health and Control Team of the Bank.
•	
We also tested key automated and manual business cycle 
controls and logic for system generated reports relevant 
to the audit; including testing of compensating controls or 
performed alternate procedures to assess whether there were 
any unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the 
Standalone Financial Statements.
•	
We have also carried out independent alternative audit 
procedures like substantive testing, analytical procedures etc. 
to verify the accuracy of the data generated from the IT system.

Income Recognition, Asset Classification (IRAC) and provisioning on Loans & Advances and Investments as per the regulatory 
requirements
Please refer to Note no.  3.4 (a) of Schedule 18 relating to Asset 
Quality in respect of movement of Non-Performing Assets 
(NPAs) and related provisions and disclosures with regard to 
Non Performing Investments (NPI) respectively as also Note 
no. 2 of Schedule 18 regarding the provisions made due to the 
potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
The Management of the Bank relies on its automated IT 
systems to determine asset classification, income recognition, 
provisioning for standard and non-performing advances/
investments and for compliance of applicable regulatory 
guidelines issued by the RBI. The Management supplements its 
assessment by availing services of experts (like independent 
valuers, lawyers, legal experts and other professionals) to 
determine the valuation and enforceability of security of such 
advances/investments.
The Bank makes provisions for the performing and non-
performing advances/investments, as per its governing 
framework which includes Management’s assessment of 
the degree of impairment subject to and guided by minimum 
provisioning levels prescribed under RBI guidelines.
Compliance of relevant prudential norms issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in respect of income recognition, 
asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances as 
well as those pertaining to investments is a key audit matter 
due to materiality, complexity and uncertainty involved and 
the current processes at the Bank which requires certain 
manual interventions, Management estimates and judgement. 
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit procedures 
in respect of income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to advances and investments. In particular:
•	
We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal control 
system in adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding 
income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to advances and investments;
•	
We have tested key IT systems/ applications used and their 
design and implementation as well as operational effectiveness 
of relevant controls, including involvement of manual process 
and manual controls in relation to income recognition, asset 
classification, provisioning pertaining to advances and 
investments and compliances of other regulatory guidelines 
issued by the RBI;
•	
We have test checked advances to examine the validity of 
the recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined the 
statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment 
provision for non-performing assets, and compliance with 
income recognition, asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to advances in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;
•	
We have evaluated the past trends of Management judgement, 
governance process and review controls over impairment 
provision calculations and discussed the provisions made with 
the top and senior management of the Bank.
•	
We have also relied on work done by external experts like 
valuers, lawyers, concurrent auditors etc. on specific areas.
•	
Critical areas for improvement, if any, as and when noticed are 
communicated to the Bank’s Management and the adequacy of 
action taken by the Bank where necessary, is reviewed by us 
periodically as part of our audit procedures.

Information other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon
The Bank’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the Other Information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements, consolidated financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon and the Pillar III Disclosures under Basel III Capital Regulation, Leverage Ratio, 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio. The other information is expected to be made available to us after the 
date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
When we read the Other Information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors and Management are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit and cash flows 
of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Act, provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued 
by Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from time to time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Management and Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.
Standalone Financial Statements
214
Annual Report 2022-23
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause a Bank to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to the aforesaid Standalone Financial Statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of Axis Bank Limited (“the 
Bank”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year 
ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based 
on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing (‘the Standards’), prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were established and maintained and whether such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. 
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including 
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial 
statement includes those policies and procedures that 
1)	
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Bank; 
2)	
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank 
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of Management and Directors of the Bank; and 
3)	
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Financial Statements
217
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statement become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion the Bank has maintained, in all respects, an adequate internal financial control system with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.

17      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
	
For the year ended 31 March, 2023
1.	
Background
	
Axis Bank Limited (‘the Bank’) was incorporated in 1993 and provides a complete suite of banking and financial services 
including retail banking, wholesale banking and treasury operations. The Bank is primarily governed by the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949. As on 31 March 2023, the Bank has overseas branches at Singapore, DIFC - Dubai and an Offshore 
Banking Unit at the International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City), 
Gandhinagar, India.
	
Effective 1 March 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business from Citibank N.A. 
(acting through its branch in India) (‘CBNA’) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) Limited (‘CFIL’) 
as going concerns without assigning values to individual assets and liabilities post receipt of statutory and other approvals 
and completion of all other conditions as stipulated under the respective Business Transfer Agreements (BTAs).
2.	
Basis of preparation
	
The standalone financial statements (‘financial statements’) have been prepared and presented under the historical cost 
convention on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in India, 
unless otherwise stated by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’), to comply with the statutory requirements prescribed under 
the Third Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the circulars, notifications, guidelines and directives issued by 
the RBI from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read 
together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 to the 
extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. Accounting policies applied have been 
consistent with the previous year except otherwise stated.
3.	
Use of estimates
	
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles requires the 
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) at the date of the financial statements, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in 
the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Any revisions, as and when carried out, to the 
accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.
4.	
Significant accounting policies
4.1	
Investments
 
Classification
	
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are classified at the time of purchase as:
	
•	
Held for Trading (‘HFT’);
	
• 	
Available for Sale (‘AFS’); and
	
•	
Held to Maturity (‘HTM’).
	
Investments that are held principally for sale within a short period are classified as HFT securities. As per the RBI guidelines, 
HFT securities, which remain unsold for a period of 90 days are transferred to AFS securities.
	
Investments that the Bank intends to hold till maturity are classified under the HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries/joint ventures and investments under TLTRO guidelines are categorised as HTM in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines.  
	
All other investments are classified as AFS securities.
	
For disclosure in the Balance Sheet, investments in India are classified under six categories - Government Securities, Other 
Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investment in Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures and Others. Investments 
made outside India are classified under three categories - Government Securities, Subsidiaries and/or Joint Ventures 
abroad and Others.
	
All investments are accounted for on settlement date, except investments in equity shares which are accounted 
for on trade date.
Standalone Financial Statements
230
Annual Report 2022-23
	
Transfer of security between categories
	
Transfer of security between categories of investments is accounted for as per the RBI guidelines.
 
Acquisition cost
	
Costs incurred at the time of acquisition, pertaining to investments, such as brokerage, commission etc. are charged to the 
Profit and Loss Account.
	
Broken period interest is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Cost of investments is computed based on the weighted average cost method.
 
Valuation
	
Investments classified under the HTM category: Investments are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, 
in which case the premium is amortised over the period remaining to maturity on a constant yield to maturity basis. Such 
amortization of premium is adjusted against interest income under the head ‘Income from Investments’ under Schedule 13 
in Profit and Loss Account. As per the RBI guidelines, discount on securities held under HTM category is not accrued and 
such securities are held at the acquisition cost till maturity.
	
Investments in subsidiaries/joint ventures are categorised as HTM and assessed for impairment to determine permanent 
diminution, if any, in accordance with the RBI guidelines and suitable provisions are made.
	
Investments classified under the AFS and HFT categories: Investments under these categories are marked to market. The 
market/fair value of quoted investments included in the AFS and HFT categories is the market price of the scrip as available 
from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges or prices declared by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association of India (‘FIMMDA’)/Financial Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’), periodically. Net depreciation, if any, 
within each category of each investment classification is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The net appreciation, 
if any, under each category of each investment classification is ignored. Net depreciation on each type of investments 
falling under the residual category of ‘Others’ (i.e. mutual funds, Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), security receipts etc.) 
is not offset against gain in another class of investment falling within the ‘Others’ category. Further, in case of standard 
investments classified as weak (including certain internally unrated investments) as per the Bank’s internal framework, 
the Bank recognizes net depreciation without availing the benefit of set-off against appreciation within the same class of 
investments as permitted under the extant RBI circular. The depreciation on securities acquired by way of conversion of 
outstanding loans is provided in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Provision for depreciation on investments is classified 
under Schedule-14 ‘Other Income’. The book value of individual securities is not changed consequent to the periodic 
valuation of investments.	
	
Non-performing investments are identified and provision is made thereon as per the RBI guidelines. Provision for 
depreciation on such non-performing investments is not set off against the appreciation in respect of other performing 
securities as per RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing investments is not recognized in the Profit and Loss Account 
until received.
	
Treasury Bills, Exchange Funded Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate of Deposits being discounted instruments, are 
valued at carrying cost which includes discount accreted over the period to maturity.  
	
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest repurchase price/Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by the mutual fund.
	
Market value of investments where current quotations are not available, is determined in accordance with the norms 
prescribed by the RBI as under:
	
•	
The market/fair value of unquoted government securities which are in the nature of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (‘SLR’) 
securities forming part of AFS and HFT categories is computed as per the rates published by FIMMDA/FBIL.
	
•	
In case of special bonds issued by the Government of India that do not qualify for SLR purposes, unquoted bonds, 
debentures and preference shares where interest/dividend is received regularly (i.e. not overdue beyond 90 days), 
the market price is derived based on the Yield to maturity (‘YTM’) for Government Securities as published by 
FIMMDA/FBIL and suitably marked up for credit risk applicable to the credit rating of the instrument. The matrix 
for credit risk mark-up for each category and credit ratings along with residual maturity issued by FIMMDA/FBIL is 
adopted for this purpose. 
	
•	
In case of bonds & debentures where interest is not received regularly (i.e. overdue beyond 90 days), the valuation is 
in accordance with prudential norms for provisioning as prescribed by the RBI. 
	
•	
PTC and Priority Sector PTCs are valued as per extant FIMMDA guidelines.
Financial Statements
231
	
•	
Equity shares, for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the stock 
exchanges, are valued at break-up value (without considering revaluation reserves, if any) which is ascertained from 
the company’s latest Balance Sheet (not older than 18 months). In case the latest Balance Sheet is not available, the 
shares are valued at `1 per company.
	
•	
Investments in listed instruments of Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’)/Infrastructure Investment Trust (‘INVIT’) 
are valued at the closing price on the recognised stock exchange with the highest volumes. In case the instruments 
are not traded on any stock exchange, valuation is carried out based on the latest NAV (not older than 1 year) 
submitted by the trust.
	
•	
Units of Venture Capital Funds (‘VCF’) held under AFS category where current quotations are not available are 
valued based on the latest audited financial statements of the fund. In case the audited financials are not available 
for a period beyond 18 months, the investments are valued at `1 per VCF. Investment in unquoted VCF may be 
categorized under HTM category for the initial period of three years and are valued at cost as per the RBI guidelines.
	
•	
Investments in Security Receipts (‘SRs’) are valued as per the NAV declared by the issuing Asset Reconstruction 
Company (‘ARC’) or net book value of loans transferred or estimated recoverable value based on Bank’s internal 
assessment on case to case basis, whichever is lower. In case of investments in SRs which are backed by more than 10 
percent of the stressed assets sold by the Bank, the valuation of such SRs is additionally subject to a floor of face value 
of the SRs reduced by the provisioning rate as per the extant asset classification and provisioning norms as applicable 
to the underlying loans, assuming that the loan notionally continued in the books of the Bank.
	
Disposal of investments
	
Investments classified under the HTM category: Realised gains are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and subsequently 
appropriated to Capital Reserve Account (net of taxes and transfer to statutory reserves) in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. Losses are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
	
Investments classified under the AFS and HFT categories: Realised gains/losses are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Short Sales
	
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, the Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government dated securities. 
Such short positions are categorised under HFT category and netted off from investments in the Balance Sheet. These 
positions are marked-to-market along with the other securities under HFT portfolio and the resultant Mark-to-Market 
(‘MTM’) gains/losses are accounted for as per the relevant RBI guidelines for valuation of investments discussed earlier.
4.2	
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions
 
Repurchase transactions (‘Repos’)
	
Repurchase transactions in Government securities and corporate debt securities including those conducted under the 
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (‘LAF’) and Marginal Standby Facility (‘MSF’) with RBI are accounted for as collateralised 
borrowings. Accordingly, securities given as collateral under an agreement to repurchase them, continue to be held under 
the investment account and the Bank continues to accrue the coupon on the security during the repo period. Borrowing 
cost on such repo transactions is accounted as interest expense in “Schedule 15 – Interest Expended” in the Profit 
and Loss Account.
 
Reverse repurchase transactions (‘Reverse repos’)
	
Reverse repurchase transactions with RBI with original maturity upto 14 days from the date of issuance, including 
those conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (‘LAF’) and Standing Deposit Facility (‘SDF’), are accounted for 
as collateralised lending under “Schedule 6 - Balances with RBI - in Other Accounts”. Revenue on such reverse repos is 
accounted for as interest income under “Schedule 13 – Interest Earned – Interest on balances with Reserve Bank of India 
and Other Inter-bank Funds” in the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Reverse repos with original maturity of more than 14 days from the date of issuance are accounted for as collateralised 
lending under “Schedule 9 - Advances”. Revenue on such reverse repos is accounted for as interest income under “Schedule 
13 - Interest Earned – Interest/discount on advances/bills” in the Profit and Loss account.
4.3	
Advances
 
Classification and measurement of advances
	
Advances are classified into performing and non-performing advances (‘NPAs’) as per the RBI guidelines and are stated net 
of bills rediscounted, inter-bank participation certificates, specific provisions made towards NPAs, interest in suspense for 
NPAs, claims received from Export Credit Guarantee Corporation, provisions for funded interest on term loan classified 
as NPAs and floating provisions. Structured collateralised foreign currency loans extended to customers and deposits 
received from the same customer are reported on a net basis.
Standalone Financial Statements
232
Annual Report 2022-23
	
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank participation with and without risk. In accordance with the RBI guidelines, 
in the case of participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the Bank is reduced from advances 
and where the Bank is participating, the aggregate amount of the participation is classified under advances. In the case of 
participation without risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the Bank is classified under borrowings and 
where the Bank is participating, the aggregate amount of participation is shown as due from banks under advances.
	
Non-performing advances and provision on non-performing advances
	
NPAs are classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets based on the criteria stipulated by the RBI. Advances held 
at the overseas branches that are identified as impaired as per host country regulations for reasons other than record of 
recovery, but which are standard as per the RBI guidelines, are classified as NPAs to the extent of amount outstanding in 
the host country. NPAs are upgraded to standard as per the extant RBI guidelines. 
	
Provisions for NPAs are made for sub-standard and doubtful assets at rates as prescribed by the RBI with the exception 
of schematic retail advances, agriculture advances and advances to Commercial Banking segment. In respect of schematic 
retail advances, provisions are made in terms of a bucket-wise policy upon reaching specified stages of delinquency (90 
days or more of delinquency) under each type of loan, which satisfies the RBI prudential norms on provisioning. Provisions 
in respect of commercial banking group advances and agriculture advances classified into sub-standard and doubtful assets 
are made at rates which are higher than those prescribed by the RBI. 
	
Provisions for advances booked in overseas branches, which are standard as per the RBI guidelines but are identified 
as impaired as per host country regulations for reasons other than record of recovery, are made as per the host 
country regulations. 
	
In case of NPAs referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (‘NCLT’) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 
(‘IBC’) where resolution plan or liquidation order has been approved by NCLT, provision is maintained at higher of the 
requirement under the RBI guidelines or the likely haircut as per resolution plan or liquidation order.
	
Provision on restructured assets
	
Restructured assets are classified and provided for in accordance with the guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time.

scale ranging from 0.25% to 100%. For exposures with contractual maturity of less than 180 days, 25% of the normal 
provision requirement is held. If the net funded exposure of the Bank in respect of each country does not exceed 1% of 
the total assets, no provision is maintained on such country exposure in accordance with RBI guidelines. This provision is 
classified under Schedule 5 – Other Liabilities and Provisions in the Balance Sheet.
4.5	
Securitisation and transfer of assets
 
Securitisation of Standard Assets
	
The Bank enters into purchase/sale of corporate and retail loans through direct assignment/Special Purpose Vehicle 
(‘SPV’). In most cases, post securitisation, the Bank continues to service the loans transferred to the assignee/SPV. The 
Bank also provides credit enhancement in the form of cash collaterals and/or by subordination of cash flows to Senior Pass 
Through Certificate holders. In respect of credit enhancements provided or recourse obligations (projected delinquencies, 
future servicing etc.)  accepted by the Bank, appropriate provision/disclosure is made at the time of sale in accordance 
with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021. In 
accordance with RBI guidelines on Securitisation of Standard Assets, any loss, profit or premium realised at the time of the 
sale is accounted for in the Profit and Loss Account for the accounting period during which the sale is completed. However, 
in case of unrealised gains arising out of sale of underlying assets to the SPV, the profit is recognised in Profit and Loss 
Account only when such unrealised gains associated with such income is redeemed in cash.

which is realised, is accounted for and reflected in the Profit and Loss Account for the accounting period during which the 
transfer is completed. Loans acquired are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the outstanding principal at the 
time of the transfer, in which case the premium paid is amortised based on a straight line method.
4.6	
Priority Sector Lending Certificates
	
The Bank enters into transactions for the sale or purchase of Priority Sector Lending Certificates (‘PSLCs’). In the case of 
a sale transaction, the Bank sells the fulfilment of priority sector obligation and in the case of a purchase transaction the 
Bank buys the fulfilment of priority sector obligation through the RBI trading platform. There is no transfer of loan assets 
in PSLC transactions.
4.7	
Translation of Foreign Currency items
	
In respect of domestic operations, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the Balance Sheet date 
at rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (‘FEDAI’). All profits/losses resulting from year end 
revaluations are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Financial statements of foreign branches classified as non-integral foreign operations as per the RBI guidelines are 
translated as follows:
	
•	
Assets and liabilities (both monetary and non-monetary as well as contingent liabilities) are translated at closing 
exchange rates notified by FEDAI at the Balance Sheet date.
	
•	
Income and expenses are translated at the rates prevailing on the date of the transactions.
	
•	
All resulting exchange differences are accumulated in a separate ‘Foreign Currency Translation Reserve’ (FCTR) till 
the disposal of the net investments. Any realised gains or losses on such disposal are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account except for those that relate to repatriation of accumulated profits which are reclassified from FCTR to 
‘Balance in Profit and Loss Account’ under Schedule 2 – Reserves and Surplus in the Balance Sheet.

and other obligations denominated in foreign currencies are disclosed at closing rates of exchange notified by FEDAI.
4.8	
Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
	
Derivative transactions comprise of forward contracts, swaps and options which are disclosed as contingent liabilities. The 
forwards, swaps and options are categorised as trading or hedge transactions. Trading derivative contracts are revalued 
at the Balance Sheet date with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and 
correspondingly in other assets (representing positive MTM) and in other liabilities (representing negative MTM ) on a 
gross basis. For hedge transactions, the Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of transaction 
itself. The effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge swaps are 
accounted for on accrual basis except in case of swaps designated with an asset or liability that is carried at market value or 
lower of cost or market value in the financial statements. In such cases the swaps are marked-to-market with the resulting 
gain or loss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of the designated asset or liability. Hedge transactions that are 
entered after 26 June, 2019 through rupee interest rate derivatives are accounted for as per the guidance note issued by 
ICAI on Accounting for Derivative Contracts. Pursuant to the RBI guidelines, any receivables under derivative contracts 
comprising of crystallised receivables as well as positive MTM in respect of future receivables which remain overdue for 
more than 90 days are reversed through the Profit and Loss account and are held in a separate suspense account under 
Schedule 5 – ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’. 
	
Premium on options is recognized as income/expense on expiry or early termination of the transaction.
	
Currency futures contracts are marked-to-market using daily settlement price on a trading day, which is the closing price 
of the respective futures contracts on that day. While the daily settlement price is computed based on the last half an hour 
weighted average price of such contracts, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on the last trading day 
of the futures contracts or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All open positions are marked-
to-market based on the settlement price and the resultant MTM profit/loss is daily settled with the exchange.
	
Valuation of Exchange Traded Currency Options (‘ETCO’) is carried out on the basis of the daily settlement price of each 
individual option provided by the exchange and valuation of Interest Rate Futures (‘IRF’) is carried out on the basis of the 
daily settlement price of each contract provided by the exchange.
Financial Statements

Outstanding forward exchange contracts including tom/spot contracts (excluding currency swaps undertaken to hedge 
foreign currency assets/liabilities and funding swaps which are not revalued) are revalued at year end on Present Value basis 
by discounting the forward value till spot date using Alternative Reference Rate (‘ARR’) curve and converting the foreign 
currency amount using the respective spot rates as notified by FEDAI/FBIL. The resulting gains or losses on revaluation are 
included in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with RBI/FEDAI guidelines.
	
Premium/discount on currency swaps undertaken to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities and funding swaps is 
recognised as interest income/expense and is amortised on a pro-rata basis over the underlying swap period. 
4.9	
Revenue recognition
	
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with AS–9, Revenue Recognition as notified under Section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, the Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2021 and the RBI guidelines, except in the case of interest income on non-performing assets where it

the tenor of the certificate as ‘Miscellaneous Income’ under Schedule 14 of the Profit and Loss Account.
	
In accordance with RBI guidelines on sale of non-performing advances, if the sale is at a price below the net book value (i.e. 
book value less provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account. If the sale is for a value higher than 
the net book value, the excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account in the year the amounts are received.
	
The Bank deals in bullion business on a consignment basis. The difference between the price recovered from customers 
and cost of bullion is accounted for at the time of sale to the customers. The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and 
lending basis and the interest paid/received is accounted for on an accrual basis.
4.10	 Fixed assets and depreciation/impairment
	
Fixed assets are carried at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.  Cost includes initial 
handling and delivery charges, duties, taxes and incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the asset. 
Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefit / 
functioning capability from / of such assets.
	
Capital work-in-progress includes cost of fixed assets that are not ready for their intended use and also includes advances 
paid to acquire fixed assets.  
	
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of a fixed asset on straight-line method from the date of addition. 
The Management believes that depreciation rates currently used, fairly reflect its estimate of the useful lives and residual 
values of fixed assets based on the historical experience of the Bank, though these rates in certain cases are different from 
those prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Whenever there is a revision of the estimated useful life of 
an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the said asset.

Depreciation on assets sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis in the Profit and Loss Account till the 
date of sale.  
	
Gain or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of fixed assets are determined as the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of assets and are recognised as income or expense in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Further, profit on sale of premises is appropriated to the Capital Reserve Account (net of taxes and transfer to 
Statutory Reserve) in accordance with RBI instructions.
	
The Bank has accounted for the Intangibles and Goodwill, acquired and arising from the acquisition of Citi India Consumer 
Business as per the generally accepted accounting principles and Accounting Standard 26 on Intangible Assets which 
permits amortization over the best estimate of useful life.   During the year, Bank has fully amortized through the Profit and 
Loss Account, Intangibles and Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Citibank India Consumer Business. The Bank 
continues to have access and business use for the Intangible assets.
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to ascertain if there is any indication of impairment 
based on internal/external factors. An impairment loss is recognised wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s net selling price and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value at the weighted average cost of capital. 
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.

administer the scheme and determine the contribution premium required to be paid by the Bank. The plan provides 
a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement or termination of employment based on the respective 
employee’s salary and the years of employment with the Bank. The liability with regard to the gratuity fund is 
recognised based on actuarial valuation conducted by an independent actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method 
as at 31 March each year based on certain assumptions regarding rate of interest, salary growth, mortality and staff 
attrition. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately recognized in the Profit and Loss Account and are not deferred.

program). The Bank estimates the provision for such loyalty/reward points using an actuarial method at the Balance Sheet 
date through an independent actuary, which includes assumptions such as redemption rate, lapse rate, discount rate, value 
of reward points etc. Provision for the said reward points is then made based on the actuarial valuation report as furnished 
by the said independent actuary.

income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. The impact of changes in the deferred tax 
assets and liabilities is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised and reassessed at each reporting date, based upon the Management’s judgement as to 
whether realisation is considered as reasonably certain. Deferred tax assets are recognised on carry forward of unabsorbed 
depreciation and tax losses only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that such deferred tax asset 
can be realised against future profits.  
4.16	 Share issue expenses
	
Share issue expenses are adjusted from the Share Premium Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
4.17	 Corporate Social Responsibility
	
Expenditure towards Corporate Social Responsibility is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.

Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year.  
	
Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity 
shares were exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end except where the results are 
anti-dilutive.  
4.19	 Employee stock/unit option scheme
	
The 2001 Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for grant of stock options on equity shares of the 
Bank to employees and Directors of the Bank and its subsidiaries.  The Scheme is in accordance with the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Employees Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 
(‘the Guidelines’). These Guidelines have since been repealed and substituted by the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021. The Scheme is in compliance with the said 
regulations. Options are granted at an exercise price, which is equal to the fair market price of the underlying equity shares 
at the date of the grant. The fair market price is the latest available closing price, prior to the date of grant, on the stock 
exchange on which the shares of the Bank are listed. If the shares are listed on more than one stock exchange, then the 
stock exchange where there is highest trading volume on the said date is considered. 
	
Further, the 2022 Employees Stock Unit Scheme (‘the ESU Scheme’) provides for grant of stock units convertible into 
equivalent number of fully paid-up equity share(s) of the Bank to eligible employees. The ESU Scheme is in accordance 
with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 and 
in compliance with the said regulations. The stock units are granted at an exercise price as determined by the Bank and 
specified at the time of grant which shall not be less than the face value of the equity shares of the Bank. 
	
The Bank followed intrinsic value method to account for its stock based employee compensation plans for all the options 
granted till the accounting period ending 31 March, 2021. 
	
As per RBI guidelines, for options/units granted after 31 March, 2021, the Bank follows the fair value method and recognizes 
the fair value of such options/units computed using the Black-Scholes model without reducing estimated forfeitures, as 
compensation expense over the vesting period. On exercise of the stock options/units, corresponding balance under 
Employee Stock Options/Units Outstanding is transferred to Share Premium. In respect of the options/units which expire 
unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options/Units Outstanding is transferred to the General 
Reserve. In respect of Employee Stock Options/Units which are granted to the employees of the subsidiaries, the Bank 
recovers the cost from the subsidiaries over the vesting period.

4.20	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
	
In accordance with AS-29 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, provision is recognised when the Bank 
has a present obligation as a result of past event where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not discounted to its present value and 
are determined based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. These are reviewed 
at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
	
•	
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the existence of which will be confirmed by occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the control of the Bank; or
	
•	
a present obligation arising from a past event which is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.
	
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
	
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and 
if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the 
period in which the change occurs.
4.21	 Accounting for dividend
	
As per AS-4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance Sheet date’ as notified by the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, the Bank does not account for proposed dividend as a 
liability through appropriation from the Profit and Loss Account. The same is recognised in the year of actual payout post 
approval of the shareholders. However, the Bank considers proposed dividend in determining capital funds in computing 
the capital adequacy ratio.

(“CFIL”) collectively referred to as Citibank India Consumer Business, effective beginning of day 1 March, 2023 (referred to 
as Legal Day One) without values being assigned to individual assets and liabilities. 
	
In accordance with the BTAs, the Bank has on Legal Day One paid an Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price aggregating 
`11,602.53 crores based on the position of business assets and business liabilities acquired as at end of day 31 January, 
2023, and the Bank without prejudice to any of its rights under the said BTAs estimates a further payable of `346.55 crores 
as Purchase Price True Up Amount based on its best estimate of the position of business assets and business liabilities 
acquired as at beginning of day 1 March, 2023. The estimated Purchase Price True Up Amount is recorded as a payable to 
CBNA at 31 March, 2023. Changes, if any, to the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and/or estimated Purchase Price True 
Up Amount, which are subject to review by an external firm and the Bank, upon the receipt of the final closing statement 
from CBNA and CFIL, shall be accounted for in the period in which the actual settlement occurs. 
	
The Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and estimated Purchase Price True Up Amount aggregating to `11,949.08 crores 
are attributable to (i) various intangible business and commercial rights viz. Customer relationship (including contracts), 
Co-branding arrangements, Business processes/ information, Non-compete rights (collectively “Intangibles”) and (ii) 
Goodwill on acquisition of the Citibank India Consumer Business. Based on the report of an independent valuer, Intangibles 
(excluding Goodwill) were recognized at `8,714.24 crores and Goodwill at `3,234.84 crores in the financial statements of 
the Bank. Under Section 15 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, banks are restricted from declaring dividend in the event a 
bank carries any intangible assets on its Balance Sheet. As a prudent measure and to protect its ability to pay dividends, the 
Bank has fully amortised the said Intangibles and Goodwill through the Profit and Loss account in FY 2022-23, even though 
the Bank continues to have access to and business use for the Intangibles. The Bank has chosen not to create any deferred 
tax asset on such Intangibles fully amortised through the Profit and Loss Account. 
	
Further, the Bank has fully charged to the Profit and Loss Account (i) `179.27 crores towards one-time stamp duty 
costs relating to the acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business and (ii) `361.47 crores towards harmonization of 
provisioning and expense policies and/or estimates used in the preparation of financial statements. 
	
Exceptional items comprise (i) full amortization of Intangibles and Goodwill; (ii) impact of policy harmonisation of operating 
expenses and provisions; and (iii) one-time acquisition related expenses. The tables below quantifies and details the nature 
of exceptional items and its corresponding impact on Profit after Tax (PAT) for the year ended 31 March, 2023.

COVID-19
	
India is emerging from the after effect of COVID-19 virus, a global pandemic that affected the world economy for more 
than two years. The extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the Bank’s operations and asset quality will 
depend on the future developments, which are highly uncertain.
	
The Bank continues to hold provisions aggregating to `5,012 crores as at 31 March, 2023 against the potential impact of 
COVID-19 (other than provisions held for restructuring under COVID-19 norms).

Disclosure on Liquidity Coverage Ratio
	
Qualitative disclosure
	
The Bank has adopted the Basel III framework on liquidity standards as prescribed by RBI and has put in place requisite 
systems and processes to enable periodical computation and reporting of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The mandated 
regulatory threshold is embedded into the Risk Appetite Statement of the Bank thus subjecting LCR maintenance to Board 
oversight and periodical review. The Bank computes the LCR and reports the same to the Asset Liability Management 
Committee (ALCO) every month for review as well as to the Risk Management Committee of the Board. 
	
The Bank computes LCR on a daily basis and in accordance with RBI guidelines the quarterly disclosures of LCR contain data 
on the simple average calculated on daily observations over the quarter.
	
The Bank follows the criteria laid down by RBI for calculation of High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA), gross outflows and 
inflows within the next 30-day period. HQLA predominantly comprises Government securities viz. Treasury Bills, Central 
and State Government securities. A relatively smaller part of HQLA is accounted for by the corporate bonds with mandated 
haircuts applied thereto.
	
The Bank monitors the concentration of funding sources from significant counterparties, significant instruments/products 
as part of the asset liability management framework. The Bank adheres to the regulatory and internal limits on Inter-bank 
liability and call money borrowings which form part of the ALM policy. The Bank’s funding sources are fairly dispersed 
across sources and maturities.
	
Expected derivative cash outflows and inflows are calculated for outstanding contracts in accordance with laid down 
valuation methodologies. Cash flows, if any, from collaterals posted against derivatives are not considered.
	
Apart from the LCR position in all currencies put together, the Bank monitors the LCR in US Dollar currency which qualifies 
as a significant currency as per RBI guidelines. 
	
The liquidity management of the Bank is undertaken by the Asset Liability Management group in the Treasury department 
in accordance with the Board approved policies and ALCO approved funding plans. The Risk department measures and 
monitors the liquidity profile of the Bank with reference to the Board approved limits, for both domestic as well as overseas 
operations, on a static as well as on a dynamic basis by using the gap analysis technique supplemented by monitoring of 
key liquidity ratios and periodical liquidity stress testing. Periodical reports are placed before the Bank’s ALCO for perusal 
and review. As per RBI guidelines, Bank is required to maintain a minimum of 100% of Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which was 
applicable for all the quarters for the financial years ending on 31 March, 2023 and 31 March, 2022.
	
All significant outflows and inflows determined in accordance with RBI guidelines are included in the prescribed LCR 
computation template.

Unhedged foreign currency exposures
	
The Bank has laid down the framework to manage credit risk arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposures of the 
borrowers. Both at the time of initial approval as well as subsequent reviews/renewals, the assessment of credit risk arising 
out of foreign currency exposure of the borrowers include details of imports, exports, repayments of foreign currency 
borrowings, as well as hedges done by the borrowers or naturally enjoyed by them vis-a-vis their intrinsic financial strength, 
history of hedging and losses arising out of foreign currency volatility. The extent of hedge/cover required on the total 
foreign currency exposure including natural hedge and hedged positions, is guided through a matrix of internal ratings. 
The hedging policy is applicable for existing as well as new clients with foreign currency exposures above a predefined 
threshold. The details of un-hedged foreign currency exposure of customers for transactions undertaken through the Bank 
are monitored periodically. The Bank also maintains additional provision and capital, in line with RBI guidelines.

Disclosure in respect of Interest Rate Swaps (‘IRS’), Forward Rate Agreement (‘FRA’) and Cross Currency Swaps (‘CCS’) 
outstanding is set out below:
	
An ‘IRS’ is a financial contract between two parties exchanging or swapping a stream of interest payments for a ‘notional 
principal’ amount on multiple occasions during a specified period. The Bank deals in interest rate benchmarks like Mumbai 
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (MIBOR), Indian Government Securities Benchmark Rate (INBMK), Mumbai Inter-Bank Forward 
Offer Rate (MIFOR), Modified MIFOR, Alternative Reference Rates (ARR) and London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) of 
various currencies. Pursuant to RBI guidelines on Roadmap for LIBOR transition all new deals are being offered on Modified 
MIFOR and ARR interest rates benchmarks as published by the regulators of respective currencies. Deals outstanding in 
MIFOR and LIBOR interest rate benchmarks prior to the transition will continue till their respective maturities. 
	
A ‘FRA’ is a financial contract between two parties to exchange interest payments for ‘notional principal’ amount on 
settlement date, for a specified period from start date to maturity date. Accordingly, on the settlement date cash payments 
based on contract rate and the settlement rate, which is the agreed bench-mark/reference rate prevailing on the 
settlement date, are made by the parties to one another. The benchmark used in the FRA contracts of the Bank is ARR of 
various currencies. 
	
A ‘CCS’ is a financial contract between two parties exchanging interest payments and principal, wherein interest payments 
and principal in one currency would be exchanged for an equally valued interest payments and principal in another currency.

Disclosure on risk exposure in Derivatives
	
Qualitative disclosures:
	
(a)	
Structure and organisation for management of risk in derivatives trading, the scope and nature of risk 
measurement, risk reporting and risk monitoring systems, policies for hedging and/or mitigating risk and 
strategies and processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants:
	
	
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from an underlying asset, or from interest 
and exchange rates or indices. The Bank undertakes over the counter and Exchange Traded derivative transactions 
for Balance Sheet management and also for proprietary trading/market making whereby the Bank offers OTC 
derivative products to the customers to enable them to hedge their interest rate and currency risks within the 
prevalent regulatory guidelines.
	
	
Proprietary trading includes Exchange Traded Currency Options, Interest Rate Futures, Currency Futures and Rupee 
Interest Rate Swaps under different benchmarks (viz. MIBOR, Modified MIFOR, LIBOR, ARR and INBMK), Currency 
Options, Currency Swaps and Non Deliverable Options. The Bank also undertakes transactions in Cross Currency 
Swaps, Principal Only Swaps, Coupon Only Swaps, Currency Options, Interest Rate Swaps, Exotic Derivatives 
and Long Term Forex Contracts (LTFX) for hedging its Balance Sheet and also offers them to its customers. These 
transactions expose the Bank to various risks, primarily credit, market, legal, reputation and operational risk. The 
Bank has adopted the following mechanism for managing risks arising out of the derivative transactions.
	
	
There is a functional separation between the Treasury Front Office, Treasury Mid Office and Treasury Back Office 
to undertake derivative transactions. The customer and interbank related derivative transactions are originated 
by Derivative sales and Treasury Front Office team respectively which ensures compliance with the trade 
origination requirements as per the Bank’s policy and the RBI guidelines. The Market Risk Group within the Bank’s 
Risk Department independently identifies, measures and monitors the market risks associated with derivative 
transactions and apprises the Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Management Committee 
of the Board (RMC) on the compliance with the risk limits. The Treasury Back Office undertakes activities such as 
trade validation, confirmation, settlement, ISDA and related documentation, post deal documentation, accounting, 
valuation and other MIS reporting.
	
	
The derivative transactions are governed by the Derivative policy, Suitability and Appropriateness Policy for 
derivative products, Market risk management policy, Hedging policy and the Asset Liability Management (ALM) 
policy of the Bank as well as by the extant RBI guidelines. The Bank has implemented policy on customer suitability 
& appropriateness to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer. 
The Bank has put in place a detailed process flow on documentation for customer derivative transactions for effective 
management of operational/reputation/compliance risk.
	
	
Various risk limits are set up and actual exposures are monitored vis-à-vis the limits allocated. These limits are set up 
taking into account market volatility, risk appetite, business strategy and management experience. Risk limits are in 
place for risk parameters viz. PV01, VaR, Stop Loss, Delta, Gamma and Vega. Actual positions are monitored against 
these limits on a daily basis and breaches, if any, are dealt with in accordance with board approved Risk Appetite 
Statement. Risk assessment of the portfolio is undertaken periodically. The Bank ensures that the Gross PV01 (Price 
value of a basis point) position arising out of all non-option rupee derivative contracts are within 0.25% of net worth 
of the Bank as on Balance Sheet date.
	
	
Hedging transactions are undertaken by the Bank to protect the variability in the fair value or the cash flow of the 
underlying Balance Sheet item. These deals are accounted on an accrual basis except the swap designated with an 
asset/liability that is carried at market value or lower of cost or market value. In that case, the swap is marked to 
market with the resulting gain or loss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of designated asset or liability. 
These transactions are tested for hedge effectiveness and in case any transaction fails the test, the same is re-
designated as a trading deal and appropriate accounting treatment is followed.
	
(b)	
Accounting policy for recording hedge and non-hedge transactions, recognition of income, premiums and 
discounts, valuation of outstanding contracts
	
	
The Hedging Policy of the Bank governs the use of derivatives for hedging purpose. Subject to the prevailing RBI 
guidelines, the Bank deals in derivatives for hedging fixed rate and floating rate coupon or foreign currency assets/

liabilities. Transactions for hedging and market making purposes are recorded separately. For hedge transactions, 
the Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. The effectiveness 
is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge derivative transactions are 
accounted for in accordance with the hedge accounting principles. Derivatives for market making purpose are 
marked to market and the resulting gain/loss is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account. The premium on option 
contracts is accounted for as per FEDAI guidelines. Derivative transactions are covered under International Swaps 
and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with respective counterparties. The exposure on account of 
derivative transactions is computed as per the RBI guidelines and is marked against the Loan Equivalent Risk (LER) 
limits approved for the respective counterparties.
	
(c)	
Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation
	
	
Derivative transactions comprise of swaps, FRAs, futures, forward contracts and options which are disclosed as 
contingent liabilities.  Trading swaps/FRAs/futures/options/forward contracts are revalued at the Balance Sheet 
date with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and correspondingly in 
other assets or other liabilities respectively. Hedged swaps are accounted for as per the RBI guidelines. In accordance 
with RBI guidelines, any receivables (crystallised receivables and positive MTM) under derivatives contracts, which 
remain overdue for more than 90 days, are reversed through the Profit and Loss Account and are held in a separate 
Suspense Account.  
	
	
Collateral requirements for derivative transactions are laid down as part of credit sanction terms on a case by case 
basis. Such collateral requirements are determined, based on usual credit appraisal process. The Bank retains the 
right to terminate transactions as a risk mitigation measure in certain cases.
	
	
The credit risk in respect of customer derivative transactions is sought to be mitigated through a laid down policy on 
sanction of Loan Equivalent Risk (LER) limits, monitoring mechanism for LER limits and trigger events for escalation/
margin calls/termination.

Annual Report 2022-23
	
	
Apart from the above, the compensation structure for MD & CEO and WTDs is aligned to RBI’s guidelines for sound 
compensation practices issued in November 2019 and addresses the general principles of:
	
	
-	
Effective and independent governance and monitoring of compensation
	
	
-	
Alignment 
of 
compensation 
with 
prudent 
risk-taking 
through 
well 
designed 
and 
consistent 
compensation structures
	
	
-	
Clear and timely disclosure to facilitate supervisory oversight by all stakeholders
	
	
	
Accordingly, the compensation policy for MD & CEO and WTDs seeks to:
	
	
	
a)	
Ensure that the compensation, in terms of structure and total amount, is in line with the best practices, 
as well as competitive vis-à-vis that of peer banks
	
	
	
b)	
Establish the linkage of compensation with individual performance as well as achievement of the 
corporate objectives of the Bank

line with Bank’s scorecard while ensuring that the compensation is aligned with prudent risk taking
	
	
	
d)

incentives as part of compensation

employees), with a strong linkage of variable pay to performance. The compensation policy of the Bank is 
approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Additional approval from Shareholders and RBI is 
obtained specifically for compensation of MD & CEO and WTDs.
	
	
Whether the remuneration committee reviewed the firm’s remuneration policy during the past year, and if so, an 
overview of any changes that were made:
	
	
Reserve Bank of India has released revised guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/ Chief Executive 
Officers/ Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff on 4 November, 2019.
	
	
Bank’s remuneration policy was reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Bank in FY 2020-21 
in order to align with RBI guidelines. Key highlights of the policy are mentioned below:
	
	
• 	
At least 50% of total compensation i.e. Fixed Pay plus Total Variable Pay shall be variable.
	
	
•	
Value of stock options will be included in definition of ‘Total Variable Pay’
	
	
•

at 300% of Fixed Pay.	
	
	
•

Variable Pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the Variable Pay shall be paid via employee stock options.
	
	
•	
Minimum 60% of the Total Variable Pay shall be deferred over 3 years. If cash component is part of Total 
Variable Pay, at least 50% of the cash component of variable pay should also be deferred over 3 years. In cases

A discussion of how the Bank ensures that risk, internal audit and compliance employees are remunerated 
independently of the businesses they oversee:
	
	
The Bank ensures that risk, internal audit and compliance employees are remunerated independently of the 
businesses they oversee and is guided by the individual employee performance. The remuneration is determined 
on the basis of relevant risk measures included in the Balanced Scorecard / key deliverables of staff in these 
functions. The parameters reviewed for performance based rewards are independent of performance of the 
business area they oversee and commensurate with their individual role in the Bank. Additionally, the ratio of fixed 
and variable compensation is weighed towards fixed compensation in case of employees in risk, internal audit, and 
compliance functions.

Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes:
	
	
An overview of the key risks that the Bank takes into account when implementing remuneration measures:
	
	
The business activity of the Bank is undertaken within the limits of risk measures to achieve the financial plan. The 
Financial Perspective in the Bank’s Balanced Score Card (BSC) contains metrics pertaining to growth, profitability 
and asset quality. These metrics along with other metrics in customer, internal process and compliance and people 
perspective are taken into account while arriving at the remuneration decisions. The metrics on internal process and 
compliance ensure due weightage to non – financial risk that bank may be exposed to.
	
	
An overview of the nature and type of key measures used to take account of these risks, including risk 
difficult to measure:
	
	
The Bank has a robust system of measuring and reviewing these risks. The risk parameters are a part of the Balanced 
Score Card used for setting of performance objectives and for measuring performance which includes, besides 
financial performance, adherence to internal processes, compliance and people perspectives. Weightage is placed 
on not only financial or quantitative achievement of objectives but also on qualitative aspects detailing how the 
objectives were achieved.
	
	
A discussion of the ways in which these measures affect remuneration:
	
	
The relevant risk measures are included in the scorecards of MD & CEO and WTDs. Inclusion of the above mentioned 
measures ensures that performance parameters are aligned to risk measures at the time of performance evaluation. 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes into consideration all the above aspects while assessing 
organisational and individual performance and making compensation related recommendations to the Board.
	
	
A discussion of how the nature and type of these measures have changed over the past year and reasons for the 
changes, as well as the impact of changes on remuneration:
	
	
The Bank continued to track key metrics across financial, customer, internal process and compliance and people 
perspective as part of  FY 2022-23 BSC. For FY 2022-23, metrics linked to Bank’s strategy, with focus on health 
metrics, sustainability, specifically on capital position and building distinctiveness were incorporated. Further, critical 
deliverables were included to drive progress as per the Bank’s Growth, Profitability Score strategy.
	
d)	
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement period 
with levels of remuneration:
	
	
The Bank’s performance management and compensation philosophies are structured to support the achievement 
of the Bank’s on-going business objectives by rewarding achievement of objectives linked directly to its strategic 
business priorities. These strategic priorities are cascaded through annualised objectives to the employees. 
	
	
The Bank follows the Balanced Scorecard approach in designing its performance management system. Adequate 
attention is given to the robust goal setting process to ensure alignment of individual objectives to support the 
achievement of business strategy, financial and non-financial goals across and through the organisation. The non-
financial goals for employees include customer service, process improvement, adherence to risk and compliance 
norms, operations and process control, learning and knowledge development.
	
	
An overview of main performance metrics for Bank, top level business lines and individuals:
	
	
The Bank follows a Balanced Scorecard approach for measuring performance for the Bank, top business lines 
and individuals. The approach broadly comprises financial, customer, internal processes, compliance, and people 
perspectives and includes parameters on revenue and profitability, business growth, customer initiatives, operational 
efficiencies, regulatory compliance, risk management and people management. 
	
	
A discussion of how amounts of individual remuneration are linked to the Bank-wide and individual performance:
	
	
The Bank’s remuneration practices are underpinned by principles of meritocracy and fairness. The remuneration 
system strives to maintain the ability to attract, retain, reward and motivate the talent in order to enable the Bank 
to attain its strategic objectives within the increasingly competitive context in which it operates. The Bank’s pay-
for-performance approach strives to ensure both internal and external equity in line with emerging market trends. 
However, the business model and affordability form the overarching boundary conditions.
	
	
The Bank follows a Balanced Scorecard approach for measuring performance at senior levels. The Balanced scorecard 
parameters for individuals are cascaded from the Bank’s Balanced Scorecard. The Management Committee or the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviews the achievements against the set of parameters which determines 
the performance of the individuals.
	
	
For all other employees, performance appraisals are conducted annually and initiated by the employee with self-
appraisal. The immediate supervisor reviews the appraisal ratings in a joint consultation meeting with the employee 
and assigns the performance rating. The final ratings are discussed by a Moderation Committee comprising of senior 
officials of the Bank. Both relative and absolute individual performances are considered for the moderation process. 
Individual fixed pay increases, variable pay and ESOPs are linked to the final performance ratings.

Annual Report 2022-23
	
	
A discussion of the measures the Bank will in general implement to adjust remuneration in the event that performance 
metrics are weak:
	
	
In cases where the performance metrics are weak or not well defined to measure the performance effectively, the 
Bank uses discretion to reward such employees. The remuneration is then influenced by the operational performance 
parameters of the Bank along with individual performance achievement.  
	
	
Whilst determining fixed and variable remuneration, relevant risk measures are included in scorecards of senior 
employees. The Financial Perspective in the Bank’s BSC contains metrics pertaining to growth, profitability and asset 
quality. These metrics along with other metrics in customer, internal process and compliance and people perspective 
are taken into account while arriving at the remuneration decisions. The metrics on internal process and compliance 
ensure due weightage to non – financial risk that bank may be exposed to.
	
	
As a prudent measure, for Material Risk Takers, a portion of variable pay if it exceeds a certain threshold is deferred 
and is paid proportionately over a period of 3 years. The deferred variable pay amount of reference year would be 
held back in case of any misrepresentation or gross inaccuracy resulting in a wrong risk assessment.
	
e)	
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the long 
term performance:
	
	
i) 	
Bank’s deferral and vesting of variable remuneration and, if the fraction of variable remuneration that is 
deferred differs across employees or groups of employees, a description of the factors that determine the 
fraction and their relative importance:
	
	
	
For MD&CEO, Whole Time Directors and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank, minimum 60% of the Total 
Variable Pay (including Cash Variable Pay and Stock Options) is deferred over 3 years or such other period as 
prescribed by RBI where applicable. In case the cash component is part of Total Variable Pay and exceeds `25 
lakhs, at least 50% of the cash component of variable pay is also deferred over 3 years or such other period as 
prescribed by RBI where applicable.
	
	
	
The total variable pay for MD&CEO, Whole Time Directors and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank is 
subject to malus and clawback clauses, as defined in the Remuneration Policy of the Bank.
	
	
ii) 	
Bank’s policy and criteria for adjusting deferred remuneration before vesting and after vesting through 
claw back arrangements:
	
	
	
The Total Variable Pay for MD&CEO, Whole Time Directors and other Material Risk Takers of the Bank is 
subject to malus and clawback clauses, which are defined in the Remuneration Policy of the Bank. Detailed 
scenarios under which said clauses can be applied, such as event of an enquiry determining gross negligence 
or breach of integrity, or significant deterioration in financial performance are defined in the Remuneration 
Policy of the Bank.
	
f)	
Description of the different forms of variable remuneration that the Bank utilizes and the rationale for using 
these different forms:
	
	
An overview of the forms of variable remuneration offered:
	
	
•	
Variable Pay: Variable Pay is linked to corporate performance, business performance and individual 
performance and ensures differential pay based on the performance levels of employees
	
	
•	
Employee Stock Options (ESOPs): ESOPs are given to selective set of employees at senior levels based on their 
level of performance and role. ESOP scheme has an inbuilt deferred vesting design which helps in directing 
long term performance orientation among employees
	
	
A discussion of the use of different forms of variable remuneration and, if the mix of different forms of variable 
remuneration differs across employees or group of employees, a description of the factors that determine the mix 
and their relative importance:
	
	
Variable pay in the form of performance based bonus is paid out annually and is linked to performance achievement 
against balanced performance measures and aligned with the principles of meritocracy. The proportion of variable 
pay in total pay shall be higher at senior management levels. The payment of all forms of variable pay is governed by 
the affordability of the Bank and based on profitability and cost income ratios. At senior management levels (and for 
certain employees with potential to cause material impact on risk exposure), a portion of variable compensation may 
be paid out in a deferred manner in order to drive prudent behaviour as well as long term & sustainable performance 
orientation. Long term variable pay is administered in the form of ESOPs with an objective of enabling employee 
participation in the business as an active stakeholder and to usher in an ‘owner-manager’ culture. The quantum of 
grant of stock options is determined and approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, in terms of the 
said Regulations and in line with best practices, subject to the approval of RBI. The current ESOP design has an inbuilt 
deferral intended to spread and manage risk.

to report the comparative financial statements for the financial year 2017-18, to be published along with the financial 
statement for the year beginning 1 April, 2018. However, the RBI in its press release issued on 5 April, 2018 deferred the 
applicability of Ind AS by one year (i.e. 1 April, 2019) for Scheduled Commercial Banks. Further, RBI in a circular issued on 
22 March, 2019 has deferred the implementation of Ind AS till further notice.

required and other processes in a phased manner. The Bank is also submitting Proforma Ind AS financial statements to RBI 
on a half-yearly basis.
	
In line with the RBI guidelines on Ind AS implementation, the Bank has formed a Steering Committee comprising members 
from the concerned functional areas, headed by the Deputy Managing Director. A progress report on the status of Ind AS

Fair Value Methodology
	
In line with RBI clarification on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/Chief Executive Officers/Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function Staff on 30 August, 2021, the Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic 
value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments granted after 31 March, 2021 and consequently 
recognized the fair value of options computed using the Black-Scholes model, without reducing estimated forfeitures, 
as compensation expense over the vesting period. During the year, the Bank has recognised ESOP compensation cost of 
`252.65 crores for options granted to employees of the Bank and recovered `32.87 crores from subsidiaries in respect of 
options granted to their employees and deputed staff.
	
The impact on reported net profit and EPS in respect of options granted prior to 31 March, 2021 considering the fair value 
based method as prescribed in the Guidance Note on ‘Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments’ issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is given below:

No cost has been incurred by the Bank in respect of ESOPs granted prior to 31 March, 2021 to the employees of the Bank 
and subsidiaries which are valued under the intrinsic value method. 
	
The fair value of the options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, with the 
following assumptions:
31 March, 2023
31 March, 2022
Dividend yield
0.26%-0.43%
0.43%-0.64%
Expected life
2.95-4.95 years
2.28-4.28 years
Risk free interest rate
5.46% to 7.13%
4.71% to 5.67%
Volatility
30.95% to 33.02%
30.91% to 33.93%
	
Volatility is the measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period. The 
measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously 
compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time. For calculating volatility, the daily volatility of the stock 
prices on the National Stock Exchange, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding with the expected life of the 
options has been considered.
	
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 March, 2023 is `240.34 (previous year `209.47).
	
Pursuant to the approval of the Shareholders in January 2023, the Bank approved the ‘Axis Bank Employees Stock Unit 
Scheme, 2022’ under which the Bank is authorized to grant Units not exceeding 50,000,000 (Five crores) in number in 
aggregate, to or for benefit of ‘Eligible Employees’ in accordance with applicable SEBI Regulations, with each such Unit(s) 
exercisable into equity share(s) of the Bank subject to vesting conditions. The Units vest in a graded manner over 3 years 
and can be exercised within five years from the date of the vesting at an exercise price as determined in accordance with 
applicable laws at the time of grant and on such terms and conditions as contained in the Scheme.
	
On 24 March, 2023, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank has approved 
the grant of upto 13,100,000 stock options and grant of upto 3,200,000 stock units to eligible employees, there have 
been no allotments of options/units under this grant. Accordingly, these options/units have not been considered in the 
above disclosure.
4.3.	 Proposed Dividend
	
The Board of Directors, in their meeting held on 27 April, 2023 have proposed a final dividend of  `1 per equity share 
amounting to `307.69 crores.  The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. In 
terms of revised Accounting Standard (AS) 4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance sheet date’ as notified 
by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, such proposed dividend 
has not been recognised as a liability as on 31 March, 2023.
	
During the year, the Bank paid final dividend of `1 per equity share amounting `307.14 crores pertaining to year ended 
31 March, 2022.
4.4.	 Segmental reporting
	
The business of the Bank is divided into four segments: Treasury, Retail Banking, Corporate/Wholesale Banking and Other 
Banking Business. These segments have been identified based on the RBI’s revised guidelines on Segment Reporting

The estimates of future salary increases considered in actuarial valuation take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and 
other relevant factors.
	
The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the average long-term rate of return expected on investments of the 
Fund during the estimated term of the obligations. 
	
As the contribution expected to be paid to the plan during the annual period beginning after the balance sheet date is based 
on various internal/external factors, a best estimate of the contribution is not determinable.

Provision towards probable impact on account of Code of Social Security 2020
	
The Code on Social Security 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment 
received Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date 
on which the Code will come into effect has not been notified and the final rules/interpretation have also not yet been 
issued. The Bank has carried out an impact assessment of the gratuity liability based on an actuarial valuation and on a 
prudent basis holds a provision of  `228.26 crores as on 31 March, 2023 (`225.30 crores as on 31 March, 2022). This is over 
and above the provisions made in normal course based on extant rules and as reported in the above disclosure.
	
The above information is as certified by the actuary and relied upon by the auditors.
	
Under the terms of BTAs executed with CBNA and CFIL, the liability as on beginning of 1 March, 2023 (Legal Day One) in 
respect of employee benefits for in perimeter employees who have joined the Bank, arising from the enforcement of Code 
on Social Security 2020 or any other social security legislation shall be borne by CBNA and CFIL respectively, if such code 
is legally enforced within a finite period. Since, the finite period for which CBNA and CFIL are responsible for the liability 
has not expired in the current financial year, accordingly, no provision for the said liability has been made in the books of 
accounts for the said employees.

1.	
the Bank has not granted any advance/loans or investments or provided guarantee or security to any other person(s)

4.14.	 Description of contingent liabilities
 
a) 
Claims against the Bank not acknowledged as debts
	
	
These represent claims filed against the Bank in the normal course of business relating to various legal cases currently 
in progress. These also include demands raised by tax authorities and other statutory authorities which are disputed 
by the Bank. The Bank holds provision of `357.85 crores as on 31 March, 2023 (previous year `297.07 crores) towards 
claims assessed as probable.
 
b) 
Liability for partly paid investments
	
	
This represents amounts remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.
 
c) 
Liability on account of forward exchange and derivative contracts
	
	
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, including non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts, currency 
options/swaps, exchange traded currency options, non-deliverable options, interest rate/currency futures and 
forward rate agreements on its own account and OTC for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments 
to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. A non-deliverable forward contract is a 
currency derivatives contract to exchange cash flows between the contracted forward exchange rate and prevailing 
spot rates. Currency swaps are commitments between two counterparties to exchange streams of interest payments 
and/or principal amounts in different currencies on specified dates over the duration of the swap at a pre-agreed 
exchange rate. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. Interest 
rate futures are standardised, exchange-traded contracts that represent a pledge to undertake a certain interest rate 
transaction at a specified price, on a specified future date. Forward rate agreements (FRA) are financial contracts 
between two counterparties, in which a buyer will pay or receive, on the settlement date, the difference between 
a pre-determined fixed rate (FRA rate) and a reference interest rate, applied on a notional principal amount, for a 
specified forward period. A foreign currency option is an agreement between two parties in which one grants to the 
other the right to buy or sell a specified amount of currency at a specific price within a specified time period or at a 
specified future time. An Exchange Traded Currency Option contract is a standardised foreign exchange derivative 
contract, which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in one currency 
into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date on the date of expiry. A non-deliverable 
option contract is a currency derivatives contract that offers the right, but not the obligation to either purchase or sell 
a currency against another currency and the contract is settled at the difference between the contracted exchange 
rate and prevailing spot rate on the expiry date. Currency Futures contract is a standardised, exchange-traded 
contract, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency at a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The amount 
of contingent liability represents the notional principal of respective forward exchange and derivative contracts.
 
d) 
Guarantees given on behalf of constituents
	
	
As a part of its banking activities, the Bank issues guarantees on behalf of its customers to enhance their credit 
standing. Guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the 
customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations. These are stated net of cash margin held with the 
Bank as on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.
 
e) 
Acceptances, endorsements and other obligations
	
	
These include documentary credit issued by the Bank on behalf of its customers and bills drawn by the Bank’s 
customers that are accepted or endorsed by the Bank. These are stated net of cash margin held with the Bank as on 
the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.

Annual Report 2022-23
 
f) 
Other items for which the Bank is contingently liable
	
	
Other items represent outstanding amount of bills rediscounted by the Bank, estimated amount of contracts 
remaining to be executed on capital account, notional principal on account of outstanding Tom/Spot foreign exchange 
contracts, contracts for purchase of investments where settlement is due post balance sheet date, contingent 
liability relating to undertakings issued towards settlements under resolution plan in respect of non-performing 
assets, commitments towards underwriting and investment in equity through bids under Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
of corporates, and amount transferred to Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF). 
	
	
During earlier years, the Bank, through one of its overseas branches, had arranged Trade Credit (Buyers Credit loans) 
against Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) issued by Punjab National Bank (PNB) and down sold such loans to other banks 
in the secondary market. The LOUs were subsequently alleged as fraudulent by PNB. As on 31 March, 2023, there 
is no funded exposure outstanding in the overseas branch as Punjab National Bank (PNB) had repaid the aggregate 
amount of all LOUs due based on the undertaking given by the Bank and made remittance to the overseas branch 
which was passed on for onward payment to the participating banks. The Bank, in its reasonable and independent 
judgment, did not and does not anticipate any valid claim by PNB against the Bank for refund by the Bank of the 
amounts paid by PNB towards the LOUs and has classified this amount as a remote liability as on 31 March, 2023 not 
warranting any disclosure as a contingent liability.
	
The Bank has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for 
material foreseeable losses. At the year end, the Bank has reviewed and recorded adequate provision as required under 
any law/accounting standards for material foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative contracts) 
in the books of account and disclosed the same under the relevant notes in the financial statements, where applicable.

Previous year figures have been regrouped and reclassified, where necessary to conform to current year’s presentation.

accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of 
reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, the aforesaid 
Consolidated Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies 
Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, read with rules made thereunder, 
of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2023, and of their consolidated profit and their consolidated cash 
flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have

Key Audit Matters
How the Matter was addressed in our report
1
Acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business
Refer Note No. 1 of Schedule 18 relating to acquisition of 
the consumer business of Citibank N. A. (CBNA) and Citicorp 
Finance (India) Ltd (CFIL) as going concerns without assigning 
values to individual assets and liabilities with effect from 
beginning of March 01, 2023 (Legal Day One/LD1) by the Bank.
The Assets and Liabilities are recognized in the books of 
the Bank on LD1. The initial purchase consideration was 
determined and recognized based on the position of business 
assets and business liabilities acquired as at end of day January 
31, 2023. Subsequently, on best estimate of the position of 
business assets and business liabilities acquired as at beginning 
of day 1 March, 2023 the purchase consideration was trued up 
to record a further payable to CBNA at March 31, 2023. These 
amounts are subject to a review of the final closing statement 
in FY 2023-24, which will also be verified by an independent 
practitioner.
Based on the report of an independent valuer, the estimated 
adjusted purchase price of ` 11,949.08 crores is attributed 
to various intangible business and commercial rights such as 
Customer Relationship (including contracts), Co-branding 
arrangements, Business processes / information, Non-
compete rights (collectively “Intangibles”)  and goodwill. The 
purchase price allocation between various intangible assets 
and goodwill involves a significant amount of judgement by the 
valuer and the Management. 
Our approach included understanding the structure of the acquisition, 
determining the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures, and 
conducting the same. 
We have performed following audit procedures for verification of the 
accounting of acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business: 
•	
Review of the Business Transfer Agreements, Transitional Services 
Agreement, regulatory approvals and other related documents 
to obtain an understanding of the structure and terms of the 
acquisition. 
•	
Verification of the preliminary closing statement prepared by 
Citibank India for transfer of assets and liabilities based on the 
position of January 31, 2023 on LD1, best estimates position as 
on March 1, 2023 as prepared by the Bank’s Management and 
subsequent integration post LD1.
•	
Verification of the integration of Citibank’s India Consumer 
Business accounting records into the financial reporting system 
of the Bank including verification of the general ledgers mapping 
between Citibank’s India Consumer Business and Axis Bank trial 
balances, and the process of opening new control accounts. 
•	
Evaluation of the fair value of the assets acquired along with the 
valuation methodology and key assumptions applied. We also 
evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions and estimates 
used in the valuation based on our knowledge of the business and 
industry.

Key Audit Matters
How the Matter was addressed in our report
The Bank has continued use of the intangible assets for 
business purposes. The Bank, as a prudent measure and to 
protect its ability to pay dividends, has fully amortised these 
intangible assets and goodwill in the Profit and Loss account 
for the year.
The value of the purchase consideration, other intangible 
assets, goodwill and the amount payable to CBNA are subject 
to changes based on the final closing statement, which is 
subject to verification by a jointly appointed independent 
practitioner and independent review by the Bank and CBNA. 
Though the Bank has continued use of the intangible assets 
for business purposes, as a prudent measure, the depreciation 
on such intangibles fully amortized through the Profit & Loss 
Account is not considered for tax purpose in the books.
As per the Business Transfer Agreements executed with 
CBNA and CFIL, till final migration, the Bank will rely on the 
Information Technology systems of CBNA/CFIL and data 
residing therein. 
The accounting of the acquisition has been determined as key 
audit matter due to the following:
•	
Materiality and complexities of the said transaction 
including the estimations involved in recognising the 
assets and liabilities acquired.
•	
Assumptions, estimates and judgements used by the 
Bank and the independent valuer for the purchase price 
allocation at the time of initial recognition and true-up 
based on estimated position as on March 1, 2023.
•	
Changes expected, if any, based on the verification of final 
closing statement by the Bank, CBNA and independent 
practitioner. 
•	
Reliance placed by the Bank on IT system and internal 
controls at CBNA/CFIL during the transition period. 
•	
Verification of the accounting treatment for other intangible assets 
and goodwill and tax impact arising out of the allocation of the 
purchase consideration based on the valuation report accepted by 
the Management of the Bank.
•	
Understanding and testing the process of resulting accounting 
effect on various areas such as alignment of accounting estimates 
and policies, NPA identification, classification and provisioning, 
employee benefits, operating expenses, taxation and related 
disclosures.
•	
Assessment of the internal controls in relation to financial 
reporting for the accounting and reporting on the said acquired 
consumer business and reviewing the Bank’s disclosures on the 
same.
•	
Evaluation of testing carried out by the Management on existence 
and operating efficiency of internal control at Citibank India 
Consumer Business.
•	
Evaluation of Management’s assessment on treatment of 
amortization of intangible assets and goodwill for taxation 
purposes.

Information Technology (IT) Systems and controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s financial accounting and reporting systems 
are highly dependent on the effective working of the Core 
Banking Solution (CBS) and other IT systems linked to the 
CBS or working independently. Considering the extensive 
volume, diverse nature and complexity of transactions that 
are processed daily, there is a risk that automated accounting 
procedures and related internal controls may not be accurately 
designed and operating effectively. There exists a risk that 
gaps in the IT control environment could result in the financial 
accounting and reporting records being materially misstated. 
Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that the IT 
applications perform as planned and the changes made are 
properly authorized, tested and controlled. Such controls 
contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data. The 
audit outcome is heavily dependent on the robustness of IT 
systems and controls.  
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit Matter 
as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on technology. The 
IT environment of the Bank is complex and the design and 
operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct impact on 
its financial reporting process. Review of these controls allows 
us to provide assurance on the integrity and completeness of 
data processed through various IT applications which are used 
for the preparation and presentation of financial reports.
•	
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit 
procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration 
the IT systems of the Bank. For this purpose, we obtained an 
understanding of the Bank’s IT environment. As part of our IT 
controls testing, we have tested IT General Controls (ITGC) as well 
as IT Application Controls (ITAC) for selected applications. 
•	
The procedures adopted by us are, in our opinion, adequate to 
provide reasonable assurance on the adequacy of IT controls in 
place. Critical areas for improvement, if any, as and when noticed 
are communicated to the Bank’s Management and the adequacy 
of action taken by the Bank where necessary, is reviewed by us 
periodically as part of our audit procedures. 
•	
IT audit specialists are an integral part of our engagement team.
•	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by Internal 
Audit department, and also the audit of Internal Financial Control 
over Financial Reporting conducted by Operations Health and 
Control Team of the Bank. 
•	
We also tested key automated and manual business cycle controls 
and logic for system generated reports relevant to the audit; 
including testing of compensating controls or performed alternate 
procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks 
that would materially impact the Standalone Financial Statements.
•	
We have also carried out independent alternative audit procedures 
like substantive testing, analytical procedures etc. to verify the 
accuracy of the data generated from the IT system.

Income Recognition, Asset Classification (IRAC) and provisioning on Loans & Advances and Investments as per the regulatory 
requirements
Please refer to Note No. 3.4 of Schedule 18 relating to Asset 
Quality in respect of movement of Non-Performing Assets 
(NPAs) and also Note No. 2.1 of Schedule 18 regarding the 
provisions made due to the probable impact of COVID-19 
pandemic.
The Management of the Bank relies on its automated IT 
systems to determine asset classification, income recognition, 
provisioning for standard and non-performing advances/
investments and for compliance of applicable regulatory 
guidelines issued by the RBI. The Management supplements 
its assessment by availing services of experts (like independent 
valuers, lawyers, legal experts and other professionals) to 
determine the valuation and enforceability of security of such 
advances/investments.
The Bank makes provisions for the performing and non-
performing advances/Investments, as per its governing 
framework which includes Management’s assessment of 
the degree of impairment subject to and guided by minimum 
provisioning levels prescribed under RBI guidelines.
Compliance of relevant prudential norms issued by the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in respect of income recognition, 
asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances as 
well as those pertaining to investments is a key audit matter 
due to materiality, complexity and uncertainty involved and 
the current processes at the Bank which requires certain 
manual interventions, Management estimates and judgement.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating effectiveness 
of internal controls and substantive audit procedures in respect of 
income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to 
advances and investments. In particular:
•	
We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal control 
system in adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding income 
recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to 
advances and investments.
•	
We have tested key IT systems / applications used and their design 
and implementation as well as operational effectiveness of relevant 
controls, including involvement of manual process and manual 
controls in relation to income recognition, asset classification, 
and provisioning pertaining to advances and investments and 
compliances of other regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI;
•	
We have test checked advances to examine the validity of the 
recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined the statement 
of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment provision for 
non-performing assets, and compliance with income recognition, 
asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances in 
terms of applicable RBI guidelines; 
•	
We have evaluated the past trends of Management judgement, 
governance process and review controls over impairment 
provision calculations and discussed the provisions made with the 
top and senior management of the Bank.
•	
We have also relied on work done by external experts like valuers, 
lawyers, concurrent auditors etc. in specific areas.
•	
Critical areas for improvement, if any, as and when noticed are 
communicated to the Bank’s Management and the adequacy 
of action taken by the Bank where necessary, is reviewed by us 
periodically as part of our audit procedures.
Information other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report thereon
The Bank’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the Other Information. The Other Information comprises 
the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the standalone financial statements, consolidated financial 
statements and our auditors’ report thereon and the Pillar III Disclosures under Basel III Capital Regulation, Leverage Ratio, 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio. The Other Information is expected to be made available to us after the 
date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the Other Information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the Other Information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors and Management are responsible for the matter stated in Section 134 (5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give 
a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the 
Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards prescribed 
Consolidated Financial Statements
308
Annual Report 2022-23
under Section 133 of the Act, read with the relevant rules issued thereunder, provision of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation 
Act, 1949 and the circulars, guidelines and directions issued by Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time. The respective 
Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the entities included 
in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management and Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Bank and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group of which we are the independent auditors, to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We 
Financial Statements
309
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our Auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Axis Bank Limited 
(‘the Bank’) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Bank and its subsidiaries companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Bank and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Bank and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) 
of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors, in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bank and its subsidiary companies.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that:
(1)	
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Bank;
(2)	
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank 
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of Management and Directors of the Bank; and
(3) 	
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on consideration 
of reporting of the auditors as mentioned in Other Matters paragraph below, the Bank and its subsidiary companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal controls stated in 
the Guidance Note.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements in so far as it relates to nine subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the matter with respect to our reliance on the work done by and on the reports of the 
other auditors.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
	
For the year ended 31 March, 2023
1.	
Principles of consolidation
	
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Axis Bank Limited (‘the Bank’), its Subsidiaries 
and Associate (together ‘the Group’). As on 31 March, 2023, the Bank has overseas branches at Singapore, DIFC - Dubai 
and an Offshore Banking Unit at the International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), Gujarat International Finance Tec-City 
(GIFT City), Gandhinagar, India.
	
The Bank consolidates its Subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Standard (‘AS’) 21, Consolidated Financial Statements 
notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the 
Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 on a line-by-line basis by adding together the like items of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenditure. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
	
Investments in entities where the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the 
equity method of accounting as prescribed under Accounting Standard 23 “Accounting for investments in Associates 
in Consolidated Financial Statements” and the pro-rata share of their profit/(loss) is included in the consolidated Profit 
and Loss account.
	
Effective 1 March 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank’s India Consumer Business from Citibank N.A. 
(acting through its branch in India) (‘CBNA’) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) Limited (‘CFIL’) 
as going concerns without assigning values to individual assets and liabilities post receipt of statutory and other approvals 
and completion of all other conditions as stipulated under the respective Business Transfer Agreements (BTAs). 
2.	
Basis of preparation
	
a)	
The consolidated financial statements (‘financial statements’) have been prepared and presented under the historical 
cost convention on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles 
in India, unless otherwise stated by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’), to comply with the statutory requirements 
prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the circulars, notifications, guidelines 
and directives issued by the RBI from time to time and the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2021 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. 
Accounting policies applied have been consistent with the previous year except otherwise stated.

c)	
The financial statements of certain subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with notified Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind-AS’). The financial statements of such subsidiaries used for consolidation are special purpose financial 
statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (‘GAAP’) specified under 
section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the companies 
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021.
Financial Statements
327
	
d)	
The audited financial statements of the above subsidiaries/step-down subsidiaries have been drawn up to the same 
reporting date as that of the Bank, i.e. 31 March, 2023.
	
e)	
The financial statements of the Bank’s foreign subsidiary, Axis Bank UK Limited (‘the Company’) are prepared in 
accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards which have been converted to Indian GAAP for 
the purpose of consolidated financial statements of the Group. Following the termination of the Share Purchase 
Agreement between OpenPayd Holdings Limited and the Bank for the sale of 100% stake in Axis Bank UK Limited 
in August 2022, the Company has initiated the wind down of its operations. Accordingly, the financial statements 
of the Company have been prepared on a basis other than that of a going concern. Considering the size and scale of 
operations of Axis Bank UK, the impact of the above is not material on the financial statements/position of the Group.
	
f)	
The Group’s share of net profit after tax for the year ended 31 March, 2023 as included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in respect of one Associate is based on management’s best estimate in the absence of financial information 
of such Associate.
3.	
Use of estimates
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles 
requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
(including contingent liabilities) at the date of the financial statements, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in 
the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Any revisions, as and when carried out, to the 
accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

Significant accounting policies

Investments
	
Axis Bank Limited
	
Classification
	
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are classified at the time of purchase as:
	
•	
Held for Trading (‘HFT’);
	
•	
Available for Sale (‘AFS’); and
	
•	
Held to Maturity (‘HTM’).
	
Investments that are held principally for sale within a short period are classified as HFT securities. As per the RBI guidelines, 
HFT securities, which remain unsold for a period of 90 days are transferred to AFS securities.
	
Investments that the Bank intends to hold till maturity are classified under the HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries/joint ventures and investments under TLTRO guidelines are categorised as HTM in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines.  
	
All other investments are classified as AFS securities.
	
For disclosure in the Balance Sheet, investments in India are classified under six categories - Government Securities, Other 
Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investment in Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures and Others. Investments 
made outside India are classified under three categories - Government Securities, Subsidiaries and/or Joint Ventures 
abroad and Others.
	
All investments are accounted for on settlement date, except investments in equity shares which are accounted 
for on trade date.
	
Transfer of security between categories 
	
Transfer of security between categories of investments is accounted for as per the RBI guidelines.
	
Acquisition cost
	
Costs incurred at the time of   acquisition, pertaining to investments, such as brokerage, commission etc. are charged to the 
Profit and Loss Account.
	
Broken period interest is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Cost of investments is computed based on the weighted average cost method.
Consolidated Financial Statements
328
Annual Report 2022-23
	
Valuation
	
Investments classified under the HTM category: Investments are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the 
face value, in which case the premium is amortised over the period remaining to maturity on a constant yield to maturity 
basis. Such amortization of premium is adjusted against interest income under the head ‘Income from Investments’ under 
Schedule 13 in Profit and Loss Account. As per the RBI guidelines, discount on securities held under HTM category is not 
accrued and such securities are held at the acquisition cost till maturity.
	
Investments classified under the AFS and HFT categories: Investments under these categories are marked to market. The 
market/fair value of quoted investments included in the AFS and HFT categories is the market price of the scrip as available 
from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges or prices declared by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association of India (‘FIMMDA’)/ Financial Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’), periodically. Net depreciation, if any, 
within each category of each investment classification is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The net appreciation 
if any, under each category of each investment classification is ignored. Net depreciation on each type of investments 
falling under the residual category of ‘Others’ (i.e. mutual funds, Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), security receipts etc.) 
is not offset against gain in another class of investment falling within the ‘Others’ category. Further, in case of standard 
investments classified as weak (including certain internally unrated investments) as per the Bank’s internal framework, 
the Bank recognizes net depreciation without availing the benefit of set-off against appreciation within the same class of 
investments as permitted under the extant RBI circular. The depreciation on securities acquired by way of conversion of 
outstanding loans is provided in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Provision for depreciation on investments is classified 
under Schedule-14 ‘Other Income’. The book value of individual securities is not changed consequent to the periodic 
valuation of investments.
	
Non-performing investments are identified and provision is made thereon as per the RBI guidelines. Provision for 
depreciation on such non-performing investments is not set off against the appreciation in respect of other performing 
securities as per RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing investments is not recognized in the Profit and Loss Account 
until received.
	
Treasury Bills, Exchange Funded Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate of Deposits being discounted instruments, are 
valued at carrying cost which includes discount accreted over the period to maturity.
	
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest repurchase price/Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) declared by the mutual fund.
	
Market value of investments where current quotations are not available, is determined in accordance with the norms 
prescribed by the RBI as under:
	
•	
The market/fair value of unquoted government securities which are in the nature of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (‘SLR’) 
securities forming part of the AFS and HFT categories is computed as per the rates published by FIMMDA/ FBIL.
	
•	
In case of special bonds issued by the Government of India that do not qualify for SLR purposes, unquoted bonds, 
debentures, and preference shares where interest/dividend is received regularly (i.e. not overdue beyond 90 days), 
the market price is derived based on the YTM for Government Securities as published by FIMMDA/FBIL and suitably 
marked up for credit risk applicable to the credit rating of the instrument. The matrix for credit risk mark-up for each 
category and credit ratings along with residual maturity issued by FIMMDA/FBIL is adopted for this purpose.
	
•	
In case of bonds & debentures where interest is not received regularly (i.e. overdue beyond 90 days), the valuation is 
in accordance with prudential norms for provisioning as prescribed by the RBI.
	
•	
PTC and Priority Sector PTCs are valued as per extant FIMMDA guidelines.
	
•	
Equity shares, for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the stock 
exchanges, are valued at break-up value (without considering revaluation reserves, if any) which is ascertained from 
the company’s latest Balance Sheet (not older than 18 months). In case the latest Balance Sheet is not available, the 
shares are valued at `1 per company.
	
•	
Investments in listed instruments of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)/Infrastructure Investment Trust (INVIT) 
are valued at the closing price on the recognised stock exchange with the highest volumes. In case the instruments 
are not traded on any stock exchange, valuation is carried out based on the latest NAV (not older than 1 year)

at the Balance Sheet date with the resulting unrealised gain or loss being recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and 
correspondingly in other assets (representing positive MTM) and in other liabilities (representing negative MTM on a 
gross basis). For hedge transactions, the Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of transaction 
itself. The effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge swaps are 
accounted for on accrual basis except in case of swaps designated with an asset or liability that is carried at market value or 
lower of cost or market value in the financial statements. In such cases the swaps are marked-to-market with the resulting 
gain or loss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of the designated asset or liability. Hedge transactions that are 
entered after 26 June, 2019 through rupee interest rate derivatives are accounted for as per the guidance note issued by 
ICAI on Accounting for Derivative Contracts. Pursuant to the RBI guidelines any receivables under derivative contracts 
comprising of crystallised receivables as well as positive MTM in respect of future receivables which remain overdue for 
more than 90 days are reversed through the Profit and Loss Account and are held in a separate suspense account under 
Schedule 5 – ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’.
	
Premium on options is recognized as income/expense on expiry or early termination of the transaction.
	
Currency futures contracts are marked-to-market using daily settlement price on a trading day, which is the closing price 
of the respective futures contracts on that day. While the daily settlement price is computed based on the last half an hour 
weighted average price of such contracts, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on the last trading day 
of the futures contracts or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All open positions are marked-
to-market based on the settlement price and the resultant marked-to-market profit/loss is daily settled with the exchange.
	
Valuation of Exchange Traded Currency Options (‘ETCO’) is carried out on the basis of the daily settlement price of each 
individual option provided by the exchange and valuation of Interest Rate Futures (‘IRF’) is carried out on the basis of the 
daily settlement price of each contract provided by the exchange.
	
Outstanding forward exchange contracts including tom/spot contracts (excluding currency swaps undertaken to hedge 
foreign currency assets/liabilities and funding swaps which are not revalued) are revalued at year end on PV basis by 
discounting the forward value till spot date using Alternative Reference Rate (‘ARR’) curve and converting the foreign 
currency amount using the respective spot rates as notified by FEDAI/FBIL. The resulting gains or losses on revaluation are 
included in the Profit and Loss Account in accordance with RBI/FEDAI guidelines.

recognised as interest income/expense and is amortised on a pro-rata basis over the underlying swap period.
	
Axis Finance Limited
	
The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and highly probable 
forecast transactions. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
	
Cash Flow Hedges
	
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or a firm commitment in respect of foreign 
currency and (ii) could affect the statement of profit and loss. Under a cash flow hedge, the hedging instrument is measured 
at fair value, but any gain or loss that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in equity, e.g., cash flow hedge 
reserve. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in Finance Cost in 
the statement of profit and loss.
	
Fair Value Hedges
	
A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised 
firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular 
risk and could affect the statement of profit and loss. When applying fair value hedge accounting, the hedging instrument 
Consolidated Financial Statements
334
Annual Report 2022-23
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The hedged item is 
remeasured to fair value in respect of the hedged risk even if normally it is measured at cost, e.g., a fixed rate borrowing. Any 
resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item related to the hedged risk is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss even if normally such a change may not be recognised, e.g., for inventory being hedged for fair value 
changes. The fair value changes of the hedged item and the hedging instrument will offset and result in no net impact in the 
statement of profit and loss except for the impact of ineffectiveness.

4.11	 Fixed assets and depreciation/impairment
	
Group
	
Fixed assets are carried at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any.  Cost includes initial

Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefit/
functioning capability from/of such assets.
	
Capital work-in-progress includes cost of fixed assets that are not ready for their intended use and also includes advances 
paid to acquire fixed assets.
	
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of a fixed asset on a straight-line method from the date of addition. 
The Management believes that depreciation rates currently used, fairly reflect its estimate of the useful lives and residual 
values of fixed assets based on the historical experience of the Group, though these rates in certain cases are different from 
those prescribed under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Whenever there is a revision of the estimated useful life of 
an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the said asset.

disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of assets and are recognised as income or expense in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Further, in case of Bank, profit on sale of premises is appropriated to the Capital Reserve Account (net of taxes 
and transfer to Statutory Reserve) in accordance with RBI instructions.
	
The Bank has accounted for the Intangibles and Goodwill, acquired and arising from the acquisition of Citi India Consumer 
Business as per the generally accepted accounting principles and Accounting Standard 26 on Intangible Assets which 
permits amortization over the best estimate of useful life. During the year, Bank has fully amortized through the Profit and 
Loss Account, Intangibles and Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Citibank India Consumer Business. The Bank 
continues to have access and business use for the Intangible assets.
	
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to ascertain if there is any indication of impairment 
based on internal/external factors. An impairment loss is recognised wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s net selling price and value in use. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value at the weighted average cost of capital. 
After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.

the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards to the extent applicable. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact 
of current year timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the year and reversal of timing 
differences of earlier years.
	
Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rates and the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off assets against 
liabilities representing current tax and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to the taxes on income 
levied by same governing taxation laws.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable 
income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised. The impact of changes in the deferred tax 
assets and liabilities is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Deferred tax assets are recognised and reassessed at each reporting date, based upon the Management’s judgement as to 
whether realisation is considered as reasonably certain. Deferred tax assets are recognised on carry forward of unabsorbed 
depreciation and tax losses only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that such deferred tax asset 
can be realised against future profits.

weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year.

shares were exercised or converted during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end except where the results 
are anti-dilutive.

Axis Bank Limited
	
The 2001 Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for grant of stock options on equity shares of the

(‘the Guidelines’). These Guidelines have since been repealed and substituted by the Securities and Exchange Board of 
Financial Statements
341
India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021. The Scheme is in compliance with the said 
regulations. Options are granted at an exercise price, which is equal to the fair market price of the underlying equity shares 
at the date of the grant. The fair market price is the latest available closing price, prior to the date of grant, on the stock 
exchange on which the shares of the Bank are listed. If the shares are listed on more than one stock exchange, then the stock 
exchange where there is highest trading volume on the said date is considered.
	
Further, the 2022 Employees Stock Unit Scheme (‘the ESU Scheme’) provides for grant of stock units convertible into 
equivalent number of fully paid-up equity share(s) of the Bank to eligible employees. The ESU Scheme is in accordance 
with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 and 
in compliance with the said regulations. The stock units are granted at an exercise price as determined by the Bank and 
specified at the time of grant which shall not be less than the face value of the equity shares of the Bank.
	
The Bank followed intrinsic value method to account for its stock based employee compensation plans for all the options 
granted till the accounting period ending 31 March, 2021.
	
As per RBI guidelines, for options/units granted after 31 March, 2021, the Bank follows the fair value method and recognizes 
the fair value of such options/units computed using the Black-Scholes model without reducing estimated forfeitures, as 
compensation expense over the vesting period. On exercise of the stock options/units, corresponding balance under 
Employee Stock Options/Units Outstanding is transferred to Share Premium. In respect of the options/units which expire 
unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options/Units Outstanding is transferred to the General 
Reserve. In respect of Employee Stock Options/Units which are granted to the employees of the subsidiaries, the Bank 
recovers the cost from the subsidiaries over the vesting period.
4.21	 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
	
Group
	
In accordance with AS-29 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” provision is recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation as a result of past event where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are not discounted to its present 
value and are determined based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date. These are 
reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
	
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
	
•	
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the existence of which will be confirmed by occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the control of the Group; or
	
•	
a present obligation arising from a past event which is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.
	
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
	
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and 
if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the 
period in which the change occurs. 
4.22	 Accounting for dividend
	
Group
	
As per AS-4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance sheet date’ as notified by the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, the group does not account for proposed dividend as 
a liability through appropriation from the Profit and Loss Account. The same is recognised in the year of actual payout post

Purchase of Citibank’s India Consumer Business
	
Upon (i) the completion of conditions stipulated in the Business Transfer Agreements (BTAs) executed on 30 March, 2022 
as amended from time to time; and (ii) the receipt of requisite statutory and other approvals, the Bank has acquired on 
a going concern basis the business assets and business liabilities of Citibank’s India Consumer Business from Citibank 
N.A. (acting through its branch in India) (“CBNA”) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) Limited 
(“CFIL”) collectively referred to as Citibank India Consumer Business, effective beginning of day 1 March, 2023 (referred to 
as Legal Day One) without values being assigned to individual assets and liabilities.
	
In accordance with the BTAs, the Bank has on Legal Day One paid an Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price aggregating 
`11,602.53 crores based on the position of business assets and business liabilities acquired as at end of day 31st January, 
2023, and the Bank without prejudice to any of its rights under the said BTAs estimates a further payable of `346.55 crores 
as Purchase Price True Up Amount based on its best estimate of the position of business assets and business liabilities 
acquired as at beginning of day 1 March, 2023. The estimated Purchase Price True Up Amount is recorded as a payable to 
CBNA at 31 March, 2023. Changes, if any, to the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and/or estimated Purchase Price True 
Up Amount, which are subject to review by an external firm and the Bank, upon the receipt of the final closing statement 
from CBNA and CFIL, shall be accounted for in the period in which the actual settlement occurs.
	
The Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price and estimated Purchase Price True Up Amount aggregating to `11,949.08 crores 
are attributable to (i) various intangible business and commercial rights viz. Customer relationship (including contracts), 
Co-branding arrangements, Business processes/information, Non-compete rights (collectively “Intangibles”) and (ii) 
Goodwill on acquisition of the Citibank India Consumer Business. Based on the report of an independent valuer, Intangibles 
(excluding Goodwill) were recognized at `8,714.24 crores and Goodwill at `3,234.84 crores in the financial statements of 
the Bank. Under Section 15 of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, banks are restricted from declaring dividend in the event a 
bank carries any intangible assets on its Balance Sheet. As a prudent measure and to protect its ability to pay dividends, the 
Bank has fully amortised the said Intangibles and Goodwill through the Profit and Loss account in FY 2022-23, even though 
the Bank continues to have access to and business use for the Intangibles. The Bank has chosen not to create any deferred 
tax asset on such Intangibles fully amortised through the Profit and Loss Account.
	
Further, the Bank has fully charged to the Profit and Loss Account (i) `179.27 crores towards one-time stamp duty 
costs relating to the acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business and (ii) `361.47 crores towards harmonization of 
provisioning and expense policies and/or estimates used in the preparation of financial statements.
	
Exceptional items comprise (i) full amortization of Intangibles and Goodwill; (ii) impact of policy harmonisation of operating 
expenses and provisions; and (iii) one-time acquisition related expenses. The tables below quantifies and details the nature 
of exceptional items and its corresponding impact on Profit after Tax (PAT) for the year ended 31 March 2023.

COVID-19
	
India is emerging from the after effect of COVID-19 virus, a global pandemic that affected the world economy for more 
than two years. The extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the Bank’s operations and asset quality will 
depend on the future developments, which are highly uncertain.
	
The Bank continues to hold provisions aggregating to `5,012 crores as at 31 March, 2023 against the potential impact of 
COVID-19 (other than provisions held for restructuring under COVID-19 norms).
2.2	
Axis Asset Management Company Ltd. (the Company), a subsidiary of the Bank, had proactively initiated an investigation 
by independent external advisors into certain allegations of potential irregularities relating to the conduct of certain 
personnel of the said subsidiary. The management of the Company has submitted details of its findings and disciplinary 
action of termination of employment taken against the concerned employees, to regulatory authorities and is cooperating 
with them as required from time to time. Further, pursuant to its independent investigation, SEBI has passed an ad interim 
ex parte order-cum-show-cause notice (Interim Order) against inter alia one of the terminated former employee. Neither 
the Company nor any of its existing officers/employees have been named as noticees in the Interim Order, nor any 
directions have been passed against them in the Interim Order. As the outcome of the independent investigation by SEBI is 
pending on 31 March, 2023, the Company’s statutory auditors have issued a modified opinion, stating that the impact is not 
ascertainable. The Company has assessed that there is no impact of this matter on its financial statements for the current or 
earlier financial years. Next steps and implications, if any, will be determined basis any change from current position in this 
matter. Considering the size and scale of operations of the Axis Bank Group, the impact, if any, on the consolidated financial

Fair Value Methodology
	
In line with RBI clarification on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors/Chief Executive Officers/Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function Staff on 30 August, 2021, the Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic 
value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments granted after 31 March, 2021 and consequently 
recognized the fair value of options computed using the Black-Scholes model, without reducing estimated forfeitures, as 
compensation expense over the vesting period. During the year, the Group has recognised ESOP compensation cost of 
`285.52 crores for options granted to employees of the Group.

The impact on reported net profit and EPS in respect of options granted prior to 31 March, 2021 considering the fair value

No cost has been incurred by the Bank in respect of ESOPs granted prior to 31 March, 2021 to the employees of the Bank 
and subsidiaries which are valued under the intrinsic value method.
	
The fair value of the options is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, with the 
following assumptions:
31 March, 2023
31 March, 2022
Dividend yield
0.26%-0.43%
0.43%-0.64%
Expected life
2.95-4.95 years
2.28-4.28 years
Risk free interest rate
5.46% to 7.13%
4.71% to 5.67%
Volatility
30.95% to 33.02%
30.91% to 33.93%
	
Volatility is the measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period. The 
measure of volatility used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously 
compounded rates of return on the stock over a period of time. For calculating volatility, the daily volatility of the stock 
prices on the National Stock Exchange, over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding with the expected life of the 
options has been considered.
	
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 March, 2023 is `240.34 (previous year 
`209.47).
	
Pursuant to the approval of the Shareholders in January 2023, the Bank approved the ‘Axis Bank Employees Stock Unit 
Scheme, 2022’ under which the Bank is authorized to grant Units not exceeding 5,00,00,000 (Five crores) in number in 
aggregate, to or for benefit of ‘Eligible Employees’ in accordance with applicable SEBI Regulations, with each such Unit(s) 
exercisable into equity share(s) of the Bank subject to vesting conditions. The Units vest in a graded manner over 3 years 
and can be exercised within five years from the date of the vesting at an exercise price as determined in accordance with 
applicable laws at the time of grant and on such terms and conditions as contained in the Scheme.
	
On 24 March, 2023, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank has approved 
the grant of upto 1,31,00,000 stock options and grant of upto 32,00,000 stock units to eligible employees, there have 
been no allotments of options/units under this grant. Accordingly, these options/units have not been considered in the 
above disclosure.
3.6	
Proposed Dividend
	
The Board of Directors, in their meeting held on 27 April, 2023 have proposed a final dividend of `1 per equity share 
amounting to `307.69 crores. The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. In 
terms of revised Accounting Standard (AS) 4 ‘Contingencies and Events occurring after the Balance sheet date’ as notified 
by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, such proposed dividend 
has not been recognised as a liability as on 31 March, 2023.

The estimates of future salary increases considered take into account the inflation, seniority, promotion and other 
relevant factors.
	
The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the average long-term rate of return expected on investments of the 
Fund during the estimated term of the obligations.
	
As the contribution expected to be paid to the plan during the annual period beginning after the balance sheet date is based 
on various internal/external factors, a best estimate of the contribution is not determinable.
	
The above information is as certified by the actuary and relied upon by the auditors.
	
Resettlement allowance
	
Profit and Loss Account
	
During the year ended 31 March, 2023, post transfer of provision towards resettlement allowance on acquisition of Citibank 
India Consumer Business, the Bank recognised an incremental expense of  `Nil towards liability in respect of resettlement

Provision towards probable impact on account of Code of Social Security 2020
	
The Code on Social Security 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-employment received 
Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on which 
the Code will come into effect has not been notified and the final rules/interpretation have also not yet been issued. The 
Bank has carried out an impact assessment of the gratuity liability based on an actuarial valuation and on a prudent basis 
holds a provision of `228.26 crores as on 31 March, 2023 (`225.30 crores as on 31 March, 2022). This is over and above the 
provisions made in normal course based on extant rules and as reported in the above disclosure.
	
The above information is as certified by the actuary and relied upon by the auditors.
	
Under the terms of BTAs executed with CBNA and CFIL, the liability as on beginning of 1 March, 2023 (Legal Day One) in 
respect of employee benefits for in perimeter employees who have joined the Bank, arising from the enforcement of Code 
on Social Security 2020 or any other social security legislation shall be borne by CBNA and CFIL respectively, if such code 
is legally enforced within a finite period. Since, the finite period for which CBNA and CFIL are responsible for the liability 
has not expired in the current financial year, accordingly, no provision for the said liability has been made in the books of 
accounts for the said employees.
3.13	 Small and Micro Enterprises

disputed by the Group. The Group holds provision of `359.18 crores as on 31 March, 2023 (previous year `298.23 
crores) towards claims assessed as probable.
	
b)	
Liability for partly paid investments
	
	
This represents amounts remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.
	
c)	
Liability on account of forward exchange and derivative contracts
	
	
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts including non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts, currency 
options/swaps, exchange traded currency options, non-deliverable options, interest rate/currency futures and 
forward rate agreements on its own account and OTC for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments 
to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. A non-deliverable forward contract is a 
currency derivatives contract to exchange cash flows between the contracted forward exchange rate and prevailing 
spot rates. Currency swaps are commitments between two counterparties to exchange streams of interest payments 
and/or principal amounts in different currencies on specified dates over the duration of the swap at a pre-agreed 
exchange rate. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. Interest 
rate futures are standardised, exchange-traded contracts that represent a pledge to undertake a certain interest rate 
transaction at a specified price, on a specified future date. Forward rate agreements (FRA) are financial contracts 
between two counterparties, in which a buyer will pay or receive, on the settlement date, the difference between 
a pre-determined fixed rate (FRA rate) and a reference interest rate, applied on a notional principal amount, for a 
specified forward period. A foreign currency option is an agreement between two parties in which one grants to the 
other the right to buy or sell a specified amount of currency at a specific price within a specified time period or at a 
specified future time. An Exchange Traded Currency Option contract is a standardised foreign exchange derivative 
contract, which gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to exchange money denominated in one currency 
into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date on the date of expiry. A non-deliverable 
option contract is a currency derivatives contract that offers the right, but not the obligation to either purchase or sell 
a currency against another currency and the contract is settled at the difference between the contracted exchange 
rate and prevailing spot rate on the expiry date. Currency Futures contract is a standardised, exchange-traded 
contract, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency at a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The amount 
of contingent liability represents the notional principal of respective forward exchange and derivative contracts.
	
d)	
Guarantees given on behalf of constituents
	
	
As a part of its banking activities, the Bank issues guarantees on behalf of its customers to enhance their credit 
standing. Guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the 
customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations. These are stated net of cash margin held with the 
Bank as on the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.
	
e)	
Acceptances, endorsements and other obligations
	
	
These include documentary credit issued by the Bank on behalf of its customers and bills drawn by the Bank’s 
customers that are accepted or endorsed by the Bank. These are stated net of cash margin held with the Bank as on 
the reporting date in Schedule 12 – Contingent Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.
	
f)	
Other items for which the Group is contingently liable
	
	
Other items represent outstanding amount of bills rediscounted by the Bank, estimated amount of contracts 
remaining to be executed on capital account, notional principal on account of outstanding Tom/Spot foreign exchange 
contracts, contracts for purchase of investments where settlement is due post balance sheet date, contingent 
liability relating to undertakings issued towards settlements under resolution plan in respect of non-performing 
assets, commitments towards underwriting and investment in equity through bids under Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
of corporates and the amount transferred to Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).

Annual Report 2022-23
	
	
During earlier years, the Bank, through one of its overseas branches, had arranged Trade Credit (Buyers Credit loans) 
against Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) issued by Punjab National Bank (PNB) and down sold such loans to other banks 
in the secondary market. The LOUs were subsequently alleged as fraudulent by PNB. As on 31 March, 2023, there 
is no funded exposure outstanding in the overseas branch as Punjab National Bank (PNB) had repaid the aggregate 
amount of all LOUs due based on the undertaking given by the Bank and made remittance to the overseas branch 
which was passed on for onward payment to the participating banks. The Bank, in its reasonable and independent 
judgment, did not and does not anticipate any valid claim by PNB against the Bank for refund by the Bank of the 
amounts paid by PNB towards the LOUs and has classified this amount as a remote liability as on 31 March, 2023 not 
warranting any disclosure as a contingent liability.
	
The Group has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for 
material foreseeable losses. At the year end, the Bank has reviewed and recorded adequate provision as required under 
any law/accounting standards for material foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative contracts) 
in the books of account and disclosed the same under the relevant notes in the financial statements, where applicable.
