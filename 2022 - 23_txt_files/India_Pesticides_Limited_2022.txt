Revenue 
Concentration 
and liquidity 
aspects
O
If a large customer 
represents more than 
10% of revenues, 
the business is 
exposed to customer 
concentration risk.  
The loss of a large high 
margin contributing 
customer has a higher 
adverse impact on the 
company than the loss 
of a large low margin 
contributing customer.
The two key elements 
of liquidity risk are 
short-term cash flow 
risk and long-term 
funding risk. The 
long-term funding 
risk includes the risk 
that loans may not be 
available when the 
business requires them 
or that such funds will 
not be available for 
the required term or at 
acceptable cost.
•	 Maintains a purchase 
agreement with 
those customers, if/
when found their 
contribution to 
revenue is more than 
10%.
•	 Business Development 
Team gives more 
focus to have 
diversified portfolios 
of customers to shield 
negative impact on 
total revenue if/when 
there is a loss of high 
margin contributing 
customer.
Negative
Inflation and 
Cost structure
R
Influence of inflation 
is inherent in any 
business and thereby 
there is a tendency of 
costs going higher.
The in-built nature of 
longer timeframe in 
projects exposes the 
business to high risks 
of resultant increase in 
costs.
•	 Defined cost structure 
is made as part of 
the agreement. 
Annual & Half Yearly 
reviews are done on 
the cost structure 
for amendments to 
be done based on 
inflation.
Planning and 
Commissioning of 
projects are always done 
on block-wise structure 
to insulate from or avoid 
negative cost impact, 
chances of which are 
high with projects of 
longer timeframe.

Technology 
Obsolescence
O
A process or 
technology used or 
product produced by 
a company for profit 
will become obsolete 
and thus no longer 
competitive in the 
marketplace. This 
would reduce the 
profitability of the 
company.
•	 India Pesticides 
Limited strongly 
believes that 
technological 
obsolescence is a 
practical reality.
•	 Process, product 
and technological 
obsolescence are 
evaluated on a 
continual basis 
through open 
discussions internally 
and with customers in 
market.
	
The necessary 
investments are 
made on R&D to 
keep ourselves 
abreast of the latest 
developments.
Positive
Legal
R
The Company is 
governed by various 
laws, which expect 
the business to be 
done within the four 
walls of the law. Thus, 
Company is exposed 
to legal action, if/when 
there is a deviation or 
negligence.
Regulatory risks, 
Compliance risk, 
Contractual risk, 
Non- contractual 
obligation, Dispute 
risk, Reputational risk 
are taken into account 
during every decision 
making discussions.
Negative
Fluctuations 
in Foreign 
Exchange
R
Currency’s value 
fluctuates between 
when the contract is 
signed and the delivery 
date; devaluation of 
any of the foreign 
currencies against 
the Indian Rupee may 
result in reduction of 
our margins.
India Pesticides Limited 
relies on natural hedge 
to reasonable extent. 
However, beyond the 
natural hedge, the 
risk can be measured 
through the net 
open position i.e. the 
difference between 
un-hedged outstanding 
receipt and payments.

O
Risk of loss resulting

events.
•	 Defined Process SOPs 
are in place.
•	 Frequent on-the-floor 
process trainings are 
conducted.
•	 Back-Up for every 
level of personnel is 
defined.
•	 Internal inspection 
followed by CAPA 
mechanism 
for continuous 
improvement is in 
practice.
	
Inter-functional 
monthly meetings are 
conducted to share 
& understand the 
required support for 
efficient & effective 
functioning.
Negative
Operational 
Efficiency
O
Chances of failing to 
meet a goal due to a 
lack of resources or the 
potential that sufficient 
resources won’t be 
available to meet a 
goal of the company.
•	 Goals are set in 
SMART format.
•	 Human resource 
not only keeps 
everyday observation 
on availability of 
resources through 
attendance records 
but also kept updated 
with forecast of 
required resources or 
existing demand.
	
Rostering of resources 
with rotation and 
change on their 
activity helps to have 
personnel trained on 
multiple activities. 
Thus, delegation of 
work meets becomes 
easily feasible.

O
CoPQ (Cost of Poor 
Quality) can be 
expected through cost 
impacting:
Direct factors such as 
out of specification, 
contaminated or a 
consumer safety risk, 
more scraps, rework, 
re-testing, recalls and 
customer returns.
Indirect factors such 
as excessive overtime, 
inventory shortages, 
planning delays, lost 
sales/opportunities 
also can lead to cost 
risk due to poor 
Quality Management.
•	 India Pesticides 
always choose to 
follow the batch-wise 
production, which 
helps to have more 
control on quality.
•	 Sustainable approach 
through 5‘R’s -   
Reduce, Reuse, Repair, 
Recycle and Recover 
helps us to control on 
our waste, shortage 
and delays.
•	 Annual Capacity 
is calculated by 
taking 10months 
into calculation. Two 
months are presumed 
for maintenance 
shut-down, forced 
shutdown and any 
other unforeseen 
events.
•	 Labs are equipped 
with the choice of 
appropriate testing 
activities, specific 
methods, and 
attributes of the 
testing. Periodical 
check on quality 
control is done 
through calibration 
with testing by 
outsourced centers. 
Thus, it feedback 
credibility, accuracy 
and competency of 
internal QC. 
	
Quality professionals

O
Possibility of frequent

the nature), Zero 
discharge and Waste 
Management are the 
key factors.
•	 Though 
manufacturing units 
are geographically 
located where 
extreme weather 
conditions do not 
occur, care is given 
on constructions 
considering any and 
all environmental 
risks.
•	 Systems are in 
place for zero liquid

treated through, RO, 
MEE, and then Spray 
Dryer.
•	 Solid waste disposal 
is done through 
government certified

at approved location.
•	 Emission scrubbers 
are active for the 
process.

Statement by Director responsible for the 
BRSR, highlighting ESG-related challenges, 
targets and achievements:
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) has gained increasing 
attention over the past few years, with many institutional investors 
investing only in those companies that provide ESG an important 
goal for organizations. Customers and market demands are placing 
increased performance reporting. Meeting Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) criteria has become pressure on corporations 
to engage in more sustainable business practice, and investors are 
increasingly using ESG criteria to evaluate the companies in which 
they might want to invest or do business with. Environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) criteria create a framework for 
helping investors who want to incorporate personal values into 
their investment approach. The ESG screening process identifies 
companies that have built sound environmental practices, strong 
social responsibility tenets, and ethical governance initiatives into 
their corporate policies and everyday operations. ESG processes 
and procedures focus on non-financial performance indicators that 
address a company’s approach towards responsible investment, 
sustainability, its impact on society and the environment, as well as 
other ethical and corporate governance considerations.
