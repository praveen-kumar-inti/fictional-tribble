5. 	 Specific commitments, goals and targets 
set by the entity with defined timelines, 
if any.
The Company has established clear and measurable commitments to enhance energy 
efficiency, promote sustainable manufacturing practices, and adopt low-carbon 
technologies as part of its long-term sustainability roadmap and net-zero ambitions. These 
commitments are driven both by mandatory requirements and voluntary initiatives. On the 
regulatory front, the Company seeks to comply with domestic and global decarbonisation 
requirements applicable to the steel sector, including the Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM), while voluntarily aspiring to achieve Green Steel certification and align 
with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
The Company’s baseline assessments indicate that its operations are energy-intensive, with 
significant opportunities to improve carbon and resource efficiency. These commitments 
currently apply to the Company’s standalone operations, with an intent to progressively 
extend coverage to subsidiaries, associates, and value-chain partners.
The Company aims to achieve measurable reductions in its carbon footprint and energy 
intensity over the medium to long term by transitioning to renewable energy sources, 
beginning with large-scale solar adoption, and by evaluating advanced technologies such 
as Green Hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). The expected 
outcomes include a phased reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, optimisation of long-
term energy costs, and enhanced resilience to future regulatory and market shifts. Timelines 
for achieving these targets are being aligned with national and international decarbonisation 
goals, with certain milestones expected within the next five to ten years.
While compliance with CBAM and other decarbonisation standards is mandatory, the 
Company’s pursuit of Green Steel certification and alignment with SBTi targets are voluntary 
and reflect its aspiration to go beyond regulatory mandates. These measures collectively 
demonstrate the Company’s commitment to environmental stewardship, operational 
efficiency, and contributing meaningfully to a sustainable, low-carbon future.
6. 	 Performance of the entity against the 
specific commitments, goals and targets 
along-with reasons in case the same are 
not met.
The Company has made significant progress against its defined sustainability commitments, 
particularly in reducing its operational carbon footprint and enhancing energy efficiency. 
Key achievements during the reporting period include the phased transition to renewable 
energy and implementation of energy efficiency measures across its plants, such as the 
installation of energy-efficient motors and transformers, Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs), 
and LED lighting systems. These initiatives have contributed to measurable reductions in 
energy consumption and emissions intensity, aligning with the Company’s medium-term 
targets.
However, a few targets could not be fully achieved within the planned timelines due to 
factors such as longer-than-anticipated technology integration periods, supply-chain 
disruptions affecting equipment availability, and evolving regulatory requirements that 
required operational recalibrations.
Despite these challenges, JBIL remains firmly committed to its sustainability goals. Corrective 
actions have been initiated, including revisiting project schedules, identifying alternative 
technology providers, and enhancing internal monitoring mechanisms. By maintaining 
an iterative approach—regularly reviewing performance, addressing bottlenecks, and 
engaging with stakeholders—the Company is strengthening its sustainability roadmap to 
ensure delivery on its long-term environmental commitments.

7. 	 Statement 
by 
director 
responsible 
for the business responsibility report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
At Jai Balaji Industries Limited (JBIL), we are deeply committed to embedding Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into the very foundation of our business strategy. 
We view sustainability not as a peripheral activity but as a driver of long-term value creation 
and operational resilience.
The iron and steel sector is inherently energy-intensive, and we recognise the challenges this 
presents in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Despite these challenges, JBIL has 
set itself ambitious decarbonisation goals. We are actively improving operational efficiency 
and reducing our environmental footprint through targeted energy transition projects, 
adoption of renewable energy sources, and exploration of emerging technologies such 
as Green Hydrogen and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). We have already 
initiated solar power integration in select operations and are in the process of assessing 
other alternative energy solutions to further reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Our medium-term targets include measurable reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions, improved energy intensity, and enhanced resource efficiency, particularly in 
water and waste management. We are committed to aligning with the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) and working towards recognised Green Steel certification, while 
ensuring compliance with both domestic regulations and international frameworks such as 
the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
On the social and governance front, JBIL is equally focused on inclusive, ethical, and 
transparent growth. We prioritise the health, safety, and well-being of our workforce, 
and have strengthened our safety management systems, resulting in improved safety 
performance over the past year. We invest in skill development and capability building, 
particularly for our shop-floor workforce, while promoting diversity and upholding human 
rights across our operations and supply chain.
Governance at JBIL is built on transparency, fairness, and accountability. We maintain regular 
engagement with our stakeholders—employees, customers, investors, regulators, and 
communities—to understand their evolving expectations and integrate their feedback into 
our sustainability roadmap.
As we move forward, our focus will remain on innovation, continuous improvement, and 
strategic alignment with both national priorities such as India’s net-zero by 2070 vision, and 
global frameworks including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By doing so, 
we aim not only to enhance our ESG performance but also to contribute meaningfully to a 
sustainable, low-carbon future for the steel industry and the communities we serve.

3. 	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing 
at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other

Steel typically lasts 25 to 30 years, making it perfect for a circular economy. Its durability and versatility allow widespread reuse and life 
extension. Steel is easily recyclable due to its magnetic properties and can be produced using low-emission technologies. It is genuinely 
cradle-to-cradle, with end-of-life steel seen as an input rather than waste. Jai Balaji maximizes scrap usage, reusing internal scrap and 
sourcing external scrap, demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices.
The Company’s approach to safely reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, and disposal at the end of their lifecycle is comprehensive 
and systematic. In managing plastic, e-waste and hazardous waste, the company implements appropriate segregation, recovery, and 
recycling practices while ensuring any non-recoverable waste is disposed of responsibly. These processes reflect JBIL’s commitment to 
sustainable waste management, environmental protection, and continuous performance improvement.

10. 	Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products 
and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
Jai Balaji Industries Limited (JBIL) follows structured and industry-aligned waste management practices focused on sustainability, 
compliance, and minimising environmental impact. Waste generated across our operations is segregated at source into hazardous, 
non-hazardous, recyclable, and organic categories using colour-coded bins and designated collection points. Recyclable and reusable 
materials are recovered through in-house processes, while hazardous waste is disposed of safely through Pollution Control Board (PCB)-
authorised vendors, ensuring regulatory compliance and traceability.
To reduce the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals, JBIL adopts best practices such as chemical substitution (replacing harmful 
substances with eco-friendly alternatives), process optimisation to reduce chemical intensity, and periodic audits of chemical inventories. 
We also follow Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) protocols, ensure safe chemical storage, and train our workforce in Hazardous Waste 
Management (HWM) procedures. These steps align with green manufacturing principles and reflect our commitment to responsible 
production, environmental stewardship, and continuous improvement.

expectations, assess socio-economic needs, and identify potential concerns arising from our operations. These interactions form the 
basis for designing and implementing meaningful community development programmes that create long-term value while minimising 
any actual or perceived adverse impact.
Grievances from the community are received through direct interactions with our site representatives, local liaison officers, and CSR

closely monitored to ensure responsiveness and accessibility, thereby strengthening trust and fostering a positive relationship with the

Essential Indicators
1. 	 Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback.
At JBIL, a comprehensive and systematic framework is established to efficiently manage consumer complaints and feedback, ensuring 
swift resolution and continuous improvement. Consumers can raise concerns through multiple channels, including email and dedicated 
helplines, which are monitored by a responsive support team.
Upon receipt, complaints are logged, categorised, and promptly assigned to the relevant departments, including the technical team, 
for resolution. For quality or operational issues, field personnel are deployed to address concerns directly at the dealer’s location or 
project site. A structured escalation protocol ensures that unresolved or critical matters are promptly elevated to senior management 
for immediate intervention.
Additionally, regular data-driven analyses of consumer feedback are conducted to identify recurring issues and improvement 
opportunities. These insights are integrated into the company’s product refinement and service enhancement strategies, reinforcing 
JBIL’s commitment to delivering excellence and maintaining high consumer satisfaction.
