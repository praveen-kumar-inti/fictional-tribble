1.
Product Quality.
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Our customers expect us 
to maintain and improve upon 
the quality of our products. Any 
lapse on product quality would 
negatively impact our brand 
value and our market share. 
Opportunity: Upholding and 
improving upon our product 
will enable us to increase our 
market share as well as retain 
our existing customer base. 
Further, increasing use of paper 
products in the food industry is 
an emerging opportunity.
Continuous 
monitoring 
and 
improvement 
of 
product 
quality is required to ensure 
our products have a consistent 
quality and meet the customer’s 
quality expectations.
Positive: 
Maintaining 
product quality would 
ensure that we remain 
competitive 
in 
our 
industry.
2.
Raw Material:  
Wood Availability
Risk 
Risk: Wood is the major source 
of raw material for pulp 
manufacturing. Availability of 
required wood is an issue.
The Company has a well-defined 
Plantation Programme - Site 
specific clones are developed as 
per prevailing soil and climatic 
conditions. 
Convincing 
and 
motivating 
farmers to raise pulp wood 
plantations by development in 
farm forestry.
Negative: 
Shortage 
of wood may lead to 
high cost of sourcing of 
wood.

3.
Energy 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: With increasing scarcity of 
natural resources and increasing 
cost, efficient management 
of energy becomes critical 
for 
uninterrupted 
business 
operations.      
Opportunity: 
Improving 
production process for better 
management of energy would 
not only enable us to improve 
operating margin but also it 
would enable us to reduce 
carbon footprint. 
Our Company has improved 
the 
production 
process, 
adopted better energy efficient 
equipment to optimize the 
energy consumption. During the 
year, through various process 
improvements, the Company 
was able to save 313166 GJ of 
energy as compared to last year. 
Negative: Increase in 
cost of production and 
not 
meeting

child/ 
forced 
labour, 
fair 
remuneration, 
gender 
diversity, 
prevention 
of 
sexual harassment, freedom 
of association and collective 
bargaining 
will 
adversely 
impact 
the 
Company’s 
smooth working & people 
development.
Opportunity: This will help 
the Company to create better 
working environment, with 
involvement and ownership of 
people working in Company.
The 
Company 
has 
in 
place

Environment 
Management
Risk 
Risk: Water is a critical input 
material in our production 
process. We have to also ensure 
that we meet air emission 
& water consumption and 
discharge norms.
Our Company has improved 
production process over the years 
to reduce water consumption. 
Further, it is our constant 
endeavour to increase the use 
of recycled water in operation. 
During the year, through various 
process and improvement, we 
were able to reduce the water 
consumption by 2% in 2023-24 
as compared to 2022-23 and 
by 37% as compared to 2015-
16.   We have online monitoring 
system for Water & Air emission. 
We need to conserve water 
using 3R principle.  For this new 
technology and equipment are 
being explored and used to meet 
Air & Water norms.
Negative: 
Non-
Compliance of norms 
may lead to closure of 
plant.
6.
Coal - Availability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Risk: Availability of local coal 
is limited. Cost of sourcing 
imported coal is high.
Opportunity: 
To 
look 
for 
opportunity to reduce energy 
(Steam & Power) consumption 
to reduce cost .Also look for 
non-fossil fuel energy sources.
We are continuously getting 
technical energy audit done 
and replacing energy inefficient 
equipment with energy efficient 
equipment & technology to 
reduce carbon footprint.  We are 
also optimising using of chipper 
dust in Coal Fired Boilers.
Negative: Increase in 
energy cost due to use 
of high cost imported 
coal.

Casuarina and Eucalyptus plantations to improve wood resource availability.
2.	 Water consumption per ton of product has reduced from 91 KL pt in 2015-16 to 
57 KL pt in 2023-24 i.e., by around 37%. (Target for water in 2023-24 was 57 KL pt

The Company got audit of GHG from external agency.  Based on report, the Company is working for reduction 
of steam & power in plant.  Outside expert are being hired for carrying out technical audit for identifying energy 
efficient motor/ pump, installation strengthening, and required action is being taken to reduce Fossil Fuel 
consumption. The Company has implemented state of art technology to reduce energy consumption.  Process 
operation and monitoring are being done through DCS for energy efficient operation. The Company has installed 
Recovery Boiler where black liquor is burned for producing steam which account to around 57% of total steam 
requirement. The Company is using chipper dust along with coal to reduce use of Fossil Fuel. The Company has 
installed Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) plant where Co2 generated in limekiln is used as raw material 
for making PCC.  This has helped to reduced GHG emission. The Company is working with farmers to plant high 
quality pulpwood seedling/saplings which will help Co2 sequestering. This year target has been set to plant 1.5 
crore seedlings/saplings.
