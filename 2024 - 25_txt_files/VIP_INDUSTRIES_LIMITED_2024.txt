Message from the Managing Director on BRSR
At VIP Industries, sustainability is at the core of our values, shaping how we operate and innovate. As we proudly lead the 
luggage industry with renowned brands like VIP, Skybags, Carlton, Caprese, Aristocrat and Alfa, we understand that our 
responsibility goes beyond providing world-class products. It extends to ensuring that our business contributes positively 
to the environment and the communities we serve.
Over the past years, we have significantly ramped up our sustainability initiatives. Across all our brands, we have implemented 
measures to reduce our carbon footprint by focusing on eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient manufacturing processes 
and waste reduction. We are particularly proud of our eco-collection, which uses recycled materials and minimal packaging, 
aligning with our goal of fostering a circular economy.
In addition to our product innovations, we have strengthened our commitment to responsible sourcing and ethical labour 
practices across our supply chain. These efforts ensure that we maintain the highest standards of social responsibility, 
contributing to the well-being of our employees and partners.
Our community initiatives continue to be a critical part of our sustainability agenda. Through our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) programs, we have engaged with local communities, focusing on education, skill development and 
environmental conservation. This year, we expanded our initiatives to support underprivileged youth through education 
scholarships and vocational training, empowering them with the skills needed to succeed in the future economy.
As we publish our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we reaffirm our dedication to driving sustainable 
growth. We are committed to continuing our efforts toward minimizing our environmental impact, promoting diversity 
and inclusion, and ensuring that we remain transparent and accountable to all our stakeholders.
I extend my heartfelt thanks to our employees, partners, and customers for their unwavering support. Together, we are 
paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future and I look forward to achieving greater milestones in the 
years ahead.

Circular 
Economy
O
With 
the 
depletion 
of 
natural 
resources and rising material costs, 
shifting towards circular economy 
models has become increasingly 
essential.
At VIP Industries, our approach to the 
circular economy is integrated across 
product design, material sourcing, 
manufacturing, 
and 
end-of-life 
management. We focus on reducing 
material waste, increasing the use of 
recyclable and sustainable inputs, and 
designing products and packaging 
that are durable, repairable, and 
recyclable. Our operations emphasize 
resource efficiency by promoting 
reuse 
and 
material 
recovery 
wherever possible. Through ongoing 
R&D and collaboration with suppliers, 
we are transitioning towards a more 
circular 
value 
chain 
minimizing 
our environmental footprint while 
delivering long-lasting, high-quality 
products to our customers.
Positive
2
Product 
Stewardship
R
Low product quality or contamination 
may lead to safety concerns, damage 
the 
company’s 
reputation, 
cause 
financial setbacks, and trigger product 
recalls. Additionally, customers are 
becoming more conscious of the 
environmental footprint associated 
with the products they use.
We prioritize the use of efficient raw 
and packaging materials, aiming to 
minimize environmental impact while 
maintaining high product quality and 
durability. Our sustainable packaging 
practices include a gradual shift 
toward recyclable and eco-friendly 
materials. 
Customer 
satisfaction 
and product reliability are reinforced 
through robust warranty provisions, 
reflecting our commitment to long-
lasting, safe, and high-performing 
products. Additionally, our Corporate 
Social 
Responsibility 
(CSR) 
policy 
integrates 
environmental 
consciousness into our operations, 
supporting sustainable development 
and 
inclusive 
growth. 
Through 
continuous innovation, responsible 
sourcing, and eco-friendly design, we 
strive to deliver products that align 
with both customer expectations and 
our sustainability goals.

Human 
Rights and

supply chain can lead to reputational 
damage, legal actions, and loss of 
business.
VIP Industries conducts audits to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
labour 
laws and human rights policies. The

expectations.

Conduct, Whistleblower Policy, Risk 
Management Policy, and CSR Policy. 
We also ensure timely disclosures

engagement. These committees ensure that the company meets all legal and regulatory obligations, and

SECTION C: PRINCIPLE WISE PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE
This section is designed to assist entities in showcasing their performance in integrating the Principles and Core Elements into 
key processes and decision-making. The information requested is divided into two categories: “Essential” and “Leadership.”
Essential Indicators: These are the minimum requirements that every entity mandated to file this report must disclose. 
They provide a baseline for demonstrating compliance with responsible business practices.
Leadership Indicators: These can be voluntarily disclosed by entities that aim to elevate their practices to a higher standard 
of social, environmental, and ethical responsibility. By reporting on these indicators, entities can highlight their commitment 
to going beyond the basic requirements and making meaningful progress in sustainability and corporate responsibility.
PRINCIPLE 1 Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with integrity, and in a manner that is Ethical, 
Transparent and Accountable.
At VIP Industries, ethics, transparency, and accountability form the foundation of the company’s governance structure. The 
organization believes that sustainable business growth can only be achieved by adhering to ethical practices and being 
accountable to its stakeholders. To ensure this, VIP Industries has implemented a comprehensive Code of Conduct that 
governs the behaviour of all employees, directors, and stakeholders associated with the company. This Code emphasizes 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations while fostering a culture of integrity and transparency.
To further strengthen its governance framework, VIP Industries has implemented a robust Whistleblower Policy. This 
policy provides a safe and confidential platform for employees to report unethical behaviour, policy violations, or potential 
misconduct without fear of retaliation. The company encourages employees to use this mechanism to highlight any 
concerns they may have about the ethical conduct of the organization.
Additionally, VIP Industries has an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy that aligns with global best practices. The policy 
outlines the company’s zero-tolerance stance toward any form of bribery or corruption. Regular training sessions are 
conducted to ensure that all employees are aware of these policies and understand their importance in maintaining 
the company’s ethical standards. Recent enhancements in this area include the introduction of anonymous reporting 
options through the whistleblower mechanism and mandatory ethics training for all employees and board members. 
Furthermore, the company has improved its disclosure practices to provide stakeholders with clear and transparent 
information regarding its financial and operational performance.

PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe
At VIP Industries, we are committed to delivering high-quality products that are not only safe but also sustainable. We 
integrate sustainability considerations at every stage of the product lifecycle, from sourcing raw materials to product 
disposal. In line with this, we have launched a new line of eco-friendly luggage made from recycled materials, demonstrating 
our dedication to reducing our environmental impact.
One of our key sustainability efforts is reducing plastic usage. We have successfully achieved a 40% reduction in plastic 
packaging and are actively exploring alternative materials to further minimize our plastic footprint. Additionally, we comply 
with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations to ensure the proper disposal of waste generated by our products. 
We partner with recycling companies to facilitate the safe and efficient disposal of end-of-life products.

The following capital expenditures (capex) have been made by us to improve the environmental and social impacts 
of our products and processes:
	
(i)	
Replacement of Low-Tension Cables: We replaced low-tension cables within our factory, which has helped reduce 
power consumption due to lower resistance in the current flow, improving overall energy efficiency.
	
(ii)	 Procurement of Electric Vehicle: We have procured an electric vehicle for our Nashik factory, which is now being 
used for internal material movement. This reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, supporting our sustainability efforts.
	
(iii)	 Composting Machine: We purchased a composting machine to process dry leaves into compost, which we then 
use as natural manure for the plants in our factory. This initiative helps reduce waste and promotes sustainable 
practices in our operations.
	
(iv)	 Replacement of Fluorescent Tubes with LED Lights: We replaced fluorescent tubes with energy-efficient LED 
lights in both our offices and factory. This switch significantly reduces energy consumption and lowers our 
environmental impact.
	
(v)	 Procurement of Variable Frequency Drive (VFD): We installed a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) in a 7-ton capacity 
air conditioning unit, reducing power consumption. The VFD optimizes energy use by adjusting the motor speed 
based on cooling needs, enhancing operational efficiency.
	
(vi)	 Implementation of Motion Sensors: We implemented motion sensors at our Head Office, factory shell stores, 
washrooms, and other areas. These sensors help ensure that lights are used only when necessary, reducing 
electricity consumption and contributing to energy efficiency.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at 
the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
All of our plastic packaging materials are covered under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework, which 
requires producers to take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their plastic packaging, including its collection, 
recycling, and disposal. We have registered on the EPR portal, which is a government platform that tracks and monitors 
the compliance of producers with EPR regulations. By being registered, we ensure that we are fully aligned with the 
applicable regulations regarding plastic waste management.
	
Our commitment to complying with these regulations underscores our responsibility in reducing plastic waste and 
contributing to a more sustainable circular economy. Our products are readily recyclable at the end of life.
4. 
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If 
yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan 
submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	
Yes, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for plastic waste is applicable to our company, and we are registered 
with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for EPR. As part of our commitment to responsible plastic waste 
management, we have developed a waste collection plan that aligns with the EPR guidelines submitted to the Pollution 
Control Board.
VIP INDUSTRIES LIMITED

This plan outlines the collection, recycling, and proper disposal of plastic packaging materials used by our company. It 
ensures that the waste generated from our products is effectively managed in compliance with environmental regulations. 
Our efforts aim to reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste by promoting recycling and responsible disposal 
practices, in line with the requirements set by the CPCB and other regulatory bodies.
PRINCIPLE 3 Businesses should respect and promote the well-being of all employees, including those in their 
value chains.
At VIP Industries, we have created a vibrant work culture that encourages passion, talent, curiosity, empowerment, and 
diversity. Within our organization, individuals are given the chance to grow both horizontally and vertically. Our foundation 
is built on core values such as youthful energy, merit-based advancement, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
Our management team is made up of experienced professionals who bring energy, expertise, and a strong commitment 
to our ambitious goal of becoming the leading luggage brand globally. With diverse backgrounds and skills from various 
industries, our team is poised to elevate VIP from a national brand to an international leader. We maintain an open-door 
policy, promoting inclusivity for our employees, former staff, and business partners, creating a unified ‘One VIP community.’
To boost employee engagement, we launched several digital initiatives, including virtual health challenges with gamified 
elements, wellness sessions, online interactions with HR and leadership, and various activities aimed at fostering a fun and 
positive work environment. Over the year, numerous training sessions were organized for both management and sales 
teams. Specialized workshops were held for the product and design teams, and induction training was offered to new hires. 
We also digitized several key administrative processes, including leave management, attendance tracking, onboarding, 
business expense reimbursements, and travel arrangements. These efforts collectively contributed to a positive workplace 
culture and enhanced performance.
In addition, we introduced the VIP Employee Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, 2018 (ESARP 2018), which allows employees of 
the Company and its subsidiaries to receive Employee Stock Appreciation Rights (ESAR). These rights enable employees to 
benefit from the company’s future share price growth, as predetermined, and are settled through the allotment of company 
shares. Our ESARP 2018 Plan complies with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021.

PRINCIPLE 5 Businesses should respect and promote human rights Essential Indicators
We are committed to promoting, protecting, and respecting the Human Rights of every individual impacted by our business 
operations. This commitment is especially focused on ensuring the well-being and dignity of our employees, along with 
safeguarding the rights of vulnerable and marginalized communities who may be directly or indirectly affected by 
our activities.
To uphold these principles, we have implemented robust policies and frameworks that prioritize human rights across all 
levels of the organization. Our Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy provides a comprehensive mechanism to prevent, address, 
and resolve incidents of harassment, ensuring a safe and respectful work environment for all. Additionally, we have 
established various grievance redressal channels to effectively manage any human rights-related concerns raised by 
employees or other stakeholders, ensuring that all voices are heard and appropriate actions are taken in a fair and 
timely manner.
Beyond our internal policies, our dedication to human rights is reflected in our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives, which aim to address pressing social issues and improve the quality of life for marginalized groups. Our CSR 
programs include efforts to improve living conditions in slum areas, providing residents with access to basic amenities and 
fostering a more dignified living environment. We are also deeply committed to promoting gender equality by supporting 
initiatives that empower women, create opportunities for education and employment, and work toward reducing gender 
disparities in the community.
Through these actions, we seek to create a positive impact both within our organization and in the broader society, 
reinforcing our belief that businesses have a responsibility to uphold human rights and contribute to a more equitable 
and inclusive world.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
We are committed to promoting environmental sustainability by striving to balance economic growth with environmental 
conservation, keeping ecological considerations at the core of our business practices. Our approach includes the continuous 
identification and evaluation of potential environmental risks associated with our operations. We actively develop and 
implement innovative strategies to address global environmental concerns, such as climate change and global warming, 
while reducing the consumption of natural resources like energy, water, and raw materials. Our initiatives are also aimed at 
minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and fostering reforestation through extensive tree plantation programs.
In line with these efforts, we have undertaken a series of energy conservation measures to improve the environmental 
performance of our facilities. For instance, traditional high-pressure vapor lamps used on shop floors and street lighting 
have been replaced with energy-efficient LED lights, significantly reducing energy consumption. We have also installed 
timer-based control systems for lighting in specific areas of our manufacturing plants and shop floors to ensure optimal 
energy usage. Additionally, outdated air compressors have been replaced with more energy-efficient models to further 
reduce power consumption.
Our focus on technological upgrades is another key aspect of our sustainability initiatives. We have introduced enhancements 
in forming machines to reduce the heating time of double-station units, thereby lowering energy requirements. To reduce 
air wastage during idle operations, air-saving control valves have been installed across various departments. Moreover, 
we have implemented a temperature control system for cooling tower fans, which automatically switches the fans on and 
off as needed, replacing the previous system where fans operated continuously.
We have also upgraded our infrastructure by replacing old oil-based high-tension breakers with modern vacuum-type 
high-tension breakers to enhance energy efficiency and safety. Furthermore, we have taken steps to promote recycling 
by reusing used stretch wrap film in the molding of accessories, thereby reducing plastic waste and promoting circular 
economy practices.
These ongoing improvements and innovations reflect our steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship and our 
dedication to integrating sustainable practices into all aspects of our business operations.
