Foreword
Dear Partners and Stakeholders,
Amrutanjan stands proudly as a beacon of traditional wisdom and modern innovation, expressing the essence of Ayurveda 
while embracing modern pharmaceutical developments. It is my unique honour, as Chairman and Managing Director of 
Amrutanjan, to welcome you to our first-ever Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR), a monument to our 
unrelenting dedication to holistic advancement.
Our journey has been marked by a genuine commitment to improving the well-being of individuals and communities while also 
protecting the environment. In this effort, we are governed by ideas that reconcile Ayurvedic tenets with the demands of a 
continually changing world. Our business decisions have an impact that extends far beyond our balance sheets and into the 
area of social and environmental impact.
Today, I am delighted to support the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) comprehensive reporting system, known 
as BRSR. This framework illustrates our unwavering commitment to transparency, responsibility, and long-term governance. It 
is more than just a formality; it reflects our conviction in the profound interdependence of corporate entity and the well-being 
of the world and its inhabitants.
Amrutanjan recognises the critical necessity of aligning our practises with the principles of responsible corporate behaviour 
in an era characterised by increasing environmental concerns and heightened social expectations. We heartily support the 
BRSR framework as a catalyst for transformation, propelling us forward on our path to a more sustainable and equitable future.
As we dig into the world of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures, we recognise the need to protect our 
natural resources, nurture our communities, and uphold the best governance standards. Our commitment to the Net Zero 
objective by 2030 demonstrates our determination to reduce our carbon footprint and positively contribute to the worldwide 
fight against climate change.
We consider our stakeholders to be essential partners in this transforming journey. We hope to confront the problems that lie 
ahead by establishing a culture of collaboration and empowerment. Our commitment to sustainable development is not only 
a responsibility we gladly accept but also a means of increasing value creation for our shareholders and stakeholders alike.
This report illustrates our complete approach to sustainability, which is inextricably linked to our overall company strategy. It 
embodies Amrutanjan’s heart and soul, magnifying our mission of encouraging wellness and prosperity for everybody.
Finally, I want to express my profound appreciation to each of you—our shareholders, customers, workers, partners, and the 
larger society—for your unflinching support during this journey. Let us continue to walk hand in hand towards a future in which 
Ayurvedic and holistic wellness principles meet the demands of a modern, linked society, and Amrutanjan’s legacy is not only 
protected but also enhanced for future generations.
With best wishes,
S. Sambhu Prasad
Chairman & Managing Director

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements
Amrutanjan is fully committed to the continuing improvement of our ESG-related initiatives. We are reaffirming our unshakable 
commitment to numerous critical areas, such as climate preservation, responsible resource management, promoting equal 
opportunities, establishing trust, prioritising the needs of all generations, and actively interacting with and supporting our local 
communities. This year, we successfully launched our ESG committee, which plays critical role in driving our company-wide 
ESG goals. As we begin our first entity-level review, we are advantageously positioned to create specific environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) goals in the coming fiscal year. The implementation of the SEBI-mandated Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) has been essential in advancing our organisation’s commitment to sustainability. Through this 
reporting approach, we have been able to demonstrate our tremendous success in decreasing emissions, conserving water, 
promoting sustainable packaging, cultivating diversity, and ensuring transparent governance. These activities, including 
installation of 120 kW solar power plant at Head Office last year, not only illustrate our commitment to sustainability but also 
strengthen our alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By adhering to the BRSR, we are 
able to effectively communicate our sustainability goals and accomplishments to our stakeholders.
