Vulnerability
Climate Change poses risks to 
mining operations. Events like
heavy rainfall may result in 
slow-down in mining activities
and improving our revenues.

NMDC seeks periodic 
renewal of Environmental 
Clearances. NMDC has
also developed project 
speciﬁc biodiversity 
management plans. 
Negative/Positive
 Biodiversity 
Risk
NMDC operates in areas of 
dense biodiversity. The mining 
operations and resultant waste 
may pose threats to biodiversity. 
Any negative impact on 
biodiversity also poses a risk 
of community agitation, and 
legal and regulatory sanctions 
on our expansion plans. 
Opportunity 
We rigorously contribute to 
biodiversity enhancement in 
all o project sites and the 
nearby areas. 
Our Afforestation activities 
presents an opportunity of 
creating carbon sink to 
offsetting our emissions.

Opportunity 
Negative/Positive
Energy 
Risk
Our operations are dependent 
on fossil fuels for running of our 
equipment and other operations.
Our proﬁtability is dependent on 
continuous availability of fuels 
at constant price. Any fuel price
uctuation results into an impact 
on our proﬁtability. 
We constantly monitor our 
fuel consumption and have
introduced several retroﬁts/
initiatives to optimize the 
fuel consumption.
4 
Risk
Negative
Water 
Water usage in operation for 
ore-washing and runoff water
forms tailings which poses a risk 
of nearby land contamination. 
This may result into community 
agitations and regulatory 
interventions resulting into 
reputational risk.
NMDC has also stopped 
wet washing of ores at 
most of the mines except 
Bacheli, hence reducing 
the risk. NMDC is aiming 
to use 100% recycled 
water for dust sprinkling 
in mine sites by 2025.

No
NMDC is always proactive in investing in technology to 
improve environmental and social impact of its products and 
processes. The details of one such interventions have been 
explained below:
NMDC is operating iron ore mines in Bailadila sector. The 
products, i.e., iron ore lumps and ﬁnes are transported through 
K- K Railway line from Bailadila to Vizag. 
To create additional evacuation facilities, NMDC has taken up 
slurry pipeline transport as an alternate mode of transport for 
transportation of iron ore ﬁnes subsequent to conversion of 
iron ore ﬁnes to iron ore concentrate slurry form. 
At the terminal stations, the slurry is ﬁltered producing ﬁlter 
cake (pellet feed concentrate) which is converted into pellets 
used in iron and steel making. NMDC’s Project assume 
signiﬁcance as it synchronizes with the changing scenario in 
iron and steel making, in the way to use the iron ore ﬁnes in 
the form of pellets due to the inherent advantages (physical 
and metallurgical) that helps in increasing the productivity of 
steel plants. 
In this mode of pipeline transport, the pipeline is laid below 
ground. Therefore, after completion of laying of pipeline, the 
existing activity like agricultural activities can be resumed. Only 
permanent structures cannot be constructed on the pipeline 
corridor. In case of transport by rail mode, due to laying of 
railway tracks, land usage gets completely converted. 
During the process of preparation of iron ore concentrate low 
grade slimes which are lying as waste are also beneﬁciated 
and converted into iron ore concentrate thereby reducing the 
wastage of ore. 
The rail transport is subject to good weather, whereas pipeline 
transport is not dependent on weather conditions. Iron ore 
mines are located in remote areas. It is not possible to lay 
railway lines at all places. In such situations, slurry pipeline 
transport is a viable solution. 
In the ﬁrst phase, NMDC has taken up laying 135 km from 
Bailadila to Nagarnar which will be further extended by laying 
additional 300 km slurry pipeline system.

4. Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation.
 
Presently, dry screening operations are being carried out at the iron ore mining complex of Donimalai 
and Kirandul and Deposit-10/11A of Bacheli complex. Hence, there is no discharge from the screening 
plants. The wet screening operations are being carried out at the Screening Plant of Deposit-5, Bacheli 
complex during monsoons season for a period of 80 to 90 days. After beneﬁciation of ore, the tailings 
generated from thickener is discharged into Tailing dam-1 for settlement of tailings and clear water is 
discharged through decanting pipe. The Tailing dam was also constructed at Panna Diamond Mining 
Project for settlement of kimberlite tailings discharge at RPH (Re-circulation Pump House). Further, to 
control ow of suspended solids into natural stream from surface runoff from mining operations, etc 
during monsoon season, a number of check dams have been constructed at various nalla courses. The 
efuent treatment plants and Sewerage Treatment plants have also been constructed at all mining 
complexes.
 
It is essential to highlight that throughout the process, no water seepage has been observed within any 
part of the project area. This diligent approach of zero liquid discharge ensures the integrity of the 
environmental safeguards implemented in the mining operation.

We at NMDC are committed to reducing waste in our iron ore mining process. Our process generates 
waste in the form of low-grade iron ore which is stored in tailing dams. As part of our sustainability 
journey, we aim to implement the 3 R strategy in earnest. To do that, we are exploring technological 
solutions to increase the utilization of low-grade iron. We are undertaking measures to reduce the waste 
generated and reuse the by-products. Blending low grade ore is one of the waste reduction and 
resource conservation strategies. Blending low grade ore with less than 55 Fe has achieved a 16% 
success rate.
 
The hazardous waste generated at our projects includes waste oil, used lubricants, and grease-soaked 
cotton cloths used for cleaning HEMMs. As prescribed by the Govt. of India in the Hazardous Waste

(Management, Handling & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, we dispose of hazardous waste 
through due auctions to authorized vendors.  We have installed a 10KLD biomedical waste incinerator 
at our Bacheli complex.
 
Most of the waste generated during mining is in the form of solid rocks and minerals known as 
overburden. This waste is dumped in designated waste dumps at each site. These dumps also receive 
slime waste from slurry pipelines. This is a traditional form of waste disposal in the mining sector. 
However, it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of these tailing dams. The stability of the waste 
dumps can be affected due to their design, surface run-off, etc. Therefore, we have undertaken 
measures to strengthen the stability of the tailing dams. We have also established organic waste 
convertors at all our projects. The tailing dams are initially proposed to and approved by the Indian 
Bureau of Mines. These tailing dams are in areas without vegetation and a considerable distance from 
freshwater bodies.

Diamond Mining project, Panna is situated adjacent panna Tiger Reserve and falls in Gangau wildlife 
Sanctuary. The mining operations are limited to a single pit which is going vertically downwards and 
present working benches are at a depth of about 120 meters. Due to blasting being conducted at a 
depth of 120 meters and use of bottom initiation technique, the vibration and noise are under control. 
The report of the task force submits that the noise levels at the pit collar at the of blasting was about 
62 db(A). The report also mentions that a few langoors sitting on the edge of the pit were unfazed by 
the blasting. All the environmental quality parameters like water, air, noise etc. are regularly measured 
in and around the mine and are found well in control. DMP, Panna has been operating since last 
55 years much long before notiﬁcation of Eco Sensitive zones. No incidence has occurred till date. The 
impact of DMP on PTR has been summarized by the having members from NTCA and PTR as well. The 
committee in their 10th meeting expressed satisfaction with the safeguard measures being taken by the 
DMP management their view is quoted below
 
The mining operation have not hindered the growth of tiger population in any way. The mining 
operation of NMDC is conﬁned to the closed area of 275.96 ha of land which is a very meagre area. 
Members also discussed about the positive impact of the NMDC on the local community through CSR

Initiative
undertaken
 NMDC is operating six iron ore deposits in the Bailadila Sector 
of Chhattisgarh. Thus, a 135 km long slurry pipeline has been 
constructed for iron ore evacuation with an estimated cost of 
800 crores from Bailadila to Nagarnar. Presently, the major 
portion of the iron ore production from the Bailadila sector is 
evacuated through the KK Railway line. This limits iron ore 
production since more than 30 MPTA cannot be transported 
through railways. To reduce dependence on Railways, NMDC 
has taken up alternate mode of evacuation to transport iron ore 
ﬁnes in slurry form. The Slurry Pipeline Project taken up by 
NMDC also helps gainful utilisation of iron ore slimes after 
converting the same into iron ore concentrate (in slurry form) by 
beneﬁciation. In this mode of pipeline transport, the pipeline is 
laid below ground. Therefore, after completion of the laying of 
the pipeline, the existing activity, like agricultural activities, can 
be resumed.  Only permanent structures cannot be constructed 
on the pipeline corridor. During the preparation of iron ore 
concentrate, low-grade slimes which are lying as waste are also 
beneﬁciated and converted into iron ore concentrate thereby 
reducing the wastage of ore. The project is downstream and will 
be economically beneﬁcial and enhance the efﬁciency in 
producing iron ore. This project has also beneﬁted the local 
population by creating employment opportunities. In the ﬁrst 
phase, NMDC laid 135 km from Bailadila to Nagarnar, which 
will be further extended up to Vizag by laying an additional 
300 km slurry pipeline system.
