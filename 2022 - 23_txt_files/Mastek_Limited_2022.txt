24.	 Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues.
	
(Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social 
matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt 
or mitigate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format)
Sr.

Material issue

Indicate 
whether risk or 
opportunity (R/O)
Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity
1
Aged Building
Risk
Few identified offices 
of the Company are 
situated in buildings 
that are more than 30 
years old posing health 
and safety risk to 
employees and third 
parties visiting these 
offices.
Company is limiting and/ or reducing the 
risk probability by continuing analysing 
unsafe areas within the building, monitoring 
the movement of material and individuals, 
institutionalising multiple exit paths, and 
enabling effective response strategy in case 
of a mishap. Company is in constant touch 
with building owner who is a Government 
authority to carry out structural repairs and 
maintenance work in the building.
Negative implications 
as any single event 
may cause serious 
injury to an individual.
2
Skill availability 
and retention
Risk, 
Opportunity
Growing market with 
newer business models 
require specific 
skills with lesser 
lead time. This gets 
further challenging 
as the organisations 
are adopting remote 
or hybrid ways of 
working. At the 
same time, this is an 
opportunity to source 
talent from newer 
locations not tried 
before, opening up 
a much wider talent 
landscape.
Company continues to evolve ways to 
engage and cross-skill or upskill individuals 
in emerging technologies and skills that 
are in demand or may potentially come in 
demand given the evolving business models 
and customer needs. Company understands
the needs of newer generation and strives 
to offer a work culture that excites 
and provides greater autonomy and 
empowerment.
For more details, please read ‘Unlocking 
our People Value’ in Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis Report.
Positive as a broader 
talent pool can be 
tapped. Negative 
owing to increase in 
choices available to 
an individual in the 
market.

Cyber Security  
and Privacy 
incidents
Risk, 
Opportunity
Covid-19 pandemic 
forced the industry 
to adopt and allow 
its workforce to work 
remotely, which 
expose the Company, 
its network and 
systems to the risk of 
cyber security threats.
Company continues to maintain systems and 
processes that reduce the probability of a 
threat occurring by applying Zero Trust
Security framework. We have attested on 
ISO 27001 by independent firm and are 
compliant with SSAE 18 SOC 1 and SOC 2. 
These systems and processes are monitored 
internally and externally and benchmarked 
against best industry practices.
As per the General Data Protection 
Regulation, its not mandatory to appoint a 
Data Protection Officer (DPO) for our size of 
business, however, Company still
appointed a DPO in 2020 itself to ensure 
data privacy remains our key priority. 
Company is conscious of its obligations both 
as a controller and processor of data.
Positive implications 
as strong cyber 
security and privacy 
framework instils 
confidence/ trust in 
our clients. Negative
implications in case 
of an unauthorised 
breach.

Statement by director responsible for 
the Business Responsibility Report, 
highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements (Listed entity 
has flexibility regarding the placement of 
this disclosure)
Mastek remains deeply invested in Environment (E), Social (S), and Governance (G), the 
three pillars of the Sustainability Framework. Board independence and governance, 
ethical business conduct, shareholder transparency, etc., which form key attributes 
under G, have been Mastek’s hallmark since its listing in 1982. Mastek Foundation 
for CSR, another key aspect under S, was established with the goal of “Informed 
Giving, Responsible Receiving” more than two decades ago. We have been consistently 
working towards reducing waste, efficient water and energy usage as part of E for 
many years. 
With this solid background, onboarding ESG and incorporating benchmark metrics 
was the natural next step. Mastek’s Sustainability Framework adopts and aligns with 
United Nation’s five SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) i.e., Quality Education in 
the communities it engages (SDG 4), promoting Gender Equality amongst its workforce 
(SDG 5), provide Clean Water and Sanitation Facilities (SDG 6), provide Decent Work 
and Economic Growth (SDG 8) and Climate Action (SDG 13). We are progressing well on 
CSR, covering various initiatives, including granting financial aid to at least 10 charity 
organisations across 5 states in India, benefitting 47000 individuals and 150 birds/ 
animals. We organise a quarterly Gratitude is Attitude event, bringing together all 
employees and charities to present themselves with donations from the employees. 
Gratitude is Attitude saw 40% participation from Mastekeers in India. Under Social 
Value in the UK, Mastek supported a number of bootcamps, and hosted multiple events 
for disadvantaged individuals to help them in various ways, including a CV workshop, 
recruitment, or a discovery day at our offices. Carbon Net-Zero Emissions assessment 
and benchmarking were undertaken for the UK office. We have committed to being 
Net Zero by 2030 in the UK. We are already offsetting 100% of carbon emissions in 
the UK as of 2022. Our offices in India are accredited with ISO 14001 – Environment 
Management System and ISO 45001 – Occupational Health & Safety Management 
System. There has been a drastic reduction in electricity consumption, total GHG 
emissions, and water consumption. We have partnered with One Tree Planted, a not-
for-profit NGO and the official partner of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem 
Restoration, to boost the environmental agenda and occasionally ensure employee 
engagement through their services.
