Yes, IRMEL has put into operation an Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS). This system is 
crafted with the intent to safeguard the well-being and safety of all individuals involved in its operations, including 
employees, contractors, and visitors. The OHSMS encompasses several crucial areas:
 
 
Risk Management: This involves the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of potential hazards in the workplace to 
avert accidents and health-related issues.
 
 
Compliance: IRMEL ensures strict adherence to both local and national health and safety regulations and standards.
 
 
Training and Awareness: Regular training sessions and awareness drives are conducted for all employees to foster a 
culture of safety.
 
 
Emergency Preparedness and Response: IRMEL has in place plans and procedures to effectively manage emergency 
situations. This includes evacuation plans, first aid provisions, and crisis management strategies.
 
 
Health Surveillance: IRMEL runs programs to monitor and safeguard employee health. These include regular medical 
check-ups, health risk assessments, and support for mental health.
 
 
Incident Investigation and Reporting: Mechanisms are in place for reporting, investigating, and analysing workplace 
incidents and accidents to prevent them from happening again.
 
 
Continuous Improvement: Regular audits are conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the OHSMS and to integrate 
the latest best practices in occupational health and safety.
 
 
Worker Participation: Employees are actively involved in safety committees and decision-making processes related to 
health and safety matters.

both regular and irregular activities. Everyone at IRMEL workplaces, including visitors, subcontractors, and suppliers, is 
involved in these processes, which are implemented both routinely and non-routinely to cater to the specific needs and 
dynamic nature of operations.
 
 
IRMEL has established procedures to:

Corporate Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
 
 
Evaluate Risks: Assessment of the risk levels and impacts of identified hazards to pinpoint those that pose significant 
HSE risks. This risk/impact assessment considers both the severity of potential consequences and the likelihood of 
their occurrence.
 
 
Implement Control Measures: Timely and effective control measures are implemented to reduce risks/impacts to a 
tolerable level, known as ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). ALARP represents a risk level that IRMEL can accept 
considering its legal obligations and internal policies.
 
 
To assist in hazard identification and risk assessment, IRMEL approaches on both routine and non-routine bases:
 
 
Routine Basis: Activities include Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Site Specific Risk Assessment (SSRA), 
Safety Audits and inspections, Risk mapping (HCA), and Safety training & drills.
 
 
Non-Routine Basis: Activities include Hazard and Operability (HAZOP), Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), 
Management of Change (MoC), Pre-Start Safety Review (PSSR) and Incident Investigation.
 
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report work related hazards and to remove themselves from such 
risks. (Y/N)

aim to create a safer working environment by actively involving all employees in the identification and mitigation of risks.
 
 
These measures include:
 
 
Incident Reporting and Investigation System: This system allows employees to report any incidents, including near-
misses, injuries, and accidents. Each report triggers a formal investigation to identify the root causes and develop 
corrective actions. This system aids in understanding specific risks and preventing similar incidents in the future.
 
 
Unsafe Act and Conditions Reporting System: This proactive system encourages employees to report any unsafe 
conditions or behaviors they observe. This allows the company to address potential hazards before they result in incidents.
 
 
Safety Alerts: Key findings and lessons learned from reported incidents and investigations are disseminated among all 
employees through safety alerts. These alerts serve to educate and remind staff about essential safety practices and the 
importance of compliance with established safety protocols.
 
d.

assessments for employees.
 
 
Insurance Scheme: IRMEL provides insurance benefits, including Mediclaim Insurance and Group Personal Accident 
Insurance. These benefits offer financial protection in the event of medical emergencies or accidents.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace. 
IRMEL places the utmost importance on the health and safety of its employees, properties, and the environment. This is 
reflected in its comprehensive Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) policy. To maintain a safe workplace, IRMEL strictly 
adheres to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in all areas, including design, operations, maintenance, and modifications. 
Before any critical task is undertaken, it is thoroughly reviewed through work permits. This ensures that all prerequisites are 
met and that Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements are complied with. IRMEL also takes steps to educate the 
public about natural gas safety. This is done through outreach programs and by providing information on how to recognize 
and report gas leaks. Regular inspections and maintenance of gas pipelines, equipment, and other assets are carried out 
to ensure they are in good working order. This helps to prevent potential accidents caused by equipment failure. IRMEL 
conducts regular annual health checks for all its employees, emphasizing the importance of proactive health management.

significant risks / concerns arising from assessments of health & safety practices and working conditions.
IRMEL has put in place Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for reporting and investigating incidents. This ensures that 
any corrective actions needed as a result of these incidents are implemented uniformly across all locations. Investigations are 
carried out by expert third-party investigators, and the results of these investigations are used to update corrective actions in 
a timely manner to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.
To minimize damage to gas pipelines caused by third-party activities, IRMEL uses GIS mapping and a mobile software for 
‘Dial before Dig’ and incident reporting.
IRMEL has also implemented a robust, fully controlled CNG operation through the SCADA system. This system is overseen by 
a centralized control room, ensuring the safe operation of CNG/LCNG operations.
In addition, IRMEL communicates natural gas safety messages to the public and PNG customers. This is done through safety 
awareness programs, radio, and SMS messages.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes. 
IRMEL upholds rigorous waste management protocols. The primary focus of IRMEL is on the safe handling and disposal of 
hazardous materials, including lube oil for CNG compressors, which is a significant component of the limited hazardous 
waste generated by the operations.
To ensure safety and compliance, IRMEL has procedures in place for the management of hazardous waste, e-waste, and 
other types of waste. These procedures involve careful separation of scrap/lube oil, which is then stored in dedicated storage 
facilities. Hazardous wastes undergo handling, segregation, storage, and transportation in line with applicable regulatory 
requirements and best industry practices.
IRMEL also has a resource conservation policy in effect, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations on natural resources, 
waste, and land. This policy promotes the use of technologies to minimize specific waste generation and toxicity.
All waste materials are directed to vendors approved by the State Pollution Control Board. These vendors are tasked with 
either recycling the waste or disposing of it in an environmentally friendly manner. The disposal of hazardous waste is carried 
out through authorized recycling vendors, as mandated by regulation, ensuring that the waste management of IRMEL is both 
effective and environmentally responsible.

if any, may be provided along-with 
summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
Electric charging station
IRMEL has developed electric vehicle 
(EV) charging stations alongside its 
CNG stations, providing customers 
with multiple fuel options at a single 
location. This integrated approach 
has been well-received by customers 
and demonstrates IRM Energy’s 
commitment to supporting the 
transition to greener mobility.
This forward-thinking approach has 
received positive responses from 
customers, who appreciate the 
convenience and environmental 
consciousness of having multiple eco-
friendly fuelling options available.
2
Shifting from Diesel driven 
HCV to CNG driven HCV for 
fleet operations
To reduce harmful emissions, IRMEL 
has started transitioning its fleet of 
heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) 
from diesel to CNG.
This strategic shift not only assists in 
maintaining a healthier environment 
but also yields positive impacts on 
operational parameters within the 
transportation sector, such as improved 
mileage and reduced fuel costs. By 
embracing cleaner fuel alternatives, 
the company exemplifies its dedication 
to sustainable practices while 
simultaneously enhancing operational 
efficiency.
3
Incident Reporting Module 
(Android & Web)
The Company has developed a 
cutting-edge Web and Android-

reducing environmental impact, the 
company has installed two engine-
driven CNG compressors that utilize 
PNG (Piped Natural Gas) as fuel 
instead of the conventional High-
Speed Diesel (HSD).
This transition has resulted in a significant 
reduction in particulate matter (PM) and 
greenhouse gas emissions, improved 
energy efficiency, and decreased 
dependence on more polluting fossil 
fuels.
5
Solar Park
The Company has established a 
captive solar facility with a capacity 
of 3.123 MW (DC) to power 23 CNG 
stations in the Banaskantha region.
This renewable energy initiative has 
facilitated a 37% transition to clean 
energy in the electricity consumption of 
these CNG stations, marking a significant 
step towards embracing sustainable 
energy sources and reducing the 
company’s carbon footprint.

environment. The primary sources of these impacts are the distribution of natural gas and the construction and upkeep 
of infrastructure. These processes can lead to air and water contamination, as well as the emission of greenhouse gases, 
potentially intensifying climate change and damaging local ecosystems. In response to these issues, the company has put 
into action several strategies for mitigation and adaptation. These include investments in renewable energy, advancements 
in technology, monitoring of environmental impacts, engagement with local communities, and adherence to regulatory 
standards. This approach ensures a commitment to environmental stewardship while maintaining operational efficiency.
