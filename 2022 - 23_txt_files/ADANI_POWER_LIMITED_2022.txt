1
Occupational 
health and 
safety
Risk
Employee 
and 
worker 
well-
being and safety is integral to 
APL. Jeopardizing the health 
and safety can not only impact 
the 
productivity, 
as 
well 
as 
profitability, but also affect the 
employee and worker morale. 
Foster a safe working environment and ensure 
zero harm. Hazards and risks are identified on a 
periodic basis, and mitigation as well as prevention 
plans are implemented. Further, for employee and 
worker well-being, regular trainings on health and 
safety are provided.
We have performed a 
qualitative 
assessment 
and 
identified 
that 
this material topic has 
negative 
implications 
on our operations and 
business 
activities. 
However, we at Adani 
have 
built 
Integrated 
management 
systems 
(IMS) that support in 
mitigating any risk. We 
have 
also 
designed 
controls 
that 
support 
in 
converting 
risks 
to 
opportunities 
through 
continuous 
collaborations 
and 
learnings.
Biodiversity
Risk
Reducing the impact of business 
operation on biodiversity and 
focus on optimization of natural 
resources to avoid negatively

The approach in managing biodiversity impacts at 
the operation and construction sites is built upon 
three major principles outlined in the Biodiversity 
Policy 
and 
embedded 
in 
the 
Biodiversity 
Assessment process
3
Regulatory 
Compliance
Risk
Failure to comply with regulatory 
requirements

compliances applicable for respective business 
functions at defined frequencies. Disciplinary 
measures and reinforcement mechanisms are 
also defined.

and 
behaviour

damages. It also puts stakeholder 
trust 
and 
the 
Company’s 
leadership position at risk
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Code of 
Conduct, Whistleblower Policy, and other ESG 
policies provide detailed guidance on ethical 
conduct and mitigate the risk of non-compliance.

•	 Using digitization to improve monitoring and reduce losses
•	 Awareness creation related to energy conservation and GHG reduction
•	 Replacing high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerant with lower GWP refrigerant
	
APL aims to lead India’s initiatives in achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets by evaluating the 
possibility of potential implementation of ammonia as a fuel in thermal power generation that will utilize 
Green Hydrogen-derived ammonia in the existing thermal power plant. Kowa supported APL by conducting 
a global survey of hydrogen and ammonia-related technologies being utilised for power generation. IHI 
Corporation has already successfully demonstrated its ammonia co-firing technology at a large-scale 
commercial coal-fired power plant in Japan and responded to many inquiries related to ammonia co-firing 
globally.
	
To achieve de-carbonization of APL’s coal-fired assets, the parties, by considering the possibility of ammonia 
co-firing through the studies, aim to de-carbonize APL’s coal fired assets with the objective to potentially 
implement the technology in other coal-fired units within India.
	
Outcome of initiative  
•	 Successful implementation will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
•	 This modification targets achieving 20% liquid ammonia co-firing ratio and higher co-firing ratio up to 
100% mono-firing at the Adani Power Mundra Coal Fired Power Plant

The Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. We follow the basic 
principle of segregation of the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept of “reduce, reuse & recycle”. 
	
The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally 
sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation.
	
Apart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include scrap 
metal, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce 
the generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All 
our site/locations are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible.

Introduction
DNV Business Assurance India 
Private Limited (‘DNV’) has been 
commissioned by the management 
of Adani Power Limited (‘APL’, 
Corporate 
Identity 
Number: 
L40100GJ1996PLC030533)
to 
undertake 
an 
independent 
assurance 
of 
the 
company’s 
Business 
Responsibility 
and 
Sustainability Reporting (‘BRSR’) 
disclosure “Principle 6”, (Businesses 
should respect and make efforts 
to 
protect 
and 
restore 
the 
environment) which is part of APL’s 
reporting on BRSR disclosures 
included in its Annual Report, it 
shall also be published in digital/
online format. The disclosures in 
this Report have been prepared 
based on the requirements of SEBI 
Circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-
2/P/CIR/2021/562 dated May 10, 
2021, prescribing format of the 
BRSR and the guidance notes and 
the nine principles of the National 
Guidelines 
on 
Responsible 
Business Conduct, 2019 (‘NGRBC’) 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Corporate 
Affairs, Government of India. The 
intended user of this assurance 
statement is the Management 
of APL (‘the Management’) and 
its stakeholders. Our assurance 
engagement was planned and 
carried out during May 2023 – 
June 2023 covering the Company’s 
sustainability 
(Environmental) 
performance during 1 April 2022 
to 31 March 2023. We performed 
a limited level of assurance based 
on our assurance methodology, 
VeriSustainTM1.
Responsibilities 
of 
the 
Management 
of 
Adani 
Power Limited and of the 
Assurance Provider
The Management has the sole 
responsibility for the preparation 
of the Report and is responsible 
for all information disclosed in the 
Report as well as the processes for 
collecting, analyzing and reporting 
the information presented in the 
Report. APL is also responsible 
for ensuring the maintenance 
and integrity of its website and 
any referenced disclosures on 
environmental 
performance. 
In 
performing this assurance work, 
DNV’s responsibility is to the 
Management of APL; however, 
this statement represents our 
independent 
opinion 
and 
is 
intended to inform the outcome of 
the assurance to the stakeholders 
of APL.
We do not provide any services 
to APL, which in our opinion 
constitutes a conflict of interest 
with this assurance work. Our 
assurance 
engagements 
are 
based on the assumption that the 
data and information provided by 
the Company to us as part of our 
review have been provided in good 
faith and are free from material 
misstatements.
Scope, 
Boundary 
and 
Limitations
The reporting scope and boundary 
encompasses 
sustainability 
(Environmental) performance of 
APL as brought out in Section A: 
General Disclosures of the BRSR.
The 
assurance 
engagement 
considers an uncertainty of ±5% 
based on materiality threshold for 
estimation/measurement 
errors 
and omissions. We did not engage 
with any external stakeholders as 
part of this assurance engagement.
During the assurance process, we 
did not come across limitations to 
the scope of the agreed assurance 
engagement.
Basis of our Opinion
During the verification, we adopted 
a risk-based approach, and a 
sample-based 
verification 
was 
carried out for a limited level of 
verification as per DNV VeriSustain 
and as agreed with APL.
We carried out the following 
activities:

Opinion and Observations
Based 
on 
the 
verification 
undertaken, nothing has come to 
our attention to suggest that the 
Report together with referenced 
information does not adhere to the 
requirements of BRSR “Principle 6” 
including the General Disclosures, 
Management 
and 
Process 
Disclosures.
Without affecting our assurance 
opinion, we provide the following 
observations against the principles 
of VeriSustain:
Materiality
The process of determining the 
issues that is most relevant to an 
organization and its stakeholders.
The Report brings out the broad 
range of with the rationale for 
issues which the Company has 
identified as being material to 
its business which are mapped 
as risks and opportunities, along 
with the rationale for considering 
the issue as being material. Key 
environmental risks, stakeholder 
opinions and concerns, and peer 
issues were taken into account 
while arriving at overall topics 
which were further prioritized to 
arrive at the significant material 
issues. Nothing has come to 
our attention to suggest that 
the Report does not meet the 
requirements 
related 
to 
the 
Principle of Materiality.
Stakeholder Inclusiveness
The participation of stakeholders 
in 
developing 
and 
achieving 
an 
accountable 
and 
strategic 
response to Sustainability.
The 
Report 
brings 
out 
the 
formal 
and 
informal 
channels 
in place to engage with its 
various 
identified 
stakeholders, 
including 
descriptions 
of 
the 
methods, 
frequencies 
and 
basis of engagement with each 
stakeholder group, as well as 
opinions and concerns arising 
out of the engagement processes 
during the reporting period. Inputs 
from the stakeholder engagement 
are used towards identifying key 
environmental topics and refining 
the 
Company’s 
policies 
and 
strategies.
Nothing has come to our attention 
to suggest that the Report does 
not meet the requirements related 
to the Principle of Stakeholder 
Inclusiveness.
Responsiveness
The extent to which an organization 
responds to stakeholder issues.
The 
Report 
brings 
out 
the 
approaches 
adopted 
by 
the 
Company to adapt and/or mitigate 
impacts related to its identified 
material issues, as well as responses 
to 
key 
stakeholder 
concerns. 
The disclosures bring out the 
descriptions of structures, policies 
and 
processes 
implemented 
by APL towards adopting and 
reviewing the NGRBC Principle 6, 
as well as performance data, and 
processes for governance.
Nothing has come to our attention 
to believe that the Report does not 
meet the requirements related to 
the Principle of Responsiveness.
Reliability
The accuracy and comparability 
of information presented in the 
report, as well as the quality of 
underlying 
data 
management 
systems.
The 
Report 
brings 
out 
the 
processes 
that 
APL 
has 
established 
towards 
capturing 
and reporting its sustainability 
performance related to Principle 
“6” of NGRBC. The majority of 
the data and information verified 
through our remote assessments 
with the Company’s management 
teams and data owners at the 
sites, sampled by us as part of 
our 
assurance 
engagement

were found to be fairly accurate 
and reliable. Some of the data 
inaccuracies identified during the 
verification process were found 
to be attributable to transcription, 
interpretation 
and 
aggregation 
errors. These data inaccuracies 
have 
been 
communicated 
for 
correction 
and 
the 
related 
disclosures were reviewed for 
correctness.
Nothing has come to our attention 
to believe that the Report does not 
meet the principle of Reliability.
Completeness
How much of all the information 
that 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
material to the organisation and 
its stakeholders is reported?
The 
Report

out 
the 
Company’s performance during 
FY2023 related to environmental 
aspects of the BRSR and covering 
the operations of APL, covering 
the 
performance

further strengthen its processes 
towards capturing and reporting 
information and data related to 
Essential and certain Leadership 
Indicators 
of 
Principle-wise 
Performance Disclosures in future 
reporting periods.
Nothing has come to our attention 
to 
suggest 
that 
the 
Report 
does not meet the Principle of 
Completeness with respect to 
scope, boundary and time.
Neutrality
The extent to which a report 
provides a balanced account of 
an 
organization’s 
performance, 
delivered in a neutral tone.
The Report brings out APL’s 
sustainability 
(Environmental) 
performance during the reporting 
period in a neutral tone in terms of 
content along with descriptions of 
key risks and opportunities during 
the reporting period.

to suggest that the Report does 
not meet the requirements related 
to the Principle of Neutrality.
