or

(Indicate positive or negative 
implications)
1.
GHG emissions 
& Climate 
Change
Risk and 
Opportunity
Climate change also poses 
operational 
risks 
through 
the increased frequency of 
extreme 
weather 
events, 
which can disrupt supply 
chains, constrain raw material 
availability, and lead to delays 
in manufacturing timelines. 
These risks are particularly 
pronounced 
for 
industries 
like ours that depend on 
stable and predictable input 
flows to ensure operational 
efficiency. Concurrently, the 
evolving 
expectations 
of 
customers, 
investors, 
and 
regulatory bodies are placing 
a 
greater 
emphasis 
on 
sustainable practices. Failure 
to demonstrate measurable 
progress in reducing GHG 
emissions 
may 
result 
in 
lost 
market 
opportunities 
and 
diminished 
investor 
confidence. However, these 
challenges also present a 
strategic 
opportunity. 
By 
reassessing and optimizing 
existing processes, KEI aims 
to enhance resource efficiency, 
strengthen the resilience of 
its operations, and position 
itself 
as 
a 
sustainability-
driven leader. This approach 
not only supports scalable 
growth but also aligns with the 
broader transition to a low-
carbon economy and evolving 
stakeholder expectations.
1.	Build 
awareness 
among 
employees regarding climate 
change and its impacts.
2.	Develop the ability to track 
and report environmental 
performance effectively.
3.	Collaborate 
with 
experts 
to enhance efficiency in 
addressing climate change 
challenges.
4.	Share KEI’s climate risk 
mitigation 
efforts 
with 
relevant 
stakeholders 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
and 
engagement.
Positive: 
Proactive 
climate 
action enhances KEI Industries’ 
brand 
equity, 
unlocks 
new 
market opportunities, and aligns 
with investor and customer 
expectations. 
It 
supports 
operational efficiency and long-
term business sustainability.
Negative: Inadequate climate 
risk management may lead to 
regulatory penalties, operational 
disruptions, and loss of trust 
among stakeholders. This can 
negatively 
impact 
financial 
performance 
and 
long-term 
growth.
2.
Product 
Stewardship
Opportunity
KEI is committed to minimizing 
the environmental impact of its 
products across their lifecycle. 
Through product stewardship, 
the 
Company 
monitors 
environmental 
performance 
and integrates sustainability 
into product development.
-
Positive- By adopting proactive 
product 
stewardship, 
KEI 
can uncover opportunities to 
enhance process efficiency and 
integrate sustainable practices. 
This 
approach 
not 
only 
contributes to environmental 
responsibility 
but 
also 
strengthens KEI’s competitive 
advantage in the market.

3.
Natural 
Resource 
Management
Risk and 
Opportunity
KEI 
Industries, 
a 
leading 
cable and wire manufacturer, 
depends heavily on natural 
resources 
throughout 
its 
supply chain, processes, and 
operations. 
The 
availability 
of these resources directly 
influences 
the 
company’s 
activities, 
making 
efficient 
and 
responsible 
resource 
management crucial to its 
success. 
1.	Utilize 
natural 
resources 
efficiently to reduce wastage.
2.	Explore alternative sources 
to ensure seamless business 
operations.
3.	Incorporate 
renewable 
resources into production 
processes 
to 
enhance 
sustainability.
4.	Collaborate with suppliers 
to 
promote 
responsible 
resource 
usage 
and 
integrate ESG practices into 
their operations.
Positive: Effective management 
of natural resources enhances 
cost efficiency and positions 
the company for long-term, 
sustainable growth.
Negative: Inefficient resource 
management 
can 
escalate 
operational costs and hinder 
the company’s overall growth 
trajectory.
4.
Supply Chain 
Sustainability
Risk and 
Opportunity
Like 
several 
industry 
counterparts, KEI Industries 
depends 
on 
value 
chain 
partners across multiple stages 
of 
product 
development. 
Embedding 
environmental 
and 
social 
responsibility 
into supply chain practices 
ensures long-term business 
resilience and reinforces the 
company’s social license to 
operate.
1.	Collaborate regularly with 
value 
chain 
partners 
to 
raise awareness about ESG 
issues.
2.	Incorporate 
ESG 
due 
diligence into the onboarding 
process for value chain 
partners.
3.	Conduct 
frequent 
evaluations of value chain 
partners to ensure alignment 
with industry best practices.
Positive: Effective supply chain 
management not only minimizes 
environmental 
impact 
but 
also 
contributes 
significantly 
to the company’s long-term 
sustainability efforts.
Negative: 
A 
mismanaged 
supply chain can result in 
resource inefficiency, disrupt 
material 
procurement, 
and 
lead to increased costs and 
reputational harm.
5.
Employee 
Development 
and 
Engagement
Risk and 
Opportunity
Disengagement 
among 
employees presents a key 
risk, 
potentially 
resulting 
in 
reduced 
productivity, 
elevated attrition rates, and 
weakened workforce morale. 
Conversely, 
opportunities 
exist in advancing employee 
development 
through 
structured training programs, 
career 
advancement 
pathways, 
and 
consistent 
engagement 
initiatives. 
Strategic investment in talent 
growth 
and 
recognition 
mechanisms contributes to 
enhanced employee retention, 
innovation 
potential, 
and 
leadership continuity
1.	Introduce ongoing training 
programs 
to 
enhance 
employees’ 
skills 
and 
expertise.
2.	Develop 
career 
growth 
initiatives to attract and 
retain top talent.
3.	Encourage a healthy work-
life 
balance 
to 
improve 
employee morale and overall 
well-being.
4.	Empower staff to share 
feedback on the grievance 
process to make it more 
robust and effective.
5.	Monitor employee sentiment 
through structured surveys 
and implement actionable 
improvements 
based 
on 
findings
Positive: A highly engaged 
and retained workforce fosters 
innovation, boosts performance, 
and 
cultivates 
a 
positive 
organizational culture.
Negative: 
Failing 
to 
meet 
workforce 
expectations 
can 
negatively affect morale, hinder 
productivity, and disrupt the 
company’s long-term growth 
strategy.
6.
Occupational 
Health & Safety
Risk
The well-being and safety of 
our employees and workers 
hold paramount importance 
for 
the 
organization. 
By 
implementing robust health 
and 
safety 
measures 
to 
mitigate risks to life and 
property, we foster a sense 
of security and strengthen 
employee confidence.
We conduct regular health 
and safety training for all 
employees to foster a safe work 
environment, including sessions 
on Hazard Identification and 
Risk Assessment (HIRA) and 
Total Productive Maintenance. 
Both internal and external 
audits have been performed, 
and the Company has adopted 
ISO 45001 to ensure the health, 
safety, and well-being of its 
workforce. Additionally, various 
awareness 
programs 
and 
training sessions are organized 
to 
address 
safety-related 
issues.
Negative: Overlooking safety 
risks 
for 
employees 
and 
workers can result in serious 
consequences, 
including 
fatalities, a reduced workforce, 
and damage to the organization’s 
reputation. Additionally, it can 
impact the availability of skilled 
labor, ultimately impacting the 
company’s 
productivity 
and 
operational efficiency.

To enhance the governance framework, KEI has undertaken several measures 
to ensure transparency, accountability, and robust management practices:
Digital Transformation: 
1.	 Development of the “Saath-Saath” Web Application and Mobile 
Application for the Retail Department:
KEI has successfully launched a robust online platform-Saath-Saath-for its 
Retail Department, transforming its previously offline scheme management 
system into a dynamic, fully digital solution. This initiative integrates an 
advanced system that automatically calculates projection benefits for 
retailers, significantly improving scheme transparency and planning. The 
platform empowers Sales Officers by providing seamless, remote access to 
KEI schemes anytime, anywhere, through both web and mobile interfaces, 
thereby increasing efficiency and field productivity.
2.	 Deployment of the Digital Factory Application:
KEI has implemented a cutting-edge Digital Factory application that 
leverages IOT to streamline manufacturing operations. This system captures 
real-time data directly from factory machines and seamlessly integrates it

the application enhances operational visibility, improves decision-making, 
and supports predictive maintenance-driving efficiency, accuracy, and 
agility across the manufacturing process.
3.	 Implementation of the Mantra Facial Recognition System:
KEI has implemented the Mantra Application, a facial recognition-based 
access control system primarily designed to enhance on-site security. This 
system ensures that only authorized personnel can access restricted areas 
by using biometric facial data for verification. All access logs are securely 
stored on KEI’s internal servers, protected with encryption protocols to 
prevent unauthorized access or tampering. The solution also includes 
role-based access control (RBAC) and audit trails, enabling real-time 
monitoring and forensic tracking, thereby strengthening physical security 
and compliance with data protection standards.
4.	 ESSCom – Structured Digital Database (SDD):
KEI has in place an application Employee Self Service Module for 
Compliance (ESSCom), a centralized Structured Digital Database 
(SDD) designed to automate compliance with SEBI’s Insider Trading 
Regulations.
It allows Compliance Officers to efficiently manage the Model Code of 
Conduct, control trading windows, and process pre-clearance requests.
The platform ensures secure, time-stamped logging of insider trades and 
disclosures. With audit trails and role-based access controls, ESSCom 
maintains high standards of data integrity and security. Automated alerts 
and real-time notifications keep stakeholders informed and enhance

3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling, and disposing at the 
end of life for:
Plastics (including 
packaging)
Electrical cables are designed for longevity, with a typical useful life of 20 to 30 years, 
owing to their inherent durability and resilience. Their core components-metals like 
copper or aluminum and insulating materials-are well-aligned with the principles of 
a circular economy.
Unlike many products, end-of-life cables are not treated as waste. Instead, they are 
considered valuable raw material for industries such as copper smelting, aluminum 
recovery, and steelmaking, making them part of a cradle-to-cradle material loop. 
Scrap cables are traded globally and serve as important feedstock for new cable 
manufacturing and other metallurgical processes.
At KEI Industries, we are committed to advancing circularity in our operations. 
We actively recover and recycle scrap cables and other waste generated during 
production. Our processes are optimized to:
•	 Maximize the internal reuse of production scrap.
•	 Work with authorized recyclers for safe disposal and recovery of plastic 
insulation, e-waste, and other associated waste streams. In alignment with 
industry best practices, our waste management systems ensure compliance 
with environmental regulations and maximize resource efficiency. We strive 
toward zero waste to landfill and are working continuously to increase the share 
of recycled content in our products. Additionally, we have obtained recycler 
certificates from more than 80% in terms of quantity of scrap ensuring adherence 
to responsible waste management, and our sustainability commitments. The 
recycler is selling these scrap which is inclusive of metallurgical, non-ferrous and 
other scrap like packaging waste, plastic, rubber, glass to secondary industries 
that convert scrap into other products. 
•	 Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our goal to integrate circular 
economy principles across the value chain-from product design to end-of-life 
recovery-ensuring that our cables contribute to a more resource-efficient and 
low-carbon future.

5.	 Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)? If “Yes”, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation:
	
Yes, KEI’s manufacturing facilities are equipped with Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs) to ensure comprehensive and responsible wastewater management. Domestic 
wastewater, such as that generated from sanitation facilities, is treated through STPs, while process-
related effluents are directed to ETPs for treatment.
	
The treated water from STPs is effectively reused within the facility premises for non-potable purposes, 
including flushing and horticulture, thereby enabling zero liquid discharge beyond site boundaries. This not 
only minimizes environmental impact but also promotes resource efficiency.
	
All units operate in strict adherence to the applicable environmental regulations and standards as prescribed 
by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The 
Company remains committed to continually maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure to comply with 
evolving environmental norms and sustainability benchmarks.
6.	 Please provide details of air emissions (other than GHG emissions) by the entity, in the following format:
	
Our NOx and SOx emission are predominantly generated from our fossil fuel consumption especially

within permissible limits, we are still keen to improve our performance. Towards this, we have/are replaced 
/ replacing diesel genset with other cleaner fuels gensets, install additional filtration systems at our stack 
emission outlets to capture emissions or replacing diesel with PNG where there is steady PNG infrastructure 
installed by government.

Note: For FY 2024–25, as part of our ongoing improvement in data collection and reporting mechanisms, 
additional non-hazardous waste data has been captured. These data points were not reported in FY 2023–
24, resulting in an increase in the reported waste recovery figures for the current year. 
 
For FY 2024–25, in alignment with the principles of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (3Rs), we enhanced 
segregation and identification of waste by-products from the manufacturing process. This allowed us to 
assess their potential for value recovery. As a result, we initiated in-house reuse of certain scrap materials 
within our own operations. Waste that could not be internally recycled were directed to scrap dealers and 
secondary recyclers capable of extracting further utility. These efforts have contributed to an increase in the 
reported recycled/reused figures for the current year.
 
In FY 2023-24, plastic waste reporting did not capture the full scope required for comprehensive disclosures. 
To enhance transparency and accuracy, we are implementing improved systems to ensure robust and 
reliable reporting and have disclosed the same for FY 24-25.

Management Responsibilities

Responsibility and Sustainability Report in accordance with the Criteria mentioned above. This responsibility 
includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core Matrices which are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set 
out in BRSR provisions and professional pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations 
in accordance with these requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the company 
to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and free from material misstatements. We were not 
involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the Report except for Assurance Statement. Our 
firm applies International Standard on Quality Management and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system 
of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We apply SQC 1 for quality control in 
assurance and related services. 
Reasonable Assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks as required 
by the circumstances.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed 
the disclosures presented within the Report and referenced information, and sampled the disclosures and were 
reviewed through the company’s customised sustainability information management system.
The procedures conducted were based on professional judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
performed, inspection of documents, evaluation of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical 
procedures, and reconciliation with underlying records. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in executing

Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the identified sustainability indicators, based 
on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our engagement in 
accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with the Company. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, 
in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The 
nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk 
of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Reasonable Assurance Opinion

that causes us to believe that the company’s identified sustainability criteria as per BRSR core framework for the 
financial year ended 31
st March 2025 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting 
Criteria.
