Talent 
management 
at 
OnMobile 
aligns 
the 
work 
culture with global standards, 
boosting employee loyalty and 
efficiency. Recruiting locally not 
only helps retain talent but also 
demonstrates the company’s 
commitment 
to 
community 
development.
Additionally, 
OnMobile 
employs 
a 
Talent 
Acquisition Procedure to 
ensure the recruitment of 
highly skilled professionals 
capable of delivering top-
tier 
services 
to 
clients 
worldwide.
Customer 
Centricity
Risk/
Opportunity
OnMobile, as a provider of mobile 
entertainment 
products 
and 
solutions, can gain advantages 
by 
prioritizing 
customer-
centricity. This involves tailoring 
products 
and 
services 
to 
match customer needs and 
preferences, which can help 
attract new customers and 
retain current ones. However, 
focusing on customer-centricity 
also comes with notable risks, 
such as the costs involved and 
the risk of users engaging in 
excessive mobile game usage.
By 
addressing 
the 
associated risks, OnMobile 
can 
capitalize 
on 
the 
benefits 
of 
customer-
centricity 
and 
maintain 
its competitive position in 
the market. Our products 
cater to a diverse customer 
base, 
making 
it 
crucial 
to consistently simulate, 
evaluate, and refine our 
product 
development 
strategies to align with 
customer 
interests 
and 
engagement.
OnMobile 
plans 
to 
introduce 
features 
that 
enable users to monitor 
and control their gaming 
time, along with providing 
resources on responsible 
gaming. 
Additionally, 
OnMobile is committed to 
strictly following mandated 
warnings and guidelines, 
including those pertaining 
to children’s content, set by 
regulatory authorities for 
gaming companies where 
applicable.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, 
targets and achievements
	
Dear Stakeholders,
	
It is with great pleasure that I present the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for OnMobile Global 
Limited for the fiscal year 2024-25. Our commitment to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles deeply into our business operations and strategic decision-making continues to strengthen and evolve. 
We recognize the critical importance of these elements in sustaining business excellence and ethical practices.
	
Commitment to Excellence and Sustainability
	
At OnMobile, we are dedicated to maintaining the highest levels of quality, superior service management, robust 
information security, and sustainable business continuity. These pillars are fundamental to our operational integrity 
and success, ensuring we deliver exceptional value consistently to all our stakeholders.
	
Environmental Initiatives
	
Our environmental stewardship initiatives are more crucial than ever as we strive to minimize our impact on the 
planet. This year, we have enhanced our efforts by implementing advanced energy-efficient lighting systems, 
expanding our water conservation measures, and strengthening our waste management practices. These initiatives 
are designed not only to reduce our environmental footprint but also to set a benchmark in sustainable operations 
within our industry.
	
Social Contributions
	
We believe in empowering the communities in which we operate. This year, we have amplified our efforts to create 
a safe and healthy working environment for our employees and extended our community engagement initiatives.

Children’s Foundation have enabled us to make significant contributions to healthcare and education. Additionally, 
we have expanded our skill-building programs, aiming to equip underprivileged youth with the necessary skills for 
a sustainable future.

Governance and Ethical Practices
	
Upholding rigorous standards of governance and transparency remains a top priority. We have strengthened our 
compliance mechanisms and internal controls, ensuring adherence to all applicable laws and regulations. Our 
robust whistle-blower policy continues to be a vital tool for maintaining transparency and addressing stakeholder 
concerns effectively.

a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to minimise our environmental footprint. As part of our future 
initiatives, we aim to evaluate the energy consumption of our data centers, office operations, and user devices to 
identify opportunities for optimization. We will focus on sourcing raw materials responsibly, managing e-waste 
effectively, and reducing emissions from transportation and operational activities.
Key focus areas include adopting renewable energy for our data centers, enhancing app performance to reduce 
server loads, and partnering with environmentally responsible service providers. Tools such as SimaPro or OpenLCA 
will be employed to analyse our impacts, particularly on carbon footprint, energy use, and water consumption. 
Transparency and accountability will remain paramount, as we plan to share our findings through sustainability 
reports and implement eco-friendly practices across our value chain.
This initiative aligns with our long-term vision of embedding sustainability into our operations, fostering digital 
innovation responsibly, and contributing positively to global environmental goals.

allows employees to submit tickets to voice their concerns or seek 
information. These submissions are then managed and resolved 
by the respective department or individual responsible. For issues 
related to grievances, employees have the option to approach HR 
business partners (HRBP). The HRBP takes charge of escalating the 
matter to the appropriate stakeholders, coordinating the required 
discussions and actions, and ensuring the resolution of the issue.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details
	
The organisation undertook various energy efficiency and waste management initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and optimise operations. Conventional lighting was replaced with energy-efficient LED lights, significantly 
reducing electricity consumption and heat generation. HVAC systems were upgraded, and smart thermostats were 
installed to ensure optimal temperature control based on occupancy, complemented by regular maintenance for 
improved efficiency. In the server room, servers were consolidated and virtualised, with energy-efficient equipment 
deployed to lower power usage.
	
Waste management efforts included establishing a formal e-waste recycling system in partnership with certified 
recyclers and adopting digital document management practices to minimise paper usage. Application code was 
streamlined to decrease processing power and server load, further lowering emissions. These initiatives not only 
reduced the environmental impact but also enhanced operational efficiency and cost savings, reinforcing the 
organisation’s commitment to sustainability.

As a mobile entertainment service provider, OnMobile’s products include web applications, games, and tones, which 
are delivered through its telecom operator partners. Since OnMobile operates as a business-to-business (B2B) entity,

local legal mandates.

services to its partners.
