5.
Data privacy and 
cyber security
R
In the realm of RF/Microwave/ Digital 
electronics, 
hardware 
products 
and 
associated software can harbor security 
gaps that may pose threats to consumer 
data security. Therefore, the onus is 
on the manufacturers in this industry 
to ensure the integrity of user data. If 
businesses operating in this sector fail 
to devise a comprehensive methodology 
to detect such vulnerabilities, they may 
inadvertently place consumer data at risk 
and potentially undermine their customer.
To 
address 
data 
privacy and security, 
the 
company 
has 
established a robust 
Cyber Risk Management 
framework. 
This 
framework, 
overseen 
by 
the 
Information 
Technology & Security 
Committee 
and 
Risk 
Management 
Committee, 
ensures 
constant 
monitoring 
of cyber risks and their 
mitigation. Data access 
is 
strictly 
controlled 
and data encryption 
is employed to ensure 
security. 
Moreover, 
the 
company 
has 
intensified its efforts 
to educate employees, 
customers, and other 
stakeholders 
about 
cyber frauds and the 
importance 
of 
data 
privacy, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
maintaining a secure 
digital environment.

Corporate 
Governance
R
Companies 
are 
assessed 
on 
their 
performance in key governance areas 
such as ownership structure, board 
remuneration, 
accounting 
practices, 
corporate ethics, and tax transparency. 
This topic examines the effect that a 
company’s corporate governance and 
business ethics practices have on its 
shareholders and other investors.
To mitigate corporate 
governance risk, the 
company 
regularly 
reviews and updates 
its policies to ensure 
they remain relevant 
and 
effective. 
The 
Board plays a crucial 
role in this process, 
overseeing 
the 
review of governance 
practices 
and 
structures. Additionally, 
governance 
policies 
are revised to reflect 
changes in legislation 
and 
industry 
best 
practices. 
This 
proactive 
approach 
to governance helps 
manage risk, enhance 
transparency, 
and 
ensure compliance with 
all relevant regulations 
and standards.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)
Dear Stakeholders,
At Astra Microwave, we believe sustainability is integral to our operations. This update highlights our progress in addressing 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) challenges.
Our commitment begins with a strong foundation. We conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment to identify 
the most critical sustainability issues. This allows us to prioritize and address these issues effectively. Furthermore, we 
meticulously calculated our carbon and water footprints. This data provides a clear picture of our environmental impact and 
shapes our sustainability strategies and goals. To guide our actions and decisions, we have established a comprehensive 
Business Responsibility and Reporting (BRR) policy.
Our dedication is evident in real-world actions. Our Bangalore building proudly holds a 5-star GRIHA rating, showcasing our 
commitment to energy-efficient and sustainable infrastructure. We’ve also invested in a solar power plant to increase our 
reliance on clean, renewable energy sources, contributing to a cleaner future. Additionally, sewage treatment plants (STPs) 
implemented across all units ensure responsible water use and minimize our environmental footprint.
Our employees are crucial partners in sustainability. We prioritize their training and development, equipping them with the 
knowledge and skills to contribute effectively. We also established a transparent and efficient grievance portal, offering a 
platform for vendors, customers, investors, and employees to address their concerns.
The path to sustainability presents challenges like data availability, evolving regulations, and investor expectations. We are 
a proactive organization, continuously monitoring and adapting to these challenges. To ensure our practices align with best 
standards, we’ve set clear targets in key areas such as poverty eradication, energy use, sustainable transport, health, and 
promoting full employment. These targets serve as milestones on our journey towards sustainable development.
Looking ahead, transparency, continuous improvement, and collaboration with stakeholders remain core values. We value 
your support and engagement as we work together to build a better, more sustainable future.

Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and worker?

Category
Yes/No
If Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief
Permanent Workers
Yes
Our organization has implemented a structured Grievance Redressal 
mechanism to ensure the prompt and effective resolution of employee 
grievances. Employees are encouraged to initially raise their grievances with 
their immediate superior, bringing any concerns or issues promptly to their 
attention. In situations where the grievance involves the immediate superior, 
employees should approach the HR department directly to communicate their 
concerns, ensuring an unbiased and impartial investigation and resolution 
process. The immediate superior or designated HR representative will 
conduct a thorough investigation and make reasonable efforts to resolve the 
issue within approximately three working days, meticulously documenting all 
discussions and actions taken and submitting these to the HR department
If an employee remains dissatisfied with the resolution provided by the 
immediate superior, they have the option to escalate the grievance by 
submitting a Grievance Form (Annexure - 17) to their next-level manager. 
The manager will then conduct a comprehensive investigation and endeavor 
to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, typically three working 
days, with all discussions and relevant documentation meticulously recorded 
and shared with the HR department. Should the employee continue to be 
unsatisfied with the resolution provided by the manager, they retain the right 
to approach the HR department for further intervention. The HR team will 
conduct an impartial investigation, considering all perspectives, and provide 
a final resolution to the grievance.
By adhering to this Grievance Redressal mechanism, we ensure that employee 
concerns are heard and addressed in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner. 
This structured approach enables us to resolve grievances while maintaining 
comprehensive documentation and upholding the principles of fairness and 
accountability throughout the process.

Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? 
(Yes/ No)

If Yes, the Coverage such systems?
The company-owned facilities and offices have Occupational and health & safety management system implemented and

b.
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by 
the entity?
To identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-routine bases, the entity employs a systematic 
process that ensures comprehensive evaluation and effective management of occupational health and safety (OHS) 
hazards. This process includes the following steps:
1.	
Identification of Significant Hazards/Risks:

Assessment Against Criteria and Ratings: Hazards identified in each work area are assessed against specific 
criteria and assigned ratings to determine their significance.

Overriding Factors and Potential Emergencies: Any hazard classified under the ‘overriding factors, Potential 
Emergency’ is automatically deemed a significant hazard due to its potential severity.

Significance Score Classification: Hazards are further evaluated based on their significance scores. Those 
falling into the “Unacceptable” and “Needs correction” categories, with LXS values ranging between 5 and 25, are 
considered significant and prioritized for action.
87
2.	
Post-Control Evaluation of Hazards/Risks:

Control Measure Implementation: The effectiveness of control measures implemented to mitigate identified 
environmental aspects and impacts is a crucial component of the evaluation.

OHS Hazards and Associated Risks Evaluation: Similar to environmental evaluations, OHS hazards and 
associated risks are assessed using overriding factors and the significance score criteria.

Categorization of Significance Scores: The significance scores are categorized into three levels: High, Medium, 
and Low. This categorization is based on a predefined evaluation table that guides the prioritization of hazard 
management efforts.
By adhering to this thorough evaluation process, the entity ensures that significant hazards and risks are identified and 
managed effectively. This systematic approach facilitates the prioritization and implementation of appropriate control 
measures, thereby enhancing workplace safety and mitigating potential risks.
c. 
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks? (Yes/ No)
yes
We’ve established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) specifically trained to handle emergencies and coordinate with 
local essential services for incident management.
The ERT comprises key personnel responsible for providing and coordinating an efficient response to minimize 
disruptions to our business operations during emergencies. This team includes members such as the Rescue Team, First 
Aiders, Observers, Firefighters, Security Staff, and Communication Lead, all under the leadership of the Security Officer 
on duty.
d.	
Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-
occupational medical and healthcare services? (Yes/ No)

The organization has implemented multiple measures to guarantee a safe and healthy workplace. Firstly, there is a clearly 
defined procedure for evaluating occupational health and safety (OHS) hazards and risks. This systematic assessment aids in 
identifying potential risks and devising appropriate control measures. Additionally, the company places strong emphasis on 
proper documentation and record-keeping, aligning with the requirements of Environmental Health and Safety Management 
System (EHSMS) documentation. This ensures accurate recording of relevant information regarding safety measures, 
incidents, and corrective actions, which can be accessed as needed.
To uphold high safety standards, regular internal and external audits are conducted throughout the year. These audits evaluate 
compliance with safety protocols, pinpoint areas for improvement, and ensure ongoing adherence to safety regulations. 
Furthermore, the company has established EHS objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each department. These 
objectives and KPIs are monitored regularly to track progress and address any deviations from set targets. This proactive 
approach facilitates continuous improvement and maintains a focus on fostering a safe working environment.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics 
or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
We value open communication and collaboration with our stakeholders. Their perspectives are crucial for making informed 
decisions that contribute to our long-term success. We have established multiple channels for receiving feedback on 
economic, environmental, and social topics. These channels include mail, online surveys, and dedicated suggestion boxes at 
our facilities.
We actively gather and analyze this feedback to understand stakeholder concerns, priorities, and suggestions. Key insights 
are then presented to the Board of Directors, ensuring these broader perspectives inform their discussions and decision-
making processes. This multi-pronged approach fosters transparency and helps us address the economic, environmental, and 
social issues that matter most to our stakeholders.
2.
Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of 
environmental, and social topics (Yes/No): 
Yes
If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into 
policies and activities of the entity.
We actively engage stakeholders to identify and manage environmental and social topics. Internal stakeholder insights 
are crucial in our materiality assessment, helping us prioritize material topics impacting our business and stakeholders. 
Their feedback also informs the development and revision of our environmental and social policies, ensuring they address 
stakeholder concerns.
This collaborative approach extends to program design. We actively seek stakeholder input when creating initiatives to 
manage and mitigate our impacts.

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.
Certainly, we have a grievance redressal mechanism in place specifically designed to address concerns related to human 
rights. Employees are encouraged to promptly bring any grievances to their immediate superior for resolution. In cases where 
the grievance involves the immediate superior, employees have the option to directly approach the Human Resources (HR) 
department. The superior will conduct a thorough investigation and strive to resolve the issue within approximately 3 working 
days, ensuring all discussions are documented and submitting relevant documentation to HR.
Should an employee remain dissatisfied with the response from their immediate superior, they have the right to escalate 
the grievance by submitting a Grievance Form to their next-level manager. The manager will conduct a comprehensive 
investigation and endeavor to resolve the issue within a similar timeframe, ensuring all discussions are documented and 
submitting documentation to HR for review.
If the employee continues to be dissatisfied with the resolution provided by the manager, they retain the option to approach 
HR for an impartial investigation and final resolution. This grievance redressal mechanism ensures a fair and transparent 
process for addressing human rights-related concerns within the organization.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
Our company upholds a comprehensive waste management practice across all our plants and offices. We strongly believe 
that responsible waste management is integral to environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility. We meticulously 
monitor and record the waste generated at our facilities. Subsequently, we entrust it to certified vendors specializing in proper 
waste management, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and employing environmentally friendly techniques 
for disposal or recycling. This approach minimizes environmental impact.
Additionally, we have stringent protocols for managing electronic waste (e-waste) and hazardous waste, which are more 
intricate to handle. Similar to general waste, we collaborate with certified vendors to ensure the proper disposal or recycling 
of these waste types. These vendors are carefully chosen to ensure they comply with the latest and most stringent waste 
handling standards, emphasizing both environmental and human safety.
In conclusion, through vigilant monitoring and collaboration with certified waste management vendors, we guarantee that our 
waste, whether general, e-waste, or hazardous, is managed in the most environmentally conscious manner possible.

AHU's Condenser 
Drain Water Reuse 
The condenser drain water from AHUs, 
which maintains a temperature below 20°C, 
is repurposed for chiller operations. This 
reduces the load on the chiller compressors. 
This 
reuse 
strategy 
decreased 
the 
load 
on 
chiller 
compressors, 
leading 
to a notable decrease in 
power consumption. 
Solar System 
Panels Cleaning 
We 
implemented 
a 
monthly 
cleaning 
schedule for our solar panels and increased 
the frequency of load measurements from 
monthly to weekly. This ensures optimal 
performance and early detection of issues. 
Regular 
cleaning 
and 
frequent 
load 
measurements allowed 
early identification of 
faulty panels. Prompt 
corrective 
actions 
were taken, enhancing 
overall 
solar 
power 
generation efficiency. 
Sensor-Based 
Water Taps 
Traditional water taps were replaced with 
sensor-based 
taps, 
which 
automatically 
control water flow based on user presence, 
thereby preventing unnecessary water use.
This initiative led to 
a reduction in water 
consumption 
by 
ensuring water is only 
used when necessary, 
eliminating wastage. 
Motion Sensors
Conventional lighting was upgraded to motion 
sensor lighting, which automatically turns 
lights on or off based on room occupancy, 
thus optimizing energy use.
This upgrade reduced 
excess 
electricity 
consumption 
by 
ensuring lights are only 
on when the space 
is occupied
Rain Water Harvesting
A rainwater harvesting system was installed 
at our facility, capturing and storing rainwater 
for various non-potable uses such as irrigation
