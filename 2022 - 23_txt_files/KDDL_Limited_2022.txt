Financial 
implications
1
Innovation 
Management 
and resource 
efficiency
O
Innovation can lead to the creation of 
improved products and services that better 
meet customer needs, thereby increasing 
customer 
satisfaction. 
Additionally, 
innovation drives the development of new 
products and services, opening up new 
revenue opportunities for the Company. 
Companies 
that 
prioritise 
innovation 
gain a competitive edge and expand their 
market share. Operational efficiency aims 
to achieve more with less, such as reducing 
energy consumption, increasing yield, and 
optimising equipment utilisation, ultimately 
maximising overall effectiveness.
Positive
2
Training 
and skill 
improvement
O
Training and skill improvement are essential 
for individuals and organisations as they 
enhance performance, productivity, and 
adaptability. Continuous learning enables 
employees to acquire new knowledge, 
refine existing skills, and stay updated 
with industry advancements, resulting in 
improved job satisfaction, career growth, 
and organisational success in a rapidly 
evolving business landscape.
Positive
3
Water 
Management
R
Water 
management 
is 
crucial 
for 
manufacturers as it ensures responsible use 
of water resources, reduces environmental 
impact, and mitigates operational risks. 
Efficient water management practices help 
conserve water, minimise water-related 
costs, comply with regulations, protect 
ecosystems, and enhance sustainability, 
demonstrating 
corporate 
social 
responsibility and long-term viability.
KDDL will continue to implement 
measures 
for 
effective 
water 
management, 
leading 
to 
reduced 
consumption of freshwater. KDDL has 
installed effluent treatment plants to 
treat wastewater discharged which 
is reused for gardening and other 
industrial applications as well in the 
production process. Conduct water 
usage 
assessment 
and 
monitoring 
to track any high usage of water and 
identify ways to reduce freshwater 
consumption.
Negative

Supply Chain 
Management
O
Supply chain management is essential for 
manufacturers as it ensures the smooth 
flow of materials, reduces costs, improves 
operational 
efficiency, 
and 
enhances 
customer satisfaction. Effective supply chain 
management enables timely production, 
minimises 
inventory 
risks, 
optimises 
logistics, fosters supplier relationships, 
and enables companies to meet market 
demand efficiently and effectively.

company as it directly impacts reputation, 
customer loyalty, and business growth. 
Satisfied customers not only contribute to 
positive word-of-mouth marketing but also 
drive repeat purchases, ensuring a strong 
market presence and continued success in 
a competitive industry.

6
Emissions 
& Energy 
management
R
Emissions and energy management hold 
paramount importance for manufacturing 
companies. 
By 
effectively 
managing 
emissions and energy usage, companies 
can reduce their environmental footprint, 
comply 
with 
regulations, 
enhance 
operational efficiency, minimise costs, 
and 
demonstrate 
a 
commitment 
to 
sustainability. 
Proactive 
management 
of emissions and energy contributes 
to a greener and more responsible 
manufacturing industry.
Implement 
effective 
policies 
and 
procedures to monitor energy and 
emission performance to identify critical 
areas to improve. Promote the use of 
renewable energy resources like solar or 
wind energy to reduce and offset GHG 
emissions. Implement effective emission 
monitoring systems to keep track of key 
high emission factors.
Negative
7
Waste 
Management
R
Effective waste management is critical for 
a manufacturing company as it minimises 
environmental impact, ensures regulatory 
compliance, reduces operational costs, 
and enhances sustainability. Proper waste 
management practices promote resource 
efficiency, mitigate potential health and 
environmental risks, and demonstrate 
corporate responsibility.
Ensure proper procedures and policies 
are in place for handling, storing and 
disposing of waste. KDDL, as a responsible 
manufacturer, effectively handles all 
the waste generated by appropriate 
storage and safe disposal through third 
party vendors. Additionally, implement 
efficient ways to reuse or reduce waste 
generated leading to less consumption 
of fresh raw materials.
Negative
8
Occupational 
Health and 
Safety
R
Occupational health and safety are a 
significant risk and vital to a manufacturing 
company as it safeguards employees 
from workplace hazards, reduces the 
risk of accidents and injuries, improves 
productivity, and ensures legal compliance. 
Prioritising health and safety foster a 
positive work environment and protects 
the Company’s reputation.
Define clear policies and procedures 
for thorough assessments of potential 
risks and hazards at KDDL premises 
take effective measures to mitigate 
any potential risk. Additionally, KDDL 
conducts routine health and safety 
monitoring to ensure no gaps related 
to occupational health and hazard. We 
provide adequate Personal Protection 
Equipment to ensure complete safety 
from any unforeseen hazard. We also 
provide
