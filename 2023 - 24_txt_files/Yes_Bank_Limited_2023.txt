Management Discussion  
and Analysis
01
The partnership aims to demonstrate the strength 
an ecosystem plays in nurturing Olympic talent. 
In line with this, YES BANK launched the campaign 
‘Milkar Jitayenge’, highlighting the shared effort 
behind every victory. YES BANK's brand ethos, 
'Life Ko Banao Rich', is the bedrock of this 
philosophy, emphasising how sports add richness 
to life. As our athletes compete globally, their 
achievements contribute to our national memory 
and pride, creating a legacy of shared experiences.
In our support for Team India at the Paris Olympics 
2024, we recognise that every athlete's journey to 
excellence is a collaborative effort. It is the unspoken 
dedication of families, friends, coaches and the 
support staff that lays the foundation for a champion.
To rally the nation in a chorus of support for our 
Paris-bound Olympic athletes, we proudly launched 
the microsite yesteamindia.com. This platform 
empowers well-wishers of Team India from within 
and outside the country to send their heartfelt 
best wishes to our Olympians. The microsite was 
ceremoniously inaugurated by Dr. P.T. Usha, 
President of the Indian Olympic Association 
and Hon’ble Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha, 
during a spirited send-off ceremony organised 
by the IOA.
To further honour this collaboration and empower 
our athletes, we are delighted to introduce 
‘YES Glory’, a special savings account proposition 
for the Indian Olympic contingent heading to Paris. 
Through this gesture, YES BANK extends best wishes 
to the athletes and acknowledges the importance 
of their families in their journey. The benefits of 
‘YES Glory’ will also be available to the athletes' 
immediate family members.
YES BANK’s partnership with the Indian Olympic Association as 
the Official Banking Partner to Team India for Paris Olympics 
2024  transcends the conventional boundaries of sponsorship. 
This collaboration is ingrained with a deeper commitment, 
not just to the athletes, but also to the spirit of our nation’s 
aspirations and dreams.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Dear Shareholders,
As I reflect on the last eighteen 
months, the time since I became 
the 
Chairman 
of 
YES 
BANK, 
the Bank has scripted a story 
of 
resilience 
and 
progress, 
achieving 
its 
third 
consecutive 
year of full-year profitability in the 
Financial Year 2023-24.
Post 
moratorium, 
YES 
BANK 
has 
exemplified 
resilience 
and 
adaptability, successfully navigating 
multiple 
challenges 
that 
came 
along the way. The collective spirit 
and ability to steer through these 
challenging periods is a testament to 
the dedication of the staff, the loyalty 
of our customers, and the support 
of our shareholders and regulatory 
authorities. As we move into the 
financial year 2025, I feel that YES 
BANK is well placed to continue to 
thrive and make further progress in 
the ever-changing banking landscape.
Macroeconomic Scenario
The 
global 
macroeconomic 
scenario for 2023-24 reflected a 
complex 
interplay 
of 
challenges 
and 
opportunities, 
marked 
by 
cautious optimism. 
The geopolitical conflicts heightened 
the uncertainties in global energy 
markets, affecting oil prices and 
regional stability. These conflicts, 
along with trade tensions and shifting 
alliances, 
underscores 
the 
need 
for diversified supply chains and 
strategic economic partnerships.
Despite these geopolitical tensions 
and 
monetary 
policy 
tightening, 
the global economy demonstrated 
resilience, 
with 
global 
GDP 
expanding by 3.2% in CY 2023. 
Advanced economies GDP grew 
at 1.6%, while the emerging and 
developing economies grew at 4.3%. 
In the midst of global headwinds, 
India has emerged as a pocket of 
resilience. The GDP growth stood 
at 8.2% in FY 2023-24, supported 
by government-led capex spending, 
robust urban and rural demand, 
and proactive measures by the RBI 
stabilising inflation at 5.4%. 
The 
government's 
emphasis 
on 
infrastructure 
development 
and 
digital 
transformation 
has 
been 
pivotal in attracting investments and 
fostering economic resilience.
The latest Financial Stability Report 
highlights 
that 
Indian 
Banking 
Sector continues to remain stable, 
with profitability and asset quality 
indicators at their “decadal best” 
levels with adequacy of liquidity and 
capital buffers in the banking system. 
Moreover, RBI’s macro-stress tests 
revealed that Scheduled Commercial 
Banks (SCBs) are well-capitalised and 
capable of absorbing macroeconomic 
shocks even in the absence of any 
further capital infusion. 
YES BANK in FY 2023-24 
During 
FY 
2023-24, 
YES 
BANK 
progressed well on its key strategic 
objective of Profitability Improvement 
and made further advancements 
across 
most 
key 
financial 
and 
operating metrics.
The Bank’s balance sheet crossed 
` 4.0 lakh crore mark with robust 
accretion to Deposits at ` 2.6 lakh 
crore. The Bank judiciously expanded 
ANOTHER KEY  
HIGHLIGHT WAS 
THE SUBSTANTIAL  
PROGRESSION IN 
ACHIEVEMENT OF  
TARGETS OF LENDING

its branch network and added 85 
branches in FY 2023-24. YES BANK’s 
Deposit Growth was 22.5% vis-à-
vis the Advances Growth of 13.8%1. 
There was a marked improvement 
in the asset quality with Net NPA and 
net carrying value of Security Receipts 
(SRs), as a percentage of advances, 
reducing from 2.4% to 1.1% as at 
March 31, 2024. 
Another 
key 
highlight 
was 
the 
substantial 
progression 
in 
achievement of targets of lending 
to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) 
achieved through a combination 
of organic efforts as well buying 
of PSL certificates by the Bank.

management,

Digital @ Banking
In FY 2023-24, YES BANK continued 
its journey of innovation in the 
digital banking space and introduced 
multiple new products and solutions 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
customer 
convenience and accessibility. 
In FY 2023-24, the Bank launched 
a comprehensive mobile banking 
solution, ‘iris by YES BANK’ with 
over 230 plus features and services 
accessible on a single platform 
enabling customers to do banking 
on-the-go, 
with 
unparalleled 
convenience and flexibility.
The Bank introduced YES Pay Next, 
an innovative UPI payment mobile 
banking 
application 
that 
offers 
efficient transaction management 
with 
its 
intuitive 
features 
and 
enhanced security protocols and 
seamless 
and 
secure

solutions. Additionally, YES BANK 
also unveiled YES PAY BIZ, a unique

solution 
with 
multiple 
features 
such

The 
Bank 
further 
strengthened 
its 
capabilities 
and 
technology 
infrastructure in digital payment 
and transaction banking ecosystem. 
YES 
BANK 
collaborated 
with 
a 
leading 
player 
in 
the 
payment 
ecosystem as the PSP Payment Bank. 
The Bank  launched UPI payments 
through 
RuPay 
Credit 
Cards, 
providing customers with enhanced 
convenience and security in credit 
card-based transactions, empowering 
its customers to transact effortlessly 
with enhanced security measures.
By leveraging technology and strategic 
partnerships, the Bank endeavours to 
offer superior customer experience 
and further enhance its positioning in 
digital banking ecosystem.
Sustainability Focussed 
The banking and finance sector 
continued 
to 
witness 
significant 
regulatory 
developments 
around 
ESG and climate integration, during 
the year. RBI issued a Framework 
for acceptance of Green Deposits 
aimed 
at 
channelising 
flow 
of 
funds to climate-aligned activities. 
The Central Bank also released a 
‘Draft 
Disclosure 
Framework 
on 
Climate-related Financial Risks’, based 
on the Taskforce for Climate-related 
Financial 
Disclosures 
(TCFD) 
recommendations. Regulators have 
highlighted that climate-related risks 
pose significant challenges to the 
banking sector and overall financial 
stability, and financial institutions 
need to set up mechanisms to 
integrate climate aspects into their 
business strategy, factor the effects of 
climate change into financial planning, 
and evaluate and disclose the impact 
of climate-related risk drivers on the 
overall enterprise risk profile. 
SEBI also expanded its Business 
Responsibility 
and

by 
introducing BRSR Core disclosures

achieving the highest S&P Global ESG 
score and CDP rating for its climate 
disclosures, amongst Indian banks, 
for the second year in a row.
Governance and Risk 
Management at the Core
The Bank remained committed to the 
highest standards of Governance, 
Risk and Compliance which remains 
at the core of everything that 
YES BANK does. 
The 
Bank 
has 
implemented 
comprehensive policies and controls 
to reflect the latest directives, including 
those related to IT governance, 
customer service, green deposits, 
asset quality, and investments, etc. 
The Bank’s leadership is dedicated 
to fostering a strong culture of 
compliance, regularly evaluating and 
updating the policies to incorporate 
best practices 
The Bank endeavours to remain 
focussed on mitigating risks revolving 
around data and information security, 
supported by a robust IT infrastructure 
with resilient systems and stringent 
security policies and controls to 
safeguard 
its 
information 
asset. 
The Bank has adopted a risk-based 
approach and follows defence-in-
depth to protect its information 
systems against cyber-attacks. It has 
adopted a Cyber Security Resilient 
Framework 
to 
manage 
cyber 
security risk. Moreover, while the 
Bank would endeavour to invest in 
straight-through-processes, it would 
be without compromising on the 
first principles of banking controls 
and compliances.
Brand that Connects
As YES BANK continues to evolve 
and adapt to the dynamic landscape 
of modern banking, the Bank’s 
refreshed brand identity reflects its 
core values, vision for the future, 
and 
commitment 
to 
delivering 
unparalleled banking experiences. 
The introduction of a refreshed logo 
in May 2023 symbolises its aspiration 
to soar to greater heights, embodying 
its 
modern, 
agile, 
and 
digitally 
forward approach. 
The strength of YES BANK is in each 
individual team member, and the 
strength of each member of the 
team is in the YES BANK platform. 
Keeping this ethos in mind, YES BANK 
proudly announced its partnership 
with the Indian Olympic Association 
as the Principal Sponsor for Team 
India at the Paris Olympics 2024. 
This 
initiative 
underscores 
our 
unwavering 
support 
for 
Indian 
athletes and the Bank's fervent 
desire to highlight its commitment 
on the global stage. To complement 
this endeavour, the Bank introduced 
a special savings account proposition 
named "Yes Glory", along with the 
empowering 
campaign 
"Milkar 
Jitayenge” which reflects our belief 
in 
collective 
success 
and 
the 
spirit of victory.
We, at YES BANK, continuously aspire 
to build a future-ready institution of 
global repute, size, and stature with 
a blend of distinctive capabilities 
that generates a superior value for 
our stakeholders.

ON MITIGATING  
RISKS REVOLVING  
AROUND DATA 
AND INFORMATION  
SECURITY, SUPPORTED  
BY A ROBUST IT 
INFRASTRUCTURE  
WITH RESILIENT  
SYSTEMS AND  
STRINGENT 
SECURITY POLICIES  
AND CONTROLS TO  
SAFEGUARD ITS 
INFORMATION ASSET.
As I conclude, I wish to express my 
sincere thanks to my colleagues 
on the Board for their continued 
support and dedication in steering 
the Bank, as we transition to a 
brighter tomorrow. 
On behalf of the entire Board and 
the Management Team, I extend my 
warmest greetings and express our 
most sincere appreciation for your 
unwavering support and trust in the 
YES BANK franchise.
Sincerely,
Rama Subramaniam Gandhi

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Dear Shareholders,
The financial year 2023-24 was 
another strong year for YES BANK of 
today, marking our third consecutive 
year of full-year profitability, since 
the year of reconstruction. The Bank 
continued to make steady progress 
on its core strategic objective of 
improving profitability and made 
further improvements across key 
operating metrics. In FY 2023-24, YES 
BANK reported a net profit of ` 1,251 
crore, a 74.4% increase compared to 
the previous year. Our balance sheet 
crossed ` 4 lakh crore, registering a 
growth of ~14% over the previous 
year’s size of ` 3.55 lakh crore as at 
March 31, 2023.
In 
this 
promising 
environment, 
YES BANK expanded its physical 
and digital footprint, significantly 
reduced its Net Non-Performing 
(NPA) and the net carrying value 
of Security Receipts (SRs), gained 
a higher incremental CASA share, 
and 
addressed 
the 
shortfall 
in 
lending to Priority Sector (PSL). 
This progress is a testament to 
the responsible banking franchise 
that 
we 
have 
been 
building 
through strategic interventions and 
investments over the last four years. 
Our 
refreshed 
brand 
identity 
and our commitment towards our 
stakeholders - customers, employees, 
and 
shareholders 
have 
been 
pivotal in this journey. The Bank 
made 
substantial 
progress 
on 
PSL 
compliance 
and 
concluded 
FY 2023-24 with NIL shortfall in 
overall PSL as well as its sub- 
categories of small and marginal 
farmers, and weaker section.
Before delving further into our 
performance for the financial year, 
let me share a brief of the operating 
environment. The global economy 
demonstrated resilience in CY 2023 
despite facing significant challenges 
such as elevated inflation rates, tight 
monetary and financial conditions, 
escalating 
geopolitical 
tensions, 
and high public debt burdens. 
Emerging 
markets 
in 
particular, 
experienced robust growth driven 
by strong domestic demand and 
technological advancements. 
On 
the 
domestic 
front, 
India 
emerged 
as 
the 
fastest-growing 
major economy in the world with 
FY 2023-24 GDP growth rate of 8.2%.
Key Highlights of FY 2023-24
During 
FY 
2023-24, 
the 
Bank 
continued to leverage its key business 
levers, including optimising the mix 
within retail assets, strengthening its 
value proposition in the SME/Business 
Banking segment, and maintaining 
leadership in the payment ecosystem. 
Additionally, the Bank scaled its 
digital 
and 
transaction 
banking 
services and utilised its branch 
distribution network as the fulcrum 
of its business. The Bank continued 
to strengthen its governance and 
compliance standards, bolstering the 
balance sheet through granularity, 
building a strong retail asset and 
liability franchise and expanding its 
customer base. 
During 
FY 
2023-24, 
YES 
BANK 
originated new loans and sanctions 
of more than ` 1.14 lakh crore. 
DURING FY 2023-24,  
THE BANK CONTINUED  
TO LEVERAGE ITS KEY  
BUSINESS LEVERS,  
INCLUDING  
OPTIMISING THE MIX  
WITHIN RETAIL ASSETS,  
STRENGTHENING ITS  
VALUE PROPOSITION  
IN THE SME/BUSINESS 
BANKING SEGMENT,  
AND MAINTAINING  
LEADERSHIP IN THE  
PAYMENT ECOSYSTEM.
As at March 31, 2024, Bank’s 
Advances stood at ` 2.28 lakh 
crore, registering a robust growth 
of 13.8%1 over the previous year, 
driven by sustained momentum in 
SME and Mid-corporate Advances 
(25%+ 
Y-O-Y 
growth) 
and 
the 
resumption of growth in corporate 
segment. The Bank maintained the 
ratio of retail and SME advances to 
Wholesale Advances (Mid and Large 
Corporate) at 62%:38%.

As at March 31, 2024, the Bank’s 
deposits reached an all-time high 
of ` 2.66 lakh crore, growing 22.5% 
over the previous year. The CASA 
improved to ~30.9%, an outcome of 
our strategic focus on granular CASA 
deposits. During the year, the Bank 
added ~1.7 million new CASA accounts 
and expanded its distribution network 
with 133 new branches in CASA 
rich clusters, since January 2023. 
Bank’s CASA performance relative 
to the industry, and in the backdrop 
of a difficult interest rate period, has 
been noteworthy.
The Bank increased provisioning in 
Q4, raising the Provision Coverage 
Ratio on NPAs to 67% as at March 31, 
2024 from 62% as at March 31, 2023. 
The Bank reported an operating 
profit of ` 3,386 crore in FY 2023-24, 
a growth of 6.4% over the previous 
year. Total income stood at ` 13,209 
crore, up 13.8% Y-O-Y. Net interest 
income for the year was ` 8,095 crore 
and non-interest income grew 38.8% 
Y-O-Y  to ` 5,114 crore.
There was a significant improvement 
in asset quality, with ratio of Net 
Non-Performing 
(NPA) 
and 
net 
carrying value of Security Receipts 
(SRs) as a percentage of advances 
reduced to 1.1% from 2.4% the 
previous 
year. 
Recoveries 
and 
resolution totalled to ` 5,978 crore. 
The Gross and Net Non-Performing 
Asset 
ratios, 
declined 
by 
50 
basis points and 20 basis points 
respectively to 1.7% and 0.6% as at 
March 31, 2024.
Full-year FY 2023-24 Net Interest 
Margin (NIM) was 2.4%, slightly down 
from 2.6% in FY 2022-23 due to 
negative drag from deposits made 
in lieu of PSL shortfall, which have 
further marginally inched up and 
peaked at ~11% as at March 31, 2024. 
Going forward, we expect a gradual 
reduction in these deposits and 
eventually see this to further reduce 
to below 5% of our total assets over 
the next 3 years and alongside that 
Bank would expect to see a reduction 
in its negative drag on Bank’s margins 
and profitability.
The Bank continued to lead in 
digital 
and 
transaction 
banking, 
gaining higher market share in 
digital 
payments 
platforms, 
with 
market shares in NACH, IMPS, NEFT, 
AePS, and UPI at 13.6%, 8.9%, 8.6%, 
29.3%, 
and 
34.5%, 
respectively, 
for FY 2023-24.
Despite 
one-off 
costs, 
including 
incremental PSLC-related expenses 
and enhanced provisioning coverage, 
the Bank showed resilience, with 
FY 2023-24 Return on Assets (ROA) 
at 0.3% (higher by 10 bps over 
FY 2022-23) with Q4 FY 2023-24 
ROA exiting at 0.5%, a significant 
improvement over previous quarter. 
YES BANK’s proforma CET-1 as at 
March 31, 2024, stood at 13.2%, 
including the impact of warrants 
conversion by CA Basque Investments 
and 
Verventa 
Holdings 
Limited 
undertaken in Q1FY 2024-25.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Dear Shareholders,
At the end of every financial year, 
penning down this letter is something 
I genuinely look forward to. It offers 
a moment to reflect on our progress. 
India's economic resilience stood 
out 
amid 
global 
uncertainties. 
Its GDP grew at an impressive 8.2% 
in FY 2023-24, becoming one of the 
fastest-growing major economies. 
This growth has been underpinned 
by strong performance by the Micro, 
Small, 
and 
Medium 
Enterprises 
(MSME) 
sector, 
catalysed 
by 
technology and data-analytics-driven 
lending. The government's focus on 
enhancing infrastructure and digital 
transformation has been pivotal, 
with initiatives such as PM GatiShakti 
and the Production-Linked Incentive 
(PLI). The Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) introduced several initiatives 
in retail banking this year, including 
the 
introduction 
of 
CBDC 
UPI 
interoperability, revolutionising digital 
payments and making transactions 
seamless and inclusive. 
These developments, alongside a 
stable political environment and 
progressive policies, underscore a 
year of innovation and expansion for 
YES BANK, as we continue to support 
the evolving needs of our retail and 
MSME customers.
Before 
I 
deep 
dive 
into 
the 
performance aspect of our retail 
business, I want to reflect on our 
refreshed brand identity that was 
launched in May 2023. The refreshed 
identity emerged from a well-thought-
out strategy, developed through 
in-depth 
interactions 
with 
all 
stakeholders. This process led to a 
visual representation that accurately 
reflects YES BANK of today.  The new 
logo, evolving from a tick to a soaring 
bird, represents our ambition to 
achieve greater heights and our 
promise to deliver a Seamless, 
Intuitive and Effortless banking 
experience. The bright colours and 
the new form factor are digitally 
friendly, 
complementing 
our 
digital prowess.
The refreshed identity, now visible 
across all customer touchpoints, 
including our branch network, digital 
assets, and payment instruments, 
has received very positive feedback 
from all key stakeholders. Along with 
our brand ethos "Life ko Banao 
Rich", the new visual identity has 
shown 
almost 
instant 
results. 
Independent studies have indicated 
a significant 8-10% growth in our 
spontaneous awareness and brand 
consideration scores over just two 
quarters. Additionally, our website 
traffic 
increased 
by 
18%, 
with 
3.1 million unique visitors.
Another 
significant 
and 
proud 
achievement in this financial year

Talking 
about 
our 
performance 
in retail business, as we enter 
the 5th year of our journey of YES 
BANK of today, on account of 
business calibration, we are a full 
spectrum retail bank growing with 
a strong momentum, dedicated to 
redefine India’s banking landscape, 
accelerating as a diversified, granular 
retail franchise, with strong focus on 
transaction banking.
The YES BANK of today believes in 
bringing the Bank to its customers. 
All our touchpoints are equipped to 
service customers with the entire 
suite of products. We are committed 
to 
enhancing 
accessibility 
and 
convenience 
through 
continuous 
digital 
innovation, 
ensuring 
that 
banking 
services 
are 
available 
wherever our customers are, and 
whenever they need them.
As 
India 
navigates 
the 
path 
towards a Viksit Bharat by 2047, at 
YES BANK, we are cognizant of the 
fact that Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprises (MSME) sector stands 
as a cornerstone of India’s economic 
architecture. They play a crucial 
role in the growth of the economy, 
and 
support 
larger 
industries 
and 
also 
generate 
employment. 
Their expansive footprint across 
rural and urban areas bridges the 
rural-urban 
divide 
and 
fosters 
inclusive growth. 
Supporting the growth of MSMEs 
and emerging large corporates is 
one of our core strategic business 
objectives. 
This 
past 
year, 
we 
introduced 
several 
innovative 
products 
that 
have 
significantly 
enhanced our offerings for MSMEs. 
We launched Digital Over Draft 
(Digi OD), a paperless unsecured 
loan specifically curated to cater 
to 
bottom-of-pyramid 
MSME 
customers. 
Additionally, 
we 
implemented 
algorithm-driven 
(BRE) lending based on cash flow 
assessments 
developed 
using 
statistical scorecards. To further 
support 
our 
MSME 
clients, 
we 
launched the SME Direct Desk, 
which caters to over 50 services, 
specially 
designed 
for 
MSME 
customers. 
Furthermore, 
we 
introduced SMARTFIN, a state-of-
the-art 
Supply 
Chain 
Financing 
platform as part of our new initiatives 
in FY 2023-24 to provide a digitally 
enabled solution for onboarding 
and loan management specifically 
tailored 
for 
MSME 
customers. 
These innovations are part of our 
ongoing commitment to providing 
comprehensive 
and 
accessible 
financial solutions to MSMEs.
I am immensely proud that our work 
is getting recognised by credible 
industry bodies. In Financial year 
2023-24, YES BANK was awarded 
the Best Bank for Promoting 
Government 
Schemes 
in 
the 
Private Sector at the MSME 
Banking Excellence Awards 2023, 
organised 
by 
Confederation 
of 
Indian 
Micro, 
Small 
and 
Medium Enterprises.

Operating Environment 
Key macro trends which are influencing the Bank’s business and our response
Resilient Global Economy, Moderating 
Inflation and Improved Domestic Stability
The 
global 
economy 
demonstrated 
resilience 
in 
FY 
2023-24, 
outperforming 
expectations 
despite 
geopolitical tensions and monetary policy tightening by 
major central banks. The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) forecasts global growth at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 
2025, driven by the United States, key emerging markets, 
and fiscal support in China. 
India remained one of the fastest-growing economies 
of the world during the year, and exhibited sound 
macroeconomic fundamentals. While urban demand 
remained strong, the rural sector also recovered after 
the initial struggle. Capex spends by the government 
(both Centre and state) played a pivotal role in sustaining 
growth momentum. Barring a few sectors, private capex 
continued to lag despite healthy balance sheets of 
banks and corporates, although recent surveys hint at a 
resurgence in capex. As per the government estimates, 
India’s GDP is projected to have clocked 8.2% growth in 
FY 2023-24, compared with 7% in FY 2022-23.
While global headwinds posed risks to India's economy, 
macroeconomic stability is anchored by moderating 
inflation and the ongoing fiscal conditions. Headline CPI 
inflation dropped to 5.2% in the second half of FY 2023-24, 
from 5.5% in the first half of FY 2023-24, averaging at 
~5.4% for the financial year 2023-24. Trade gap improved 
slightly in FY 2023-24, compared to FY 2022-23 even as 
moderation was witnessed in exports and imports.
Despite a challenging global environment, the Indian 
banking sector remained stable, with improving profitability 
and asset quality, adequate level of liquidity and capital 
buffers. Moreover, RBI’s macro-stress tests revealed that 
Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) are well capitalised 
and capable of absorbing the most adverse economic 
shocks even without capital infusion.
Our Response
The Bank closely monitored global and domestic 
economic trends, and adjusted its actions according to 
the country risks and sector-specific impacts. In context, 
Bank also hosted 'The Growth Summit', fostering 
insightful discussions with diverse stakeholders, aimed 
at propelling India towards a USD 10 trillion economy. 
Amidst the macro-economic backdrop, the Bank 
continued to drive growth with improvement in 
profitability with a focus on retail asset mix optimisation, 
strong 
growth 
within 
SME 
and 
Mid-Corporate 
segments, and further improving the share of its 
branch distribution, by leveraging the network to 
offer a full spectrum of products. The Bank, through 
its comprehensive strategy, reported reductions 
in shortfalls in PSL categories and sub-categories. 
The Bank further fortified its balance sheet through a 
significant reduction in its Gross NPA and Net NPA.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Our Response
The Bank is committed to complying with RBI's guidelines 
and regulations, ensuring a robust compliance culture 
that prioritises customer protection, risk management, 
and sustainable practices. The Bank has implemented 
comprehensive policies and controls to reflect the latest 
directives, including those related to IT governance, 
customer service, green deposits, asset quality, and 
investments. The Bank’s leadership is dedicated to 
fostering a culture of compliance, regularly evaluating 
and updating our policies to embrace best practices 
and align with RBI's vision for a resilient and sustainable 
banking system.
Government and Regulatory Interventions
Key guidelines issued during the year focussed around 
strengthening 
governance 
and 
risk 
management, 
enhancing customer service and grievance redressal, 
aiding customer interests, focussing on improving asset 
quality and investment practices, and fostering a robust 
compliance culture.
Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled Services 
(ITeS)
To exercise control and ensure due diligence with 
regards to various risks, RBI issued Master Directions 
on Outsourcing of Information Technology Services. 
Further, the regulator also issued Master Directions on 
IT Governance, Risk, Controls, Assurance Practices and 
Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Management.
Enhancing Customer Service and Fair Lending 
Practices
RBI issued a comprehensive framework for strengthening 
and improving the efficacy of the grievance redressal 
mechanism and customer service provided by the Credit 
Institutions (CIs) and Credit Information Companies (CICs) 
along with a framework for compensation to customers 
for delayed updation/rectification of credit information. 
The central bank also issued various guidelines to ensure 
reasonableness and transparency in disclosure of penal 
interest to promote fair lending practices amongst 
regulated entities. 
Improving Asset Quality and Investment Practices
In response to the high growth seen in consumer 
credit and increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank 
borrowings, RBI increased the applicable risk weights 
in certain components of consumer credit and advised 
banks and NBFCs to strengthen their internal surveillance 
mechanisms, address the build-up of risks, and institute 
suitable safeguards. The Regulator also issued instructions 
restricting investments by a regulated entity (RE) in any 
scheme of Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) which has 
downstream investments either directly or indirectly in a 
debtor company of the RE, to curb situation of possible 
evergreening through investments in units of AIF.

ESG and Climate Change
In FY 2023-24, sustainability and climate action remained 
prominent agendas in global and national discussions, 
notably through the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration 
under India’s Presidency, which reaffirmed the G20 
leaders’ commitment to advancing sustainable finance. 
The endorsed recommendations included mechanisms to 
ensure the timely and adequate mobilisation of resources 
for climate finance while supporting transition activities 
tailored to individual country circumstances. The UNFCCC 
CoP-28 forum urged Parties to intensify global climate 
ambition by the end of the decade through decisive actions. 
India also called for a clear roadmap for climate finance 
as an essential element for achieving the quantified goals. 
Operationalisation of The Loss and Damage (L&D) fund at 
CoP-28, became a pivotal moment in climate justice for 
countries grappling with climate change impacts. 
Aligned with its Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), India showcased its climate ambition at CoP-28 by 
launching the Green Credit programme, which incentivises 
voluntary pro-planet actions, under its LiFE (Lifestyle for 
Environment) initiative. Allocations under the interim Union 
Budget 2024-25 reaffirmed India’s commitment to Net Zero 
by 2070 by highlighting measures in four key areas: green 
energy, electric vehicles, bio-manufacturing & bio-foundry, 
and blue economy. The Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI), also took significant steps to boost green 
investments by prescribing additional requirements 
for issuing transition bonds to prevent mis-allocation 
and pioneering the framework for ESG rating providers. 
In April 2023, RBI issued a framework for acceptance of 
Green Deposits which aims to direct the flow of funds to 
sustainable projects and initiatives, protect the interest of 
the depositors and address greenwashing concerns. 
The year also witnessed significant regulatory initiatives 
to 
promote 
ESG 
governance. 
The 
central 
bank 
intensified efforts to develop policy interventions aimed 
at building resilience within the Indian banking sector 
and outlined clear supervisory expectations through a 
draft disclosure framework on climate-related financial 
risks. SEBI introduced the BRSR Core standards which 
expands the scope of BRSR (Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report) reporting framework by including 
transparency in the value chain of listed entities. SEBI’s glide 
path for companies to adopt the BRSR Core disclosures 
aims to ensure that emissions across the value chain are 
adequately accounted and reported.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Our Response
YES BANK continues to actively monitor developments in 
the ESG and climate landscape by collaborating closely 
with a diverse range of stakeholders to integrate key 
sustainability themes and practices into its business. 
The Bank has published its BRSR as part of its Integrated 
Annual Report (refer to 
 page 328) and aligns its 
ESG disclosures with benchmark reporting frameworks 
such as the GRI Standards and the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations.
For its comprehensive ESG and climate disclosures, 
YES BANK achieved the highest score among Indian 
Banks, with a S&P Global ESG score of 74 (out of 100)*. 
The Bank maintained its rating of 'A-' (Leadership Band) 
by CDP, making it the highest-rated Indian Bank for 
climate disclosures. The Bank has established a robust 
climate governance framework, with Board-level and 
Executive-level committees overseeing its climate 
strategy. It strives to align its business with the goals 
of the Paris Agreement and India's net zero transition. 
YES BANK has pledged to reduce GHG emissions from 
its operations to Net Zero by 2030. In FY 2023-24, 
the Bank increased the share of renewable energy 
in the Bank’s electricity mix to 12.31% resulting in 
approximately 5,254 tCO2e in avoided emissions.
In line with its climate commitments, the Bank has 
started developing its capacity for scenario analysis 
and is leveraging scenario-based target setting 
approaches to develop long-term climate resilient 
strategies and roadmaps. To start with, the Bank has 
measured and reported the financed emissions of 
its fund-based electricity generation portfolio. It has 
set decarbonisation targets to reduce the financed 
emissions intensity of its electricity generation loan 
portfolio, in line with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) well-below 2-degree scenario, striving for a 
1.5-degree scenario. YES BANK continues to support 
climate-aligned sectors such as renewable energy and 
electric vehicles and has developed targeted products 
for green financing, such as YES Kiran rooftop solar 
loans for SMEs.
*YES BANK achieved the highest S&P Global ESG score amongst Indian banks based on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability 
Assessment (CSA) 2023. The Bank’s S&P Global ESG score stood at 74 (out of 100) as at February 16, 2024. The Bank’s S&P Global CSA 
Score stood at 73 (out of 100) as of December 1, 2023

The Digital Banking environment in India has entered a

in Artificial Intelligence (AI), shifting customer preferences, 
market dynamics and regulatory changes. The previous 
year witnessed significant policy reforms and regulatory 
changes  in India's banking sector, in the form of new

banking standards amongst others, which were aimed 
at enhancing resilience and transparency for ensuring a

Data Privacy and Cyber Security
As the financial ecosystem shifts towards open banking, 
ecosystem banking, and digital payments and lending, 
banks are faced with the need to have robust IT 
infrastructure with resilient systems and stringent security 
policies & controls to safeguard their information assets. 
Consequently, security risks and related complexities have 
also emerged, which may result in breach of confidentiality 
and 
compromise 
of 
customer’s 
classified 
data. 
Therefore, staying ahead of the curve in cyber security 
measures has become crucial for financial institutions to 
maintain a secure digital environment for their customers.
Our Response
YES BANK’s comprehensive information security 
programme ensures utmost confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability of its infrastructure. The Bank maintains 
continuous oversight over this issue through a Board 
Level Committee, a management-level ‘Security 
Council’ and independent audits by the Internal 
Audit Team and an external third-party. The Bank 
has adopted Global Information Security Standard 
ISO 27001:2013 and implemented Board-approved 
Information Security Policy and Cyber Security policy, 
as directives to protect its information assets. 
The Bank has adopted a risk-based approach and 
follows defence-in-depth to protect its information 
systems against cyber-attacks. It has adopted a 
Cyber Security Resilient Framework to manage 
cyber security risk. The Bank has established a 
24x7 Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor 
cyber-related risks and keep a vigil on suspicious 
network traffic and enables proactive threat detection 
and response. The Bank has also embraced the 
principles of Security/Privacy by Design to embed 
privacy safeguards in all its processes.

Resilient economic growth
The Indian economy has continued to exhibit robust 
resilience despite global headwinds and geopolitical 
tensions, clocking a GDP growth of 8.2% in FY 2023-24, 
one of the highest among the world’s major economies. 
Credit disbursal and the capital investment cycle is 
unfolding successfully, especially with strengthening 
of balance sheets of corporates and banks, and gross 
NPAs of banks at decade lows. With credit demand and 
growth outpacing growth in deposits, the banking sector 
is navigating competitive headwinds in a bid to mobilise 
deposits while minimising the impact on margins brought 
on by rising funding costs.

is geared to further improve profitability with consistent 
change across metrics on customer base, book quality, 
liquidity and coverage ratio, augmented by a strengthened

The Board has the overall responsibility for Risk 
Management and oversees the Bank’s Risk & Control 
environment, and also reviews and approves the policies 
as part of overseeing the Risk Management practices. 
In this regard the Board:
	y
Ensures that comprehensive policies, systems and 
controls are in place to identify, monitor and manage 
material risks at a Bank wide level with clearly 
defined risk limits
	y
Lays down Risk Appetite Statement which articulates 
the quantum of risk the Bank is willing and able to 
assume in its exposures and business activities, in 
pursuit of its strategic objectives and desired returns
	y
Establishes policies governing various aspects of 
risk management, which lay down the Risk Appetite 
Framework within the overall Risk Appetite Statement
The Board has put in place Board-level Committees, 
as highlighted above, which inter-alia pertain to Risk 
Management, to deal with risk management practices, 
policies, procedures and to have adequate oversight on 
the risks faced by the Bank. The Board Committees have 
in turn set up various Executive-level Committees for 
oversight over specific risks (details of these Committees 
can be referred to on 
 Page 78
These Committees review various aspects / key risks 
and ensure that the best-in-class frameworks are in 
place to oversee day-to-day management of underlying 
business activities, transactions and associated risks 
while dealing with internal and external stakeholders. 
Further, Risk-based events, potential threats, performance 
of the Bank vis-à-vis Risk Limits and Risk Appetite, and Risk 
Profile dashboard covering key risk indicators, among 
others, are presented to these Committees, with periodic 
trends highlighted along with level and direction of risks.
Additionally, in line with best Risk Governance practices, 
the Bank has independent credit underwriting and 
risk management verticals. The underwriting vertical 
consisting of Credit Units is headed by the Chief Credit 
Risk Officer (CCRO), and the risk controls and policy 
vertical consisting of various independent control units is 
headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The CRO reports to 
the Risk Management Committee, while the CCRO reports 
to the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, also 
accountable to Board Credit Committee.
The Bank also conducts a detailed Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Policy (ICAAP) review exercise, 
which is approved by the Board at least on an annual 
basis to identify its risk universe, review its risk appetite 
in line with business strategy as well as assess its internal 
controls and mitigation measures in place for the risks and 
capital requirements.

inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems or external events, including loss arising 
out of legal risk.
Governance Framework
Operational 
Risk 
is 
monitored 
and 
reviewed 
by 
Operational Risk Management Committee on an overall 
basis. Further, it is also reviewed by various Executive 
Committees, i.e., Product Process Approval Committee, 
Fraud Identification Committee, Accountability Review 
Committee, Whistle Blower Committee, Disciplinary 
Committee, Standing Committee on Customer Service 
based on the underlying risk.

by Risk Management Committee (RMC)  at the 
Board-level
Impact
Operational Risk may lead to financial loss to the Bank. 
Additionally, Operational Risk events may lead to multiple 
customer grievances and cause reputation loss to the 
Bank. The Bank may also face legal actions and incur losses 
due to penalties imposed or compensation paid to the 
customers as required by the legal or regulatory bodies. 
Operational risk events may also result in loss of data or 
pose an increased information security risk.

Brief Description of Risk
Market Risk is the risk of loss in on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in 
market prices due to unfavourable movement in market 
variables such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, 
price risk, volatility risk, among others. 
Governance Framework
Market Risk is monitored and reviewed by Asset & Liability 
Management Committee (ALCO).
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls 
across the organisation to mitigate Operational Risk. 
These include: 
	y
The Bank manages market risk through well-defined 
Market Risk, Investment and Derivative Policies and 
limit framework
	y
Additionally, the Bank has a robust limit framework 
which supports various measures such as Risk 
Sensitivity, Value-at-Risk, Stop Loss, Stress Testing, and 
Rate Scan, among others
	y
Additionally, the Bank has strong processes and 
systems in place, along with independent Middle 
Office and Market Risk Function to monitor the risk 
on an ongoing basis and submit the same with the 
ALCO and the Board
Impact
Market risk may have an impact on the Bank's financial 
performance, capital ratios, regulatory compliance, and 
reputation. It is essential for banks to manage market 
risk effectively to ensure that they maintain a diversified 
portfolio, reduce their exposure to risk, and minimise 
potential losses.

Brief Description of Risk
Credit risk is defined as potential losses associated 
with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or 
counterparties. Losses stem from outright default or a 
reduction in portfolio value.
Governance Framework
Credit Risk is monitored and reviewed by various 
committees such as Management Credit Committee 
(MCC), Executive Credit Committee (ECC), Stressed 
Asset 
Management 
Committee 
(SAMC), 
Committee 
for 
Classification 
of 
Wilful 
Defaulters 
and 
Non 
Co-operative Borrowers.
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
	y
The Bank has a distinct architecture of policies, 
procedures and systems for managing credit risk in 
both its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale 
lending is managed on an individual and portfolio 
basis. In contrast, retail lending, given the granularity of 
individual exposures, is managed largely on a portfolio 
basis across various products and customer segments
	y
Furthermore, multiple credit risk models/scorecards 
are used to appraise and score different customer 
segments under Retail and SME segments. In 
wholesale segments, credit risk is managed by capping 
exposures based on borrower groups, industry, 
credit rating grades, country, among others. This is 
backed by portfolio diversification, stringent credit 
approval processes and periodic post-disbursement 
monitoring and remedial measures
	y
For wholesale and retail segments, robust front-end 
and back-end systems are in place to ensure credit 
quality and minimise loss from defaults. In the Retail 
Assets space, the Bank has adopted a calibrated 
and granular asset growth strategy with emphasis 
on superior risk filters and adoption of digital based 
lending, with an endeavour to increase the proportion 
of Retail in the Bank’s overall advances book
	y
The Bank has been able to ensure strong asset 
quality on incremental lending post-March 2020, 
despite volatile times in the lending environment, 
by stringently adhering to prudent norms and 
institutionalised processes
Impact
Credit risk may have a significant impact on the 
Bank's financial performance, capital ratios, regulatory 
compliance and reputation. It is essential for the Bank to 
manage credit risk effectively to ensure that it maintains a 
diversified loan portfolio, reduce its exposure to risk, and 
minimise potential losses.
RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
Credit Risk

Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
The Bank monitors concentration in its portfolio, across 
various categories such as but not limited to name 
concentration, 
concentrations 
to 
business 
groups, 
rating-wise concentration, sectors (industry groups), 
and correlated industry groups (economic sectors), 
among others. The Bank uses percentage analysis 
as well as Normalised Herfindahl–Hirschman Index 
(HHI) for analysing concentration risk, over and above 
various concentration limits such as sector caps, and 
rating wise caps.
Impact 
Asset concentration risk can have a significant impact on 
the Bank's financial performance, credit quality, regulatory 
compliance and reputation. 
Brief Description of Risk
Asset Concentration Risk is defined as risk arising from 
any single exposure or a group of exposures with the 
potential to produce losses large enough (relative to the 
Bank’s capital, total assets, or overall risk level) which can 
pose a threat to the Bank’s health or ability to maintain its 
core operations.
Governance Framework
Asset Concentration Risk is primarily monitored and 
reviewed by Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
(ERMC).

Brief Description of Risk
Compliance Risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, 
material financial loss, or loss to reputation, the Bank 
may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, 
regulations, rules applicable to its banking activities.
Governance Framework
Compliance risk is reviewed and monitored by the 
Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC).
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
	y
There is a Board-approved Compliance Policy in place, 
which is reviewed on an annual basis
	y
The 
Compliance 
function 
tracks 
and 
reviews 
compliance with regulatory guidelines
Impact
Non-compliance with applicable regulations and laws 
can result in adverse regulatory action which may have 
implications on the Bank’s business (in case of stringent 
regulatory action in the form of curtailing expansion/
specific business lines etc). This may also result in 
reputation risk to the Bank.
Compliance Risk
R5
Brief Description of Risk
Reputation risk refers to the potential damage to the 
Bank's reputation, brand image or public perception due 
to negative publicity, scandal, adverse regulatory actions 
or other events. The risk arises when an organisation’s 
actions and behaviours do not align with its stated values 
or societal expectations. 
Governance Framework
Reputation Risk is reviewed and monitored by Enterprise 
Risk Management Committee (ERMC).
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
	y
Oversight of Reputation Risk Management, related 
policy and reputation crisis management action plan 
by a senior Management level Committee (ERMC). 
The Committee monitors Reputation Risk quantified 
through a comprehensive scorecard and recommends 
necessary actions
	y
Reputed auditors/internal and concurrent audit 
framework
	y
Obtaining 
continuous 
customer 
feedback 
and 
oversight by Customer Service Committee of the 
Board to ensure superior service delivery
	y
Grievance redressal mechanisms
	y
Review of new products by senior management, audit 
& compliance, and risk management through PPAC 
(Product and Process Approval Committee) 
	y
Tracking adverse news on traditional/social media, 
analysis and reporting for efficient media management
	y
Social Media Policy, Code of Conduct Policy and 
trainings
	y
Creating brand image through responsible banking 
supported through business and financial accolades
	y
Review of legal cases filed against the Bank to ensure 
there is no undue reputation risk
	y
Board-approved KYC / AML policy and monitoring of 
transactions to ensure that no money laundering is 
done through the Bank
Impact
Reputation risk can result in a decline in market value, 
loss of customers, difficulty in attracting and retaining 
employees, and increased regulatory scrutiny. It may 
undermine the public's confidence in the Bank leading 
to liquidity risk to the Bank. Reputation risk can have 
long-lasting effects and may be difficult to recover from 
an extreme event.

	y
The Bank conducts various studies to assess the 
behavioural 
pattern 
of 
non-contractual 
assets 
and liabilities and embedded options available to 
customers that are used while managing maturity 
gaps. The Bank also has the necessary framework to 
manage intraday liquidity risk
	y
The Bank has been maintaining Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) in line 
with extant regulatory guidelines. Further, the Bank 
has internal thresholds for these ratios more stringent 
than the regulatory minimum
	y
To avoid liquidity risk arising out of excess depositor 
concentration, the Bank has a strong mechanism to 
track top depositor concentration, bulk and retail 
depositor concentration, with internal policy limits as 
well as a robust monitoring and reporting process
Impact
ALM Risk may result in the Bank not being able to meet 
obligations to its depositors and creditors on a timely 
basis, which can result in severe reputational risk and 
a run on the Bank, thereby resulting in insolvency. 
Improper 
management 
of 
liquidity 
risk 
will 
also 
result in the Bank having to borrow at higher rates to 
meet its obligations, thereby eroding its profitability, 
and thereby capital. Excess interest rate risk may also 
result in erosion of profitability when interest rates 
move adversely.
Brief Description of Risk
ALM Risk arises on account of liquidity risk and interest 
rate risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not 
be able to meet its short-term financial obligations due 
to an asset-liability mismatch or interest rate fluctuations. 
Further, asset liability mismatch may also lead to interest 
rate risk to the Bank. 
Governance Framework
ALM risk is reviewed and monitored by Asset & Liability 
Management Committee (ALCO).
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
	y
The Bank has an asset–liability management policy 
for liquidity and interest rate risk management 
that is implemented, monitored and periodically 
reviewed by the ALCO
	y
As part of this process, the Bank has various Board-
approved limits for both liquidity and interest rate 
risks. While maturity gap and stock ratio limits help 
manage liquidity risk, net interest income and market 
value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk. This 
is reinforced by a comprehensive Board-approved 
stress testing framework covering liquidity and 
interest rate risk

completeness. The overall strategy of the Bank is reviewed 
with and approved by the Board. Financial planning 
for the upcoming financial year is conducted in alignment 
with the Bank’s long-term strategic objectives. The annual 
budgets and business plans are also approved by 
the Board after deliberations and discussions with 
the Management. 
The Bank does regular monitoring of actual outcomes 
vis-à-vis budgeted targets, which are reviewed by Business 
Heads and MD & CEO. The Bank also periodically reviews 
financial performance against its strategic objectives and 
business plans through its Apex Management Committee 
(AMCOM), and identifies course corrections as necessary. 
Actual performance vs. budget is reviewed by the Board 
on a quarterly basis.
The Bank also tracks Strategic Risk by evaluating 
performance on key identified metrics linked to the Bank’s 
strategic objectives. The Strategic Risk is reviewed on a 
quarterly basis and mitigation plan is documented in case 
of moderate or high risk. Strategic Risk is also tracked and 
presented to the ERMC committee as well as RMC and 
Board as part of the ERM dashboard on a quarterly basis.
Impact
Delay or failure in achieving the Bank’s strategies and / 
or 
expected 
business 
and 
financial 
performance 
outcomes will ultimately impact growth.
Brief Description of Risk
Strategic risks are those that undermine the organisation’s 
capability to implement business strategy or deliver 
expected outcomes.
Governance Framework
The Bank periodically reviews financial performance 
against its strategic objectives and business plans through 
its Apex Management Committee (AMCOM), and identifies 
course corrections as necessary. Actual performance vis-à-
vis budget are reviewed by the Board on a quarterly basis.
Aspects pertaining to Strategic Risk are also reviewed and 
monitored by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
(ERMC) on a periodic basis.
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
Strategic risk management at the Bank is not viewed as 
a task that is performed in isolation. It is ingrained in the 
Bank’s day-to-day processes as well as our decision-making 
and governance structures. All Group entities conduct 
annual 
business 
and 
capital 
planning 
exercise 
individually based on business strategy and risk appetite. 
The regulatory guidelines are also considered while 
formulating the business strategy, as are issues of talent, 
organisational culture, risk management and governance.

Attrition Risk is the potential of losing employees from the 
organisation due to resignation, or retirement along with 
lack of interest from potential employees to join the Bank.
Governance Framework
Attrition risk is reviewed and monitored by the Apex 
Management Committee.
Risk Measurement, Management and Mitigation
The Bank has undertaken various initiatives such as timely 
closure of branches, step-up targets, hiring through 
alternate channels, prompt redressal of employee 
grievances, incentive in-line with other Banks, de-linking 
of local conveyance and mobile reimbursement from 
minimum sales achievement, identifying and elevating top 
performing frontline sales/service executives, in order to 
ensure retention of junior management levels of Retail 
segment. Additionally, the Bank has created Retention 
Action Workgroup RAW - a dedicated team focussed on 
identifying and addressing key factors that contribute 
to employee satisfaction and commitment to the 
organisation, which has proven instrumental in enhancing 
employee retention.
Impact 
Attrition may impact the Bank in several ways such as 
lowering the morale, reduction in productivity and also 
its culture. Higher attrition is also linked to higher costs 
associated with replacing, onboarding and training the 
human assets. It may additionally result in operational 
risk due to lack of adequate skilled manpower to perform 
critical activities.

Climate Risk
Brief Description of Risk
Climate risks are emerging long-term risks comprising:
Physical Risks: Direct physical impacts of climate change 
ranging from acute risks (such as extreme weather 
events) to chronic risks (like gradual rise in sea level 
and temperature).
Transition Risks: Risks arising from external efforts to 
address climate change such as regulatory and policy 
changes, technological advancement or shifts in investor 
sentiment and consumer behaviour.
Impact
Increase in frequency and severity of climatic events may 
adversely affect the Bank’s infrastructure, employees 
and client performance, and therefore, the Bank’s 
revenues and costs.
Stricter environmental regulations and policy changes may 
impact operations / strategy of the Bank and/or its clients.

Brief Description of Risk
Information security encompasses a broad spectrum of 
practices and technologies aimed at protecting data from 
unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 
It encompasses not only technological solutions, but also 
policies, procedures, and awareness initiatives designed 
to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities.
Information security risk refers to the potential threats and 
vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of sensitive information and critical 
systems with in our environment. These risks encompass 
various scenarios, including cyber-attacks, data breaches, 
insider threats, regulatory non-compliance and operational 
disruptions. This can result in financial losses, reputation 
damage, regulatory sanctions and broader implications for 
the stability of the financial system.
Effectively managing information security risks involves 
identifying, assessing, prioritising, and mitigating potential 
threats to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
of information assets. This is essential for maintaining 
trust, protecting assets and ensuring the resilience 
of banking operations in an increasingly digital and 
interconnected landscape.
Governance Framework
Information Security Risk is monitored and reviewed by 
the Security Council on overall basis and for customer 
transactions 
by 
Fraud 
& 
Suspicious

Stakeholder Engagement &  
Materiality Assessment1
Given its vast national presence, depth and breadth of its offerings, and a wide array of 
business activities, YES BANK serves a broad spectrum of stakeholder groups, each of 
whom either help contribute to or are impacted by the Bank’s value creation journey. 
Based on a survey of its top management and senior 
leadership, the Bank has identified 10 critical stakeholder 
groups that are most affected by its business activities, 
and in turn, impact its ability to create value. The Bank 
believes in engaging closely with all its key stakeholders 
in order to better understand and address their needs, 
and incorporate their feedback into the Bank’s overall 
business strategy. The Bank follows a robust stakeholder 
engagement 
model, 
employing 
a 
combination 
of 
structured, and need-based engagement mechanisms 
to reach out to these stakeholder groups on a periodic 
basis. The Bank has set up dedicated grievance redressal 
mechanisms and set up specialised business units, 
through which stakeholders  can redress any of their 
grievances. Critical concerns voiced by stakeholders 
are communicated to relevant Board-level committees, 
periodically. In FY 2023-24, the Bank continued to engage 
with its critical stakeholder groups through various means, 
a summary of which is provided below.

Materiality Assessment
YES BANK operates within a fast moving and rapidly changing banking and finance sector 
in one of the world’s fastest growing and emerging economies. With India emerging 
as the world’s foremost growth engine, the Bank’s business not only contributes to 
the country’s economic progress, but also plays a key role in the nation’s sustainable 
development agenda.
The Bank’s operations, business activities, products and services, and relationships touch a multitude of stakeholders 
across the country and help advance India’s national priorities. Cognisant of the impacts its business can have across 
economic, environmental and social dimensions, YES BANK proactively carries out a materiality assessment exercise 
triennially to identify and mitigate negative impacts and advance positive impacts, originating from its business activities. 
The Bank’s material topics represent its most significant impacts across its operations, business, products and value 
chain. In FY 2023-24, the Bank conducted a fresh materiality assessment. The material topics identified as part of the 
materiality assessment are considered pertinent areas of interest to the Bank’s stakeholders, forming a key input to the 
management’s strategy and approach towards sustainability, and guiding the Bank’s sustainability-led disclosures in this 
Integrated Annual Report.
Methodology: Materiality Assessment FY 2023-241
The Bank’s materiality assessment exercise for FY 2023-24 
followed a comprehensive 5-step methodology based on 
the requirements of benchmark sustainability disclosure 
frameworks such as SEBI’s Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework, GRI 
Standards (2021), and the international <IR> framework. 
To holistically assess the impacts of its business activities, 
the Bank adopted the double-materiality concept, 
analysing both the impacts that its business has on the 
economy, environment, and people, including impacts on 
their human rights; and the impact of current sustainability 
issues on the Bank’s own enterprise value creation process.
Impact Identification
1
	y
Undertaking a comprehensive desk-research, BFSI 
sector peer benchmarking, and internal deliberations 
to curate an extensive list of impacts that arise or may 
arise from the Bank’s business
	y
Covering impacts that could positively or negatively 
affect the economy, environment, and people, 
(including impacts on their human rights), and impacts 
that in-turn could affect the Bank’s enterprise value 
creation process
	y
83 impacts were identified, categorised, and clubbed 
under 15 potential material topics
Stakeholder Engagement 
2
	y
Roll out of a stakeholder engagement programme to 
gather insights from the Bank’s key stakeholders on 
the materiality of the impacts identified
	y
A digital survey was curated to collect stakeholder 
ratings on the materiality of all impacts 
	y
The survey covered 11 key internal and external 
stakeholder groups: Top Management, Regulators, 
Employees, Customers, Shareholders & Investors, 
Financial & ESG Analysts, Business Associates, 
Suppliers, Media, Industry & Peers, and Community 
groups

Impact Significance
3
	y
Each 
identified 
impact 
was 
evaluated 
as 
positive 
or 
negative and actual or potential 
and assigned a 'significance' 
score based on its severity, 
likelihood, scale and scope, and 
impact on human rights. The 
Bank’s top management and 
senior leadership reviewed the 
'significance' rating of the impact
Materiality Matrix
5
	y
The ratings of each topic were plotted 
on two axes, “importance to enterprise 
value creation” and “importance to 
external stakeholders” 
	y
The median rating was taken to be the 
materiality threshold for both aspects
	y
11 out of 15 topics rated on or above 
the median were determined as the 
Bank’s most significant material topics
	y
The final materiality ratings and 
material topics were approved by the 
Sustainability Council and the CSR and 
ESG Committee of the Board
Impact Prioritisation
4
	y
The stakeholder ratings (step 2) 
and the significance scores (step 
3) were mapped to arrive at the 
prioritisation of the identified 
impacts and the corresponding 
15 potential material topics
Materiality Matrix: FY 2023-24
The Bank’s materiality matrix 
was constructed by plotting 
the ratings of material topics 
by “Importance to Enterprise 
Value Creation” on the X axis 
and by “Importance to external 
stakeholders” on the Y axis. 
The change in the number of 
material topics from 10 to 11 
from the previous financial 
year was due to the addition of 
“advancing sustainable finance” 
as a separate material topic. 
Other minor changes were due 
to changes in the nomenclature 
of some material topics for 
the purpose of enhancing the 
topic’s coverage and coherence.

skill and experience of the directors. At the time of 
appointment/re-appointment, the Bank’s Board-level

the qualification, knowledge, skill sets and experience 
of the directors. Upon its review, if the N&RC finds that 
the directors meet the requirements of the Bank, it

appointment/re-appointment. 
Further, the N&RC on an annual basis, also assesses the 
various skill sets and experience of the Board members 
and evaluates the same as against the Bank’s requirements 
based on business and regulatory norms. If the N&RC 
forms an opinion that there is a need for induction of a 
new director with a specific skill or experience to bridge 
the gap, it makes a recommendation to the Board for 
induction of a new director. In such cases, the Bank follows 
the procedure laid down in the policy with regard to Fit and 
Proper Criteria for induction of a director.

Board Remuneration Policy1
The Board has adopted a Board Remuneration Policy 
in line with the requirements under the provisions of 
Section 197 and Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013. 
The Policy is prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act and rules made thereunder, SEBI LODR 
Regulations, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circular 
and guidelines issued thereunder. The Board and the 
Board-level Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
(N&RC) reviews and amends this policy from time to time. 
The objective of the Policy is to put in place a mechanism 
for determining the remuneration of Directors of the Bank 
in terms of the statutory and business requirements of 
the Bank. The Bank has a separate Total Rewards Policy 
articulated in line with relevant RBI guidelines which 
inter alia deals with the Compensation & Benefits of the 
Managing Director & CEO and the Whole-time Directors.
The N&RC recommends to the Board the remuneration 
for the Chairperson, Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), 
and Executive Directors. NEDs are paid sitting fees within 
the permissible limit prescribed under the Companies 
Act, 2013, Listing Regulations and other regulatory 
guidelines, as amended from time to time. The N&RC 
recommends changes in sitting fees based on factors 
such as performance parameters of the Bank, industry 
benchmarking, etc. which is approved by the Board. 
The Bank may also pay NEDs a fixed remuneration in 
accordance to the RBI circular no. RBI/2021-22/24 DOR.
GOV.REC.8/29.67.001/2021-22 dated April 26, 2021. 
The remuneration of all Executive Directors are governed 
by the Bank’s Board-approved ‘Total Rewards Policy’ which 
includes fixed pay and variable pay, performance bonus 
and stock-linked incentives, terms and conditions of 
termination (including payments), malus/clawback clauses 
as per the Bank’s policy, and retirals such as Provident 
Fund and Gratuity. 
The remuneration payable to the Chairperson and 
Executive Directors is subject to the prior approval of RBI 
and final approval of the shareholders. 
Remuneration is benchmarked for every role against 
market data provided by Bank’s appointed remuneration 
consultant. A reputed and credible third party organisation 
has been onboarded as remuneration consultant.
There were no proposals related to change of 
remuneration of Directors sent to the Board in FY 2023-24. 
The remuneration for Chairman and Executive Director 
were approved in FY 2022-23, details of which are available 
on page 268 of the Bank’s Integrated Annual Report for 
FY 2022-23 which can be accessed here: 
https://www.yesbank.in/pdf?name=integrated_

with the guidelines stated in the RBI circular dated 
04 November 2019 (Ref. RBI/2019-20/89, DOR.APPT. 
BC. No. 23/29.67.001/2019-20). The Bank has a process 
of defining measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
for MD & CEO under financial & non-financial parameters. 
Financial KPIs include metrics such as profitability, asset 
quality, deposit growth etc. while non-financial KPIs include 
metrics on governance and compliance, ESG and climate 
change, human resources etc.
The MD&CEO’s Variable pay consists of performance 
bonus and stock-linked Incentive. The variable pay is 
governed by regulatory guidelines which includes deferral 
arrangement. While part of performance bonus is 
deferred over subsequent three performance periods, the 
stock-linked incentive vests over 42 months from the grant

clauses as per the Bank’s policy.
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer’s Compensation

financial year is 71.4x*. The ratio of the percentage increase in the annual total compensation of the MD 
& CEO to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees stood at 1.951.
*Remuneration includes fixed pay, perquisite value, performance bonus paid and value of stock options granted during the year (this

Supplier base 
In FY 2023-24, the Bank transacted with over 7,700+ 
suppliers for provision of goods and services across 
all its offices and branches. The Bank has formed 
strategic relationships with eminent Indian and global 
companies, however, significant portion of transactions 
and procurements are done through domestic vendors. 
As the Bank is spread across the country, it also procures 
from local vendors for localised consumption of 
products and services.
Governance and risk management 
The Bank has established a clearly defined risk management 
framework for its suppliers based on the risk profile of the 
vendor and item category. In order to mitigate the risks for 
the Bank, control and governance parameters have been 
constructed, implemented and reviewed on a periodic 
basis. Additionally, the Bank has implemented Vendor 
Performance Evaluation Framework wherein periodic 
vendor performance reviews are conducted based on 
vendor category. The Bank has also put in place processes 
to ensure Vendor Redundancy/Business Continuity 
Planning (BCP) for critical spend categories. In additional 
to assessing vendors’ credibility, capability and cost to 
deliver, YES BANK has implemented well-established 
vendor guidelines, outlining its vendor selection criteria in 
compliance with the law. This has been further enhanced 
with the introduction of SAP Ariba e-Sourcing Platform 
which has improved fairness and transparency in sourcing 
processes. While the e-sourcing platform has already 
become an integral part of its sourcing process, the Bank 
is continually looking to enhance the institutionalisation of 
the implemented system-based workflows. 
As part of the Bank’s stated objective and commitment 
to implementing best practices in corporate governance, 
the Bank has a Whistle-blower portal – the 'Corporate 
Whistle-blower Initiative' (CWI), which is an independent 
online reporting service aimed at facilitating secure 
and confidential communication of any concerns faced 
by its vendors to the designated and independent 
Whistle-blower Committee constituted by the Bank.
Skill development and continuous improvement
During the year, SPU continued to identify cost management 
initiatives based on spend analytics to optimise cost 
structures and collaborated with various operational/ 
functional units, to identify opportunities for value 
engineering and innovative solutions. Given the need for 
continual improvement and innovation, skill development 
has been a key focus area within the procurement team. 
In FY 2023-24, the team collectively clocked more than 
139 man-days of learning and development engagements 
on functional and cognitive skill development. This also 
includes participation in conferences and seminars for 
knowledge enhancement. 
YES BANK’s large and diverse supplier base of over 13,500+ large, medium, and small suppliers are integral to 
the vitality of its business and ecosystem. The Bank has set up a Strategic Procurement Unit (SPU) staffed with 
executives, skilled in responsible sourcing practices across categories, functions and domains. The Bank’s

Information Security - Governance
With the proliferation of digital banking services 
and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, 
the Bank’s preparedness to safeguard its data and 
information systems is a strategic area for review and 
monitoring. The Bank has instituted a well-defined 
governance structure for information security and data 
protection. It has constituted an Information Security 
Unit led by the Chief Information Security Officer and 
adopted a Board-approved Information Security Policy. 
A management level committee, Security Council, with 
cross-functional representation, meets on a quarterly 
basis to review security implementation across the 
Bank and provide guidance to the information security 
function. Information Security Risk is monitored and 
reviewed as a standalone risk by the Security Council 
on an overall basis, and which is also further reviewed 
by the Fraud & Suspicious Transaction Monitoring 
Committee. The Bank’s Internal Audit Department (IAD), 
which is ISO 9001:2015 certified (Quality Management 
System), 
provides 
an 
independent 
and 
objective 
assurance of the Bank’s Information Security system.

The Board-level Risk Management Committee monitors

the Bank’s overall risk profile and provides guidance and 
direction on information security. The Bank has also 
constituted a Board-level IT Strategy Committee, chaired 
by a Director with 30 years of specialised knowledge 
in information technology. The IT Strategy Committee 
approves and oversees the implementation of the 
Bank’s Cyber Security Policy and the Bank’s Cyber Crisis 
Management Plan. The Bank has also adopted a robust 
information security management system certified as 
per the requirements of the global information security 
standard ISO 27001:2013 and the Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). The implementation of 
the Bank’s Information Security Policies is independently 
audited by an external third-party auditor for its 
adherence to the ISO 27001:2013 Information Security 
Management System. 
Training and awareness building
Defending the Bank’s information systems is a responsibility 
of every YES BANKer and the Bank strategically invests in 
employee training and awareness programmes to enhance 
cybersecurity posture and ensure staff adherence to 
security protocols. The Bank also performs simulated 
phishing drills to check the awareness of its employees 
and contract staff with targeted trainings for staff who 
fall prey to such phishing simulations. Going beyond its 
employees, the Bank also rolls out regular awareness 
campaigns to build awareness about cyber security 
amongst its consultants, vendors, customers, and other 
stakeholders, educating them about emerging cyber 
security threats, and how to safely and securely use the

Robust information security management 
system
By 
prioritising 
data 
protection 
and 
information 
security, the Bank aims to foster customer confidence, 
maintain regulatory compliance, and mitigate financial 
and reputational risks associated with data breaches 
or cyberattacks.
The 
Bank’s 
ISO 
27001:2013 
information 
security 
management system is geared to safeguard its systems, 
networks, and applications from cyber threats, including 
malware, phishing attacks, and insider threats. To mitigate 
risks and protect the Bank’s IT assets against potential 
breaches, the Bank employs various security controls 
such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, multi-factor 
authentication, and regular security audits. The Bank also 
complies with all required regulations, including the RBI’s 
guidelines on cybersecurity and data protection, which 
mandate the implementation of robust data security 
frameworks and encryption standards. Committing to 
achieve the highest benchmarks of Information Security, 
the Bank also conducts third party vulnerability analysis 
of

complaints from regulatory bodies. All complaints except 2 
were resolved as at March 31, 2024 and the same will be 
resolved within stipulated timelines1. 
YES BANK has adopted a risk-based approach and follows 
a “defence-in-depth” security architecture to protect its 
information systems against cyber-attacks. To manage 
cyber security risk, the Bank has adopted a Cyber Security 
Resilient framework based on four key pillars – Protect, 
Detect, Respond and Recover. The Bank has established 
a 24x7 security operations center (SOC) to monitor 
cyber risks, which keeps vigil on suspicious network 
traffic and events to detect any anomalies, and helps 
respond to potential incidents, in a timely manner. The Bank 
also subscribes to various threat intelligence services that 
help identify malicious indicator of compromise (IOCs) 
and block them as a proactive approach to prevent 
potential attacks.
Continuous monitoring, incident response plans, and 
collaboration with industry stakeholders further bolsters 
the Bank’s resilience against evolving threats. The Bank 
has completed Digital Forensics Readiness Assessment 
to ensure that all relevant logs are captured, in case of 
any forensics investigation, and has also completed Cloud 
Security Assessment which would assist in building a 
framework for Cloud security. 
Privacy
YES BANK recognises the importance of safeguarding 
its customers' personal and financial information. 
In today's digital age, data privacy is not just a regulatory 
requirement but a cornerstone of the Bank’s commitment 
to trust and security. The Bank’s policies related to data 
security & privacy are based principles of transparency, 
security, 
control, 
and 
compliance. 
To 
adhere 
to 
these principles, the Bank follows practices like data 
encryption, regular audits, employee training, third-party 
management, amongst others. The Bank is committed to 
maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of its

Customer experience measurement 
Customers are not just a key stakeholder group, but a 
valuable source of insight and feedback for the Bank’s 
overall business strategy. The Bank strongly believes 
in listening to its customers and incorporating their 
suggestions into its products, operations and approach. 
Towards this, the Bank has put in place, a holistic 
methodology for measuring customer experience across 
touch points. The Bank’s Service Excellence unit captures 
the Voice of the Customer (VOC) and Customer Scoring 
through transaction and engagement feedback, and by 
assessing performance across key service drivers. Over the 
years, the Bank has strengthened its customer experience 
measurement process by investing in digital platforms, 
making it real time and based on contextual conversations 
with customers.
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
The Bank has also institutionalised Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) as a key metric to drive superior service experience, 
customer loyalty and advocacy, across its various channels. 
NPS is a metric for measuring customer experience and 
is a predictor of customer loyalty. It has been adopted 
by several global organisations to improve customer 
experience across products and services. NPS is calculated 
by subtracting the percentage of customers who are 
Detractors (i.e. customer rating between 0 and 6) from 
the percentage who are Promoters (i.e. customer rating 
9 or 10). Continuous focus and commitment to customer 
experience has resulted in reduction in Detractors and an 
increase in Promoters resulting in improved Net Promoter 
Scores across channels. The Bank’s Net Promoter Score 
for FY 2023-24 stood at 70 (an improvement over 
last year’s NPS of 68). The overall Retail Banking NPS 
journey is on an increasing trend and scores for 
FY 2023-24 have seen significant improvement of 
18 points over the last 3 years. Along with measuring 
NPS, the Bank has established a robust Detractor 
Management process which includes service recovery of 
Detractors, close looping customer feedback, winback 
initiatives to retain Customers, and further collaboration 
with the Promoters. NPS trends, Consumer insights 
(VOC), Detractor Analysis are reviewed periodically with 
respective stakeholders across channels and various 
improvement initiatives across People, Process and 
Technology are taken to provide superior banking 
experience to customers.

assessment of executives is based on performance 
descriptors and their definitions, employing a two-pronged 
approach which includes weightages to both business/

the need to uphold core values of the Bank and consistently 
adhere to regulatory compliance and governance norms.

Employee Volunteering
YES BANK firmly believes that employee volunteering opportunities offers two-fold benefits – it fosters 
positive workplace culture and enhances skills of employees by involving them in tasks that differ from 
their regular responsibilities. Backed by employee volunteering policy, YES BANKers are encouraged 
to participate in skills-based volunteering. So far, the Bank employees have volunteered to conduct 
sessions on financial literacy, build capacity of NGOs through consultative approach, plant trees, identify 
potential scholars for a scholarship programme, strengthen prototype idea in a social hackathon and 
deliver work-readiness module to trainees. Over 4,000 volunteering hours were contributed in FY 2023-24. 
Additionally, YES BANK employees have been contributing towards Payroll Giving Programme for 
YES Foundation and have generously participated in crowdfunding campaigns to address emergency 
medical needs of people within our sphere of influence.

Progress on Profitability
During the fiscal year FY 2023-24, the Bank has significantly progressed along the 
path of improving its profitability. The Return on Assets (RoA) for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2024 was at 0.5% vis-à-vis 0.2% in quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Bank’s 
management has clearly identified financial imperatives which are likely to uplift the 
trajectory of its Return on Assets (RoA) profile, which include: resolution of Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) shortfall related drag, improving the Advances Yield through 
product mix optimisation, reducing cost of deposits by increasing proportion of CASA 
deposits, further enhancing the fee income intensity and improving cost efficiency to 
align with the best-in-class in the industry. 
Towards this end, the Bank has identified several business levers as enlisted below, which will aid in achieving 
these financial imperatives. To further ensure the rigor of execution, the Bank has set up a dedicated Strategy and 
Transformation vertical to drive these initiatives in a focussed manner.  
Description and Impacts
Progress on profitability refers to the Bank’s commitment towards building a long-term sustainable 
franchise which delivers profitable growth on a consistent and predictable basis. This includes building 
a robust income engine with sustainably superior Net Interest Margins (NIM) and best-in-class fee 
generation, coupled with an optimum cost structure, which aids in generating superlative operating 
profits. At the same time, ensuring a strong credit and risk management culture to minimise credit 
costs, leading to maximisation of RoA profile.

Business Lever 1: Resolution of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) shortfall related drag
On account of the accumulated PSL shortfalls over the last 
few years, as the Bank was dealing with the aftermath of 
reconstruction and did not have adequate affordability to 
buy PSL certificates, the mandated deposits in lieu of the 
PSL shortfalls have steadily risen to approximately 11% of 
total Assets (as at March 31, 2024). Given the considerably 
lower yield (average realised yield of 2.97% in FY 2023-24) 
generated on these deposits, the consequent drag on Net 
Interest Margins (NIM), Operating Profits, Cost to Income 
and Return on Assets (RoA) is significant.
In order to address this, the Bank had formulated a 
comprehensive strategy to address the PSL shortfalls and 
has significantly progressed along the path of execution. 
The intervention areas include focussed Acceleration on 
Organic Sourcing in PSL sub-categories of: SMF (Small & 
Marginal Farmers), NCF (Non-Corporate Farmers) and

Business Lever 2: Retail Assets: Product and Sourcing Mix Calibration
While the Retail Assets portfolio has significantly scaled 
up over the last few years (CAGR of 26.7% between 
FY 2019-20 and FY2023-2024), there is significant focus 
now on improving the profitability profile through 
optimisation of the product mix and the sourcing mix. 
From the bouquet of over 20 retail products that the Bank 
currently offers, certain set of products have been identified 
which are RoA accretive and there has been a concerted 
effort towards increasing the mix of these products in 
the Bank’s disbursements. As a result, the proportion of 
RoA accretive products in the Bank’s disbursements has 
improved from 35% in FY 2022-23 to 44% in FY 2023-24. 
Moreover, the Bank has ensured that the product risk 
profile is broadly retained through mix optimisation within 
existing product categories.
On the same lines, the Bank has made significant 
strategic interventions to improve the internal sourcing 
of Assets through Branches and internal channels, owing 
to the significantly lower cost of acquisition of these 
channels in comparison to DSA (Direct Sales Agents). 
On account of these efforts, the internal sourcing mix of 
Retail Assets has improved from 35% in FY 2021-22 to 
41% in FY 2023-24.
*ROA Accretive products include Personal Loans, Used Vehicles (including CV/CE). Affordable home 
Loans, Unsecured Business Loans, Micro LAP and Education Loans.

Business Lever 4: Maximising Branch Distribution as Fulcrum of Business
YES BANK, is leveraging its existing and growing network 
of branches and BCBOs (Business Correspondent Banking 
Outlets) to offer full spectrum of products, including 
Deposits, Assets and fee products (third party products 
such Insurance, Mutual Funds etc). The Bank’s Branch 
Banking vertical has significantly outperformed the 
Banking Industry in terms of generation of deposits, and 
low-cost CASA deposits in particular. This has aided the 
Bank in delivering strong liability growth over the last few 
years, despite industry-wide challenges. In addition, with 
rising penetration of the Retail Asset offerings across the 
Branch network and the addition in front-line sales staff in 
branches, the Retail Assets sourcing as well as distribution 
of fee-generating products through branch channels has 
improved over the years, thereby reducing the overall cost 
of acquisition for the Bank and improving the profitability 
profile of the Branches.

Climate Action
The increasing frequency of extreme weather-related events and the socio-economic 
impact of unchecked global warming continue to pose significant risk to economies, 
businesses, and societies globally. With India being one of the most climate-vulnerable 
countries, YES BANK treats climate risk and climate action as key strategic priorities. 
The Bank has set up a robust governance structure to oversee its climate strategy, and 
has built internal capacities to identify, assess and mitigate climate-related risks.
YES BANK was one of the first Banks in India to support and enhance its sustainability disclosures in line with the Taskforce 
on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), recommendations. In FY 2023-24, the Bank continued to be recognised 
for its climate transparency and was rated ‘A-’ Leadership Band by CDP for its 2023 Climate Change disclosures, retaining 
its position as the highest rated Indian Bank for climate disclosures. 
Description and Impacts1
Climate action refers to the steps the Bank takes towards strategically integrating climate considerations 
into its business, including addressing climate risks, setting and disclosing emission reduction targets 
and decarbonisation its portfolio in line with global decarbonisation scenarios.

Climate-related Risks Identification1
YES BANK recognises climate risk as a critical risk and 
since FY 2018-19, the Bank’s management committees 
have been considering climate risk in their briefing. 
The Bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process details its importance within the framework, 
alongside other Pillar II risks. In line with the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB)’s Taskforce on Climate-related 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, the Bank has 
classified these climate-related risks as Transition Risks 
and Physical Risks. Through desk research, the Bank 
enlisted material climate-related risks faced by the 
financial sector, including Current Regulation, Emerging 
regulation, Technological Risk, Legal Risk, Market Risk, 
Reputational Risk, Acute Physical Risk and Chronic 
Physical Risk. The climate-related risks were ranked 
by the senior management, in the order of relevance 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
the 
foreseeable 
medium-term. 
Based on this survey, top ranking climate-related 
risks, with maximum potential to generate significant 
change in the Bank’s business operations, revenue 
or expenditure, were identified to establish a climate 
risk profile.
Enhanced Disclosure 
Policies
Stringent Environmental 
Regulation
Increased Severity of 
Extreme Weather Events
With growing awareness on 
Environmental & Social (E&S) 
issues globally, countries have 
established robust E&S regulations 
that specify requirements for 
operating licenses, occupational 
health and safety standards, 
and emission/discharge limits. 
Stricter environmental regulations 
may affect repayment capability 
of clients who fail to meet the 
enhanced regulations. 
In recent years, severe climatic 
events such as droughts, cyclones, 
high temperatures and floods, 
have impacted India’s economy, 
especially in sectors such as 
agriculture and allied industries. 
Climate change may increase 
the frequency and severity 
of climatic events, which can 
adversely affect employee & client 
performance, and therefore the 
Bank’s revenues.
Introduction of enhanced 
disclosure policies by the 
government and/or regulatory 
bodies may result in legal 
proceedings or penalties 
for organisations failing to 
comply with the enhanced 
disclosure requirements.

Climate-related Risk Management1
YES BANK recognises climate risk as a significant risk and 
refers to the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Taskforce on 
Climate related Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for 
adoption of best practices around managing and disclosing 
climate risk. YES BANK broadly categorises climate risks 
into physical and transitional risks. Physical risks are a 
consequence of direct physical impacts of climate change 
and range from acute risks (such as extreme weather 
events) to chronic risks (like gradual rise in sea level and 
temperature). Transition Risks arise from external efforts 
to address climate change including, but not limited to, 
regulatory and policy changes, technological advancement 
or shifts in investor sentiment and consumer behaviour. 
The Bank considers climate risk as a material Pillar II risk in 
its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) 
document and in it details its overall governance and 
control framework. 
In line with its sustainability-focussed vision and 
commitments, YES BANK has put in place systems for 
managing climate-related risks at the organisational, 
project and portfolio levels.
Organisational level
1.	 The Bank has a formal process in place for the 
identification of climate risks and opportunities. 
ESG and climate change related risks and opportunities 
are evaluated by Risk Management, Infrastructure 
and Facilities Management (IFM) and Strategic 
Procurement Units, for the projects and initiatives 
under respective domains.
2.	 In FY 2018-19, ‘Climate risks’ were added to the Bank’s 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), 
which is an integral part of the management and 
decision-making process in the Bank. Climate-related 
risks are reviewed annually to establish adequacy of 
measures taken by the Bank, along with the ongoing 
annual review of the ICAAP.
3.	 The Bank has also constituted an Executive level 
Sustainability Council to ensure deeper integration 
of sustainability into all aspects of business and 
banking. The Council helps develop formal structures 
and actionable frameworks to include risks and 
opportunities arising out of climate change and 
sustainable development. 
1GRI 201-2
166
YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
4.	 To manage any potential service disruptions due 
to climate change, YES BANK has a robust Business 
Continuity Plan which is ISO 22301 certified, 
an 
International 
Business 
Continuity 
Standard. 
In FY 2022-23, YES BANK continues to have the 
highest number of locations certified under ISO 
14001:2015 Environment Management System (EMS) 
standard, globally. The recertification is based on the 
Bank’s Environmental Management Policy released in 
2016, which commits to reducing the Bank’s carbon 
emissions through broad-level actions.
5.	 Recognising the importance of enhanced transparency 
and disclosures, the Bank has been proactively 
reporting on its triple bottom line performance 
through 
its 
annual 
and 
sustainability 
reports. 
These sustainability disclosures are aligned with 
benchmark reporting frameworks, including Integrated 
Reporting, GRI Standards, TCFD recommendations and 
Principles for Responsible Banking.
Project level 
1.	 At a project level, E&S risk assessment is integrated 
into its overall credit approval framework. As part of 
the Bank’s Environment & Social Management System 
(ESMS), a Board-approved Environment & Social 
Policy (ESP) mandates appropriate assessment of 
E&S risks for project finance. The Bank has dedicated 
E&S experts housed within the Credit Risk Unit who 
are responsible for implementing the provisions of 
the ESP. These experts undertake preliminary E&S 
assessment of projects basis the severity of risk. 
Further detailed Environment and Social Impact 
Assessment is conducted against IFC Performance 
Standards (A number of cross cutting topics such as 
climate change, gender, human rights, and water are 
addressed across multiple Performance Standards) 
by internal/external E&S Risk experts and appropriate 
covenants are included in the credit documents which 
are monitored throughout the credit cycle.
2. Further, for identified high risk projects, the Bank 
includes climate risk screening as a part of the 
Environment and Social Due Diligence. Bank has also 
put in framework for readily capturing information 
on key physical and transition risk related indicators 
from clients in preliminary assessment checklist for 
all projects/project related loan (sanctioned amount 
above a threshold)
Portfolio level
1. 
At a portfolio level, the Bank has identified climate 
sensitive sectors and is taking a sectoral approach 
to measure and mitigate climate risk. It has initiated 
measurement of financed emission of its carbon 
intensive portfolio. 
2.	
Further, the Bank is leveraging scenario-based 
assessment to develop roadmaps for building climate 
resilience of portfolio. As a starting point, the Bank 
has specifically focussed on its energy exposure, as 
the sector is at the centre stage for climate action 
globally. The Bank has analysed the financed emission 
intensity in the energy sector and developed internal 
targets to reduce the sectoral emission intensity, in 
line with global de-carbonisation pathways.
3. 
The Bank is in the process of quantifying financed 
emission of rest of its portfolio, to identify carbon 
intensive holding and develop emission reduction 
targets 
(intensity/absolute) 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Paris Agreement, as per availability of data and 
methodologies.

Bank has developed interim target of reducing financed 
emission intensity of its electricity generation portfolio, at 
least by 50%, while striving for achieving 75% reduction by 
FY 2031-32. The Bank has developed an internal roadmap 
of mix of non-renewable energy and renewable energy, 
that has been incorporated in risk appetite. Further, Bank 
has developed internal additional criteria for financing 
towards non-renewable energy sector.
In FY 2022-23, the emission intensity of electricity 
generation fund-based portfolio (corporate loans, project 
finance, investments) declined significantly from 0.628 
tCO2e/MWh in FY 2021-22 to 0.404 tCO2e/MWh due to 
decline in fossil fuel-based energy generation portfolio 
from a mix perspective, on account of stringent internal 
lending criteria as well as sale of stressed non-renewable 
energy portfolio to the ARC.
In FY 2023-24, there was a slight increase in emission 
intensity of electricity generation fund-based portfolio 
(corporate loans, project finance, investments) from 
0.404  tCO2e/MWh to 0.479 tCO2e/MWh. The increase 
in emission intensity is primarily due to the increase in 
output of clients in terms of electricity generation and 
thus, associated emissions per unit of ` crore exposure 
and slight increase in exposure towards non-renewable 
energy generation. Emission intensity of FY 2023-24 
remains within the trajectory of SBTi well below 2 degrees 
as well as SBTi 1.5-degree pathway and meeting the 
bank’s interim intensity target for the electricity generation 
sector for the year. 
In the Indian context, there are challenges regarding 
availability and reliability of emission data. Further, there 
remains challenges in availability of generic sector specific 
financed emission intensity (such as financed emission per 
revenue or finance emission per unit of production). As the 
ESG reporting ecosystem in India evolves, disclosure on 
these aspects would further help the Bank to improve 
data quality of its financed emissions. The Bank would also 
be exploring other approaches for some of the sectors/
asset classes to measure degree of alignment with the 
Paris Agreement.

CLIMATE ACTION
Climate-related scenario analysis
Methodologies and tools to link climate risk to traditional 
financial risk parameters, economic impact modelling, 
scenario analysis and stress testing are in early stages 
and are being progressively explored through global 
collaborations. There are challenges that need to be 
addressed in terms of climate related data availabilities 
(such as frequency of climate events at good spatial 
resolution, regional and global impact on sector), 
availability of regional climate impact scenarios and 
holistic climate risk assessment tools and methodologies. 
To that extent, the Bank strives to be ahead of the curve 
through striving to build its capacity and understanding 
of financial impact of climate change and methodologies 
for scenario analysis, working in collaborations with peer 
banks, regulators, data providers etc.1
In line with its climate commitments, the Bank has 
initiated developing its capacity for scenario analysis and 
is leveraging scenario-based target setting approach 
to develop long-term climate resilient strategies and 
roadmaps on a best effort basis. The Bank has analysed 
its emission from its own operation in various scenarios, 
such as Business as usual, 1.5 degree scenario, well below 
2 degree scenario, 2 degree scenarios, and has drawn 
insights to develop an ambitious target of becoming net 
zero by 2030. Further, the Bank is striving to leverage 
methodologies and scenarios provided by the Science 
Based Targets Initiative for initiating assessment and 
taking concrete actions to develop roadmaps for climate 
intensive/vulnerable sectors for alignment scenarios 
limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees/
striving for 1.5°C. 
To start with, the Bank has developed a roadmap to 
reduce financed emissions of its lending sub-portfolio 
(electricity generation) emissions aligning with ambitions 
outlined in Paris Agreement. The Bank would continue to 
build its capacity on this front, through piloting emerging 
methodologies and collaborating with regulators, peer 
banks, think tanks and data providers to accelerate 
developments at this front, both in regional and 
global context.

Transition to low-carbon 
The banking sector is a pivotal player in steering 
economies towards a low-carbon future. In the context of 
India, recent projections underscore a need for over USD 
10 trillion in financing to meet its net-zero target, of which 
more than 80% is required for the transition of the Indian 
power sector alone. Recognising that the majority of this 
financing will need to be mobilised by domestic financial 
institutions, YES BANK is committed to offer innovative 
and responsible solutions to the industry and support 
the country’s transition to a low carbon future through 
its business activities. The Bank, through its financing to 
renewable energy, contributes to avoidance of emission 
in electricity generation, and assists in decarbonising 
India’s electricity generation. The Bank continues to 
support climate-aligned sectors like renewable energy, 
electric vehicles and to develop targeted products 
for green financing such as YES Kiran (rooftop solar 
loans for SMEs).

debt burden. Enhancing access to finance continues to be a strategic priority at 
YES BANK. 
The Bank has implemented a comprehensive Financial Inclusion Plan which is reviewed by its Board of Directors on an 
annual basis. Taking a multi-pronged approach, the Bank’s initiatives aim to improve access to basic financial services in 
rural, hard to reach areas, widen the reach and uptake of government schemes such as Kisan Credit Card (KCC), promote 
financial literacy, and enhance employability and entrepreneurship opportunities amongst vulnerable communities, 
through skill-building and livelihood programmes.

Catalysing employment and entrepreneurship 
opportunities for over 100,000 youth by 2026
YES BANK, through its social development arm, YES 
Foundation, actively engages with communities to 
understand their unique needs and collaborates on 
projects that create positive impact. This community-centric 
approach ensures the Bank’s CSR initiatives are relevant 
and sustainable. 
The Bank’s CSR initiatives have had a positive impact on 
the livelihoods of rural as well as urban communities, 
while also contributing to environmental sustainability. 
With farmers, the initiatives focus on enhancing their 
income 
through 
sustainable 
agricultural 
practices 
and access to water. The work with rural women and 
artisans around nano enterprise development has 
not only led to income enhancement but also brought

intangible benefits, like empowerment and breaking 
gender role stereotypes.
Recognising the demographic dividend of India, the 
Bank, through YES Foundation, has undertaken skilling 
programmes, 
providing 
market-oriented 
job 
skills 
to underprivileged youth and ensuring at least 70% 
placement of the trained youth. Enabling livelihood and 
skill development has fostered systemic change in the 
society, inspiring the youth to participate in social and 
economic transformation of the country. 
YES BANK has made steady headway towards realising 
its CSR commitment to catalyse employment and 
entrepreneurship opportunities for over 100,000 youth by 
2026, and has reached over 40,000 youth, till date. 
Employability
In order to harness the demographic dividend of 
the country, YES BANK, through YES Foundation, 
has 
undertaken 
skilling 
programmes 
to 
provide 
market-oriented job skills across various sectors to 
underprivileged youth and ensure that at least 70% of 
the trained youth are placed. In FY 2023-24, 2,200 youth 
received skills training across 6 different states. In addition 
to this, soft skills like communicative English, basic 
computers, mock interviews, resume writing, personality 
development and confidence building were also provided 
to the trainees. Learning Management Systems and 
supplementing classroom learning with self-paced online 
learning was also encouraged. Sessions from industry 
experts played an important role in providing realistic 
insights and practical tips to benefit the trainees.

Entrepreneurship
Agricultural development in India is uneven, with several 
states facing pronounced disparities. Rising cultivation 
costs, inadequate price support, and limited market access 
have compounded farmers' challenges. Besides overuse 
of chemicals, environmental threats, and neglect of soil 
health have further exacerbated food insecurity and 
livelihood concerns. Limited knowledge of innovative 
agricultural practices and challenges in accessing water for 
irrigation throughout the year has prompted a significant 
portion of the population to engage in seasonal migration. 
Women and artisans are also susceptible to cycle of 
economic vulnerability and need specific interventions 
encompassing skill enhancement and market linkages. 
Rural entrepreneurship is a key growth driver for any 
economy. YES BANK, through YES Foundation, works with 
small and marginalised farmers in Rajasthan and Gujarat 
to promote sustainable livelihood by combining traditional 
and scientific methods. The Bank strives to strengthen rural 
economies by enhancing income generation opportunities 
through farming extensions, agricultural inputs and 
promotion of handicrafts and handlooms. 6,000 farmers 
in FY 2023-24 received training on various climate resilient 
farming techniques and gained access to enhanced 
irrigation support facilities. The work in watershed 
development has ushered a newfound hope for a lot of 
farmers and reversed migration of youth in the region.
“In my 2-acre plot, I used to cultivate grains  
and vegetables. This farming, however, only 
fetched me an annual income of around 
` 40,000, posing a challenge to make ends 
meet. Thanks to interventions like mulching, 
drip irrigation, and training in scientific tomato 
cultivation, I saw a significant increase in our 
agricultural yields. My annual income has now 
risen to over ` 1.3 lakh, and my elder son has 
also returned to the village from the city to help 
us with cultivating our land”
- Lilaben Arvindbhai, project beneficiary and farmer from 
Vangara village of Panchmahal district, Gujarat.
The Bank is yet to undertake any social impact assessments 
of its financial inclusion and community development 
initiatives. 100% of Bank’s operations are covered through 
its implemented local* community engagement and 
development programmes. The Bank’s employability 
and entrepreneurship programmes include processes 
for stakeholder engagement with the community, 
consultations with local authorities, small and marginal 
farmer groups, local panchayat, village development 
committees as well as community volunteers, as part of 
the programme’s implementation design1.

Promoting financial literacy:
The Bank undertakes various interventions to engage with 
customers and incubate financial discipline among its 
members. Women members are imparted financial literacy 
training through a process called Compulsory Group 
Training (CGT), by BC Agents and the Bank’s staff, and 
training efficacy is assessed through a verbal interactive 
test called Group Recognition Test (GRT). The Bank in 
collaboration with Accion International has also designed 
customised training modules to promote financial literacy 
amongst its customers. In FY 2023-24, over 1,460 Financial 
Literacy Camps were conducted across 134 rural Branches.
Responsible lending and grievance redressal 
processes
The Bank undertakes several measures to protect its 
microfinance customers from over indebtedness and to 
ensure that they are able to repay the loan without any 
harassment and duress.
Steps to mitigate over indebtedness of borrowers:
	y
Household Assessment: Prior to loan sanctioning, 
the Bank undertakes a detailed household assessment 
capturing the amenities and assets available in the 
household, income, expense and loan obligations of all 
household members. Through this process, the Bank 
arrives at the net disposable income for the household 
which is one of the key determinants for deciding loan 
eligibility and sanction amount 
	y
Limit of total indebtedness: To avoid over 
indebtedness of the customer, a loan is only sanctioned 
for cases where total indebtedness is less than ` 2 lakh 
(basis the MFI Credit Bureau report) 
	y
Loan applications are screened basis combined 
credit report (CCR) of the household: In addition 
to the total indebtedness limits, screening is also 
done basis delinquency in microfinance, agri as well 
as retail loans
	y
Loan 
eligibility 
based 
on 
customer 
categorisation: Loan eligibility limits are also set 
based on categorisation of New to Credit (NTC), New 
to Bank (NTB) and Existing to Bank customers. The 
limit for NTC and NTB is deliberately set lower taking a 
conservative approach towards their credit exposure
	y
Promoting responsible usage of loan: At the 
time of Compulsory Group Training (CGT) and Group 
Recognition Training (GRT), customers are advised to 
utilise the loan that will be sanctioned for productive 
purposes. The purpose of the loan is also captured in 
the Loan Application Form and Sanction Letter

	y
Group Credit Product Plus and Hospicash: The 
Bank provides customers an opportunity to opt for 
insurance products such as Group Credit Product Plus 
(GCPP) and Hospicash. GCPP relieves the customer 
and household of the debt burden in the eventuality 
of the death of the customer or co-insured. In most 
instances this is a critical support as the loss of a 
key earning member leads to economic hardship for 
the family and delinquency could affect access to 
future credit. Hospicash on the other hand ensures 
that the customer/household doesn’t have to dip 
into their savings/monthly income in case of medical 
emergencies, thus minimising any adverse impact on 
the customer’s repayment capacity
Responsible customer handling and staff training:
	y
YES BANK has a Board-approved Fair Practices Code 
specific to Microfinance customers, which outlines its 
commitment to not resort to undue harassment or use 
of force against customers and that the Bank would 
be accountable for any inappropriate behaviour by its 
employees or employees of its outsourced agency 
	y
All ISB employees undergo the mandatory ‘Code 
of Conduct’ training module of the Bank. All BCAs 
(employees of YBL’s BC partners who are involved 
in sourcing and collection on behalf of YBL) are 
required to get a certification from the Indian Institute 
of Banking & Finance (IIBF) within 9 months of their 
association with YES BANK. In addition to general 
banking and technical aspects, this IIBF module also 
includes a section on behavioural aspects
Responsible repayment and collection practices:
	y
Customers are provided with a detailed repayment 
schedule at the time of loan disbursement, along with 
a loan card which is updated at the time of collection 
	y
Collection is undertaken only at a designated place 
(centre) for the ease of customers 
	y
Any deviation from the collection date, non updation 
of loan card, behavioural issues and other service 
issues can be reported by the customer on the toll free 
grievance redressal number (which is shared at the 
time of CGT, GRT, is also mentioned on the repayment 
schedule and displayed in the BC branch)
Grievance Redressal:
	y
In order to provide timely redressal of customer 
grievances at no extra cost and given that most of the 
Bank’s microfinance customers are located in rural, 
hard to reach areas, the Bank has introduced a “Missed 
Call Facility” for customers to register their grievances 
	y
Missed calls made by customers are responded 
to through a callback in the customer’s vernacular 
language, wherein the customer may comfortably 
explain his/her complaints or grievances. The Missed 
Call number is prominently displayed at BC banking 
outlets, BC branches and on the Loan Card given 
to the borrowers 
	y
Additionally, BCBO being a fixed point outlet, 
additional options of Grievance Redressal are also 
provided to the customers. Customers may register 
their complaints through the existing YES TOUCH 
grievance channels (for example: calling up the contact 
centre at 1800 1200). The Grievance Redressal posters 
in local languages are prominently displayed at the 
BCBO outlets to guide the customers in this regard. 
For customers who wish to submit any complaint 
in written form at the outlet, can do so through the 
complaint registers maintained at the BC banking 
outlets. All BCBOs are also equipped with a separate 
Complaint/Suggestion Box

totalling 956 in tonnage with energy-efficient, inverter 
units, resulting in energy savings of approximately 
29,48,711 MJ*. The Bank’s focussed energy conservation 
initiatives helped reduce the Bank’s energy intensity 
per rupee of turnover by approximately 18% from the 
previous year, even as its overall energy consumption 
for FY 2023-24 increased by a marginal 1.57% over the 
previous year, due to the addition of new facilities.
Reducing emissions1
The carbon emissions from its use of energy, represent 
one of the Bank’s most significant environmental impacts. 
YES BANK is cognizant of its climate-related impacts and 
strives to align its business to the Paris Agreement’s goal 
of limiting global temperature rise. Towards this, the Bank 
aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions with 
a target of reaching net zero by 2030. To achieve its net 
zero target, the Bank has begun migrating most of its 
facilities to renewable energy. In FY 2023-24, the share of 
renewable energy in the Bank’s electricity mix increased to 
12.31% resulting in approximately 5,254 tCO2e in avoided 
emissions. Currently, three of the Bank’s offices, YES BANK 
House, YES Fintech Centre, Airoli and Vaman Centre, 
Andheri), along with 43 of the Bank’s 92 Branches in

Internal Carbon Pricing
In order to drive low carbon transition of its operations, 
the Bank undertook an exercise to determine its 
internal carbon price. At an organisation level, the Bank 
has estimated an implicit price of ` 1,026 per tCO2e 
emissions, i.e. to avoid one unit tCO2e emissions, annual 
cost or required expenditure is of around ` 1,026. 
The estimation is based on the internal roadmap to 
achieve its ambition of net zero target covering Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions, and annual expenditures required 
to achieve the reduction. The implicit carbon price varies 
for different facilities in different geographical locations. 
Facility level estimates range from implicit price of 
` 422 per tCO2e emission to ` 2004 per tCO2e emission, 
with the overall carbon price at an organisational level 
estimated at ` 1,026 per tCO2e emissions emitted. The Bank 
will relook and re-calibrate its carbon price on a periodic 
basis to consider emerging alternatives and evolving 
ecosystem. The implicit price enables the Bank to drive low 
carbon investment, energy efficiency and change internal 
behaviour and in turn meet stakeholder expectation of 
doing business in an environmentally sustainable way. 
The implicit carbon price enables the Bank for a faster 
transition to energy-efficient equipment and renewable 
energy sourcing, through inclusion of the cost of carbon 
abatement in its investments and expenditures, reflecting 
the holistic cost-benefit analysis.

fixtures to light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, across India. 
The Bank is also eliminating the use of printed flexes for 
its promotional activities and switching to digital screens 
at many of its facilities. Over the years, YES BANK has 
eliminated the use and procurement of single-use plastics 
and also switched to procuring 100% recycled paper (A4) 
for internal operational use, across all its facilities.

Climate change induced erratic rainfall and extreme 
weather events like cyclones, floods, drought and pest 
attacks are leading to declining agricultural yields. 
Agrarian and tribal communities, already struggling 
land degradation and uncertain prices are expected 
to be the worst impacted by climate change, with their 
incomes estimated to decline by up to 25%. Some of the 
areas grapple with a spectrum of socio-economic and 
environmental adversities, from erratic rainfall patterns 
and water scarcity to land degradation and diminishing 
agricultural productivity. 
YES FOUNDATION’s Agroforestry Project:
Fighting climate change while Improving farmer income 
YES BANK, through YES Foundation, undertook the 
implementation of an agroforestry project across 11 states 
in India. This initiative will play a critical role in enhancing 
green cover, addressing climate change, while also 
supporting sustainable livelihoods of farmers. The project 
is designed to respond strategically to the challenges 
induced by climate change by introducing sustainable 
solutions and offering comprehensive support to farming 
communities. By incorporating native tree plantation and 
adopting innovative agricultural practices, the project 
aims to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change 
and bolster the resilience of farming communities. In 
FY 2023-24, 2 lakh trees were planted on farmer land and 
were geotagged to monitor growth and survival.
Indal Singh, a farmer from Amas village of Gaya district in 
Bihar, along with his brothers, had to take on additional 
labour work to meet the monetary needs of their large 
extended family. Currently, his family’s yearly income is 
only around ` 1-2 lakh from sale of produce from his 7 
acres of land. Indal Singh actively sought his enrolment 
when he heard of the Bank’s plantation project and was 
allocated 1,700 Mango, Lemon and Amla saplings. He is 
confident that he will take good care of the trees and 
that the fruits that will be harvested will enhance his 
family income by ` 3-4 lakh.

Sustainable Finance
Addressing challenges such as climate change and achieving critical Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) requires the mobilisation of large quantum of finances. 
According to a report by the World Economic Forum*, an estimated USD 50 trillion 
in incremental investments is required by 2050 to transition the global economy to 
net-zero emissions and avert a climate catastrophe. India itself requires an estimated 
investment of USD 10.1 trillion to reach its net zero by 2070 target#. Developing 
countries like India also face a growing annual investment gap of about USD 2 trillion, 
required to achieve SDGs. 
Being cognizant of the environmental and social impacts of its business, YES BANK has taken proactive and decisive steps 
towards integrating ESG and climate considerations into its business. The Bank has instituted an Environment and Social 
Risk Management System (ESMS) as part of its responsible lending practices and has been at the forefront in developing 
and bringing to market innovative green financial mechanisms to support climate-aligned and sustainability-linked sectors. 
Description and Impacts
Sustainable finance refers to the process of integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
considerations in investment decisions, leading to increased longer-term investments in sustainable 
economic activities and projects. This includes the mobilisation of finance needed for private 
investments towards achievement of the Paris Agreement and SDGs.

Integrating E&S Considerations into lending
YES BANK has adopted a proactive approach to address 
environmental and social impacts that could result from its 
lending activities. Towards this, the Bank has instituted an 
Environment and Social Risk Management System (ESMS) 
to assess and mitigate Environment and Social (E&S) risks 
of its financing activities, centred around its Environment 
and Social Policy. The Bank’s Environment and Social 
Policy (ESP), implemented in 2006, serves as a structured 
approach towards responsible lending.
The ESP, as an integral part of the Bank’s Environment 
& Social Management System sets out the overarching 
framework for identification and management of potential 
and/or existing E&S risks commensurate with the nature 
and scale of transactions and their potential impacts. 
Through this policy, the Bank integrates environmental 
and social risks into its overall credit risk assessment 
framework, which goes beyond financial risk mitigation. 
It has voluntarily adopted the policy, based on international 
frameworks 
such 
as 
IFC 
Performance 
Standards. 
The ESP is a crucial part of the Bank’s credit risk appraisal 
process and the Bank further continues to mainstream 
environment and social considerations across its lending 
by strengthening ESP integration with the overall credit 
risk assessment framework. The policy encompasses 
all the lending transactions of the Bank integrating E&S 
considerations in its financing activities and establishes a 
risk-based approach where high value transactions that 
carry high ESG risks are subject to enhanced evaluation 
and approval through a specialised team of internal/
external E&S risk assessment experts.
The policy provides for a ‘list of prohibited activities’ that 
the Bank does not finance. The list is derived from the IFC‘s 
exclusion list and includes sectors or activities that have 
a highly negative impact from Environment and Social 
lens. The policy identifies and classifies the Bank’s lending 
activity into various segments, and accordingly advises 
the applicable procedures for E&S risk assessment. 
Typically, for project finance/project related corporate 
loan transactions as defined in the policy, the E&S risk 
team undertakes an initial assessment to determine the 
degree of adverse environmental or social impact arising 
from business activities of the borrower and accordingly 
categorises transactions based on the level of E&S risks 
involved. For projects with significant E&S risks, the Bank 
conducts enhanced due diligence/assessment in line 
with IFC PS and national regulations through internal/ 
independent E&S risk analysts and develops corrective 
action plans with the borrower, performance on which is 
monitored throughout the credit cycle. The Bank strives 
to positively influence borrowers by engaging them in 
adopting appropriate sustainable practices to meet higher 
ESG industry expectations.

Solar Energy Project
The Borrower approached the Bank to seek term 
loan facilities for setting up a 100 MW solar energy 
project. As per the provisions of the E&S Policy, the 
Bank conducted a preliminary desk-based assessment 
to determine potential adverse environmental and/
or social impacts arising from business activities of 
the Project. The preliminary assessment highlighted 
need of a detailed E&S due-diligence (E&S DD) in line 
with IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) requirements 
and verifying compliance with applicable Indian E&S 
regulatory framework. Accordingly, a detailed E&S 
DD assessment was commissioned by the Bank to 
identify and mitigate potential E&S risks associated 
with the Project. The E&S DD recommended improving 
legal compliances of the sub-contractors engaged 
in on-site activities and revising the existing formal 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) to reflect site 
specific scenarios. The Bank is in consultation with the 
Borrower to finalise an Environmental & Social Action 
Plan (ESAP) addressing key concerns identified in the 
E&S DD assessment.
Sponge Iron Manufacturing Unit
The Bank sanctioned facilities to a Borrower for setting 
up a sponge iron manufacturing unit. The preliminary 
desk-based assessment indicated the need for a 
detailed Environment & Social Due-Diligence (E&S DD). 
The E&S DD assessment highlighted the need for 
improving the over-all on-site health and safety (H&S) 
aspects during the construction phase. The Bank 
engaged with the Borrower to develop and implement 
on-site H&S aspects such as work permit system, EHS 
training calendar. Improvements were also made to the 
existing on-site firefighting and first-aid facilities.
Hybrid (solar and wind) Renewable Energy 
Project
The Borrower and the Bank had been in engagement 
to participate in loan facilities for setting up a hybrid 
(wind and solar) renewable energy project. As per the 
provisions of the E&S Policy, the Bank conducted a 
preliminary desk-based assessment to determine the 
potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts 
arising from business activities of the Project.
Environmental & Social Due Diligence (E&S DD) was 
conducted by an independent E&S Consultant for both 
the wind and solar components of project.  
For the solar component of the project, the E&S DD 
assessment identified environmental monitoring and 
biodiversity conservation as key areas for improvement. 
Environmental monitoring has been conducted by the 
borrower at the site for parameters such as ambient 
air quality, ambient noise, drinking water quality etc. 
to assess adverse impacts on the local environment. 
All the relevant parameters were observed to be 
within the prescribed levels. Awareness training on 
conservation measures of local species has been 
initiated at the site. Carcass monitoring is also being 
conducted at the site on regular intervals. The data 
collated during the monitoring is documented and shall 
be evaluated to assess requirements of appropriate 
mitigation measures to protect the local species.
The key recommendations of the ESAP enclosed in the 
E&S DD assessment report for the wind component 
of the project included improvement to the on-site 
health and safety practices, labour management and 
implementation of the bio-diversity management 
plan. The Bank along with other project lenders are 
in discussion with the Borrower on the compliance 
measures 
implemented 
for 
mitigating 
above 
mentioned aspects.
Overview of projects for which detailed E&S Due Diligence / Assessment was conducted 
(FY 2023-24)
In FY 2023-24, detailed E&S due diligence/assessments were conducted for 8 transactions, all of which were project 
finance cases. There were no project-related corporate loan transactions.

Sustainable finance mechanisms
Given the large quantum of finances required to drive 
the sustainable development agenda, a number of 
new financial mechanisms such as green bonds and 
sustainability bonds have emerged globally that channelise 
finance to sustainable outcomes. Global green bond 
issuances increased by 15% to USD 587.6 billion in 2023*. 
India also joined a handful of countries to launch its first 
sovereign green bonds, raising ` 16,000 crore (USD 2 
billion) through two issuances. Backed by such innovative 
mechanisms, the global sustainable finance market is 
expected to grow from USD 3.6 trillion in 2021 to USD 23 
trillion by 2031.
YES BANK’s Green Bonds
YES BANK has always been at the forefront of identifying 
and capitalising on sustainable finance opportunities. 
The Bank kickstarted the green bond market in India, by 
issuing India’s maiden green bond in February 2015 and 
went on to raise ` 1,645 crore (USD 260 million), through 
a total of three green bonds for channelising finance 
towards India’s renewable energy sector. The renewable 
energy projects financed through the green bonds 
proceeds would annually avoid 1,117 ktCO2e in total, with 
attributable avoidance of 309 ktCO2e.
Green Fixed Deposits
The Bank is committed to drive much-needed finances 
towards green sectors and contribute to achieving India’s 
net zero target. In 2018, the Bank launched India’s first-ever 
green deposit product whereby equivalent proceeds 
raised through green fixed deposits, were earmarked 
towards SDG-aligned sectors. In the line with the new 
extant guildelines issued by RBI on its Framework for 
acceptance of Green Deposits, the Bank has put in place 
a Board-approved Green Deposit Policy and Financing 
Framework and is in the process of rolling out its Green 
Deposit programme.

Mobilising finance towards climate-aligned 
sectors 
The Banking sector has a crucial role to play in energy 
transition, climate adaptation and the shift to a low-carbon 
economy. According to the latest estimates, India would 
need over USD 10 trillion of financing to achieve its net 
zero by 2070 target, with investments of over USD 8.4 
trillion needed by the power sector alone. A majority of 
this financing will have to be driven by domestic financial 
institutions to support the technology shifts that would 
be required if India has to become net zero. The financial 
sector led by banks can support this transition by 
redirecting finances from climate-negative sectors like 
coal, and channelise them to climate-aligned, low-carbon 
activities. YES BANK is focussed on estimating its financed 
emissions from carbon-intensive sectors and developing 
sectoral targets for decarbonisation in line with global 
best practices. In FY 2021-22, the Bank became the first 
in its sector to measure and report financed emissions 
of its fund-based electricity generation portfolio and 
develop targets to reduce its financed emission intensity, 
dovetailing them into a targeted mix for its non-renewable 
energy and renewable energy portfolio. Additionally, 
the Bank continues to support climate-aligned sectors 
like renewable energy and electric vehicles and develop 
targeted products for green financing such as its loans for 
rooftop solar for MSMEs.
Clean and renewable energy lending
In FY 2023-24, YES BANK sanctioned debt facilities of 
` 3,819 crore for supporting renewable energy projects 
including solar, wind, hybrid projects of around 637 MW, 
and power transmission, InvIT, and smart metering 
projects. YES BANK continues to offer innovative and 
responsible solutions to the power industry and support 
the country’s transition to a net zero carbon emission by 
2070 through its business activities. 
The Bank has continued to channelise its efforts in 
meeting the country’s sustainability goals by sanctioning 
debt facilities amounting to ` 39,469 crore, towards 
~7.90 GW since 2015. Projects underwritten by the Bank 
have found a healthy appetite in the financing market 
with a significant portion of projects being successfully 
downsold/ refinanced. The Bank continues to have a 
positive outlook on the renewable and transmission sector 
and is now exploring growth in smart metering as well as 
domestic solar module manufacturing/assembly space.
As at March 31, 2024, the Bank’s lending book size for 
renewable energy generation stood at ~` 2,110 crore with 
corporate advances representing ~97.26%.
Avoided emissions 
Through its financing of renewable energy, YES BANK 
contributes to avoidance of emissions in electricity 
generation and assists in decarbonising India’s electricity 
generation sector. The clients/projects in the Bank’s 
renewable energy book (as at March 31, 2024) would 
lead to attributable electricity generation of 662 GWh and 
attributable avoidance of 619 ktCO2e, annually.

Solar Module Manufacturing 
In the quest for greater supply chain independence and 
to promote the Make-in-India initiative, solar industry in 
India is witnessing a shift towards local manufacturing. 
As India aims to achieve renewable energy capacity of 
500 GW, rapidly growing solar industry will play vital 
role. Government of India initiated various schemes 
including 
the 
Approved 
List 
of 
Models 
and 
Manufacturers (ALMM) guidelines and the Production 
Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme to boost the domestic 
module manufacturing ecosystem and to cater to 
increasing demands of both domestic and international 
solar power developers. 
In order to support India’s objective of becoming the 
next manufacturing hub of solar modules and panels, 
YES BANK has been evaluating sanction of credit 
facilities for setup of solar module facilities. As part of 
the endeavour, YBL evaluated a proposal wherein the 
Company intended to increase its production facility’s 
capacity and was selected as a successful bidder under 
the Government of India’s PLI scheme for domestic 
solar PV module manufacturing capacity. Borrower is 
amongst the country’s largest module manufacturers 
and is having a strong order book. The debt requirement 
for the Project was proposed to be funded by a 
consortium of lenders. 
CASE STUDIES

Electric Vehicle (EV) Financing 
India's EV financing industry is projected to be worth 3.7 
lakh crore in 2030, about 80% of India's current retail 
vehicle finance industry of 4.5 lakh crore (NITI Aayog). 
Investment in India's transition to e-mobility has the 
potential to create significant economic, social, and 
environmental benefits for the country. Currently, one-third 
of EV vehicles are being sold through financing and 
have the potential to grow cent percent with access to 
the right financing options. YES BANK offers EV loans 
at lower interest rates and contributes to the development 
of the electric vehicle ecosystem by financing auto 
ancillaries 
and 
charging 
infrastructure 
players.

and sewage treatment plants and supporting the electric 
vehicle ecosystem by financing auto ancillaries and 
charging infrastructure players. As at March 31, 2024, the 
Bank’s SME financing advances stood at ` 35,327 crore.
Affordable Housing
Affordable housing is a critical sector to enable India’s 
socio-economic development. To address the grave 
shortage in affordable housing, the government has 
already taken various initiatives including “Housing for 
All”. Most of the organised lenders require standard 
documented income proof thus making it difficult for this 
section of the society to avail a home loan. Understanding 
their challenges, YES BANK decided to take a step 
forward to help people fulfil their dreams and launched 
YES KHUSHI Home Loans in May 2016, as a step 
towards social responsibility by serving the underserved/ 
neglected segment of the society & meeting their financial 
need. YES KHUSHI home loans is primarily targeted 
towards the Economically Weaker Section and Low Income 
Group segments which may have formal, semi-formal 
or informal income documents and are looking for 
financial assistance to buy or construct their first home. 
The Bank’s target customers majorly include small traders 
& shopkeepers, maids, teachers, tutors, nurses, ward 
boys, sales executives, cashiers in malls, employees of 
private security agencies, bus drivers, amongst others, 
who may not have formal income documents and instead 
receive income/salary in cash. As at March 31, 2024, the 
Bank’s Khushi (Affordable) Home loans portfolio stood at 
~ ` 6,310 crore and nearly 45,927 customers have been 
extended loans under the Bank’s affordable housing 
loan programme.

Principles for Responsible Banking:
Portfolio Impact Assessment and Targets
In 2019, YES BANK along with 32 global Banks and UNEP 
FI, founded the UNEPI Principles for Responsible Banking 
(PRB) – the first global framework for enabling the banking 
sector to align its business to the objectives of the SDGs 
and the Paris Climate Agreement. YES BANK continues 
to be the only Indian Founding signatory amongst 230 
global Banks that have joined PRB’s call to action. The PRB 
framework calls upon banks to undertake an impact 
analysis of their portfolios in order to assess how their 
businesses interact with and impact the 17 SDGs, and to 
minimise negative impacts and maximise positive impacts 
of their businesses.
In FY 2021-22, the Bank used the amended UNEP FI 
PRB Portfolio Impact Assessment tool v2, (published on 
July 16, 2021), to assess its portfolio. The tool assesses 
the potential impacts of the Bank’s exposure towards 
various sectors on 22 key impact categories, derived from 
core elements of SDGs (as defined in the UNEP FI Impact 
Radar), in the context of India’s need and challenges. 
These impact categories include availability and quality 
of water, food, education, employment, housing, health 
& sanitation, energy, climate change, resource efficiency, 
waste, information, culture & heritage, mobility, air, soil etc. 
To understand and take into account India’s environmental, 
social, and economic context, in which the Bank operates, 
Bank has utilised the tool to identify the level of need 
at national level, with regards to 22 impact categories. 
Considering the scope, scale of exposure, context and 
relevance in the impact assessment, Bank has identified 
and prioritised Climate Change and Financial Inclusion 
as most significant/material areas, to pursue focussed 
approach driven by specific, measurable, actionable, 
relevant and time bound targets, in consultation with 
top management. 
The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a holistic 
blueprint for building a sustainable society of the future. The SDGs provide the banking 
sector an opportunity to align its business activities and financing to larger societal 
goals and outcomes, and to ensure that financial systems of the future are geared 
towards sustainable growth.

In FY 2023-24, Bank has been able 
to reach out to 6.56 lakh women 
beneficiaries leading to a degrowth of 
~14% in number of women beneficiary 
from the baseline of FY 2022-23. In  
FY 2023-24, overall disbursement to women 
beneficiary has increased, with Bank’s 
lending totalling to ` 1,781 crore (~20% 
higher compared to base year FY 2022-23).
During the year, the loan origination 
system for microfinance has undergone 
transition to adhere to revised regulatory 
guidelines. The technological transition 
has led to system constraints impacting 
the business-as-usual scenario, including 
client accretion and retention resulting in 
lower than expected women beneficiary 
and corresponding disbursement.
Bank intends to achieve the shortfall in 
target and increase its disbursement 
portfolio and beneficiaries by empanelling 
new Business Correspondent (BC) 
partners to boost its presence in the 
segment for expansion and penetrate 
further into untapped geographies of 
the domestic market along with the 
introduction to new improved loan 
origination system.

Executive Summary 
MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Despite having witnessed geopolitical tensions and 
tightening of the monetary policy stance by majority of the 
central banks, the global economy remained resilient in 
CY 2023/FY 2023-24. Prompt actions undertaken by the 
regulatory authorities helped mitigate potential risks to 
the financial sector that emanated from the deteriorating 
health of select banks in the United States and Europe. 
Elevated interest rates in the world’s major economies 
led to inflation falling faster-than-expected from its 2022 
peak. Oil prices displayed some moderation in the first half 
of FY 2023-24 which was followed by some upward bias 
owing to geo-political tensions, extension and deepening 
of production cuts by OPEC (Oil Producing and Exporting 
Countries), US government’s announcement to replenish 
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Rising trade barriers, 
increased sanctions, technology decoupling and migration 
restrictions were some other highlights of the fiscal. 
Management Discussion  
and Analysis
While the global economy demonstrated broad resilience, 
significant growth divergences were observed across 
various economies. According to the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), global GDP grew ~3.2% in CY 2023. 
Advanced Economies grew by ~1.6%, compared to ~4.3% 
growth in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies. 
Going ahead, last-mile efforts to bring the inflation down to 
target levels is likely to pose further challenges. IMF doesn’t 
expect most major economies to reach their targeted 
growth levels before CY 2025. Amidst this backdrop, IMF 
expects the global economy to deliver a growth rate of 
~3.2% in CY 2024, similar to that in CY 2023. Growth rate 
of Advanced Economies is expected at ~1.7%, while on the 
other hand, emerging market economies are expected to 
grow by ~4.2%. 
On the domestic front, the Indian economy remained 
one of the fastest growing economies of the world and 
continued to exhibit strong macroeconomic fundamentals.

While 
urban 
demand 
remained 
relatively 
robust 
throughout the fiscal, the rural sector too displayed signs 
of recovery in the year’s latter half. Capex spending by 
the central and state governments played a critical role in 
driving and sustaining the growth momentum. 
Headline CPI inflation remained below 5% in Q1-FY 
2023-24 before it peaked to the level of 7.4% in July 2024. 
However, inflation containment measures undertaken 
by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
resulted in bringing down of Headline CPI inflation in the 
second half, averaging at ~4.9% for FY 2023-24. 
RBI remains committed to further bring inflation down 
to 4% levels, and therefore, kept policy rate unchanged 
at 6.5%, and maintained its stance of “withdrawal of 
accommodation”.
Further measures such as Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio 
(I-CRR), Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) and Variable 
Repo Rate (VRR) auctions were also undertaken to balance 
the system-wide liquidity during the year. Core inflation, on 
the other hand, averaged at ~4.4% in FY 2023-24, drifting 
from 5.3% in April 2023 to 3.3% by March 2024. 
The Indian banking system continued to be resilient as 
evidenced through the findings of RBI’s Financial Stability 
Report (Dec’23) with Scheduled Commercial Banks’ (SCBs) 
Capital-to-Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) remaining at 16.8%, 
Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio falling to a 
multi-year low of 3.2%, and Net Non-Performing Assets 
(NNPA) ratio to 0.8% as on September 30, 2023, even while 
the Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) steadily increased 
to 75.3%. RBI’s stress test results revealed that SCBs are 
well-capitalised and capable of absorbing macro-economic 
shocks, even with no further capital infusion. 
With growth conditions being resilient, RBI continues to 
remain focussed on bringing down inflation to a target of 
4% on a durable basis. RBI projects Headline CPI inflation 
to be below 4% in Q2-FY25, before rising again.

The central bank remains optimistic on domestic growth, 
and projects India’s FY 2024-25 GDP to grow by 7%, aided 
by rural demand recovery, buoyant urban consumption, 
and such other factors. However, external headwinds 
including protracted geopolitical tensions and trade 
disruptions could pose risk to domestic growth. As per 
the official estimates from the government, India’s GDP 
is stood at 8.2% in FY 2023-24, compared with 7.0% in 
the earlier fiscal year of FY 2022-23. During the year, the 
credit needs of the economy’s productive sectors were 
comfortably met by the banking sector.

External sector resilience has been a key contributing 
factor in improved domestic macroeconomic stability. 
Strong services exports and remittances have been crucial 
in providing stability to Current Account Deficit (CAD). 
Importantly, services exports remained resilient amidst 
the global slowdown fears with the increasing contribution 
from non-software exports. 
The trade gap improved slightly in FY 2023-24 vis-à-vis 
FY 2022-23 even as moderation was witnessed in both 
exports and imports. Consequent to the above trends, 
the ratio of CAD as a percentage of GDP is expected to 
improve to 0.7% in FY 2023-24, from 2.0% in FY 2022-23. 
Further, capital flows remained robust, with inflows 
from Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) increasingly being 
determined by geopolitical alignments and inward-looking 
strategies of various economies. Thus, inward FDI 
declined by 3.6% between April 2023 and January 2024, 
compared to the corresponding period in the previous 
year. However, External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) 
registrations 
and 
disbursements 
improved 
during 
the same period. Net Foreign Portfolio Investment 
(FPI) inflows stood at USD 57.6 billion in FY 2023-24. 
The pace of FPI investments picked up significantly on 
the debt side following the announcement of India being 
included in JP Morgan’s widely tracked Government Bond 
Index-Emerging Markets. 
Uncertainties in the global monetary policy dynamics 
associated with the resilience of the US economy and 
relative growth paths of the Advanced Economies (AEs) led 
to wide moves in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). In July 2023, 
DXY touched a low of 99.7, but swiftly turned around to 
peak at around 107 by early October. Thereafter, it again 
moved down to around 101 by late-December 2023 before 
finishing the year at 104.60. However, USD/INR experienced 
a ranged move, and tended to be on an appreciation mode 
in the last quarter of FY 2023-24. Consequently, it moved 
in a narrow range of 81.76-83.40 during the year. By the 
end of April 2024, foreign exchange (FX) reserves were at a 
healthy ~USD 638 billion. 
RETAIL BANKING
The Retail business in India’s banking sector witnessed robust growth during the year with system-wide share of retail 
loans (personal loans) at 32.4%, which increased 17.7% Y-O-Y (excluding HDFC and HDFC Bank merger impact).

Risk Management
The Bank’s long-term financial security and success is 
built on its risk management architecture. The Bank's 
risk management is based on three lines of defence: 
(a) business units, (b) independent control functions, and 
(c) and internal audit. 
Further, the Bank’s Board has the overall responsibility of 
risk management, with the risk management architecture 
being overseen by the Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
of the Board. Additionally, risk management is undertaken 
by four Board-level committees for respective risks, 
wherein risk assessment and management are undertaken 
within the Bank’s Board-approved risk architecture. 
The Bank is exposed to three Pillar 1 risks in the course 
of its business: credit risk, market risk, and operational 
risk. With the evolving banking landscape, the Bank is also 
exposed to Pillar 2 risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk in banking book, and cyber security risk. These risks are 
also critical as they not only have a bearing on the Bank’s 
226
YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
financial strength and operations, but also on its reputation. 
A detailed description of various risks faced by the Bank, 
their respective governance framework, management and 
mitigation strategies, and their implication to the Bank is 
presented on 
 Page 68.
The Bank has Board-approved risk policies that define 
its risk framework. The RMC and the Board monitors the 
compliance of various risk parameters and risk exposures 
on a periodic basis. The RMC also ensures that frameworks 
are established for assessing and managing various risks 
faced by the Bank. It ensures that the Bank's framework 
is adequate and appropriate for changing business and 
economic conditions, structure and needs of the Bank and 
is well within its risk appetite. 
Further, the Bank has a structured strategy assessment 
and management framework in the Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess 
and manage the risks that may have a material adverse 
impact on its business strategy, financial position and 
capital adequacy. It also has in place a Board-approved 
risk appetite statement for key risks identified under 
ICAAP. There are internal policies and processes to ensure 
that the Bank operates within its risk appetite thresholds.
The Bank has also implemented a Board-approved stress 
testing framework that forms an integral part of ICAAP and 
risk assessment. Stress testing involves the use of various 
techniques to assess the Bank’s potential vulnerability 
to extreme, but plausible, stressed business conditions. 
The Bank evaluates the impact of various stress testing 
scenarios on account of various Pillar I and Pillar II risks.
Internal Audit
The Bank’s Internal Audit Department (IAD), which is 
ISO 9001:2015 certified (Quality Management System), 
provides an independent and objective assurance and 
consulting services to add value and improve its risk and 
control environment. The IAD monitors the adequacy, 
effectiveness and adherence to internal controls, processes 
and procedures instituted by the Bank’s management and 
extant regulations.
The Internal Audit team reports to the Audit Committee 
('ACB') of the Board for audit planning, reporting and 
review, and the Head of the IAD reports directly to the ACB 
of the Bank’s Board of Directors. The IAD has unlimited and 
unrestricted access to all relevant data, systems, personnel 
and information to achieve its objectives. It is staffed with 
qualified team members with relevant certifications, and 
its training programme ensures that all team members are 
upskilled at frequent intervals.
The IAD has adopted a risk-based approach towards 
internal auditing, as per regulatory guidelines and 
internationally established best practices. A risk-based 
audit plan (RBAP) is prepared annually and is duly approved 
by the 'ACB'. The IAD audits various businesses, operations, 
information security (IS), information technology (IT) 
systems and support units as per the RBAP. The IAD 
prepares a report for each audit, recommends mitigation 
plans for the risks identified and ensures compliance with 
all the recommendations. The 'ACB' monitors the progress 
of the RBAP on a quarterly basis.
The Bank also subjects its operations to concurrent 
auditing by reputed audit firms to complement its 
internal auditing function. Concurrent auditing covers 
core activities, including operations (including credit), 
financial markets, data centres (including IT & IS systems) 
and branches in compliance with regulatory guidelines. 
All audit reports are circulated to the relevant management 
teams and the 'ACB'.
Compliance
Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, 
promoting a robust culture of compliance among 
YES BANKers and building trust among all the 
stakeholders is an overarching consideration at 
the Bank. The dedicated Compliance Department 
strives to be at the forefront of regulatory changes 
and continues to work closely with all the Bank’s 
businesses and operations to be compliant with 
existing and new requirements. To further this 
objective, the Chief Compliance Officer at the Bank 
reports directly to the ACB.
The key functions of the Compliance Department 
align with various RBI guidelines, which includes 
identifying 
effective 
procedures, 
corresponding 
controls to support the Bank’s business divisions and 
the dissemination of key regulatory updates affecting 
the Bank’s various businesses. The Compliance 
Department 
also 
reviews 
new 
products 
and 
processes from a regulatory compliance perspective, 
provides guidance on compliance-related matters, 
conducts compliance reviews and delivers training 
to employees on different aspects on compliance. 
In addition, the Bank has also put in place the KYC and 
Anti-Money Laundering policy approved by the Board 
and transaction monitoring procedures, as per the 
regulatory guidelines.

To,
The Members,
Your Directors are pleased to present the Twentieth 
Annual Report on the business and operations of the Bank 
together with the audited financial statements (standalone 
as well as consolidated) for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2024.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
FY 2023-24 was the fourth year of the new journey of YES 
BANK. Whilst, in the first year, the focus was on rebuilding 
the Bank, in the second year, we swiftly shifted our focus 
on growing the Bank, in the third year, we achieved critical 
milestones of equity capital raise from two global marquee 
Private Equity investors, transfer of legacy stressed asset 
pool to ARC which was by far the single largest transaction 
of sale of non-performing assets in the Indian Banking 
System. Through the fourth year 2023-24, the Bank has 
continued to build on a strong momentum on both our 
asset and liability with focus on granularity and in risk 
calibrated manner. The Bank now has a dedicated focus 
towards improving the profitability profile of the Bank, 
thereby enhancing the shareholder returns. The Directors 
are pleased to inform the shareholders that the Bank’s 
Total Assets in FY 2023-24 crossed ` 4 lakh crore, with 
deposits crossing ` 2.6 lakh crore and CASA ratio at 30.9%. 
At the same time, the Return on Assets (RoA) for FY 2023-24 
expanded to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous year, and 
the annualised RoA for the Quarter ended March 31, 
2024 was at 0.5%.
The Bank has further progressed on its transformation 
journey and has emerged as a re-energised, recapitalised 
and recalibrated organisation, by leveraging on a unique 
opportunity to learn from past challenges and become 
stronger, while continuing to fulfil its unwavering 
commitment towards its customers and stakeholders. 
The Bank is on track to achieve its longer-term Strategic 
Objectives and none of this would have been possible 
without the confidence reposed on the Bank by our 
customers, depositors and investors. The confidence 
of stakeholders has not only been seen through the 
improving financial performance of the Bank during 
the last year, but also through external validation in the 
form of Credit Rating upgrades, continuing momentum 
on new client acquisition, several marquee strategic 
partnerships and re-inclusion of the stock in marquee 
indices amongst others.
Directors’ Report
Importantly, during the year, the Bank has dedicatedly 
focussed on executing its profitability improvement 
roadmap by leveraging the core and key business levers 
of 1) retail asset mix optimisation, 2) SME and Mid-Market 
strong value proposition, 3) leveraging Digital and 
Transaction Banking capabilities and partnerships and, 
lastly 4) fully sweating Branches as the fulcrum of the 
business to drive higher cross sell and lower costs going 
forward. This is being driven alongside a focused Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) strategy.
As a part of its transformation, the Bank unveiled its 
refreshed brand identity on May 30, 2023, as a part of which 
a vibrant new logo was launched which carries forward 
the visual DNA of the Bank and builds on it. This new 
identity embodies our deep commitment to empower our 
customer. While we take care of their banking needs, they 
can continue to focus on living a fuller life, spend more 
time with their loved ones and create new memories. 
The YES BANK of today truly represents our brand ethos - 
Life Ko Banao Rich.
The Bank undertook multiple initiatives to grow the Bank’s 
business and launched innovative and tailored propositions 
for its customers. The Bank launched ‘IRIS by YES BANK’-

the heart of its strategy. The Bank remains focused on its 
priorities and looks to continue this momentum onwards 
and upwards so that it can deliver on its strategic objectives 
while creating superior value for all its stakeholders.
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
As we progress into Fiscal 25, the overall business outlook 
remains healthy. The Banking sector in India has exhibited 
remarkable resilience in the face of many adversities. 
The latest Financial Stability Report (December 23) indicates 
that the domestic financial system remains stable, with 
sound balance sheets of financial institutions, and which 
is expected to continue to support the funding needs of 
a growing economy. On a y-o-y basis, one should expect 
some moderation in the credit growth from the banking 
system that accounts for a high base of the last year 
and relative expected moderation in GDP growth rate to 
around 7% in Fiscal 25.
The Government is expected to continue with its reforms 
momentum and keep up the pace of capex investments. 
Various surveys have indicated that likely crowding-in 
of private investments which may further boost credit 
demand. With the RBI increasing the risk weight of some 
of the segments of personal loan, the impact was already 
visible in the last four months of Fiscal 24 and we expect 
the pace of growth in this segment to slow down going 
forward; with some offsets likely to continue to come from 
sustained growth in Housing segment.
As we may see rate cut cycle beginning to unfold at some 
point in Fiscal 25, it is expected that financial markets may 
exhibit some volatility. A falling interest rate scenario is 
expected to be detrimental for the net interest margins 
(NIMs) for the banking sector as transmission of rate cuts 
on the asset side is generally faster than on the liability 
side. Continued global geopolitical tensions could, on the 
other hand, temper the growth outlook and hence lead to 
moderation in credit growth. Geopolitical risks also raise 
the fear of a rise in commodity prices and could also lead 
to hampering economic growth and hence credit growth.

DISCLOSURES UNDER GREEN INFRA BONDS
Green bonds have emerged as a mainstream financing 
mechanism for providing structured finances to vital clean 
energy and are playing a pivotal role in realization of India’s 
renewable energy potential. Since the maiden issuance by 
YES BANK, the Green Bonds market has witnessed a steady 
growth. Driven by its commitment on mainstreaming 
green finance, YES BANK has issued three green bonds, 
out of which two green bonds are outstanding as of 
March 31, 2024:
	
February 2015: YES BANK issued India’s first-ever 
Green Infrastructure Bonds, raising an amount of 
` 1,000 crore (bearing ISIN: INE528G08279). This 
10 year tenor bond witnessed strong demand from 
leading investors including Insurance companies, 
Pension & Provident Funds, Foreign Portfolio 
Investors, New Pension Schemes and Mutual Funds
	
August 2015: YES BANK raised ` 315 crore through 
the issue of Green Infrastructure Bonds (bearing ISIN 
INE528G08295) to International Finance Corporation 
on a private placement basis. The bonds are for a 
tenor of 10 years.
	
December 2016: YES BANK raised ` 330 crore, 
through an issue of  a 7-year Green Infrastructure 
Bonds (bearing ISIN INE528G08360) to  FMO, the 
Dutch Development Bank, on a private placement 
basis. The green infrastructure bonds have been 
redeemed upon maturity in December 2023.
The proceeds of the outstanding green infrastructure 
bonds are used to finance Green Infrastructure Projects 
as per ‘Eligible Projects’ outlined in the Bank’s internal 
guidelines that are in adherence to the Green Bond 
Principles (GBP).
The GBP are voluntary guidelines, developed by the 
International Capital Markets Association, for broad 
use by the market that recommend transparency and 
disclosure, and promote integrity in the development of 
the Green Bond market. They have the following four key 
components and the Bank showcases its adoption below:
	
Use of Proceeds: The proceeds raised by the Bank 
are used in eligible project categories and include all 
projects funded in whole, or in part, in the fields of 
renewable and clean energy projects including Wind, 
Solar, Biomass, Hydropower and other such projects
	
Process for Evaluation and Selection of Eligible 
Projects: The Bank’s process starts with interactions 
with potential borrowers to understand the overall 
aspects of the project. The evaluation moves to 
documentation and appraisal of projects as per 
Bank’s policies and confirmation of the eligibility 
for Green Bonds
	
Management of Proceeds: Green Bond allocations 
to eligible projects are tracked by the Bank through 
an MIS based system. The unallocated proceeds, if 
any, are placed in liquid instruments
	
Reporting: The Bank’s communication to investors 
through an annual update includes:
	
	
List of projects to which proceeds have been 
allocated to, with brief description including

Responsibilities of the Management of YES Bank and DNV
The management of YES Bank has provided the information and data used by DNV during the delivery of 
this review. Our statement represents an independent opinion and is intended to inform YES bank
management and other interested stakeholders in the Green Bonds as to whether the Sector Technical 
Criteria identified above have been met, based on the information provided to us. In our work we have

Basis of DNV
Opinion
DNV has conducted the verification against the requirements of the Green Bond Principles, 2021 and 
Clause 2.1 of Chapter IX-Green Debt Securities of Operational Circular no 
SEBI/HO/DDHS/P/CIR/2021/613 dated August 10, 2021 (updated as on April 13, 2022).
As per our Protocol, the criteria against which the Green Bonds have been reviewed are grouped under 
the four Principles:
Principle One: Use of Proceeds. The Use of Proceeds criteria are guided by the requirement 
that an issuer of a Green Bond must use the funds raised to finance or refinance eligible activities. 
The eligible activities should produce clear environmental benefits. 
Principle Two: Process for Project Evaluation and Selection. The Project Evaluation and 
Selection criteria are guided by the requirements that an issuer of a Green bond should outline the 
process it follows when determining eligibility of an investment using the Green bond proceeds 
and outline any impact objectives it will consider. 
Principle Three: Management of Proceeds. The Management of Proceeds criteria are guided 
by the requirements that a Green bond should be tracked within the issuing organisation and that 
a declaration of how unallocated funds will be handled should be made. 
Principle Four: Reporting. The Reporting criteria are guided by the recommendation that at 
least Sustainability Reporting to the investors should be made of the use of bond proceeds and 
that quantitative and/or qualitative performance indicators should be used, where feasible.
Work Undertaken
Our work constituted a high level review of the available information, based on the understanding that 
this information was provided to us by YES Bank in good faith. We have not performed an audit or other

In compliance with Regulation 34(3) and Clause (C) of 
Schedule V of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI LODR”), a Report on Corporate 
Governance 
for 
the 
Financial 
Year 
2023-24 
is 
presented below:
1.	
BANK’S 
PHILOSOPHY 
ON 
CODE 
OF 
GOVERNANCE1
	
At YES BANK, we are driven by a deep purpose and 
relentless commitment to our path to Corporate 
Governance. 
Our 
differentiated 
approach 
to 
governance is built on sound governance practices 
based 
on 
conscience, 
openness, 
fairness, 
professionalism, and accountability. This approach 
helps in building confidence of its various stakeholders 
and thereby paving the way for its long-term success.
The Bank believes in sustainable corporate growth that 
emanates from the top leadership down through 
the organisation to the various stakeholders which 
is reflected in its sound financial system, enhanced 
market reputation and improved efficiency.
	
Transparency and Accountability are the fundamental 
principles to sound Corporate Governance, which 
ensures that the organisation is managed and 
monitored in a responsible manner for “creating and 
sharing value”.
	
The Bank regularly upgrades its systems, policies, 
and processes to meet the demands of a dynamic 
and challenging business environment, providing 
reasonable assurance regarding the maintenance 
of proper internal controls and the monitoring of 
operations, thereby enhancing transparency and 
accountability. YES BANK is committed to adhere to 
highest standards of ethics, transparency, disclosures 
and governance and to protect the interest of all its 
stakeholders. The Board is focused on ensuring 
continuous 
improvements 
in 
both 
Corporate 
Governance and Risk Controls of the Bank.
	
YES BANK’s Corporate Governance Framework 
ensures that timely disclosures are made and 
accurate information is shared regarding the financial 
performance, operations, material events as well as 
the leadership and governance of the Bank.
Corporate Governance Report
(The Report on Corporate Governance for the year ended March 31, 2024)
	
During the recent past years, certain Corporate 
Governance issues were raised by Stakeholders 
and Regulators.
	
Taking a positive note of such observations, the Bank 
has worked effortlessly to strengthen its governance 
and disclosure practices and promises to continue 
to be on the progressive path to nourish Corporate 
Governance practices to make it more effective from 
regulatory and market perspective.
	
Environmental, Social & Governance Rating
	
Environmental, 
Social 
and 
Governance 
(ESG) 
performance refers to the non-financial performance 
of an organisation on crucial issues such as 
climate change, environmental sustainability, social 
responsibility, ethics, institutional frameworks, and 
transparency, amongst others.
	
Globally, there is an emerging awareness that an 
organisation’s overall performance is linked to 
non-financial, yet financially material issues, which 
pose significant material risks to long term returns. 
This has led to the emergence of ESG, a set of 
non-financial metrics or parameters, which along 
with financial metrics, provide a holistic assessment 
of an organisation’s impact on three fronts - Profits, 
People and Planet.
	
YES BANK views the emergence of ESG as an 
important development for the corporate sector both 
from an ethical and financial perspective. The Bank 
continuously strives to integrate ESG principles into 
its core business strategy, adopt best practices in 
ESG and align its business to global frameworks on 
sustainability such as the United Nation’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate 
Agreement, and the Principles for Responsible Banking 
(PRB). The Bank has set up a robust governance 
structure for integrating ESG considerations into its 
business by constituting a Board level CSR and ESG 
Committee to oversee the Bank’s ESG agenda, and 
an Executive level Sustainability Council chaired by 
the Managing Director & CEO which oversees the 
implementation of the Bank’s sustainability strategy 
and performance. The Bank further strengthened its 
ESG governance by including ESG in its a Board level 
Committee and renaming the same as CSR & ESG 
1GRI 2-9

data points on an organisation’s performance 
across 
topics 
such 
as 
Climate 
Strategy,

products and services
•	
The Bank has set up a dedicated “Secure Banking” section on its website to educate customers on the safe and 
secure ways of using digital payments/ channels
•	
The Bank also sends periodic advisories via email or SMS’ to inform customers on safety practices
•

3. 	
Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/discontinuation of essential services.
	
Disruption in services of the Bank (planned and unplanned) does have the potential to cause grave reputational 
damage. Keeping this in view, the Bank’s Corporate Communication is entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating 
the Bank’s communication strategy, based on the severity of the situation. Appended below, are some steps taken by 
the Corporate Communication team to mitigate the risk that could arise as a result of service disruptions
	
Unplanned/Planned Downtimes: In case of a downtime, the Bank’s Corporate Communication team works with the 
Bank’s Business and Digital Technology Solutions Group (BDTS) team to assess the cause of the disruption. The team 
then frames a communication that not just acknowledges the issue, but also provides a fair idea of the time required 
to restore normalcy. Post relevant approvals, the communication is disseminated to customers in the following ways:
•	
Press Release: We may issue a brief press release to the media which talks about the downtime and carry 
other relevant details like services that got impacted, services that remain intact, as well as the time it will take 
to restore normalcy. Depending on the magnitude of the issue, we may choose to restrict the issuance of the 
release to a certain geographical region
•	
Social Media: This is a critical strategy wherein we acknowledge the downtime by proactively putting up a social 
media notification on all of the Bank’s handles. Typically, the post should also carry details about the issue in 
brief and the services that have been impacted as well as the ones that are working seamlessly 
•	
Online Reputation Management (ORM): A gist of the press release is shared with the ORM team 
which then uses it as reference to respond to customer queries/escalations on social media, emails and 
telephonic conversations
•	
WhatsApp/SMS: Considering customers are significantly more active in accessing information on their phones, 
we also make it point to communicate all critical information to customers through WhatsApp and SMS’
	
The strategies listed above are purely planned and executed basis the degree of impact and may not involve activating 
all four channels of communication every time.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Members of
YES BANK Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of 
YES BANK Limited (‘the Bank’), which comprise the Balance 
Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Profit and Loss Account 
and the Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and 
notes to the standalone financial statements, including 
a summary of the significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 
“Standalone Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
standalone financial statements give the information 
required by the section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) and 
circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of 
India, in the manner so required for banking companies 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 
of the Act, read with Companies (Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2021 as amended to the extent applicable, of the 
state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2024, and its 
profit, and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under Section 143 (10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of 
the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current 
year. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report:
Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
Asset Classification of Advances and Investments (IRAC) and Provisioning
Refer to schedule 8 and schedule 9, read with relevant 
Notes relating to provisions and contingencies, disclosures 
with regard to Non Performing Investments (NPI) and 
Asset Quality in respect of movement of Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) and related provisions respectively.
As required under prudential norms issued by the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) in respect of asset classification and 
provisioning pertaining to investments as well as those 
pertaining to advances, and relevant circulars, notifications 
and directives issued by the RBI which were collectively 
considered by the Bank till March 31, 2024, classifies 
advances into performing and non-performing advances 
(NPA) which consists of Standard, Sub-standard, Doubtful 
and Loss and makes appropriate provisions.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit 
procedures in respect of asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to investments and advances. In particular:
	
Evaluated the Bank’s internal control system in 
adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding 
income 
recognition, 
asset 
classification 
and 
provisioning pertaining to investments and advances;
	
Tested key IT systems/ applications used and their 
design and implementation as well as operational 
effectiveness of relevant controls, in relation to asset 
classification viz., standard, sub-standard, doubtful 
and loss with reference to their days-past-due (DPD) 
status (including consideration of non-financial 
parameters of NPA, including sufficiency of credits 
in working capital loans, restructuring guidelines, the 
Regulatory Package and Resolution framework) and 
provisioning pertaining to investments and advances;
372
YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
The Bank, as per its governing framework, made the 
performing and non-performing advances provisions 
based on Management’s assessment of the degree 
of impairment of the advances subject to and guided 
by minimum provisioning levels prescribed under 
RBI guidelines.
The Classification, Provisioning and Write off of Advances 
including Investments is a Key Audit Matter as the Bank 
has significant credit risk exposure to a large number of 
borrowers across various sectors, products, industries 
and geographies and there is a high degree of complexity, 
uncertainty and judgment involved in recoverability 
of advances, nature of transactions and estimation of 
provisions thereon and identification of accounts to 
be written off.
	
Test checked advances to examine the validity of the 
recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined 
the statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, 
impairment provision for non-performing assets, 
and compliance with income recognition, asset 
classification and provisioning pertaining to advances 
in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;
	
Tested, selected restructured accounts on sample 
basis and their compliance with relevant RBI guidelines;
	
For the selected non-performing advances, we 
assessed Management’s forecast and inputs of 
recoverable cash flows, borrower’s audited financial 
statements, valuation of underlying security and 
collaterals, estimation of recoverable amounts on 
default and other sources of repayment;
	
Tested the Bank’s processes for making provision on 
advances for compliance with RBI regulations and 
internally laid down policies for provisioning;
	
Undertaken the walkthrough for the automated E-NPA 
system and tested the core functionality for selected 
samples considering the audit universe.
	
Validated the parameters used to calculate collective 
provisions with reference to IRAC norms, and 
Regulatory Package;
	
Tested provision created for fraud accounts as at 
March 31, 2024 as per the RBI circular;
	
Re-performed, for a sample of retail and corporate 
portfolios, as part of our substantive audit procedures 
the calculation of provisions, to determine the 
accuracy of the same; (Collective for standard portfolio 
and case specific for non performing portfolio)
	
Assessed the adequacy of disclosures against 
the RBI Guidelines
IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s key financial accounting and reporting 
processes are highly dependent on Core Banking and 
Treasury Solutions and other supporting software and 
hardware controls. The volume of transactions processed 
and recorded is huge and hence the IT controls are 
required to ensure that applications process data as 
expected and that changes are made in an appropriate 
manner. The Bank’s IT control framework includes 
automated, 
semi-automated 
and 
manual 
controls 
designed to address identified risks. IT controls are 
stated in Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls 
(ITGC) and IT Application Controls (ITAC). Such controls 
contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data. 
	
We have planned, designed and carried out the desired 
audit procedures and sample checks, taking into 
consideration the IT systems of the Bank. As part of our 
IT controls testing, we have tested ITGC as well as ITAC 
for selected critical applications.  The focus of testing 
of ITGCs was based on the various parameters such as 
Completeness, Validity, Identification/ Authentication, 
Authorization, Integrity and Accountability. On the 
other hand, focus of testing automated controls from 
applications was whether the controls prevent 
or detect unauthorized transactions and support 
financial 
objectives 
including 
completeness, 
accuracy, authorization and validity of transactions.

Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit 
Matter as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on 
technology. The IT environment is complex and the design 
and operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct 
impact on its financial reporting process.  Such controls 
provide assurance on the integrity and completeness of 
data processed through various IT applications which are 
used for the preparation of financial reports.
	
The procedures adopted by us are, in our opinion, 
adequate to provide reasonable assurance on 
the adequacy of IT controls in place. The areas for 
improvement as and when noticed are communicated 
for suitable actions to the Bank as part of our audit. 
The corrective steps / alternate controls deployed by 
the Bank are tested on sample basis.  
	
In ITGC testing, on sample basis, we reviewed 
control areas such as User Management, Change 
Management, Systems Security, Cyber Security, 
Interface Testing, deployment of new applications, 
Incident Management, Physical & Environmental 
Security, Creation and maintenance of edit logs, 
Backup and Restoration, Business Continuity and 
Disaster Recovery, Service Level Agreement. 
	
For ITAC, we carried out on sample basis, compliance 
tests of system functionality in order to assess the 
accuracy of system calculations. We also carried out 
procedures such as validations and limit checks on 
data entered into applications, approvals, process 
dependencies, restriction on time period in which 
transactions may be recorded and GL mapping for 
financial accounting. 
	
Tested the control environment using various 
techniques such as inquiry, walkthroughs in live 
environment, testing in UAT environment, review of 
documentation / record / reports, observation and 
re-performance.
	
Wherever deviations were noted either the same 
were explained to our satisfaction or we tested 
compensating controls and performed alternate 
procedures, where necessary, to draw comfort.
	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit 
conducted by internal audit department, and 
also the testing of Internal Financial Control 
conducted by the Operational Risk Management 
department of the Bank. 
Information other than the standalone financial 
statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the Other Information. The other 
information comprises the Management Discussion and 
Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, 
Directors’ Report forming part of the Annual Report, but 
does not include the Standalone Financial Statements, 
Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon and the Pillar III Disclosures under Basel 
III Capital Regulation, Leverage Ratio, Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio. The Annual Report is 
expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor's report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the Other 
374
YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information 
is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the other information, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged 
with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of 
these standalone financial statements that give a true and 
fair view of the  financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of 
the Act read with Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2021 as amended to the extent applicable, provisions 
of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
the circulars and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of 
India (‘RBI’) from time to time, as applicable to the Bank. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of 
the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of 
the standalone financial statements that give a true and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate 
the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the bank has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Director’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
375
Corporate Overview
Our Performance
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Our Business In-Depth
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures 
in the standalone financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the standalone financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the standalone 
financial 
statements 
represent 
the 
underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current year and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
The Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 
March 31, 2023, have been audited by one of the 
predecessor auditors M.P. Chitale & Co. and continuing 
joint statutory auditors Chokshi & Chokshi LLP, whose 
report dated April 22, 2023 had expressed an unmodified 
opinion. The above report has been furnished to us 
by the management and has been relied upon by 
us for the purpose of our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements of YES BANK 
Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction 
with our audit of the standalone financial statements of 
the Bank for the year ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Bank has maintained, in all material 
respects, an adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements and such 
internal financial controls were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2024, with reference to financial statements 
criteria established by the Bank considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.
Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements the criteria established by the Bank considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence 
to the Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and 
the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report
of even date on the standalone financial statements of YES BANK Limited 
for the year ended March 31, 2024
(Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent 
Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of YES BANK Limited on the standalone financial statements 
for the year ended March 31, 2024)
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the 
Standards on Auditing (‘the Standards’), issued by the ICAI 
and deemed to be, prescribed under section 143(10) of the 
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls over financial reporting, both issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements were established and maintained 
and whether such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements

standalone financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls 
with 
Reference 
to 
Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements 
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statement may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the

March 31, 2024
17.1	Background1
YES BANK is a publicly held bank engaged in providing a wide range of banking and financial services. YES BANK is a 
banking company governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The Bank was incorporated as a limited company under 
the Companies Act, 1956 on November 21, 2003. The Bank received the licence to commence banking operations from 
the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on May 24, 2004. Further, YES BANK was included to the Second Schedule of the Reserve 
Bank of India Act, 1934 with effect from August 21, 2004. Also, the Bank has a branch at International Financial Services 
Centre (‘IFSC’) at GIFT City, Gujarat (‘IBU’). The Bank classifies transactions undertaken by IBU as overseas operation. 
The financial accounting system of the Bank is centralized and, therefore, accounting returns are not required to be 
submitted by branches of the Bank.
17.2	Basis of preparation
The standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed under the Third 
Schedule (Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank 
used in the preparation of these financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India 
(Indian GAAP), the guidelines and clarifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, the accounting 
standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 
2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent 
in the banking industry in India. The Bank follows the accrual method of accounting and the historical cost convention, 
unless otherwise stated by RBI guidelines.
17.3	Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered 
while reporting amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements 
and income and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation 
of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The impact of 
any revision in these estimates is recognised prospectively from the period of change.
Significant accounting policies

17.4.11 Employee benefits
Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)1
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares of the 
Bank to its employees. The options granted to employees vest in a graded manner and these may be exercised by the 
employees within specified periods.
Measurement of the employee share-based payment plans is done in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting 
for Employee Share-based Payments issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021. RBI, vide its clarification 
dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant 
should be recognised as an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 2021. 
Accordingly, the Bank changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all 
share-linked instruments granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on 
the date of grant using Black-Scholes model is recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Options granted till March 31, 2021, the Bank measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the 
intrinsic value method. Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying 
stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the 
exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank’s stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day 
preceding the date of grant of stock options.
Compensated absences
The employees of the Bank are entitled to carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilized leave subject to a maximum 
limit. The employees cannot encash unavailed/unutilized leave. The Bank provides for leave encashment / compensated 
absences based on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave utilisation.
Gratuity
The Bank provides for gratuity, for all employees. The Gratuity is payable to an employee as per Payment of Gratuity 
Act. The Bank accounts for the liability for future gratuity benefits using the projected unit credit method based on 
independent actuarial valuation.
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method as per the requirement of AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the determination is based on actuarial calculations, 
which include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or 
loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss account.

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer 
probable that an outflow of resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Bank or 
a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. 
The Bank does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.

Write Down of AT1 Bonds
On March 5, 2020, Central Government in terms of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (“BR Act”) imposed 
moratorium on the Bank. Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 36ACA of the 
BR Act superseded the then Board of Directors and appointed an Administrator to manage the affairs of the Bank 
w.e.f. March 5, 2020. Subsequently on March 13, 2020, through the ‘YES Bank Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020’ 
(“the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme”), the relevant authorities (i.e., Central Government in consultation with RBI) 
decided to “reconstitute” the Bank. Further, in terms of the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme, the Administrator was to 
continue in office until the Board of Directors mentioned in the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme assumed office, i.e., on 
March 26, 2020.
In light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR Act, 
and to protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down (` 84,150 million) two tranches 
of the Additional Tier 1 Bonds (“AT-1 Bonds”) issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual covenants and 
applicable RBI guidelines, on March 14, 2020.
Aggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil suit(s), criminal 
and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 2020. 
The same are pending adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon’ble Bombay High 
Court and one writ petition before the Hon’ble Madras High Court (as mentioned below).
Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“MHC”):
The RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, in so far as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, 
was challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank 
of India and Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon’ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 upheld 
the validity of the RBI Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect of writing down 
of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon’ble MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be written-down before 
the equity shares bear losses and considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in the secondary market, 
they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms and conditions thereof. The Hon’ble MHC also noted the loss absorbency 
feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.
Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court (“BHC”):
Multiple writ petition(s) were filed before the Hon’ble BHC challenging the write down of AT-1 Bonds and the stock 
exchange intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon’ble BHC vide its judgment 
dated January 20, 2023 set aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds 
(“Judgment”). At the request of the Bank, the Hon’ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.
Proceedings before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”):
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the Hon’ble BHC, the Bank, the RBI and the Central Government have filed separate Special 
Leave Petition(s) (“SLPs”) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC. On March 3, 
2023, the Hon’ble Supreme Court issued notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon’ble BHC, subject to the final 
orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are pending hearing.
Given that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central 
Government (“relevant authorities” in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement of 
Hon’ble BHC, the Bank has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under litigation.

Upon final verdict of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, financial impact, if any, on the results and/or other financial information 
shall be accounted for in future reporting periods. The matter is tentatively scheduled for hearing on May 10, 2024.
Separately, Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) issued a Show Cause Notice dated October 28, 2020 to the 
Bank and other noticee(s) (ex-employees of the Bank) alleging violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent 
and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. Thereafter, SEBI vide its order dated April 12, 
2021 imposed penalty of ` 250 million on the Bank under Section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 
1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. SEBI also imposed penalties on other noticee(s). 
Aggrieved by the above-mentioned SEBI order, the Bank and other noticee(s) preferred separate Appeal(s) before the 
Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“SAT”). SAT heard the Appeal(s) and the effect and operation of the SEBI 
order dated April 12, 2021 has been stayed. The said Appeal(s) are pending final hearing.

# Sale of stressed loans to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Private Limited
FY2024
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Bank has transferred two stressed loans of gross value ` 6,903.20 million to 
ARCs. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 1,420.84 
million and the final consideration received was ` 3,364.00 million under “100% upfront cash basis”. The realized profit 
amounting ` 1,943.16 million due to cash recovery exceeding the net book value of stressed loans was credited to Profit 
and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2024.

Reconstruction Private Limited (“JC Flowers ARC”) for a strategic partnership in relation to sale of identified stressed loans 
of the Bank aggregating to up to ` 480,000 million as on March 31, 2022. The Bank had used the bid of JC Flowers ARC as 
a base bid (“Base Bid”) to conduct a transparent bidding process on Swiss Challenge basis under the aegis of the Master 
Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 2021 (‘the Master 
Direction’) for inviting challenger bids for sale of identified stressed loan portfolio. Pursuant to the conclusion of the Swiss 
Challenge process, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at their meeting held on September 20, 2022, approved JC Flowers 
ARC as the winner of the Swiss Challenge process and proceeded towards negotiating definitive agreements.

On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 2022 to 
November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million which included 
exposures worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the 
Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration received was ` 80,458.68 
million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall of 
` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 spread 
equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realised profit amounting 
to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans was credited to Profit 
and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the consideration received was 
higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower than the net book value, such 
excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. The Bank has continued to carry 
forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank has reflected such sale in a manner that 
the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same 
is being assessed for the provisioning requirements as per the extant RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking 
into account the principle that there should be no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts 
vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying exposure, had it stayed in the books.

for the year ended March 31, 2024
Our Business In-Depth
Qualitative disclosures:
a)	
Purpose: The Bank uses Derivatives including Forwards & swaps for various purposes including hedging its currency 
and interest rate risk in its balance sheet, customer offerings and proprietary trading. The management of these 
products and businesses is governed by Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Derivatives Policy, Derivatives 
Appropriateness Policy, Hedging Policy and Asset Liability Management (ALM) policy.
b)	
Structure: The Board of Directors of the Bank have constituted a Board level sub-committee, the Risk Management 
Committee (‘RMC’) and delegated to it all functions and responsibilities relating to the risk management policy of the 
Bank and its supervision thereof.
c)	
As part of prudent business and risk management practice, the Bank has also instituted a comprehensive limit 
and control structure encompassing Value-at-Risk (VAR), Sensitivity, Greeks, Stop loss & credit limits for derivative 
transactions including suitability and appropriateness framework. The Bank has an internal reporting mechanism 
providing regular reports to the RMC as well as to the management of the Bank. Such a structure helps the Bank to 
monitor and mitigate market risk across FX and interest rates.
d)	
The Bank has an independent Middle Office and Market Risk functions, which are responsible for monitoring, 
measurement, and analysis of derivative related risks, among others. The Bank has a Credit Risk Management unit 
which is responsible for setting up counterparty limits and also a treasury operation unit which is responsible for 
managing operational aspects of derivatives including settlement of transactions. The Bank is subject to a concurrent 
audit for all treasury transactions, including derivatives transactions, a monthly report of which is periodically 
submitted to the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Bank.
e)	
In addition to the above, the Bank independently evaluates the potential credit exposure on account of all derivative 
transactions, wherein risk limits are specified separately for each product, in terms of both credit exposure and 
tenor. As mandated by the Credit Policy of the Bank, the Bank has instituted an approval structure for all treasury/
derivative related credit exposures. Wherever necessary, appropriate credit covenants are stipulated as trigger 
events to call for collaterals or terminate transaction and contain the risks.
f)	
The Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts has been notified by the RBI through circular dated March 30, 
2021. The Bank has computed capital adequacy as well as exposure on account of these contracts as per Current 
Exposure method considering each transaction as separate netting set on conservative basis. The Bank shall work 
progressively over the period on classification of multiple permissible transactions into a netting set which may result 
in reduction in capital requirement and exposure due to these transactions. There is no change in Current Exposure 
Method (CEM) computation for Non-Bilateral Counterparties & Quasi Central Counter Party (QCCP) trades.
g)	
The Bank reports all trading positions to the management on a daily basis. The Bank revalues its trading position on a 
daily basis for Management and Information System (‘MIS’) and control purposes and records the same in the books 
of accounts on a monthly basis.
h)	
For derivative contracts in the banking book designated as hedge, the Bank documents at the inception of the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, the risk management objective for 
undertaking the hedge and the ALCO monitors all outstanding hedges on a periodical basis. Further the Bank’s 
‘Hedging Policy’ has stipulated conditions to ensure that the Hedges entered into are effective.

$ On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 2022 to 
November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million which included 
exposures worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the 
Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration received was ` 80,458.68 
million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.
	
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall 
of ` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 
spread equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realized 
profit amounting to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans 
was credited to Profit and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the 
consideration received was higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower 
than the net book value, such excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. 
The Bank has continued to carry forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank 
has reflected such sale in a manner that the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the 
loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same is being assessed for the provisioning requirements as per the extant 
RBI guidelines on each reporting date also taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning 
arbitrage between the provisioning on Security Receipts vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying 
exposure, had it stayed in the books.

*The difference between weighted average number of equity shares outstanding between basic and diluted in the above mentioned 
disclosure is on account of outstanding ESOPs and share warrants convertible into equity shares.
Basic earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing net profit / (loss) for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings per equity 
share has been computed by dividing the net profit / (loss) for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where 
the results are anti-dilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank and 
allotment of share warrants convertible into equity shares. There is no impact of dilution on the profits in the current year 
and previous year.

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2024
The Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked 
instruments granted beginning from April 01, 2021. The Bank has adopted the fair value method based on Black- Scholes 
Pricing Model, for pricing and accounting of options. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the 
grant date and is recognised under employee cost over the vesting period. As a result, ‘Employees cost’ for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 is ` 312.56 million (Previous year: ` 216.26 million). The weighted average fair value of options granted 
during the year ended March 31, 2024 was ` 4.07 per option (Previous year: ` 3.73 per option).
If the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have 
been lower by ` 220.82 million (Previous year: lower by ` 229.19 million). The basic earnings per share would have been 
` 0.43 per share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) instead of ` 0.44 per share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) and diluted 
earnings per share would have been ` 0.42 per share (Previous year: ` 0.26 per share) per share instead of ` 0.43 per 
share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) due to the impact of the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic 
Value of the Options and the Fair Value of the Options.
The following inputs and assumptions have been used for computation of the fair value based on method of Black- 
Scholes Pricing Model for the options granted during the year:
Inputs
For the year ended 
March 31, 2024

Expected dividend yield
1.10%
1.10%
Risk free interest rates over the expected life of the option are based on yield of the government securities in effect at 
the time of the grant. The expected life of an option is estimated based on the vesting period plus expected exercise 
period after vesting based on exercise behaviour of the employees who receive the option. Expected exercise behaviour 
is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise pattern of the Bank. Expected volatility during the estimated 
expected life of the option is based on historical volatility determined based on observed market prices of the Bank’s 
publicly traded equity shares. Expected dividend yield during the estimated expected life of the option are based on 
industry average.

In line with the above, the “Total Rewards Policy” of the Bank has the following objectives:
	
Attracting and retaining top class talent
	
Creating and reinforcing a strong meritocracy-based performance culture
	
Reinforcing employee behaviours aligned with organisational values, which include adherence to the best Governance

performance of Bank, Business Unit and the Individual. The Bank’s Variable Pay Programme rewards employees on 
both short-term and long-term basis. There is a direct correlation between the quantum of Variable Pay payout and 
level of risk exposure and level and role of an employee in the organisation.
4.	
To assess and incorporate the future risk, deferral arrangements have been incorporated for the payout of Variable 
Pay, where a certain proportion of Variable Pay (Cash and Non-Cash) is deferred over a period of time for the 
Senior Executives of the Bank. The Bank assesses through the Business Unit Head/ Risk/ Compliance/ Audit/ Finance 
function for any adverse outcomes in the case of organisational or business unit or individual level prior to the 
payment of the deferred portion.

claw-back arrangements as decided by the Board Remuneration Committee.

period with levels of remuneration.
	
The Bank’s performance management process and compensation philosophies are structured to support the 
achievement of the Bank’s Key Strategic Objectives (KSO) such as Governance Compliance, Liability Generation, Cost 
Management, Customer Service, Strengthening Systems, Controls & Processes and Human Capital Development.

the performance year have a linkage with these KSOs. The targets for these are determined at the Bank, Business Unit

YES BANK LIMITED | INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023-24
Standalone Financial Statements
for the year ended March 31, 2024
Qualitative Disclosure:
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the key reforms adopted by RBI to develop a more resilient banking sector.
LCR indicates the Bank’s ability to meet proportion of the Bank’s liquidity needs under a 30 day stress period as assessed 
based on regulatory guidelines with the High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) maintained by the Bank. As per the regulatory 
guidelines, Banks are required to maintain minimum LCR at 100% i.e., maintain HQLA of a minimum 100% for Net Cash 
Outflows as assessed based on the regulatory guidelines.
The Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the LCR in line with regulatory guidelines and is 
monitored at consolidated level. Further, the Bank also monitors its liquidity requirements in USD.
The Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz. Retail (which include deposits from individuals), 
Small Business Customers (those with deposits up to ` 7.5 crore) and Wholesale Customers to determine the cash 
outflows for LCR. Within Wholesale, deposits on account of Operational activity by the customers through clearing, custody, 
and cash management services of the Bank are classified as Operational Deposits. Non-Operational Deposits from 
wholesale customers are further segregated within Non-Financial Corporates and Others to compute the corresponding 
Cash Outflow for LCR. The Bank also includes other contractual funding including a portion of other liabilities which are 
expected to run down in a 30-day time frame in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on regulatory guidelines, 
are part of the Bank’s LCR framework. Expected derivative cash outflows and inflows from outstanding contracts are 
considered for computation of Net Cash Outflow. The Bank considers the other expected inflows in next 30 days as 
prescribed in the regulatory guidelines to compute the Net Cash Outflows for LCR.
HQLA maintained by the Bank primarily comprises of cash reserves in excess of required CRR, Government Securities 
i.e., Treasury Bills, dated securities issued by the Central & State Government along with eligible Corporate Bonds & 
Commercial Papers that qualify as Level 2 HQLA. Further, securities forming part of HQLA maintained by the Bank is well 
diversified across various marketable instruments, which shall provide the Bank adequate and timely liquidity to meet the 
Net Cash Outflow as & when required.
The Bank endeavors to meet the LCR requirement and adequacy of LCR remains a conscious strategy of the Bank. 
The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of LCR to maintain sufficient liquidity and 
compliance to LCR on an ongoing basis.
The Board of Directors of the Bank has empowered the Asset Liability Management Committee i.e. ALCO (Top 
Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall Board 
approved Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity view 
for the Bank with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the 
Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent 
liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank’s profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with 
the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank 
estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis as 
per ALCO guidance.
The daily average LCR for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 is 116.96% (for the quarter ending March 31, 2023 was 
120.12%), which is well above the prudential requirement of 100%.

Our Business In-Depth
Qualitative Disclosure:
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposed reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity 
regulations with the objective of promoting a more resilient banking sector in the backdrop of global financial crisis in 
2007. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was one of the important reform proposed in order to ensure resilience of the 
Banks over a longer term and stable liabilities to fund their business activities. NSFR was subsequently prescribed by the 
RBI to enhance resilience of the Indian Banking system.
NSFR ensures that the Bank has sufficient stable funding available to fulfill the funding requirements by restricting 
the reliance on unstable short-term funding to finance potentially illiquid long-term assets. NSFR reduces long-term 
refinancing risk over longer-term time horizon (over 1 year) of the Bank by measuring the extent of stable sources of 
funds with the Bank to fund its long term assets.
Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as amount of Available Stable Funding (ASF) to fulfil the amount of Required 
Stable Funding (RSF).
	
Available Stable Funding (ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over 1 year 
period. The amount of available stable funding is a function of the source and type of liability along with residual 
maturities of the various liabilities.
	
Required Stable Funding (RSF) is defined as the funding required for assets and off-balance sheet exposures over 
1 year period. The amount of required stable funding is a function of the underlying liquidity characteristics and 
residual maturities of the various assets.
NSFR was implemented w.e.f. October 01, 2021 by the RBI with stipulation of minimum NSFR maintenance at 100%.
The Bank has implemented robust process to compute and report the NSFR in line with regulatory guidelines and is 
monitored at consolidated level. The Bank endeavors to meet the NSFR requirement and adequacy of NSFR remains 
a conscious strategy of the Bank. The Bank has placed stringent threshold as risk appetite for maintenance of NSFR to 
maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance to NSFR on an ongoing basis.
The Board of Directors of the Bank have empowered Asset Liability Management Committee i.e. ALCO (Top Management 
Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank within overall Board approved 
Strategic and Risk framework. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity view for the Bank 
with the help of the economic analysis. ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target 
good quality asset and liability profile to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity 
of sources and servicing costs and meet the Bank’s profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust 
MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank. BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity 
requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis as per ALCO guidance.
NSFR as at March 31, 2024 is 122.68% (as at March 31, 2023 was 109.95%), which is well above the minimum regulatory 
requirement of 100%.

17.5.68 Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure of Bank’s Customer
The Bank has in place a policy on managing credit risk arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposures of its 
borrowers. The objective of this policy is to maximize the hedging on foreign currency exposures of borrowers by 
reviewing their foreign currency product portfolio and encouraging them to hedge the unhedged portion. In line with the 
policy, assessment of unhedged foreign currency exposure is a part of assessment of borrowers and is undertaken while 
proposing limits or at the review stage. Additionally, at the time of sanctioning limits for all clients, the Bank stipulates a 
limit on the unhedged foreign currency exposure of the client (as a % of total foreign currency exposure sanctioned by the 
Bank) after considering factors such as internal rating of the borrower, size, possibility of natural hedging, sophistication 
of borrower and maturity of borrower’s financial systems, relative size of unhedged foreign currency exposure with 
respect to total borrowings of the client, etc. Further, the Bank reviews the unhedged foreign currency exposure across 
its portfolio on a periodic basis. The Bank also maintains incremental provision and capital towards the unhedged foreign 
currency exposures of its borrowers in line with the extant RBI guidelines.
The Bank has maintained provision of ` 856.64 million (Previous year of ` 912.37 million) and additional capital of ` 3,022.42 
million (Previous year of ` 2,876.74 million) on account of Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure of its borrowers as at 
March 31, 2024.

Contingent 
Liabilities
Brief
1.
Claims against 
the Bank not 
acknowledged as 
debts
The Bank is a party to various legal and tax proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank does 
not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial 
conditions, results of operations or cash flows.
2.
Liability on 
account of 
forward exchange 
and derivative 
contracts.
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, currency 
swaps and interest rate swaps with interbank participants and customers. Forward exchange contracts are 
commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. Currency swaps are 
commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/principal in one currency against another, based on 
predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash 
flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments of such foreign exchange contracts and derivatives 
provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily 
indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, 
do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable 
(assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms. 
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to 
which instruments are favorable or unfavorable and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial 
assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Members of
YES BANK Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of YES BANK Limited (hereinafter referred to

Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred 
to as ‘the Group’), which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Consolidated 
Profit and Loss Account and the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the 
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of 
the significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Consolidated 
Financial Statements’).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of report of the other auditor on 
separate financial statements and on the other financial 
information of the subsidiary, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the 
section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well 
as the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) and circulars and 
guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, in the 
manner so required for banking companies and give a true 
and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, read 
with Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021 as 
amended to the extent applicable, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2024, and its 
consolidated profit, and its consolidated cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (‘SAs’) specified under Section 143 (10) of 
the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further 
described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our 
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements under the provisions of 
the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current year. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report:

Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit 
procedures in respect of asset classification and provisioning 
pertaining to investments and advances. In particular:

Key Audit Matters
Auditor’s Response
As required under prudential norms issued by the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) in respect of asset classification and 
provisioning pertaining to investments as well as those 
pertaining to advances, and relevant circulars, notifications 
and directives issued by the RBI which were collectively 
considered by the Bank till March 31, 2024, classifies 
advances into performing and non-performing advances 
(NPA) which consists of Standard, Sub-standard, Doubtful 
and Loss and makes appropriate provisions.
The Bank, as per its governing framework, made the 
performing and non-performing advances provisions 
based on Management’s assessment of the degree 
of impairment of the advances subject to and guided 
by minimum provisioning levels prescribed under 
RBI guidelines.
The Classification, Provisioning and Write off of Advances 
including Investments is a Key Audit Matter as the Bank 
has significant credit risk exposure to a large number of 
borrowers across various sectors, products, industries 
and geographies and there is a high degree of complexity, 
uncertainty and judgment involved in recoverability 
of advances, nature of transactions and estimation of 
provisions thereon and identification of accounts to 
be written off.
	
Tested key IT systems/ applications used and their 
design and implementation as well as operational 
effectiveness of relevant controls, in relation to asset 
classification viz., standard, sub-standard, doubtful 
and loss with reference to their days-past-due (DPD) 
status (including consideration of non-financial 
parameters of NPA, including sufficiency of credits 
in working capital loans, restructuring guidelines, the 
Regulatory Package and Resolution framework) and 
provisioning pertaining to investments and advances;
	
Test checked advances to examine the validity of the 
recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined 
the statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, 
impairment provision for non-performing assets, 
and compliance with income recognition, asset 
classification and provisioning pertaining to advances 
in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;
	
Tested, selected restructured accounts on sample 
basis and their compliance with relevant RBI guidelines; 
	
For the selected non-performing advances, we 
assessed Management’s forecast and inputs of 
recoverable cash flows, borrower’s audited financial 
statements, valuation of underlying security and 
collaterals, estimation of recoverable amounts on 
default and other sources of repayment;
	
Tested the Bank’s processes for making provision on 
advances for compliance with RBI regulations and 
internally laid down policies for provisioning;
	
Undertaken the walkthrough for the automated E-NPA 
system and tested the core functionality for selected 
samples considering the audit universe.
	
Validated the parameters used to calculate collective 
provisions with reference to IRAC norms, and 
Regulatory Package;
	
Tested provision created for fraud accounts as at 
March 31, 2024 as per the RBI circular;
	
Re-performed, for a sample of retail and corporate 
portfolios, as part of our substantive audit procedures 
the calculation of provisions, to determine the 
accuracy of the same; (Collective for standard portfolio 
and case specific for non performing portfolio)
	
Assessed the adequacy of disclosures against the 
RBI Guidelines

Auditor’s Response
IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting
The Bank’s key financial accounting and reporting 
processes are highly dependent on Core Banking and 
Treasury Solutions and other supporting software and 
hardware controls. The volume of transactions processed 
and recorded is huge and hence the IT controls are 
required to ensure that applications process data as 
expected and that changes are made in an appropriate 
manner. The Bank’s IT control framework includes 
automated, 
semi-automated 
and 
manual 
controls 
designed to address identified risks. IT controls are 
stated in Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls 
(ITGC) and IT Application Controls (ITAC). Such controls 
contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data.
We have identified IT Controls Framework as a Key Audit 
Matter as the Bank’s business is highly dependent on 
technology. The IT environment is complex and the design 
and operating effectiveness of IT controls have a direct 
impact on its financial reporting process.  Such controls 
provide assurance on the integrity and completeness of 
data processed through various IT applications which are 
used for the preparation of financial reports.
	
We have planned, designed and carried out the 
desired audit procedures and sample checks, taking 
into consideration the IT systems of the Bank. 
As part of our IT controls testing, we have tested 
ITGC as well as ITAC for selected critical applications. 
The focus of testing of ITGCs was based on the 
various parameters such as Completeness, Validity, 
Identification/ Authentication, Authorization, Integrity 
and Accountability. On the other hand, focus of 
testing automated controls from applications was 
whether the controls prevent or detect unauthorized 
transactions 
and 
support 
financial 
objectives 
including completeness, accuracy, authorization and 
validity of transactions. The procedures adopted by us 
are, in our opinion, adequate to provide reasonable 
assurance on the adequacy of IT controls in place. 
The areas for improvement as and when noticed are 
communicated for suitable actions to the Bank as part 
of our audit. The corrective steps / alternate controls 
deployed by the Bank are tested on sample basis. 
	
In ITGC testing, on sample basis, we reviewed 
control areas such as User Management, Change 
Management, Systems Security, Cyber Security, 
Interface Testing, deployment of new applications, 
Incident Management, Physical & Environmental 
Security, Creation and maintenance of edit logs, 
Backup 
and 
Restoration, 
Business 
Continuity 
and Disaster Recovery, Service Level Agreement. 
	
For 
ITAC, 
we 
carried 
out 
on 
sample 
basis, 
compliance tests of system functionality in order 
to assess the accuracy of system calculations. 
We also carried out procedures such as validations 
and limit checks on data entered into applications, 
approvals, 
process 
dependencies, 
restriction 
on time period in which transactions may be 
recorded and GL mapping for financial accounting. 
	
Tested the control environment using various 
techniques 
such 
as 
inquiry, 
walkthroughs 
in 
live environment, testing in UAT environment, 
review 
of 
documentation 
/ 
record 
/ 
reports, 
observation 
and 
re-performance.
	
Wherever deviations were noted either the same 
were explained to our satisfaction or we tested 
compensating controls and performed alternate 
procedures, where necessary, to draw comfort.
	
In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted 
by internal audit department, and also the testing 
of Internal Financial Control conducted by the 
Operational Risk Management department of the Bank.

any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the Other 
Information identified above when it becomes available 
and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information 
is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the other information, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged 
with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged 
with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a 
true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, 
consolidated financial performance and consolidated 
cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the 
Act read with Companies (Accounting Standard) Rules 2021, 
as amended to the extent applicable, provisions of Section 
29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars 
and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from 
time to time, as applicable to the Bank. The respective 
Board of Directors of the Company included in the Group 
are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and 
the RBI Guidelines, for safeguarding of the assets of the 
Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of

The respective Board of Directors of the Company included 
in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit 
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
471

Financial Statements

fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Bank has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements made by the Management and 
Board of Directors.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Director’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and 
content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including 
the 
disclosures, 
and 
whether 
the 
consolidated financial statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
	
Obtain 
sufficient 
appropriate 
audit 
evidence 
regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements 
of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have 
been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audits carried out by them. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
Our responsibilities in this regard are further 
described in para (a) of the section titled ‘Other 
Matters’ in this audit report.
	
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us 
along with the consideration of audit reports of the 
other auditors referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of 
the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Bank and such other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of

assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements of the Bank and its subsidiary company, which 
are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note and the Standards on Auditing (‘the Standards’),

subsidiary company, in terms of his report referred to 
in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A Bank's internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial 
statement 
includes 
those 
policies 
and 
procedures that
1)	
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the Bank;
2)	
provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being 
made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the Bank; and
3)	
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls 
with 
reference 
to 
consolidated 
financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statement may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the 
Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements in so far as it relates to one subsidiary 
company, is based on the corresponding report of the 
auditor of this company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

the prices published by FBIL. Further, in the case of unquoted bonds, debentures, PTCs (other than priority sector) 
and preference shares, valuation is carried out by applying an appropriate mark-up (reflecting associated credit risk) 
over the Yield to Maturity (‘YTM’) rates of government securities. Such mark up and YTM rates applied are as per the 
relevant rates published by FIMMDA/FBIL.
	
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government dated securities in accordance with RBI 
guidelines. The short position is reflected as the amount received on sale which is categorized under HFT category

category are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV) shown by the AIF/VCF as per the financial statements. The VCF/AIF are 
valued based on the audited financial statements once in a year. In case the audited financials are not available for 
a period beyond 18 months, the investments are valued at ` 1 per VCF/AIF.
	
Quoted equity shares are valued at their closing price on a recognised stock exchange. Unquoted equity shares

book value (NBV) at the time of transfer, the shortfall is debited to the Profit and Loss Account and spread equally 
over the financial year. The realised profit, where the cash recovery exceeds the NBV of the stressed loans, the same 
is credited to Profit and Loss Account. For stressed loans where the consideration received was higher than the 
NBV at the time of transfer but the cash recovery is lower than the NBV, such excess amount is not reversed in the 
Profit and Loss Account and the Bank continues to carry forward the same as provision against the Security Receipts 
(SRs). In effect, the value of SRs is reflected in a manner that the value of SRs is not higher than the NBV of the loans 
transferred to ARC. The provisioning requirements is as per the extant RBI guidelines applied on each reporting 
date, taking into account the principle that there should be no provisioning arbitrage between the provisioning on 
security receipts vis-à-vis the provisioning requirements on the underlying stressed loans, had it stayed in the books.

employees within specified periods.
Measurement of the employee share-based payment plans is done in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting 
for Employee Share-based Payments issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and SEBI (Share Based 
Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021. RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines 
on Compensation of Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, 
advised banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant should be recognised as an expense for 
all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Bank changed its accounting 
policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments granted after March 31, 
2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes model is 
recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Options granted till March 31, 2021, the Bank measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the 
intrinsic value method. Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying 
stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the 
exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank’s stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day 
preceding the date of grant of stock options.
YSIL measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Compensation cost 
in case of YSIL is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair value of underlying YSIL shares as on issue date over the 
exercise price. The fair value of the stock-based compensation in case of YSIL is estimated on the date of grant using 
discounted cashflow method and expensed over the vesting period

Act. The Group accounts for the liability for future gratuity benefits using the projected unit credit method based on 
independent actuarial valuation.
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method as per the requirement of Accounting Standard-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the determination is based on 
actuarial calculations, which include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and interest

of timing differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating 
loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax 
rates at the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the profit 
and loss account.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in 
future. Deferred tax assets in case of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognised only if there is virtual certainty that 
such deferred tax asset can be realised against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognised and reassessed 
at each balance sheet date based upon management’s judgement and appropriately adjusted to reflect the amount that 
is reasonably certain to be realised.
17.5.14 Provisions and contingent assets/liabilities

# Sale of stressed loans to JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Private Limited
FY2024
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Bank has transferred two stressed loans of gross value ` 6,903.20 million to 
ARCs. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 1,420.84 
million and the final consideration received was ` 3,364.00 million under “100% upfront cash basis”. The realised profit 
amounting ` 1,943.16 million due to cash recovery exceeding the net book value of stressed loans was credited to Profit 
and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2024.
FY2023
In the previous year, on July 13, 2022, the Bank had signed a binding term sheet with JCF ARC LLC and JC Flowers Asset 
Reconstruction Private Limited (“JC Flowers ARC”) for a strategic partnership in relation to sale of identified stressed loans 
of the Bank aggregating to up to ` 480,000 million as on March 31, 2022. The Bank had used the bid of JC Flowers ARC as 
a base bid (“Base Bid”) to conduct a transparent bidding process on Swiss Challenge basis under the aegis of the Master 
Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 2021 (‘the Master 
Direction’) for inviting challenger bids for sale of identified stressed loan portfolio. Pursuant to the conclusion of the Swiss 
Challenge process, the Board of Directors of the Bank, at their meeting held on September 20, 2022, approved JC Flowers 
ARC as the winner of the Swiss Challenge process and proceeded towards negotiating definitive agreements.
On December 16, 2022, the Bank concluded the aforesaid assignment after adjusting recoveries between April 1, 2022 to 
November 30, 2022. The gross value of exposures transferred to JC Flowers ARC was ` 437,157.89 million which included 
exposures worth ` 151,980.93 million earlier written-off by the Bank. The net book value (‘NBV’) of these exposures in the 
Bank’s books as on the date of assignment was ` 49,817.57 million and the final consideration received was ` 80,458.68 
million under 15:85 cash and security receipts structure.
For stressed loans transferred to ARC for a consideration lower than the NBV at the time of transfer, the shortfall of 
` 6,086.09 million to the Bank was debited to the Profit and Loss Account during the year ended March 31, 2023 spread 
equally over the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The realised profit amounting 
to ` 5,113.81 million where the cash recovery was exceeding the net book value of stressed loans was credited to Profit 
and Loss Account in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For stressed loans where the consideration received was 
higher than that net book value at the time of transfer and the cash recovery is lower than the net book value, such 
excess amount of ` 31,613.38 million was not reversed in the Profit and Loss Account. The Bank has continued to carry 
forward the same as provision against these security receipts. In effect the Bank has reflected such sale in a manner that 
the value of security receipts is not higher than the net book value of the loans transferred to JC Flowers ARC. The same

The difference between weighted average number of equity shares outstanding between basic and diluted in the above 
mentioned disclosure is on account of outstanding ESOPs and share warrants convertible into equity shares.
Basic earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders 
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings per equity share has been 
computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number 
of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares options outstanding during the year, except where the results are 
anti-dilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank and allotment of share 
warrants convertible into equity shares. There is no impact of dilution on the profits in the current year and previous year.

The Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked 
instruments granted beginning from April 01, 2021. The Bank has adopted the fair value method based on Black- Scholes 
Pricing Model, for pricing and accounting of options. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the 
grant date and is recognised under employee cost over the vesting period. As a result, ‘Employees cost’ for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 is ` 312.56 million (Previous year: ` 216.26 million). The weighted average fair value of options granted 
during the year ended March 31, 2024 was ` 4.07 per option (Previous year: ` 3.73 per option).
If the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have 
been lower by ` 220.82 million (Previous year: lower by ` 229.19 million). The basic earnings per share would have been 
` 0.43 per share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) instead of ` 0.44 per share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) and diluted 
earnings per share would have been ` 0.42 per share (Previous year: ` 0.26 per share) per share instead of ` 0.43 per 
share (Previous year: ` 0.27 per share) due to the impact of the aforesaid mentioned difference between the Intrinsic 
Value of the Options and the Fair Value of the Options.
The following inputs and assumptions have been used for computation of the fair value based on method of Black- 
Scholes Pricing Model for the options granted during the year:

Risk free interest rates over the expected life of the option are based on yield of the government securities in effect at 
the time of the grant. The expected life of an option is estimated based on the vesting period plus expected exercise 
period after vesting based on exercise behaviour of the employees who receive the option. Expected exercise behaviour 
is estimated based on the historical stock option exercise pattern of the Bank. Expected volatility during the estimated 
expected life of the option is based on historical volatility determined based on observed market prices of the Bank’s 
publicly traded equity shares. Expected dividend yield during the estimated expected life of the option are based on 
industry average.

Write Down of AT1 Bonds
On March 5, 2020, Central Government in terms of Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (“BR Act”) imposed 
moratorium on the Bank. Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 36ACA of the 
BR Act superseded the then Board of Directors and appointed an Administrator to manage the affairs of the Bank 
w.e.f. March 5, 2020. Subsequently on March 13, 2020, through the ‘YES BANK Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020’ 
(“the YES BANK Reconstruction Scheme”), the relevant authorities (i.e., Central Government in consultation with RBI) 
decided to “reconstitute” the Bank. Further, in terms of the Yes BANK Reconstruction Scheme, the Administrator was to 
continue in office until the Board of Directors mentioned in the YES BANK Reconstruction Scheme assumed office, i.e., on 
March 26, 2020.
In light of the above, the Administrator, on behalf of the Bank, consequent to the invocation of Section 45 of the BR Act, 
and to protect the interest of the Bank and its depositors, was constrained to write down (` 84,150 million) two tranches 
of the Additional Tier 1 Bonds (“AT-1 Bonds”) issued in 2016 and 2017, in compliance with the contractual covenants and 
applicable RBI guidelines, on March 14, 2020.
Aggrieved by the said write down of AT-1 Bonds, AT-1 Bondholders filed various writ petition(s), civil suit(s), criminal 
and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds since 2020. 
The same are pending adjudication, save and except the batch of writ petition(s) filed before the Hon’ble Bombay High 
Court and one writ petition before the Hon’ble Madras High Court (as mentioned below).
Judgment dated September 30, 2020 of the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“MHC”):
The RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations, in so far as it relates to issuance and write down of AT-1 Bonds, 
was challenged before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble MHC in the Writ Petition titled Piyush Bokaria Vs. Reserve Bank 
of India and Ors., (being W.P. (Civil) 12586 of 2020). The Hon’ble MHC vide its judgment dated September 30, 2020 upheld 
the validity of the RBI Master Circular in relation to the AT-1 Bonds. Additionally, with respect to the aspect of writing down 
of AT-1 Bonds, the Hon’ble MHC observed that one of the features of AT-1 Bonds is that they can be written-down before 
the equity shares bear losses and considering that the Petitioners purchased the AT -1 Bonds in the secondary market, 
they cannot claim to be ignorant of the terms and conditions thereof. The Hon’ble MHC also noted the loss absorbency 
feature of the AT-1 Bonds and dismissed the Writ Petition.
Judgment dated January 20, 2023 of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court (“BHC”):
Multiple writ petition(s) were filed before the Hon’ble BHC challenging the write down of AT-1 Bonds and the stock 
exchange intimation dated March 14, 2020 made in relation to the write down. The Hon’ble BHC vide its judgment 
dated January 20, 2023 set aside the stock exchange intimation and decision of the Bank to write down the AT-1 Bonds 
(“Judgment”). At the request of the Bank, the Hon’ble BHC stayed the order for a period of 6 (six) weeks.

Proceedings before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“Supreme Court”):
Aggrieved by the Judgment of the Hon’ble BHC, the Bank, the RBI and the Central Government have filed separate Special 
Leave Petition(s) (“SLPs”) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court challenging the Judgement of the Hon’ble BHC. On March 3, 
2023, the Hon’ble Supreme Court issued notice and extended the stay granted by the Hon’ble BHC, subject to the final 
orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The SLPs are pending hearing.
Given that the write down of the AT-1 Bonds was in accordance with the relevant regulations and as RBI and Central 
Government (“relevant authorities” in terms of the RBI Master Circular) have also filed SLPs challenging the Judgement of 
Hon’ble BHC, the Bank has estimated that there should not be any material financial impact of the matter under litigation. 
Upon final verdict of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, financial impact, if any, on the results and/or other financial information 
shall be accounted for in future reporting periods. The matter is tentatively scheduled for hearing on May 10, 2024.
Separately, Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) issued a Show Cause Notice dated October 28, 2020 to the 
Bank and other noticee(s) (ex-employees of the Bank) alleging violation of provisions of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent 
and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. Thereafter, SEBI vide its order dated April 12, 
2021 imposed penalty of ` 250 million on the Bank under Section 15 HA of Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 
1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. SEBI also imposed penalties on other noticee(s). 
Aggrieved by the above-mentioned SEBI order, the Bank and other noticee(s) preferred separate Appeal(s) before the 
Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai (“SAT”). SAT heard the Appeal(s) and the effect and operation of the SEBI 
order dated April 12, 2021 has been stayed. The said Appeal(s) are pending final hearing.

17.6.22 Description of contingent liabilities
Sr. 
No.
Contingent Liabilities
Brief
1.
Claims against the Group 
not acknowledged as debts
The Group is a party to various legal and tax proceedings in the normal course of business. The 
Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.
2.
Liability on account of 
forward exchange and 
derivative contracts.
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps with interbank participants and customers. Forward 
exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the 
contracted rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/
principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps 
are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts 
of financial instruments of such foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for 
comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the 
amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, 
do not indicate the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices 
relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial 
instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are favorable or unfavorable and, thus the 
aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.
3.
Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, endorsements 
and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on 
behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing 
of the customers of the Bank. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the 
Bank will make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance 
obligations.
4.
Other items for which the 
Group is contingently liable
Purchase of securities pending settlement, capital commitments, amount deposited with RBI under 
Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), bill re-discounting, Foreign Exchange Contracts (Tom 
& Spot), Custodian operations, undrawn partial credit enhancement facilities, When Issued (WI)

Principle 2: Impact and Target Setting
We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative 
impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and environment resulting from 
our activities, products and services. To this end, we will set and publish targets 
where we can have the most significant impacts.
2.1	 Impact Analysis (Key Step 1)
Show that your bank has performed an impact analysis of its portfolio/s to identify its most significant impact 
areas and determine priority areas for target-setting. The impact analysis shall be updated regularly1 and fulfil the 
following requirements/elements (a-d)2:
a)	
Scope: What is the scope of your bank’s impact analysis? Please describe which parts of the bank’s core 
business areas, products/services across the main geographies that the bank operates in (as described 
under 1.1) have been considered in the impact analysis. Please also describe which areas have not yet been 
included, and why.
In FY2021-22, In line with PRB requirement YES BANK used UNEP FI PRB 
Portfolio Impact  Assessment tool v2, (published on July 16, 2021) to assess 
its entire lending (Corporate, Retail and MSME) portfolio & all Retail product 
suite(as of December 31, 2021) and identified the sub-portfolio’s positive and 
negative impact areas.
The scope for the impact assessment, segment wise is provided below:
	y
Scope for Corporate Banking (constituting 42.6% of total advances): 91% of 
corporate banking advances were included (due to limitation in the tool to 
30 ISIC sectors)
	y
Scope for MSME- (constituting 23.7% of advances): 99% of MSME advances 
(due to limitation in the tool to 30 ISIC sectors)
	y
Scope for Consumer Banking: All consumer banking product suite included 
liabilitites (CASA, FD, other services) and assets (Home loans, Vehicle Loans 
etc). (Retail assets constituted 33.7% of total advances)

b)	
Portfolio composition: Has your bank considered the composition of its portfolio (in %) in the analysis? 
Please provide proportional composition of your portfolio globally and per geographical scope
i)	
by sectors & industries3 for business, corporate and investment banking portfolios (i.e. sector exposure 
or industry breakdown in %), and/or 
ii)	
by products & services and by types of customers for consumer and retail banking portfolios. If your 
bank has taken another approach to determine the bank’s scale of exposure, please elaborate, to show how 
you have considered where the bank’s core business/major activities lie in terms of industries or sectors.
1That means that where the initial impact analysis has been carried out in a previous period, the information should be updated 
accordingly, the scope expanded as well as the quality of the impact analysis improved over time.
2Further guidance can be found in the Interactive Guidance on impact analysis and target setting.
3‘Key sectors’ relative to different impact areas, i.e. those sectors whose positive and negative impacts are particularly strong, are 
particularly relevant here.

Context: What are the main challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the main 
countries/regions in which your bank and/or your clients operate?4 Please describe how these have been 
considered, including what stakeholders you have engaged to help inform this element of the impact analysis. 
	
This step aims to put your bank’s portfolio impacts into the context of society’s needs.
Based on these first 3 elements of an impact analysis, what positive and negative impact areas has your 
bank identified? Which (at least two) significant impact areas did you prioritise to pursue your target setting strategy 
(see 2.2)5? Please disclose.
For the impact assessment, the bank has considered composition of its portfolio. 
The Bank had to take an extensive exercise of mapping the International 
Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) and Basic Statistical Return (BSR) codes, 
and then, preparing the portfolio for the assessment using the tool.
The Bank discloses composition of its portfolio sector & industry wise in its 
BASEL disclosures (regulatory disclosure) and Investor Presentations.

Targets: 
 Page 149
To understand and take into account India’s environmental, social, and economic context, in which the bank operates, bank 
has utilized the tool to identify the level of need at national level, with regards to 22 impact categories. Climate Change, 
Inclusive Healthy economies, Biodiversity, Air, Water and Economic Convergence were assessed to be amongst most 
significant impact areas where India’s country needs are high.
Considering the scope, scale of exposure, context and relevance, the most 
significant impact area are the following:
	y
Climate Change (Negative)
	y
Inclusive and Healthy Economy (Positive and Negative)
	y
Biodiversity (Negative)
	y
Economic Convergence (Positive)
The Bank has identified and prioritised Climate Change and Financial 
Inclusion as significant areas, to pursue focussed approach driven by specific, 
measurable, actionable, relevant and time bound targets, in consultation with 
top management.
4Global priorities might alternatively be considered for banks with highly diversified and international portfolios.
5To prioritise the areas of most significant impact, a qualitative overlay to the quantitative analysis as described in a), b) and c) will be 
important, e.g. through stakeholder engagement and further geographic contextualisation.

d)	
For these (min. two prioritised impact areas): Performance measurement: Has your bank identified 
which sectors & industries as well as types of customers financed or invested in are causing the strongest 
actual positive or negative impacts? Please describe how you assessed the performance of these, using 
appropriate indicators related to significant impact areas that apply to your bank’s context. 
In determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant impact, you should consider 
the bank’s current performance levels, i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the 
social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products 
and services. If you have identified climate and/or financial health&inclusion as your most significant impact 
areas, please also refer to the applicable indicators in the Annex. 
If your bank has taken another approach to assess the intensity of impact resulting from the bank’s activities 
and provision of products and services, please describe this. 
The outcome of this step will then also provide the baseline (incl. indicators) you can use for setting targets in two areas of 
most significant impact.
Climate Change: While, climate change cuts across the portfolio as a significant 
impact area, Bank has identified climate sensitive sectors and is taking a sectoral 
approach to measure financed emission of its carbon intensive sectors. As a 
starting point, the Bank has specifically focussed on its energy exposure, as 
the sector is at the center stage for the climate action globally. The Bank has 
analyzed the financed emission intensity in energy sector and developed 
internal targets to reduce the sectoral emission intensity, in line with global 
de-carbonisation pathways.
Bank has also taken cognizance of the positive impact opportunities arising out 
of low carbon transition and is focussing on its portfolio in Renewable energy 
and Electric Vehicle.
YES BANK has adopted a proactive approach to address environmental and 
social impacts that could result from its lending activities. Towards this, the Bank 
has instituted an Environment and Social Risk Management System (ESMS) to 
assess and mitigate environment and social (E&S) risks of its financing activities, 
centered around its Environment and Social Policy.
Financial Inclusion: Bank has a significant Retail portfolio because of which 
financial inclusion is emerging as a significant impact area. YES BANK has 
been employing three pronged approach to address the challenge of financial 
inclusion in Indian Context:
	y
Credit led approach- YES BANK is working towards increasing credit access 
to women to reduce the gender inequality and to contribute significantly 
towards strengthening women entrepreneurship and empowerment
	y
Remittances led approach- YES BANK is one of the pioneer banks which 
started domestic money transfer under its flagship programme YES Money. 
YES Money has developed a unique platform to meet the remittance

of the Principles. This includes information about
•	 which committee has responsibility over the sustainability strategy as well as targets approval and monitoring 
(including information about the highest level of governance the PRB is subjected to),

The Bank is reviewing its ESG,Climate and Sustainable Development 
strategy at the Board level with following governance structure:
Board Level Committee: In FY 2021-22, the Bank strengthened its ESG 
governance by constituting a Board level, Corporate Social Responsibility and 
Environmental Social & Governance Committee to oversee the Sustainability 
Council (Management level committee) and guide the Bank’s overall ESG agenda 
(which includes UNEP FI's Responsible Banking principles).
Management Level Committee: The Bank has constituted an Executive 
level Sustainability Council chaired by the MD & CEO which oversees the 
implementation of the Bank’s sustainability agenda, sets long, medium & 
short-term sustainability targets and evaluates the Bank’s ESG performance 
(which includes UNEP FI's Responsible Banking principles Impact assessment 
and target setting approach and approval). The CFO, which is the highest 
management-level executive (Head of the Sustainable Finance & Reporting 
team at the bank) is also entrusted as the custodian of implementation of the 
Bank’s Climate Strategy and reports directly into the MD & CEO. The CFO is 
responsible for implementation of UNEP FI's Responsible Banking principles 
and managing day-to-day issues regarding ESG.
Remuneration linked to KPI: The performance review process has been 
aligned further with the Bank’s priorities. As Environment, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) is an important element of our strategy, domain-specific ESG KPIs have 
been identified and integrated in to the Top Management’s goals and is being 
cascaded further to the direct reportees of top management.
