10.	 Health and safety management system:
	
1.	
Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the Entity? (Yes/No). If yes, the 
coverage of such system?
	
	
Yes, the Company has an Integrated Management Systems for Quality (ISO 9001), Occupational Health & Safety (ISO 
45001) and Environment (ISO 14001). EHS Management System defines the mandatory requirements for the systematic 
management and execution within the organisation. The Company’s Integrated EHS Management System is accredited by 
international certification body TUV Nord.
	
2.	
What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the 
Entity?
	
	
For every routine and non-routine activity occurring at the projects, Risk assessment in the form of HIRAC (Hazard 
Identification, risk assessment and control measures) and EAI (Environmental aspects and impacts) is prepared elaborating 
the control measures adopted for identified potential risks during the execution of the activity. Also, HCC has undertaken 
the Proactive Safety Observation Programme (PSOP). The PSOP programme analyses the causes of possible accidents, 
near-misses, unsafe conditions and unsafe acts. Each of these causes is systematically reported and pre-emptive actions 
are taken to mitigate the chances of an accident. Going one step further, the Company has added a new dimension to 
its safety programme by introducing the Behaviour-based Safety Programme. Behaviour-based Safety (BBS) emphasizes 
that employees need to take ownership of their own behaviour. If they behave in an unsafe manner, they are repeatedly 
made to correct themselves. Both safe and unsafe behaviours are recorded and displayed as learning opportunities. BBS 
emphasises that unsafe conditions are created by unsafe behaviours. The purpose of BBS is to identify both safe and 
at-risk behaviours, identify possibilities for injury, communicate the risk and help identify safer solutions. A BBS steering 
committee monitors its progress. The feedback process reinforces the use of safe behaviours and helps the Company 
to determine why certain at-risk behaviours were carried out. Collecting information about at-risk behaviour helps 
management determine the root cause of such behaviour and helps in developing an action plan to remove the mental 
barrier causing this behaviour.
	
3.	
Whether you have processes for Workers to report work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
	
	
Yes, the Company has processes for Workers to report work related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.
	
4.	
Do the Employees/Workers of the Entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the Entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
	
As a part of the EHS Management system, a project specific EHS plan is prepared at the inception of every new project that 
determines the broad parameters of EHS management. This EHS plan identifies the hazardous operations and the risks arising 
from such hazards which are within the scope of the work. It even specifies the required integrated preventive measures 
(Controls) to mitigate the same. The Company has undertaken several initiatives over the years to improve safety performance, 
including mandatory induction and training programmes, toolbox talks, demonstration of usages of personal protective 
equipment etc. Besides these initiatives, HCC has undertaken the Proactive Safety Observation Programme (PSOP) and 
Behaviour-based Safety (BBS) programme which has brought about a paradigm shift in the way safety is observed at all project 
sites.

The Company’s EHS Council undertakes a review of all accidents and incidents, and formulate procedures based on risk analysis 
of data gathered through various assessment tools. This data is used for predictive analysis, measurement of incidents and 
unsafe behaviours. This enables identification of the key areas of risk which in turn guides the projects to proactively manage 
and focus resources to prevent any accidents or incidents. Such analysis is shared throughout the organisation, to support 
HCC’s ZERO HARM objective.

Essential Indicators
1.	
Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the Entity.
	
HCC has systematically identified, prioritised, and engaged with a diverse set of stakeholders considering the present and 
potential impacts of its business on them and vice versa. In line with its business models, the Company has identified the 
following as key stakeholder groups:
80
Stakeholders 
Basis of Identification 
Customers / Clients
Government owned enterprises (central and state) contribute to majority of the Company’s current 
orderbook, hence they are the largest clients for the business. In addition to providing the business, 
they also determine policies for various areas as well as determine the plans for various sectors.
Suppliers / Subcontractors
EPC have significant dependence on supply chain partners for sourcing of key raw materials e.g., 
cement, aggregates, steel and other materials for construction projects and outsourcing activities 
such as low-end civil works in construction projects. To maintain sustainable growth, these partners 
are key elements in meeting the delivery and cost objectives for various contracts.
Employees and workforce
Construction is a labour-intensive activity, and HCC employs large number of workers in addition 
to its own employees. Hence, their skills development, health and well-being are important for the 
Company’s ongoing and future operations.
Investors and 
Shareholders
Investors and shareholders make an important contribution to the growth of the Company by
