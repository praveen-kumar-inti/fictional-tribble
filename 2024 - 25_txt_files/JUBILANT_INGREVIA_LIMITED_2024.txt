1
GHG 
Emissions 
and Energy 
Management
Risk & 
Opportunity
Significant Scope 1 emissions arise 
from direct fossil fuel use (e.g., 
coal, FO, LSHS), exposing the 
company to carbon pricing, regulatory 
tightening, and climate transition 
risks. Additionally, Scope 3 emissions, 
primarily from purchased goods, capital 
goods, and energy-related activities, 
are substantial. These emissions 
are under increasing scrutiny from 
downstream customers and ESG 
rating agencies, creating risk exposure 
across the entire value chain.
On the other hand, there is a strategic 
opportunity in shifting to green supply 
chains and investing in low-carbon 
product innovations, such as green 
chemistry-based offerings. This 
approach not only helps mitigate 
environmental risks but also enables 
the company to meet evolving 
customer demands and strengthen its 
competitive position in a transitioning 
market.
We have implemented an internal 
carbon price of US$12 per ton CO2 
to drive emission reductions and 
invest in cleaner energy.
The Company is diversifying its 
energy mix by adopting renewable 
sources (solar, biogas, biomass) and 
integrating biomass as a fuel (with 
two facilities already 100% biomass-
powered).
We also employ waste heat recovery 
and set annual GHG reduction 
targets to monitor progress. We are 
aligning ourselves with SBTi-target 
setting also to stay aligned with our 
goals and strategizing to reduce our 
scope 3 emissions. 
Negative
2
Health & 
Safety
Risk
Operating as a chemical manufacturing 
business involves inherent health and 
safety risks. Past incidents, including 
a fatality and other injuries, highlight 
the need for stringent safety processes 
and systems. Ensuring the well-being 
of employees, contractors, and the 
community is critical, as any major 
accident could damage our reputation 
and disrupt operations. 
Any major accident could not 
only damage our reputation and 
disrupt operations but also trigger 
compensation payouts as part of our 
commitment to supporting affected 
individuals. In the event of a fatality 
or critical accident, Jubilant follows 
a structured compensation process, 
including compensation for the 
victim’s family and medical expenses, 
in accordance with labor laws and 
insurance policies. This could involve 
financial settlements, medical and 
reimbursements.
We have enforced a rigorous safety 
management through regular 
workplace inspections, equipment 
checks, and comprehensive process 
risk assessments (HAZOP, LOPA, 
JSA, FMEA).
Multi-level safety meetings (site, 
department, and corporate) and 
periodic external audits/gap analyses 
drive continuous improvement in our 
safety performance.
We also conduct extensive safety 
training, promote behavior-based 
safety, and implement Process Safety 
Management to foster a strong safety 
culture and protect our people and 
assets.

3
Water 
Management
Risk
Our operations are heavily dependent 
on water, and some manufacturing 
sites (like Gajraula) are in water-
stressed regions, where water 
inavailability poses a direct risk to our 
operations and the nearby community. 
In an era of climate change-driven 
water scarcity, excessive water use 
or pollution poses significant risks to 
local communities and can result in 
regulatory penalties and community 
backlash. Past incidents (legal actions, 
fines, and mandated remediation 
related to water pollution and 
groundwater extraction) underscore 
the need for robust water management 
and compliance.
We regularly assess water-related 
risks at all sites using tools (e.g., 
WWF Water Risk Filter, WRI 
Aqueduct) to identify areas of high 
water stress.
We have maximized water recycling 
and reuse, and most facilities 
achieved zero liquid discharge, 
and any treated effluent (such as at 
Bharuch and Savli) is discharged 
in compliance with regulatory 
standards, with quality parameters 
(BOD, COD, TSS, etc.) closely 
monitored internally and by third 
parties.
We also engage in water 
replenishment initiatives – such as 
rainwater harvesting and rejuvenating 
community water bodies (e.g., 
adopting 195 ponds around Gajraula) 
– to enhance groundwater recharge 
and ensure sustainable water 
availability. The Company has set 
ambitious water conservation targets 
aligned with the SDGs and national 
commitments (INDCs) to drive 
continual improvement.
Negative
4
Product 
Safety 
(Consumer 
& End-User 
Safety)
Risk
As a supplier to pharmaceutical, 
agrochemical, nutrition, consumer 
product, and industrial markets, 
product safety and responsible 
sourcing are paramount. Any lapse 
in ensuring safe products could harm 
end-user health, violate regulations, 
and damage our reputation. It is 
therefore essential to meet stringent 
customer safety standards and align 
our sourcing with ESG expectations.
We enforce strict product quality 
and safety standards. Robust 
quality control systems are in place, 
aligned with applicable standards 
such as FDA and REACH. We work 
closely with suppliers to uphold 
ESG criteria across the value 
chain. The Company conducts Life 
Cycle Assessments (LCA) and 
Product Carbon Footprinting for key 
products to proactively identify and 
address environmental and safety 
risks. Our product stewardship 
practices and supplier policies 
are regularly updated in line with 
evolving regulations and customer 
expectations to ensure continued 
compliance and consumer safety.

5
Waste 
Management
Risk
Our operations generate substantial 
hazardous and non-hazardous 
waste. Without proper reduction 
and management, this waste can 
contaminate water, air, and soil 
(through chemical leaching), posing 
environmental and health risks 
to employees and neighboring 
communities. Inadequate waste 
management also increases the risk of 
regulatory violations, leading to severe 
fines and penalties.
Jubilant Ingrevia emphasizes waste 
minimization and a circular economy 
approach in its operations.
Hazardous waste is recycled or 
recovered where feasible (including 
co-processing in cement kilns) 
and otherwise disposed of safely 
via secure landfills or controlled 
incineration. Non-hazardous waste 
(e.g., fly ash, metal scrap, plastic, 
paper, wood) is sent to authorized 
recyclers or reused by third parties. 
We also reduce packaging waste by 
shipping products in bulk and reusing 
containers like drums and carboys to 
curtail single-use materials.
Additionally, we convert waste into 
resources: our effluent treatment 
processes generate biogas (~9,464 
m³) used as fuel on-site, and 
we recover valuable chemicals 
from waste streams (conserving 
approximately 1,169 MT of glacial 
acetic acid by reusing dilute acetic 
acid).
Negative
6
Compliance 
Management 
(Legal & 
Regulatory)
Risk
In a highly regulated industry, any 
failure to comply with laws and 
standards could adversely affect 
our financial results and operations. 
Frequent regulatory changes or stricter 
enforcement can raise costs and delay 
product launches. Non-compliance 
risks legal penalties and reputational 
damage, and may erode customer trust 
– especially as key clients demand 
strong ESG adherence from suppliers. 
Past fines for regulatory lapses 
underscore the importance of stringent 
compliance.
We have established a robust 
Compliance Management System 
to monitor and ensure adherence to 
all applicable laws and regulations. 
We conduct regular training and 
awareness programs for relevant 
personnel to keep them updated on 
new or changing requirements. This 
proactive approach and strong ethical 
governance help prevent violations 
and maintain stakeholder confidence.
Negative 
7
Business 
Ethics
Risk
Ethical lapses or non-compliance with 
evolving regulations (such as anti-
corruption or tax laws) pose serious 
legal and financial risks in our industry. 
Failing to uphold high ethical standards 
can lead to sanctions, financial losses, 
and severe reputational damage, 
undermining stakeholder trust and 
long-term business continuity.
Jubilant Ingrevia has embedded 
strong ethical governance and a 
robust compliance framework across 
its operations. We reinforce integrity 
and transparency through a strict 
Code of Conduct, regular ethics and 
compliance training, and dedicated 
policies (e.g., Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment, human rights) to ensure 
accountability. These measures 
help prevent misconduct, ensure 
legal compliance, and strengthen 
stakeholder confidence in the 
Company.

Air Pollution
Risk
Although our processes are not major 
emitters, but we operate in areas with 
poor ambient air quality. Any significant 
increase in air emissions could trigger 
regulatory action or fines, disrupt 
operations, and pose health hazards to 
employees and local communities.
We control emissions through 
advanced equipment such 
as electrostatic precipitators, 
scrubbers, and thermal oxidizers, 
with continuous monitoring and 
periodic third-party testing to ensure 
regulatory compliance. Preventive 
maintenance is conducted regularly, 
and ozone-depleting substances 
are being phased out, with minimal 
CFC-11 equivalent usage in cooling 
systems.
Negative

Human 
Capital 
Development
Opportunity
A skilled and knowledgeable workforce 
is crucial for achieving operational 
excellence and advancing our ESG 
objectives. By investing in employee 
development and ESG awareness, 
we can boost productivity, foster 
innovation, and better adapt to industry 
changes. Human capital development 
is therefore seen as an opportunity 
to enhance overall performance and 
maintain a competitive edge.
We invest in continuous learning 
and skill development through 
a comprehensive Learning 
Management System (LMS) that 
provides employees with access to 
a wide range of training programs 
and resources. The Company also 
partners with reputable external 
institutions to offer specialized 
training in technical, managerial, and 
ESG topics. Ongoing upskilling and 
leadership development ensure our 
human capital is prepared to meet

women in our workforce to 6.5%. We will continue to work towards creating a more inclusive workplace for all employees.

coverage such system?
	
	
Yes. Presence of a well-equipped Occupational Health Centre at every manufacturing facility to deal with any occupational 	
health emergency with qualified doctors and paramedical staff, running comprehensive health assessment programs. Covered 
sites are - Gajraula Manufacturing Facility, Bharuch Manufacturing Facility, Nira Manufacturing Facility, Savli Manufacturing 
Facility, Ambernath Manufacturing Facility
	
b.	 What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
	
	
The Company has established a comprehensive Risk Management framework that plays a critical role in preventing incidents, 
occupational illnesses, and injuries, while also ensuring emergency preparedness and business continuity. Given the inherent 
risks associated with its operations and the handling of hazardous chemicals, all sites have implemented a structured approach 
to Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Management. This approach integrates both qualitative and quantitative 
methodologies and is subject to regular review, with specific mitigation strategies developed for high-risk areas. The process 
clearly outlines roles and responsibilities, incorporates mechanisms for monitoring control measures, and emphasizes 
competency development through training and awareness programs for all personnel involved in high-risk activities. Formal 
training in risk assessment has been conducted where relevant. For all operational activities—routine, non-routine, or 
project-based—hazards are identified by trained cross-functional teams. Risk assessments are conducted using tools such 
as Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and adherence to Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), which are mandatory to consult prior to the commencement of any task. The Company has instituted

detailed procedures for process and functional safety, including the application of methodologies such as Safety Integrity 
Level (SIL) assessments. Identified hazards and associated risks are managed through operational controls guided by the 
hierarchy of controls principle. Advanced techniques such as What-If Analysis, and Failure are deployed based on specific 
case requirements. To ensure accountability, all safety observations and hazards are logged into ‘Sanchetna’, our digital 
CAPA platform. Meanwhile, incidents—whether minor or major—are captured and investigated through Incident Reporting and 
Investigation System (IRIS), using robust root-cause tools like 5WHY and Fishbone analysis. Key process hazards, such as the 
storage and handling of toxic chemicals like ammonia and chlorine, as well as flammable substances such as fuel, have been 
specifically addressed through Quantitative Risk Assessments (QRA), HAZOP studies, and engineering reviews, conducted with 
support from both internal and external subject matter experts. QRA, HAZOP, IHRA, What-if Analysis, HIRA, JSA, Safety Audit,

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
	
Following are the summary of key measures taken by the entity to ensure safe and healthy work place:
	
Jubilant Ingrevia has adopted a comprehensive and system-driven approach to workplace safety, anchored in its Occupational 
Health & Safety (OHS) policy aligned with ISO 45001 standards and global best practices. The Company ensures coverage of all 
employees, contractors, and visitors under its safety management systems, supported by a trained OHS team, regular audits, and 
third-party inspections.
Leadership accountability is embedded through weekly Board updates and monthly reviews by the Sustainability Committee. In 2024, the 
Company launched Project Apollo, a safety transformation program focused on workplace safety, process safety, digitalization, and safety 
culture enhancement.
Proactive safety is driven through rigorous risk assessments (e.g., HAZOP, LOPA, JSA), daily briefings, toolbox talks, safety committees, 
behavior-based safety programs, and real-time hazard reporting via digital platforms like Sanchetna and IRIS. Formal training programs, 
including over 2.5 lakh safety training hours in the year, are conducted regularly for all personnel.
Dedicated process safety systems, contractor safety supervision, permit ownership decentralization, and community emergency 
preparedness programs further ensure a culture of zero harm. A strict hierarchy of controls and CAPA tracking ensures timely mitigation of 
risks, making safety a business-wide priority embedded across operations.

agenda to reinforce commitment and transparency.
	» Monthly Safety Theme Program – Each month, a focused safety theme is launched to promote targeted awareness, training, and 
engagement on specific risk areas relevant to site operations.
	» Legal compliances – We strictly adhere to all applicable health, safety, and environmental regulations, ensuring full legal compliance 
through periodic reviews and updates.
	» Safety Improvement Plan – A dynamic, data-driven Safety Improvement Plan is maintained to track action points, monitor progress, and 
achieve measurable improvements in workplace safety.
	» Process Safety Management Implementation – PSM principles are embedded in high-risk operations to manage hazardous processes 
systematically, prevent incidents, and safeguard people and assets.

All employees of these locations, who have access to operating sites, are also covered under these OHS management systems 
which is audited periodically. All visitors coming to the sites are also briefed about basic safety, before entering the premises. The 
Company is implementing a comprehensive safety management system under the guidance of well renowned safety consulting 
organisation. Any OHS (Occupational Health & Safety) risks a rise from assessments of health and safety practices and working 
conditions are immediately addressed by the site OHS management team through necessary corrective & preventive measures. 
The same is reviewed by both site management and corporate management from time to time. For our suppliers (including contract 
manufacturers), the Company has established and communicated a ‘Green Supply Chain’ policy expecting our suppliers to provide 
safe & healthy working conditions and decent labour practices while doing business. The Company also conducts critical suppliers 
(including contract manufacturers) EHS/ Sustainability audits from time to time and provides their observations/recommendations to 
suppliers’ management.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.
	
Yes. Jubilant Ingrevia has implemented Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) across the majority of its manufacturing facilities:
	
»	
Most of the manufacturing sites (3 out of 5) operate under a ZLD model, where effluent is fully treated and recycled enabling 
reuse of process and utility water, significantly reducing freshwater consumption 
	
»	
All plants are equipped with state-of-the-art Effluent Treatment Plants (ETP), followed by technologies like Reverse Osmosis 
(RO) to achieve zero discharge, with treated water reused internally 
	
»	
Continuous improvement initiatives including the adoption of rainwater harvesting, process modifications, and innovative 
technologies ensure sustained ZLD performance and year-over-year reductions in freshwater usage per unit production

10. 	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to 
reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Jubilant Ingrevia adopts a structured Reduce–Reuse–Recycle (3R) strategy to manage waste responsibly and minimize the use of 
hazardous chemicals across its operations.
	
Reduce: The company minimizes packaging waste by dispatching products in bulk and through tankers, reducing dependence on 
single-use plastic. It actively avoids littering and promotes resource efficiency at every stage of operations.
	
Reuse: Materials such as drums and carboys are reused wherever feasible. Non-hazardous waste - such as fly ash, metal scrap, 
plastic, paper, and wood are reused by authorized third parties, in alignment with circular economy principles.
	
Recycle: Hazardous waste is managed using a combination of recycling, co-processing in cement kilns, secured landfilling, and 
incineration, as per regulatory norms and the nature of waste generated at different sites.
	
To further reduce environmental impact, the company continuously works on improving process efficiency, adopting safer 
alternatives, and reducing the use of toxic or hazardous chemicals in its products and operations. These actions reflect Jubilant 
Ingrevia’s commitment to sustainable manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and environmental stewardship.

Management’s Responsibilities 
6. The Holding Company’s management is responsible for selecting or establishing suitable criteria for 
preparing the Identified Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if 
any, related to reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information, identification of key aspects, 
engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes design, implementation and 
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation of the BRSR and the measurement of Identified 
Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Inherent limitations 
 
7. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-
financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques and can 
affect comparability between entities.  
Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control 
8. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of International Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (‘IESBA’), 
which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. 
9. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, “Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements” which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management 
including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards 
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
Practitioner’s Responsibility  
10. Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance in the form of an opinion on the Identified 
Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.

Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000 (Revised)’) issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (‘IAASB’). This standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.  
11. A reasonable assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Holding 
Company’s use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, 
assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud 
or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.  
12. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods 
and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. 
13. Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
a. Performed walkthrough and discussion with individual data owners for understanding business 
processes and data management processes at manufacturing facilities at Gajraula in Uttar 
Pradesh.  
b. Visited the corporate office at Noida for data and document verification;
