(Indicate 
positive or 
negative 
implications)
1.
Emissions
Risk
Increased carbon footprint 
contributes to climate risk.
Climate change-induced 
instability will have a direct 
consequence for vital 
Company infrastructure, 
as well as secondary 
repercussions on 
economic capabilities.
Failure to adopt appropriate 
countermeasures to reduce 
the carbon intensity of the 
business can impact brand 
reputation & stakeholder 
confidence.
Emission reduction 
initiatives for 
identified areas of 
higher emissions.
Exploring options to 
move to low-carbon 
fuels that have lesser 
emissions such as 
biodiesel, natural 
gas, Compressed 
Biogas (CBG), etc.
Impact on 
Company’s 
reputation and 
brand value.
2.
Energy
Risk, 
Opportunity
Risk: LMW’s business 
activities are primarily 
the manufacturing of 
various machinery tools 
and equipment. This is an 
energy intensive process, 
which could lead to a 
lack of optimisation of 
direct as well as indirect 
energy consumption and 
continued reliance on fossil 
fuel-based energy sources.
Opportunity: Having 
already achieved a 
significant reliance 
on renewable energy, 
the Company remains 
committed to maintaining 
and strengthening this 
focus while continuously 
seeking opportunities 
to improve energy 
consumption efficiency.
The company has 
set an internal target 
to offset 100% of 
energy consumption 
with renewable 
energy.
The Company has 
a 15 MW Solar 
Power Generation 
Plant and has 
also installed 28 
windmills with a 
total capacity of 
36.80 MW. This 
has helped offset 
the emissions 
generated by energy 
consumption from 
conventional non-
renewable sources.
As a measure of 
energy efficiency 
across divisions, 
sodium vapour lights 
are being replaced 
with LED.
Reduction in 
energy and 
environmental 
costs.
Increased 
operational 
efficiency.
Improved 
equipment 
lifespan.

Waste 
Management
Risk

equipment leads to the 
generation of a significant 
amount of waste across 
all divisions. The waste 
generated is both 
hazardous (metal scraps, 
paints, etc.) as well as non-
hazardous (paper, wood, 
etc.).
Lack of waste management 
and waste re-utilization 
could lead to operational 
inefficiency and hinder 
product manufacturing.
Waste in the form 
of metal chips is 
used as raw material 
for the Foundry 
division. Hazardous 
waste generated 
during operations 
is disposed through 
authorized vendors.
Legal fines.
4.
Efficient 
Resource 
Utilization
Opportunity

minimising the negative 
impact of operations on 
the environment and 
utilizing natural resources in 
an efficient and sustainable 
manner can improve 
operational efficiency and 
attract environmentally 
conscious customers.

in revenue 
share from 
environment 
conscious 
customers.
Scope to

Occupational 
Health & 
Safety
Opportunity
The company’s ability 
to provide a work 
environment free of 
injuries, fatalities, and 
illness, and promote better 
health and wellbeing of 
employees results in better 
productivity and boosts 
employee morale.
-
Reduced 
cost of talent 
acquisition.
6.

Response:
	
Since its inception, the Company has maintained a strong and early commitment to environmental well-being, 
proactively integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its operations well before 
they gained widespread recognition.
	
The Company is actively implementing measures aimed at reducing absolute carbon emissions across its 
facilities. This reduction is being achieved through various initiatives focused on enhancing operational efficiency, 
expanding renewable energy generation and procurement, and transitioning to cleaner fuels.
	
Its business offerings encompass a comprehensive range of energy-efficient and environment-friendly products 
and solutions. These offerings enable industries to optimise energy consumption, decrease greenhouse gas 
emissions, and minimise freshwater intake through water reuse and recycling technologies.
	
Recognising the evolving energy landscape and its potential to contribute to this shift, the Company has 
strategically focused its efforts on green energy solutions. Its strategies are proactively aligned with broader 
climate change mitigation and sustainability objectives. To strengthen its clean energy offerings and solidify 
its position as a trusted energy transition partner for its customers, the Company is investing in research and 
development, enhancing its digital capabilities, and forging partnerships with other technology companies.
	
On the social front, the Company is actively involved in initiatives aimed at fostering equal opportunities through 
education and empowering the informal workforce through dedicated programmes.
	
The Company acknowledges the significant challenges inherent in meeting its ESG imperatives. These include 
navigating the complexities of existing industrial infrastructure and facilitating their transition to cleaner, more 
sustainable alternatives; managing the cost implications of implementing technological innovations; assessing 
and mitigating the sustainability practices and associated environmental and social risks within its supply chain; 
and ensuring robust data collection and reporting on ESG performance metrics across the organisation.
	
Despite these challenges, the Company remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing them through 
continuous innovation, strategic partnerships, proactive stakeholder engagement, and the ongoing improvement 
of its ESG practices. The Company recognises the progress it has made and is dedicated to pursuing further 
advancements in its sustainability journey.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
Response: The Company’s focus lies in reducing net emissions by tracking overall energy consumption and 
we have internally set a target to 100% offset the energy consumption with renewable energy. The scope 1 
emissions account for around 62% of overall emissions. Diesel and LPG account for the majority of scope 1 
emissions (53% and 28% respectively). Therefore, the Company is exploring options to move to low-carbon 
fuels which have lesser emissions. These include the use of biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), instead of 
diesel in generators, switching to electric heaters from LPG in canteens etc. CNG is cost-effective and a better 
alternative for Acetylene used in the foundry division.
	
The Company’s scope 2 emission accounts for 38% of overall emissions, most of which were offset by the 
wind and solar power generating facilities installed by the Company. The Company has a 15 MW Solar Power 
Generation Plant and has also installed 28 windmills with a total capacity of 36.80 MW. This has helped offset 
the emissions generated by energy consumption from conventional non-renewable sources.
	
The Company is continuously developing and modifying processes to minimize the use of energy and fossil 
fuels. To reduce the emissions from non-renewable sources, the Company is replacing sodium vapour lights with 
LED. The Company has also reduced emissions caused by refrigerant through better refrigerant management 
leading to lower emissions. Along with this, the Company is switching to energy efficiency compressors.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the 
practices adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Response: Various measures are taken by the Company to handle waste at its facilities, namely:
	
Zero Liquid Discharge: The Company has installed a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) along with RO plants and a 
Zero Liquid Discharge mechanism at its plants.
	
Hazardous waste: The hazardous waste generated during operations is disposed through authorized vendors 
who have the necessary certification/licenses to handle such waste.
	
E-Waste: The Company disposes of outdated servers, monitors, computers, and other e-waste generated in its 
operations through e-waste management vendors approved by the government.
	
Production/Other waste: The Company also has a well-established waste recycling system which helps it to 
reuse more than 10% of production waste generated. The cast iron and mild steel waste generated from the 
manufacturing process is recycled entirely in an in-house foundry. This is achieved by initially briquetting and 
shredding of waste before melting. The Company’s sand reclamation facility recycles waste sand from foundry 
processes. Other waste such as plastic, office waste, packaging, and paper is given to vendors for recycling. 
Food waste from cafeterias is given to vendors to use as animal feed and manure in nearby farmlands. The 
Company has disposed of old batteries through authorised vendors for recycling.

Management Responsibilities 
The 
Company's 
Management 
is 
responsible 
for 
identification of key aspects, content and presentation 
of the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report 
in accordance with the Criteria mentioned above. This 
responsibility includes the design, implementation 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to 
the preparation of the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report and measurement of BRSR Core 
Matrices which are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control
We are independent from the entity in accordance 
with the requirements of independence and quality 
assurance set out in BRSR provisions and professional 
pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional 
professional obligations in accordance with these 
requirements.
Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption 
that the data and information provided by the Company 
to us as part of our review have been provided in good 
faith and free from material misstatements.
We were not involved in the preparation of any 
statements or data included in the Report except for 
Assurance Statement. Our firm applies International 
Standard on Quality Management and accordingly 
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control 
including 
documented 
policies 
and 
procedures 
regarding 
compliance 
with 
ethical 
requirements, 
professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. We apply SQC 1 for quality control in 
assurance and related services.
Reasonable Assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement includes identifying 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the 
Identified Sustainability Information, whether due to 
LMW LIMITED
034
fraud or error, and responding to the assessed risks as 
required by the circumstances.
As part of our assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team 
of sustainability and assurance specialists reviewed the 
disclosures presented within the Report and referenced 
information, and sampled the disclosures and were 
reviewed through the LMW’s customised sustainability 
information management system.
The procedures conducted were based on professional 
judgement and included inquiries, observation of 
processes 
performed, 
inspection 
of 
documents, 
evaluation of quantification methods and reporting 
policies, 
analytical 
procedures, 
and 
reconciliation 
with underlying records. Given the circumstances 
of the engagement, in executing the procedures 
outlined above, we:
• 	
Obtained an understanding of the identified 
sustainability information and related disclosures.
•	
Acquired knowledge of the assessment criteria 
and assessed their adequacy for evaluating and/or 
measuring the identified sustainability information.
•	
Conducted inquiries with Company’s management, 
including the environment team, compliance 
team, human resources team, and other relevant 
personnel responsible for preparing the Report.
•	
Developed an understanding and performed an 
evaluation of the design of key systems, processes, 
and controls for recording, processing, and 
reporting the identified sustainability information at 
the corporate office and other locations.
•	
Based on our understanding and the potential risks of 
material misstatement in the identified sustainability 
information, we determined the nature, timing, and 
extent of further procedures.
•	
We tested the Company's process for compiling 
sustainability 
information 
by 
comparing 
or 
reconciling it with the underlying records.
•	
We verified the consolidation of data from various 
plants and offices on a sample basis within the 
reporting boundary to ensure the completeness of 
the reported data.
We believe that the evidence we have gathered is both 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
reasonable assurance opinion.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance 
conclusion on the identified sustainability indicators, 
based on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our 
engagement in accordance with the International 
Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 
3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement 
as agreed with the Company. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether, in all material 
respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance 
with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, 
and extent of the procedures selected depend on our 
judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Reasonable Assurance Opinion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Company's 
identified sustainability criteria as per BRSR core 
framework for the financial year ended 31st March 2025 
are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations

records, data, and explanations provided to us by the 
Company for the purpose of our review. The assurance 
scope excludes:

•	
Mapping of the Report with reporting frameworks

Criteria above.
•

the 
effectiveness 
of 
management’s internal controls when determining

assurance engagement was not designed to provide 
assurance on internal controls.

The procedures did not include testing controls 
or performing procedures relating to checking 
aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.
