Statement by director responsible for the 
business responsibility report, highlighting 
ESG related challenges, targets and 
achievements (listed entity has flexibility 
regarding the placement of this disclosure)
At Affle, we recognize the importance of integrating 
sustainability across our organization. We continue 
to benchmark our governance, ESG practices and 
financial reporting with industry leading standards. 
Our proactive adoption of ESG in FY2020-21 and 
perpetual initiatives towards enabling a sustainable 
well-governed ecosystem reinforces our commitment 
towards inclusive value creation for the stakeholders 
and the society at large.
Affle being in the mobile advertising technology 
business, is significantly less resource intensive in 
terms of environmental impact or related material 
inputs. However, as a responsible Company, we resolve 
to accelerate the evolution of ESG to make a positive 
impact on people and the planet. We are committed 
to make conscious efforts towards managing energy, 
water and waste more efficiently. Recently, we revised 
our e-waste strategy as part of our waste management 
approach, with the aim of minimizing waste and its 
environmental impact. Our revised policy will reduce 
e-waste through donating used laptops/hardware to 
charitable organizations in working condition, aligned 
to the 3R (Reduce, Recycle and Reuse) principle of 
waste management. This shall also contribute to the 
digital inclusiveness and academic well-being of the 
communities around us.
During the year FY2024, we continued our efforts of
