Corporate Overview
6.
Performance of the Company against 
the specific commitments, goals and 
targets along with reasons, in case 
the same are not met. 
a.	
To support biodiversity and carbon sequestration, the Company has reserved 
7 acres of land at its Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar facility and 1 acre at its Kothur 
facility for afforestation and greenbelt development. This initiative involves the 
plantation of approximately 21,500 trees in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and 
15,000 trees in Hyderabad.
	
As of the reporting period, the Company has successfully planted:
	
•	
16,000 trees at the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar facility
	
•	
12,850 trees at the Kothur facility
	
These plantations utilise a combination of traditional methods and the 
Miyawaki afforestation technique, which encourages dense, multi-layered, 
and self-sustaining forests. With an expected annual growth rate of 1 metre, 
the plantations are projected to become self-sustainable within two years of 
plantation, contributing to long-term ecological restoration and improved air 
quality around the facilities.
b.	
In line with its commitment to reduce direct emissions, the Company has added 
21 Electric Vehicles (EVs) to its operational fleet over the past three financial 
years:
	
•	
6 EVs in 2022–23
	
•	
10 EVs in 2023–24
	
•	
5 EVs in 2024-25
	
The Company is committed to continuing this transition and plans to expand the 
EV fleet further based on operational requirements, reinforcing its support for 
clean mobility and energy-efficient logistics.
c.	
The Company continues to strengthen its commitment to clean energy by 
operating a 1 MW solar power plant at its Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar facility. This 
installation plays a key role in reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources 
and supports the Company’s long-term sustainability goals. While there was 
no capacity expansion during the current reporting year, the Company remains 
focused on increasing the share of renewable electricity in its overall energy mix. 
Plans for future enhancement to 3 MW remain under consideration and will be 
pursued in alignment with operational and regulatory readiness.
Governance, leadership and oversight 
7.
Statement by Director, responsible for the Business Responsibility Report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets 
and achievements 
Our journey toward sustainable growth is guided by a deep commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
principles. In an increasingly complex global environment—marked by climate risks, stakeholder scrutiny, and the evolving 
regulatory landscape—we recognise that building a future-ready business requires a holistic approach to sustainability.
As part of our ongoing efforts to address climate change and reduce our carbon footprint, we have undertaken a series 
of initiatives focused on clean energy, afforestation, and green mobility. Our 1 MW solar power plant at the Chhatrapati 
Sambhajinagar facility continues to make a significant impact, while there was no expansion in renewable capacity this year, 
we remain committed to enhancing our clean energy share in the future. In afforestation, we have initiated a large-scale 
greenbelt programme covering 8 acres (7 acres in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and 1 acre in Kothur) using both traditional and 
Miyawaki plantation methods. So far, over 28,800 trees have been planted. These plantations are designed to grow rapidly, 
become self-sustaining within two years of plantation, and contribute meaningfully to biodiversity and carbon absorption. 
To further support our decarbonisation goals, we added 21 electric vehicles to our fleet over the past three years. We will 
continue to assess opportunities to expand this fleet based on operational requirements.
A significant milestone this year was the completion of our new expansion facility at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, which has 
been awarded the LEED Gold certification. This achievement reflects our commitment to sustainable infrastructure and green 
building practices.
Our broader commitment to sustainability also includes continuous investment in employee health, safety, and well-being. 
We are proud to report zero workplace injuries during the reporting year, supported by robust training and safety protocols. 
Our people remain at the core of our success, and we are focused on fostering an inclusive and secure work environment.

Our manufacturing facilities have an effective zero liquid discharge mechanism. We have installed Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) at both locations to treat sewage and canteen wastewater. The Kothur Plant has an STP capacity of 40 KLD, the Macharam 
Plant has an STP of 50 KLD and the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Plant has a capacity of 50 KLD.
	
The treated water from these plants is utilised for on-site gardening, promoting a sustainable approach to water management. 
Additionally, the sludge generated undergoes is carefully digested in a controlled wetland area in the STP. The dried sludge is 
used as fertiliser, reducing waste while promoting eco-friendly practices.

Does the Company have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details. 
	
The Company has installed 1MW solar plant at its Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar plant, resulting in reduction of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions of over 1162 MT of CO2 equivalent from electricity consumption. The Company has undertaken afforestation 
on 7 acres at its Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar plant and 1 acre at its Kothur Plant, this project entails plantation of about 21,500 
trees at the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Facility and about 15,000 trees at the Kothur Facility, which will help enhance the overall 
air quality, mitigate GHG emissions, regulate temperature and create a better environment in its surroundings. The Company has 
started replacing conventional vehicles with electric vehicles, contributing to reducing GHG emissions

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes. 
	
As part of our commitment to building a sustainable ecosystem, we actively implement the 3R principles- Reduce, Reuse, 
and Recycle - across our operations. At our manufacturing facilities, waste is categorised into hazardous and non-hazardous 
categories. Non-hazardous waste is further categorised as recyclable or non-recyclable. We manage waste in compliance with 
the OCP for Material Handling, with recyclable waste handled by state-authorised vendors who have been certified by the 
pollution control board. Battery recycling is facilitated by returning the batteries to the suppliers, whilst e-waste is processed by 
state authorised recyclers. This necessitates a constant emphasis on three essential areas: Minimising energy use,  Recycling 
solid and liquid waste , Recovering reusable carbide, oils, and lubricants.
11.	 If the Company has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries,
