Our business model is built on sustainability, aimed at 
fostering financial, social, and digital inclusion for Indians. 
Through our extensive network of outlets, we are advancing 
financial, digital, and social inclusion in rural India. Every 
aspect of our business and the products and services we 
offer are designed with sustainability in mind.
Our Kendra outlets serve as one-stop shops, delivering 
essential services to rural citizens, including banking 
services, ATMs, healthcare, and online shopping.
Our capital expenditure primarily supports the acquisition of 
environmentally friendly ATM machines. These machines 
are paperless, with transaction acknowledgments sent 
via SMS, in line with our ‘Go Green’ initiatives. We are 
committed to minimizing paper usage through prevention, 
reduction, recycling, and reuse to mitigate environmental 
impacts.
To further enhance our environmental efforts, we are 
integrating energy efficiencies into our facilities by 
increasing the use of renewable energy sources, such as 
solar power. Currently, 13% of our energy consumption 
comes from solar power. We are also working on 
expanding our use of renewable energy through power 
purchase agreements with private renewable energy 
suppliers.
Our commitment to green infrastructure includes adopting 
cleaner technologies, green IT practices, and IT-enabled 
operational efficiencies. We also emphasize sustainable 
procurement through our Green Procurement Policy, 
prioritizing EPEAT-certified products to support our energy 
and carbon management goals.

Use of Renewable energy
As part of our commitment to sustainability, we are actively

emphasis on enhancing the utilisation of renewable energy 
sources in our overall energy consumption. In our offices, 
we have taken significant steps towards sustainability. 
We have implemented solar power systems, reducing 
our dependence on traditional electricity sources. Our 
workplace design incorporates glass walls, allowing ample 
sunlight to illuminate the premises and minimizing the need 
for artificial lighting. Furthermore, we have installed energy-
efficient LED lighting to promote responsible electricity 
consumption. These initiatives at both our Kendras 
and workplaces reflect our commitment to sustainable 
practices, demonstrating our dedication to environmental 
responsibility and creating an eco-friendlier future.
