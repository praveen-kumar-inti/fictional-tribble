Business Responsibility 
and Sustainability Report
CEO STATEMENT
I am pleased to announce the release of Hindustan Zinc’s 
3rd Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, 
demonstrating our steadfast commitment to Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Throughout our 
journey, we have recognised sustainability’s pivotal role 
as a cornerstone of our mission. Over the years, we’ve 
established a tradition of driving impactful change within 
our industry and the communities we operate in. Our long-
standing determination to progressively work towards the 
betterment of society and the planet remains unwavering as 
we persist in our efforts to advance our sustainability and 
social progress. In alignment with the evolving landscape, 
we are actively pursuing initiatives geared towards fostering 
sustainable and resilient business growth for the long-term.
Our dedication to safety is evident in achieving zero fatalities 
across our operations during the year, underscoring our 
robust safety culture and adherence to rigorous standards 
such as Critical Risk Management (CRM). This commitment 
to safety has been acknowledged with the prestigious 
British Safety Council International Safety Awards.
Hindustan Zinc’s sustainability efforts have garnered 
international acclaim, with our Company ranking first in 
the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment and 
achieving A- ratings for CDP ‘Climate Change’ and ‘Water’ in 
the metal and mining sector.
To ensure comprehensive ESG coverage, we have 
established a structured three-tier framework for 
sustainability governance. This framework guides our 
strategic goals, emphasising energy efficiency, carbon 
footprint reduction, effective water management, 
biodiversity conservation, and fostering an inclusive work 
environment.
In alignment with our long-term vision, we are actively 
transitioning to a low-carbon economy, with a target of 
achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050. Our initiatives 
include the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs), zero 
liquid discharge plants, renewable energy investments, 
and proactive water management strategies.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives 
are aligned with global Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), focussing on education, livelihoods, 
environmental conservation, and community 
engagement. Noteworthy projects include Sakhi 
programme aimed at empowering women, support for 
farmer producer organisations (FPOs), and initiatives like 
Zinc Football Academy promoting sports.
Diversity and inclusivity are integral to our ethos, as 
demonstrated by initiatives like India’s first all-women 
underground mine rescue team and progressive 
parenthood policies. We extend our commitment to 
sustainability across our supply chain with initiatives like 
‘Wednesday for Transition’ and sustainable sourcing 
policies.
At Hindustan Zinc, sustainability is not merely a metric 
but a strategic imperative that drives our growth 
trajectory. We remain steadfast in our dedication 
to environmental stewardship, societal impact, and 
operational excellence.
Best Regards,
Arun Misra
CEO & WTD

Water
Management
Risk
Opportunity
Our operational activities involve 
processes in which water is an 
indispensable input, both for 
extraction and processing & 
smelting.
Thus, it is even more important 
for us to strive to reduce water 
usage and increase reutilisation 
throughout the value chain.
According to our climate change 
assessment, climate change may 
result in increase in extreme 
weather events and subsequent 
resource shortages.
Our operations are located in 
Rajasthan, which is one of the 
designated water-stressed 
regions in the country based on 
WRI’s Aqueduct tool. There is a 
high probability of experiencing 
situations of drought and extreme 
heat waves.
Since water is a critical input to our 
business, these factors have the 
potential to disrupt operations, to 
impact productivity of staff as well 
as our revenues and logistics
Water conservation is particularly important 
for us as we operate in a water-stressed 
region. We are 2.41 times water positive 
and are well on the path to be 5 times 
water positive company and reducing the 
water consumption by 25% by 2025 from 
base year 2020.
Company has taken several initiatives to 
reduce its dependencies on fresh water 
and improve availability of water for the 
communities surrounding our sites.
	y
Increasing efficiency in water 
usage and exploring less 
water‑intensive technologies
	y

Strengthening water recycling and 
installation of ZLD across all plants
	y
Using alternative water sources 
like treated water from sewage 
treatment plant to reduce 
dependency on freshwater
	y
Replenish water within local 
watersheds and rainwater harvesting
	y
Water risk assessment using WBCSD’s 
India Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct and 
GEMI local water tools
This would 
have financial 
implications as 
the Company has 
already taken 
significant initiatives 
to reduce water 
consumption and 
recycle it efficiently 
in past. However 
due to initiatives, 
we are reducing 
dependency on 
fresh water, hence 
positive impact also 
considered

Climate Change 
& Decarbonisation
Risk
We are an energy-intensive 
industry due to the nature of our 
operational activities, logistics and 
transportation processes. That is 
why we seek new technologies 
and progress regarding sustainable 
energy generation. This can impact 
the overall market value of the 
products in the geographies with 
restrictions, thus impacting our 
revenues.
As a result, we keep track of all 
transition risks and changes in 
regional Climate Change Policy.
As per our physical risk assessment 
for the year 2030 and 2050, 
Hindustan Zinc is likely to face 
natural disasters like droughts, heat 
waves and increase in extreme 
weather conditions. These would 
impose challenges to mining 
operations. Climate change 
may cause or result in increase 
in extreme weather events and 
subsequent resource shortages, 
impacting overall cost of acquisition 
of resources from alternative 
sources.
The rising challenges of climate change 
and resource scarcity have put us on a 
path of transformation to a low-carbon 
economy. Our strategies for mitigating 
these risks include:
	y
Reducing fossil fuel-based energy 
usage in our operations by using 
innovative energy efficiency 
technologies and process optimisation
	y
Shifting to renewables and/or low-
carbon solutions where possible
	y
The Company has committed for net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 and 
is planning to increase RE power 
portfolio by addition of 450 MW 
renewable project by 2026
	y
Replace diesel-fuelled transportation 
vehicles with electric vehicles - 
We have introduced India’s first 
underground mining electric vehicle
	y
Introduced LNG-powered trucks and 
electrical trucks for upstream and 
downstream transportation
	y
Business partners also introduced 
electrical vehicles, several 
forklifts, towing vehicles, and 
passenger vehicles
	y
100% RE power consumption at 
Pantnagar Metal Plant
	y
Use of biomass in power plant
	y
Climate change risk assessment
There may be 
negative financial 
consequences for 
failing to implement 
mitigation and 
adaptation 
strategies. 
However, the 
Company is 
committed to taking 
positive steps 
towards the journey 
of net zero
Opportunity
	y
Use of renewable electricity may 
result in lower Levellised Cost 
of Energy (LCOE)
	y
New market opportunities due to 
expected growth in solar PV panels 
and energy storage systems using 
zinc, lead and silver
	y
Decarbonised metals may give 
differentiator and may command 
premium well before 2030

Biodiversity & 
Ecosystem
Risk 
Opportunity
Biodiversity provides many 
ecosystem services. If improperly 
managed, mining, smelting and 
exploration activities have the 
potential to negatively affect 
biodiversity and ecosystem 
services. Impact could be loss 
of protected species and habitat 
fragmentation. Such risks could 
affect our social licence to operate 
as well as our reputation.
We work to proactively manage our impact 
on biodiversity and strive to protect the 
ecosystems in which we operate.

Tailing 
Management
Risk
The monitoring and management 
of tailings storage facilities (TSFs)
plays a significant role in reducing 
environmental impact on our local 
stakeholders. Tailings dam failure 
can lead to loss of life, injuries and 
damage to the environment, as 
well as can impact our Company’s 
reputation. It can also entail 
significant financial costs/losses and 
stoppages in production.
Failing of tailings dams can cause a huge 
environmental impact. Hence, we accord 
top priority to managing them responsibly.
	y
All the Company’s tailings facilities 
are designed and constructed to the 
highest engineering standards and 
best-in-class benchmarked practices
	y
External and internal inspection and 
monitoring of the TSFs to review 
the integrity/stability of our TSF 
structures and their associated 
management practices
	y
Effectiveness of reclaim water system
	y
Collection and recycling of 
supernatant water
	y
Conducting periodic TSF risk 
assessments and developing 
mitigation plans to minimise 
associated risks
	y
Surveillance of tailings storage facility
	y
Effectiveness of emergency 
planning and response
	y
Utilisation of tailings in backfilling
	y
Replacement of wet tailing disposal 
system with dry tailing disposal
	y
Dam break analysis and 
Emergency preparedness
	y
Company introduced a novel, satellite-
based Interferometric Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring 
technique to provide early warning of 
surface ground movements
	y
We aim to be fully compliant with the 
Global Industry Standards on Tailings 
Management (GISTM) by FY 2024-25

Large-scale air emissions can cause 
serious impact on the environment and 
local communities. We continuously work 
towards reducing air emissions.

Diversity, Equal 
Opportunity & 
Inclusion
Risk
People are our core assets and 
responsible for organisational 
success. By establishing a culture 
of safety, employee engagement 
and support for diverse groups 
in our workforce, we have been 
able to deliver in the top quartile 
of the business performance. We 
are an employer of choice and 
a Company that continues to 
attract, develop and retain talent 
across all the levels. Diversity is 
a business imperative for us and 
we firmly believe that healthy 
diversity mix is more likely to have 
financial returns above industry 
median. Strategically, we focus 
on having a strong representation 
of women across levels and 
women currently constitutes 
21.7% of the strength in the 
executive cadre. Simultaneously, 
we have successfully onboarded 
transgenders in front-end roles. 
We have flagship programmes for 
identification and development 
of diverse workgroups such as 
V-Build, V-Lead, ACT-UP, She-Leads, 
V-Aspire which focus on technical & 
behavioural aspects of individuals.
While we see opportunity in diverse 
workgroups, there are apparent risks. The 
workplace has to be inclusive, safe, secure, 
free of discrimination, harassment and 
bullying.

Mitigation: Policy on Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment, 
Anti‑Discrimination Policy, 
Internal Complaints Committee
	y
Grievance Redressal Committee,

well as IBU level to ensure mitigation 
of the mentioned risks
There may be 
minor financial 
implications 
while strategising

Talent Attraction 
& Retention
Risk
A high-quality talent pipeline 
paves the way for organisation 
excellence. Our talent management 
framework is conceptualised and 
implemented to maximise individual 
contribution by developing existing 
skills & experience. We believe 
in deploying best-in-class talent 
management practices that boost 
performance and help in building 
our brand to attract and retain 
talent.
We continuously work with a 
focused approach to get the right 
people in the right jobs, developing 
them and creating a great work 
environment, which in turn will build 
the foundation for an exceptionally 
talented and successful 
organisation.
The core operations at Hindustan 
Zinc including mining, smelting & 
refining, require workforce with 
niche skills. Attrition in this talent 
pool is considered as a threat to the 
business deliverables.
We build and leverage the talent through a 
robust framework, as mentioned below:
	y
Attraction and Acquisition - 
Empanelment of premier institutes 
across the country to tap the best 
talent, unique drives for attracting best 
talent from diverse work groups, etc.
	y
Promoting Young Talent - Right MIP, 
building the talent pipeline through 
succession planning
	y
Capability Building - Ensuring that 
we have people with the right skills 
which are niche skills in mining and 
smelting. Also acquiring new skills 
at par with external requirements 
and be agile with both internal & 
external developments. We ensure 
the development of our people on 
technical & behavioural aspects 
through customised interventions
	y
Driving Diversity - DEI is a business 
imperative and our objective is to 
achieve gender parity across all levels 
starting from the Board
	y
Performance Management - 
Cascading organisation’s goals to 
the last line to ensure that the entire 
workforce is aligned to achieve the 
business targets

Circularity 
& Waste 
Management
Risk
Opportunity
Waste generated from our 
operations poses challenge to us 
in terms of increasing our cost of 
production, challenge in terms of its 
storage & risk of non-compliance.
	y
At Hindustan Zinc, we believe in 
zero waste and have designed a 
comprehensive approach in managing 
waste generated. We have aligned 
our waste management practices 
to ‘4R’ strategy – Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle and Reclaim
	y
Gainful utilisation of waste in terms of 
recovering minor metals & using waste 
in other industries (cement, road, etc.)
	y
Commissioning of Fumer plant will 
be resulting in 100% elimination 
of jarosite waste from one of the 
hydro zinc smelters
Together with 
some negative 
implications, this 
would largely have 
a positive impact 
through waste to 
wealth initiatives
Social

Health, Safety & 
Well-Being
Risk
Hindustan Zinc’s mining and 
smelting operations involve various 
procedures that can have significant 
consequences on the workers and 
the environment.
Failure to ensure health and safety 
could result in increased
cost of litigation, reduced 
availability of manpower, reduced 
employee morale, or even threaten 
the viability of operations in worst-
case scenarios.
It is our constant endeavour to make our 
workplace free of fatalities, injuries and 
occupational diseases.

Community 
Engagement and 
Development
Risk
Opportunity
Communities are identified as 
foremost stakeholder group. 
Stakeholders, especially 
communities, may get impacted at 
the socio-cultural and economic 
level due to our business 
operations. Deficit of trust and 
relationship with the earmarked 
stakeholders may not only impede 
the progress on initiatives for 
furthering our societal impact but 
may also lead to consequential loss 
of reputation, brand and business 
continuity.
Mismatch between expectations of 
community and actions deployed 
or lack of awareness or poor 
deployment of engagement 
initiatives may lead to discontented 
communities.
A proactive and sustained 
approach towards consultation 
with stakeholders including 
communities is critical to 
strengthen the engagement levels 
and sustained interactions and 
engagement platforms would lead 
to presenting our commitment to 
driving value for both communities 
and organisation.
We also are cognizant that each 
location has a different cultural 
and economic significance, which 
influences the expectations local 
communities have from us. Hence, 
community engagement for 
sustainable integrated land use 
planning, the training of community 
persons in specialised skills, 
importance to cultural values and 
its integration into the relationship, 
empowering and bringing women in 
leadership by focusing on equality, 
overall developing the assets 
within the community & intensely 
educating them thereby making 
self-sustained communities’ local 
employment, local sourcing is one 
of the most important aspect for 
us to build trust and uplift their 
standard of living.
	y
Proactive and sustained engagement 
platforms like “Community Connect”, 
“Community Leadership Connect” 
shall ensure two-way communication 
network and strengthen the trust 
element. Our approach towards 
strengthening Social Performance 
Steering Committees (SPSC) at 
business locations with active 
involvement of the functional 
leaders across Hindustan Zinc is 
key to monitoring the grievances 
and their resolution, key risks and 
their mitigation and creating strong 
relationships with the stakeholder 
base. Thereby, reducing the 
collective risks & immediately 
addressing the grievances 
and feedbacks received from 
the communities
	y
Engagement of senior management at 
village level across all business 
units (BUs) on a regular basis for 
discussing village level development 
and ensure resolution of concerns/
grievances, if any
	y
Model Village as a strategic approach 
is being adopted to strengthen the 
village infrastructure in discussion with 
the villages and its elected members
	y
Assessing the community needs and 
impact derived of our interventions 
including perception studies aid 
us in learning the insights and 
further help us draw inferences and 
future action plans

100%
100%
Our Research & Development (R&D) capabilities are pivotal in advancing our circular 
economy objectives, notably through the creation of innovative flotation reagents that 
enhance mineral recovery and minimise impurities. Additionally, our commitment to 
environmental stewardship is demonstrated by numerous waste recycling initiatives 
aimed at diminishing our ecological footprint and reclaiming valuable resources from 
waste. Furthermore, R&D has been instrumental in refining the processes within Waelz kiln 
operations, thereby optimising metal recovery from secondary materials.
The Company's commitment to sustainable innovation has been further validated with the 
acquisition of Indian patents for three cutting-edge technologies (IN 468077, IN 476200, 
and IN 476226). These patents encompass advancements in both pyrometallurgy and 
hydrometallurgy, aiming to elevate zinc and lead yields through proprietary in-house 
developments. These technologies are pivotal in converting waste into valuable resources, 
thereby not only propelling the Company's operational efficiency but also empowering local 
entrepreneurs and communities.
To bolster our research capabilities, we have equipped our facilities with advanced 
instruments, including X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and a suite of other 
specialised equipment.

2. 	 a. 	 Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)
	
	
Yes. The Company conducts business in a manner that improves welfare, health and safety of workers across 
our supply chain, ensures compliance with the law and adherence to ethical standards of governance and 
sustainability. To achieve this vision, we have put in place a Sustainable Sourcing policy that aligns our goals 
with our valued business partners and promote a culture of responsibility towards sustainability in all our 
stakeholders. The policy applies to all our Tier 1 suppliers including service and supply partners based on 
fundamental requirement of adherence to the Supplier’s Code of Conduct, which embodies our commitment to 
internationally recognised standards on five core principles - Labour and Human Rights, Occupational Health and 
Safety, Environmental Sustainability, Business Integrity and Governance. We may require our business partners to 
provide information, complete training and perform other activities in connection with this policy before, during or 
after supply of goods or performance of services. We are committed to working with our Tier-1 suppliers through 
collaborations and improvement in their process for responsible procurement based on global best practices. To 
ensure responsible sourcing of minerals, including when sourcing from CAHRA (Conflict-Affected and High-Risk 
Area), Hindustan Zinc has established effective internal management of due diligence system to identify, assess 
and manage potential risks associated with our mineral supply chains. Through this, Hindustan Zinc identifies 
potential red flags, triggering enhanced due diligence in its mineral supply chains. Where red flags are identified, 
we undertake enhanced due diligence to map the factual circumstances of the presence of risks, including 
serious human rights abuses; risks associated with the contracting of public or private security forces; direct or 
indirect support to non-state armed groups; money laundering; non-payment of taxes, fees and royalties due to 
governments; bribery; environment violations or non-compliance, GHG emissions, non-availability of water, social 
unrest and fraudulent misrepresentation of the origin of the materials. We also map out risk management plans, 
including a feedback/grievance mechanism, to ensure prevention and quick mitigation of identified risks.

Yes. The Company is committed to providing equal opportunities to all individuals and is intolerant towards 
discrimination and/or harassment based on race, religion, colour, age, sexual orientation, national origin, gender 
identification, political affiliation and political beliefs, minority or vulnerable groups. The Company has adopted 
Diversity & Inclusion Policy with the objective to ensure that the Company continues to be an employer for all diversity

ICC are responsible for conducting enquiries pertaining to such complaints. Hindustan Zinc follows several mechanisms 
to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases:
	y
Confidentiality: Keeping the complaint and its details confidential helps to protect the complainant’s privacy and 
prevent retaliation. The organisation ensures protection of aggrieved women by taking appropriate steps such as 
change of workplace or leaves, etc. as prescribed by the law.
	y
Non-retaliation policy: At Hindustan Zinc, Human Rights Policy and Prevention of “Sexual Harassment” Policy is 
established to ensure the prohibition of retaliation against an employee who reports discrimination or harassment.
	y
Investigation: An investigation conducted to determine whether the complaint has merit and to identify any 
witnesses or evidence to support the complaint.
	y
Remedial actions: If the investigation finds that discrimination or harassment has occurred, remedial actions are 
taken to address the situation. It includes disciplinary action against the perpetrator, training to employees and 
managers and change/amendment/modification in policies and procedures.
	y
Support and counselling: Support and counselling to the complainant to help them to cope with the emotional 
impact of the situation.
9. 	 Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)
	
Yes. Human Rights forms the part of our business agreements and contracts for all of our value chain partners. Further

as child labour, forced and compulsory labour are also ensured along with other necessary compliances.
	
2. 	 Compliance with Company’s Code of Conduct – All the value chain partners are also abided by our Code of 
Conduct through signing the same as a part of their respective contracts.
	
3. 	 Due diligence process – Most of our value chain partners undergo desktop assessment and on-site assessment for 
human rights, together with usual risk assessment process.
10. 	Assessments for the year:

Outcome of
the initiative
6
Paste fill
Instead of conventional hydraulic filling, Company chose to use 
the paste fill technology. This technology ensured fast filling and 
practically no bleeding water in the stopes. The other benefits of 
paste fill technology have been water conservation, better stope 
stability, surface integrity in mines and more recycling of tailings.
	y
Metal recovery from 
secondary stopes
	y
It reduces cement consumptions 
with increase in uses of fly ash
	y
It reduces water consumption 
as paste solids content is high 
(77-79% solids)
	y
Nearly, 39% of tailings used 
in paste fill plant and this 
also helped in improving the 
stability of tailing dam
7
Ancillary Plant
It treats residues produced during smelting process leading to 
in-house production of few key consumables and byproducts, in 
collaboration with the Company’s central R&D team. Few projects 
were successfully executed including production of copper 
sulphate and zinc sulphate from PF cake as well as production of 
potassium antimony tartrate from antimony dust.
	y
It treats different kinds of 
residues, namely copper 
dross, purification waste 
cake, antimony dust/slag 
and raw zinc oxide
	y
This has also enabled 
improvement of metal recoveries 
of lead, copper and silver

Jarofix Yard 
Restoration
Company follows the principle of reducing the waste, 
quantitatively as well as qualitatively and performing recovery 
and recycle. The last priority is disposal in landfills. Company 
used Mycorrhiza technology for rejuvenation and reclamation 
of wasteland into productive land by increasing the green 
cover, enhance biodiversity and control fugitive dust emission 
and restoring site. It also makes plants less vulnerable to 
environmental stresses and by optimum use of water resources
Development of green belt in an 
area of 6.25 Hectare (10,000 
plants). Provides overall stability to 
waste dump and dump failure due 
to heavy rains – ensuring safe and 
stable dump

Solar Plant
Company has installed 40.70 MW of solar power project by 
utilising its waste lands without disturbing any productive land
40.70 MW of renewable power 
capacity

Resource 
Efficiency
Company has been able to bring improvement in its metal 
recovery from beneficiation plant through digitalisation. 
Advanced control opportunity for grinding and flotation circuit: 
To address the difficulty in flotation process plants coming from 
the constantly changing feed characteristics, Advance Process 
Control (APC) system was introduced to maintain a stabilised 
circuit operation while optimising the process performance to 
maximise recovery. Three APCs were implemented for grinding & 
flotation operation (lead and zinc) in mills at Rampura Agucha and 
SK Mines.
	y
Lead recovery improved by 0.9% 
while also moving concentrate 
grade distribution on higher side
	y
Zinc recovery improved by 0.9% 
while narrowing concentrate 
grade distribution around target
11
Fumer Plant
In the existing zinc hydro metallurgical process, Jarosite is 
generated which is treated with lime & cement and disposed in 
Jarofix Yard. In the proposed Fumer plant, a clean slag will be 
produced and utilised in cement manufacturing and goethite cake 
produced will be treated with lime & cement and disposed in 
captive secured landfill.

Jarofix/Jarosite 
Utilisation 
in Cement 
and Road 
construction
Jarosite is waste produced in the hydrometallurgy process of zinc 
extraction, necessitating additional investment for its stabilisation 
and disposal. In collaboration with IIT-R, Company conducted a 
feasibility study to utilise Jarosite in construction-related works, 
using Jarosite in concrete, mortar and paver blocks as 10%-
15% replacement of cement. The study showed positive results 
and encouraged us to conduct field trials. Company has been 
granted permission by Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board for 
gainful utilisation of Jarofix waste for road construction/highway 
construction (embankment). Company also partnered with a 
few Government agencies like NCCBM, NEERI and CRRI for the 
utilisation of jarosite in cement and road construction.

commissioned in January 2019. Another 15 MLD commissioned 
in FY 2020-21 taking the total to 60 MLD.
The replacement of fresh water for 
operations by STP treated water has

Dry Tailing 
Plant
India’s first Dry Tailing Plant was set up at the Zawar Mines in 
Rajasthan. The dry tailing technology is based on separating 
water from tailings slurry, which is generated in the beneficiation 
process. Company repurposes tailings materials and waste rock 
as backfill to stabilise our underground mining operations, while 
the remaining tailings are then placed in a specially-designed 
tailings storage to minimise the environmental, social and 
economic risks. We externally review the integrity/stability of our 
dam structures and their associated management practices by 
global experts.
Key benefits of the dry tailing 
technology include recirculation 
of more than 80% of the process 
water present in tailings, a faster 
rehabilitation and restoration of 
storage site at mine closure and 
ensuring re-availability of water for 
further use.

Our Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on BRSR Core with respect to the Entity/ 
Sites covered in the “Scope, Boundary, and Limitations” paragraph given below, based on the procedures 
we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires 
that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether BRSR Core are

Emphasis of Matter 
 
We draw your attention to the following matters:  
 
 The “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” in this report and the boundary, as mentioned in point no. 13 
of Section A: General Disclosures of BRSR. These Entity/ Sites are considered for the reporting in 
BRSR as per the management’s assessment of materiality.      
 
 The financial numbers used in some of the indicators of the BRSR Core are extracted from the 
Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24 and hence are not audited by us. While the financial numbers 
related to certain Entities include inter-company consolidation adjustments as per the applicable 
financial reporting framework (net figures), the non-financial data used in some of the indicators of the 
BRSR Core are given without adjustments (gross figures). Further, some of the Entities/ Sites are 
considered for the purpose of said financial numbers, which may have been excluded from the “Scope, 
Boundary and Limitations”. 
 
 The Non-Financial Reporting System used by the Group in the preparation of BRSR Core is in the 
advanced stage of implementation and is in the process of being integrated with other Financial and 
Non-Financial Reporting Systems of the Group. 
 
 For the purpose of reporting under Principle 3.1(c) (Essential Indicator) of BRSR with respect to 
‘spending on measures towards well-being of employees’, the data for other than permanent workers 
have not been considered due to non-availability of information. The Company is in the process of 
setting up the mechanism to capture the required data going forward.

 Operations of the Group other than those covered in the “Scope and Boundary”. 
 
 Aspects of BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than Indicators other than

Our Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on Indicators other than BRSR Core with 
respect to the Entity/ Sites covered in the “Scope, Boundary, and Limitations” paragraph given below, 
based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained. 
 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised), “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This standard requires 
that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether Indicators other than 
BRSR Core are free from material misstatement.  
 
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s 
use of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of Indicators other than BRSR Core whether due to 
fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Indicators other than the BRSR Core. 
 
A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement 
in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal controls, and the 
procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.

Limited Assurance Conclusion 
 
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s Indicators other than BRSR Core included in the 
BRSR for the year ended 31 March 2024 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
“Criteria”. 
 
Emphasis of Matter 
 
We draw your attention to the following matters:  
 
 The “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” in this report and the boundary, as mentioned in point no. 13 
of Section A: General Disclosures of BRSR. These Entity/ Sites are considered for the reporting in 
BRSR as per the management’s assessment of materiality.      
 
 The financial numbers used in some of the Indicators other than BRSR Core are extracted from the 
Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24 and hence are not audited by us. While the financial numbers 
related to certain Entities include inter-company consolidation adjustments as per the applicable 
financial reporting framework (net figures), the non-financial data used in some of the Indicators other 
than BRSR Core are given without adjustments (gross figures). Further, some of the Entities/ Sites are 
considered for the purpose of said financial numbers, which may have been excluded from the “Scope, 
Boundary and Limitations”. 
 
 The Non-Financial Reporting System used by the Group in the preparation of Indicators other than 
BRSR Core is in the advanced stage of implementation and is in the process of being integrated with 
other Financial and Non-Financial Reporting Systems of the Group.  
 
 The disclosures with respect to Value Chain Partners have been provided considering Tier 1 upstream 
Value Chain Partners only.  
 
Our limited assurance conclusion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Assurance Procedures  
 
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, 
observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of 
quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records. 
 
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
 
 Obtained an understanding of the Group’s business activities, processes and its operating locations, as 
identified by the Group.  
 
 Interviewed people involved to understand the reporting process, governance, data management 
systems and controls in place during the reporting period. 
 
 Performed limited substantive testing on a sample basis of Indicators other than BRSR Core for the 
Entity/ Sites, as covered in the “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” to verify whether the data was 
appropriately recorded, collated, measured and reported with underlying supporting documents. 
 
 Checked the consolidation for the Entity/ Sites as covered in the “Scope, Boundary and Limitations” 
for ensuring the completeness of data being reported. 
 
 Assessed the level of adherence of the “Criteria”, as mentioned above by the Group while reporting.  
 
 Verified the financial numbers which are also used for Indicators other than BRSR Core from the 
Integrated Annual Report FY 2023-24.  
 
 Assessed the appropriateness of various assumptions, estimations and thresholds used by the Group in 
the preparation of Indicators other than BRSR Core. 
 
 Undertook analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data used in Indicators 
other than BRSR Core. 
 
 Obtained written representations from Group’s Management. 
 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been 
obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a 
reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Indicators other than BRSR Core have been prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
