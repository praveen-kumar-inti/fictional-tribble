Corporate 
Governance
Risk
Within corporate governance, ethical 
and responsible business conduct 
and anti-bribery are the key issues 
applicable to the AMC sector. On 
the compliance front, the key issue 
pertains to adherence to changing 
regulatory 
requirements 
and 
disclosures for the AMC industry.
Rapid and continuous changes to the 
regulatory landscape, markets, and 
product offerings can lead to a risk of 
inadequacy in fully comprehending and 
swiftly responding to such changes or 
regulatory requirements.
Additionally, 
an 
increasing 
focus 
on 
governance, 
compliance 
and 
disclosures on ESG would require the 
Company to address emerging ESG-
related risks.
The Company has put in place a 
robust and documented framework 
for managing corporate governance, 
including a documented whistle-blower 
policy. Through such policies, and a 
robust code of conduct that applies 
to all employees across the Company, 
ABSLAMC has created an ecosystem 
conducive to mitigating governance-
related and compliance related risks.
The Company also provides trainings 
as well as monitors the performance 
against these periodically.
This includes for example training 
programs for Directors to familiarize 
them with matters relating to changes 
in the regulations, policies impacting the 
business of the Company, and regulatory 
developments.
Negative:
In the event of issues arising 
in 
managing 
the 
Company’s 
governance 
practices 
and 
alignment with compliance-based 
or regulatory requirements, the 
likelihood of a negative impact can 
be on the Company’s:
1.	 ESG ratings
2.	 Potential to draw additional 
investment in the business 
from responsible or ESG-
aware investors  
Risk 
Management
Opportunity
The Company considers effective risk 
management as a key component of 
effective business management, and 
key to meeting business goals and 
objectives. The Company continues 
to face various types of risks, such 
as strategic risk, investment risk, 
operational risk, and ESG-linked risks. 
To mitigate these risks, over the 
years, the Company has developed 
and consistently improved on its Risk 
Management Framework.
There exists an opportunity for the 
Company to continue to iterate and 
innovate on its risk management 
framework 
and 
related 
practices 
and policies, in line with regulatory 
requirements 
and 
the 
evolving 
landscape of the AMC industry.
Backed by well-established protocols 
and processes, the Company has 
created 
a 
robust 
enterprise 
risk 
management 
framework. 
This 
framework includes strategies and 
protocols on risk identification, risk 
assessment, risk response, and an 
all-encompassing risk management 
strategy.
Through its robust risk management 
framework, 
the 
Company 
has 
demonstrated its commitment to ethical 
conduct in all aspects of its business 
and operations. Alongside maintaining 
compliance with regulatory requirements, 
the Company has also taken efforts to 
take into account industry best practices 
in risk management.
Currently, the Company also has a 
Responsible Investment Policy for the 
‘Aditya Birla Sun Life ESG Fund’.
Positive:
The 
Company’s 
robust 
risk 
management 
framework 
has 
enabled it to overcome key risks 
and challenges, including those 
stemming from the COVID-19 
crisis.
The Company also believes that 
its 
commitment 
to 
address 
and mitigate ESG-related risks 
is 
demonstrated 
through 
its 
initiatives taken on responsible 
investing.
Through such efforts on risk 
management, 
the 
Committee 
aims to contribute to the overall 
financial stability and focus on 
sustainability of the Company.

Data Privacy 
and Cyber 
Security
Risk
Within data privacy and security 
management, 
cybersecurity-related 
risk remains a key challenge for 
the Company. This primarily refers 
to the likelihood of the Company’s 
information 
technology/ 
IT-based 
resources being weakened or failing. 
Given the growing incidence of 
cybersecurity threats in the industry, 
a few of the risks the Company has 
identified include:
1.	 Ransomware 
2.	 Phishing
3.	 Associated loss or wiping out 
of proprietary data or material 
information
4.	 Associated loss of control over 
the Company’s key IT systems and 
processes because of attacks by 
third parties 
The Company has identified these risks 
as having the potential to significantly 
affect the Company’s operations, 
reputation, and profitability.
The Company has accorded high 
priority to this issue, and taken steps 
to identify, address and mitigate risks 
related to data privacy and cyber 
security.  
The Company has included data privacy 
and cyber security risks in its Risk 
Management Policy. This information 
is also confirmed and documented in 
the Charter of the Risk Management 
Committee. 
The Company has also taken measures 
to mitigate such risks and their impact. 
This includes regular testing of its IT 
systems, having effective firewalls in 
place, and regular and comprehensive 
reviews of its IT systems, processes 
and assets.
Negative:
The 
likelihood 
of 
incurring 
increased costs to effectively 
manage and ensure timely updates 
to the Company’s IT infrastructure, 
systems, and processes, including 
any costs incurred for system 
upgradation. 
Customer 
satisfaction 
and 
Relationship 
Management
Risk
Since the Company provides financial 
products and services to a diverse 
set of customer segments, pan-India, 
any negative impact on customer 
satisfaction 
or 
experience 
can 
directly affect the Company’s brand, 
reputation, and its efforts to maintain 
and/or its customer base.
Negative impact in this context could 
be the result of lack of transparency or 
in following of responsible and ethical 
practices in selling, marketing and 
information disclosure on its products.
To 
address 
any 
escalations 
or 
grievances from customers, ABSLAMC 
has in place a robust system and 
processes. This includes a dedicated 
grievance redressal system, and an 
escalation matrix defined in the system 
for automatic escalation of grievances 
to the next level. These grievances 
may pertain to varying topics, including 
marketing and sale of specific products, 
and information disclosures on these 
products.
The Company values and promotes 
ethical and responsible behaviour by 
its representatives in its operations, 
marketing, and selling practices. These 
values form a core part of the training 
of key employee groups managing 
marketing and sales. The Company 
ensures that all such employee groups 
follow ethical marketing and selling 
practices across all stages of the 
product sales cycle. 
Negative:
In the event of issues arising in 
ensuring customer satisfaction and 
a positive customer experience, 
this can lead to a decrease in the 
Company’s customer base and 
affect its reputation.
