HPL Electric & Power Limited has established comprehensive processes to safely reclaim, reuse, recycle, and dispose of products at the 
end of their life cycle, covering various types of waste: 
 
Plastics (including packaging): Plastics used in our operations are segregated, cleaned, and sent to certified recycling facilities. This 
ensures that plastic waste is managed responsibly and in accordance with environmental regulations. 
 
E-waste: Electronic waste generated from our operations is collected and processed by authorized e-waste recyclers. This ensures the 
safe disposal and recycling of electronic components, minimizing environmental impact. 
 
Hazardous waste: Hazardous waste generated during manufacturing processes is handled according to stringent regulatory 
guidelines. We partner with licensed hazardous waste management companies to ensure safe and compliant disposal. 
 
Other waste: Other types of waste, including organic waste, are either composted or sent to appropriate recycling centres. This 
approach helps in minimizing landfill use and promoting sustainable waste management practices.

proper disposal of electronic and hazardous materials. These efforts reflect HPL's proactive approach to sustainability and environmental

Solar Power Deployment:HPL has initiated solar energy projects at its manufacturing plants. Over the last few years, the company 
has been gradually implementing solar energy usage across its facilities. This shift to renewable energy sources is a critical part of 
HPL's strategy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and decrease its carbon footprint. 
 
Energy-Efficient Equipment:The company has invested in energy-efficient equipment, including BEE star-rated air conditioning units 
and energy-saving insulated heaters for injection moulding machines. Additionally, HPL uses variable frequency drives (VFDs) and 
energy-efficient motors, which contribute to significant energy savings.
