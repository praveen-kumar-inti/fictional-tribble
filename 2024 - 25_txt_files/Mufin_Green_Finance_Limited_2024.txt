MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
[Schedule V – Regulation 34(3) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015]
Introduction
Management Discussion and Analysis mainly comprise of the statements which, inter-alia, involve predictions based 
on perceptions and may, therefore, be prone to uncertainties.  It is the sum total of the Company’s expectations, 
beliefs, estimates and projections which are forward looking within the meaning of applicable laws and regulations. 
The actual results could differ materially from those expressed herein specifically or impliedly.
Macroeconomic Overview
The Indian economy in the year 2024-25 was marked by significant inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and 
volatile global financial markets. This posed substantial risks to inflation and economic stability. The Central Government’s 
commitment to fiscal consolidation presented challenges in balancing growth and inflation control. Despite these hurdles, 
the Indian economy demonstrated resilience, achieving robust GDP growth at 6.5% for FY 2024-25, driven by strong 
private consumption, increased government spending on infrastructure and continuing monetary easing. 
The general elections in 2024 resulted in a decisive victory for the incumbent government, which continued its focus 
on economic reforms and infrastructure development. This political stability boosted investor confidence, supporting 
sustained economic growth. However, the Indian economy faced liquidity challenges in most part of the of FY25. CPI 
inflation #uctuated, peaking at 6.2% in October 2024 before moderating to 3.6% by February 2025. The rupee faced 
depreciation risks due to external uncertainties, impacting import costs and contributing to imported inflation. 
The RBI maintained a cautious stance, keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50% till January 2025 to balance 
inflation control with growth support. To manage liquidity, the RBI conducted Open Market Operations (OMOs) and 
dollar/rupee swaps to stabilise the rupee, which faced depreciation pressures due to global uncertainties. The Liquidity 
Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor was actively used to manage short-term liquidity mismatches, ensuring adequate 
liquidity in the banking system. These measures helped lower borrowing costs and stimulated investment.
In Q4, RBI adopted a fresh perspective to monetary policy, focussing on balancing growth and inflation control. In 
response to economic challenges and the need to contain inflation within the target range, RBI reduced the repo rate 
by 25 bps in February 2025 and an additional 25 bps in April 2025 taking the repo rate to 6%. The Policy stance has 
also been changed from neutral to accommodative. The rate cuts are expected to encourage lending and investment, 
stimulate demand, and strengthen overall economic activity.
OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY FY 2024-25
India’s economy has exhibited steady growth and stability during FY25, reaffirming its position as one of the fastest-
growing major economies globally. According to the Second Advanced Estimate (SAE) data from the National 
Statistical Office (NSO), the Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.5% for FY25, following an 
impressive 9.2% growth as per the First Revised Estimates from the prior financial year. The positive growth in India’s 
exports can be attributed to the country’s sustained economic activity, bolstered by ongoing momentum in both the 
manufacturing and services sectors. This ongoing growth trend highlights the nation’s solid economic foundations, 
beneficial government policies, a flourishing services sector, and domestic demand, all of which promote confidence 
in India’s long-term growth trajectory.

E - Estimated   |   P - Projected
India’s economic expansion is expected to be propelled by several key factors. Strong domestic demand is projected 
as a significant medium-term contributor. Furthermore, anticipated capital spending on infrastructure and asset 
development is likely to enhance growth through multiplier effects.
Future capital expenditures should also benefit from government support, including tax buoyancy, simplified tax 
structures, tariff reassessment, and digital tax filing. Finally, a positive investment outlook is encouraged by the 
government’s focus on capital expenditure, progress in the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) & ‘Make in India’ 
schemes, stronger corporate balance sheets, and a well-capitalized banking sector with low levels of non-performing 
assets (NPAs).
India’s improving economic status now places it as the world’s fourth-largest economy by nominal Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). Ambitious national targets aim for a $7 trillion economy by FY30 and $30 trillion by 2047, to be 
achieved through substantial infrastructure investments, ongoing reforms, and widespread technological integration.
a)	
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS
	
Indian Financial Services Industry Overview
	
FY2025 witnessed robust growth in India’s financial sectors, marked by improved banking metrics, significant 
financial inclusion, thriving capital markets, and strong macroeconomic fundamentals.
	
•	
India’s monetary and financial sectors displayed resilience and stability, fostering inclusive growth and 
economic development with 6.5% GDP growth in FY2025.
	
•	
Banking sector performance grew steadily with credit growth aligning with deposit growth, while scheduled 
commercial banks improved profitability, evidenced by declining gross non-performing assets and a higher 
capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio.
	
•	
RBI’s Financial Inclusion Index rose significantly from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 in March 2024, driven by 
government-backed infrastructure financing.
	
•	
Indian stock markets reached new highs by Dec 2024, outperforming other emerging markets despite 
global uncertainties. Market growth was fuelled by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, healthy corporate 
earnings, supportive institutional investment and robust SIP inflows (35% up YoY).
Outlook
India’s financial sector has demonstrated strength midst challenging geopolitical conditions, showcasing robust 
performance across banking, capital markets, insurance, and pensions. System liquidity remains in surplus, while 
banks exhibit strong financial health, evidenced by narrowing credit-deposit growth gaps and improved profitability. 
The financial sector is undergoing a transformation, characterised by rising consumer credit, increased non-bank 
financing, and the surging popularity of equity-based financing. These trends signify diversification and innovation 
in financial services but also pose incremental regulatory challenges. The expansion of consumer debt, unsecured 
lending, and the influx of young investors into equity markets highlight the need for balanced growth and stability in 
the sector. While these developments mark a new era for India’s financial landscape, they require careful oversight to 
ensure stability and sustainability amidst rapid change.
Indian NBFC Industry
India, as one of the fastest growing and largest economies globally, presents a conducive environment for the 
expansion of its credit market. The total NBFC credit outstanding stood at approximately ` 52 trillion as of December 
2024 and is projected to cross ` 60 trillion by FY2026, reflecting the sector’s continued expansion. Amongst banks, 
NBFC and All India Financial Institutions, NBFCs have maintained 21-24% share of credit from FY2017 to FY2024. 
As India targets becoming a $5 trillion economy in the coming years, the demand for financing is set to increase, 
underscoring the vital role of NBFCs in supporting economic growth and development.
Retail loans, which accounted for 58% of total NBFC credit in December 2024, remain the cornerstone of growth. 
Unsecured business loans accounted for 28% of retail NBFC credit in December 2024. Earlier, RBI had raised risk 
weights by 25 bps to 125% on unsecured retail loans, due to its indiscriminate growth, especially in personal loans 
and credit cards. Asset segments such as microfinance, personal loans, credit cards and unsecured business loans 
witnessed higher stress in FY2025, leading to higher delinquencies and write-offs.
Over the years, NBFCs have significantly strengthened their balance sheets, marked by reduced leverage and improved 
asset quality, with a notable shift towards the retail segment. NBFCs are effectively utilising digital data to improve 
credit assessments and operational efficiency. The interest of equity investors remains strong and there is vast pool 
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
83
of debt capital overseas which is largely untapped. With such a stable foundation, the sector remains well-positioned 
to navigate the evolving regulatory environment while maintaining momentum.
Growth Drivers for the Indian NBFC Industry
1. 	
Digital Transformation and Technological Advancements
	
NBFCs are increasingly leveraging digital technologies to enhance operational efficiency, manage fraud, and 
improve customer engagement. The adoption of super apps, digital sourcing platforms, and strategic partnerships 
with fintech firms is driving innovation and reshaping the lending landscape.
2. 	
Focus on Key Segments
	
i. 	
Retail Loans: The retail lending sector remains a key driver of growth, with strong demand for home 
loans, vehicle financing, and personal loans. Favourable demographic trends, rapid urbanisation, and rising 
disposable income are further driving growth in this segment.
	
ii. 	
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Financing: The strength of the MSME sector presents 
significant opportunities for NBFCs, particularly through tailored financial solutions such as factoring, 
supply chain financing, and unsecured business loans.
3. 	
Financial Inclusion
	
India has made significant progress in financial inclusion, with a total of 55.1 crore beneficiaries under the 
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) Scheme as of March 2025. NBFCs play a crucial role in bridging 
the credit gap for underserved and unbanked populations. By leveraging technology and customised product 
offerings, they are driving financial inclusion across rural and remote regions, ensuring wider access to credit 
and banking services.
4. 	
Sustainability and EV Financing
	
The Government’s push for eco-friendly projects, including solar energy, waste management, and sustainable 
infrastructure, has opened new avenues for NBFCs in green financing and impact investing. With the rapid 
adoption of electric vehicles in India, NBFCs are capitalising on emerging opportunities in green finance.
5. 	
Healthy Asset Quality Levels
	
While concerns persist over rising household indebtedness and asset quality risks in unsecured lending (such as 
personal loans and microfinance), NBFCs that prioritise proactive risk management, digital credit monitoring, 
and diversified lending portfolios are better positioned to maintain financial stability and portfolio health
b)	
OPPORTUNITIES & THREATS
	
•	
Rising government incentives and subsidies for EVs and renewable energy adoption.
	
•	
Increasing ESG-driven investments from domestic and international institutions.
	
•	
Expanding charging infrastructure and technological innovations in EV batteries.
	
•	
Untapped financing potential in Tier-II and Tier-III cities for e-mobility and rooftop solar projects.
	
•	
Potential to bundle vehicle finance, battery leasing, and solar rooftop loans as integrated products.
c)	
SEGMENT-WISE PERFORMANCE
The Company has only one line of business, i.e., Financing and Investment Activities during the year under review, 
hence no segment wise information is required. The Company has no activity outside India. Therefore, there is no 
geographical segment. 
d)	
OUTLOOK
	
1. 	
Electric Vehicle (EV) Financing
	
	
The electric mobility sector is poised for exponential growth, with India targeting 30% EV penetration 
by 2030. Government incentives under FAME-II, state subsidies, and tax benefits are driving adoption 
across two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and fleet operators. At the same time, e-commerce, ride-hailing, and 
logistics players are increasingly shifting to electric fleets to reduce costs and meet ESG goals.
	
Financing remains a critical enabler, as upfront EV costs are still high compared to ICE vehicles.
	
Demand for innovative financing products such as battery leasing, pay-as-you-drive models, and digital-
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
84
first loan approvals will rise. Strategic tie-ups with OEMs, fleet operators, and charging companies will 
create new avenues for growth.
	
2. 	
Solar Financing
	
	
The solar energy market continues to be one of the fastest-growing renewable energy segments, 
supported by India’s ambitious target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. Rooftop solar, 
SME installations, and community solar projects present strong financing potential.
	
	
Residential and SME adoption of rooftop solar is accelerating due to falling panel costs, net-metering 
benefits, and ESG-linked financing.
	
	
Tailored products such as long-tenure rooftop loans, lease-based financing, and blended finance 
with institutional investors will play a key role. Partnerships with EPC players and developers will 
further boost disbursement volumes.
	
3. 	
Insurance Premium Financing (IPF)
	
	
Insurance penetration in India remains low but is steadily rising due to regulatory push, rising financial 
awareness, and digitization of insurance distribution. For corporates, large-ticket insurance policies (marine, 
fire, health, liability) often involve significant upfront premium payments.
	
	
Insurance Premium Financing (IPF) allows businesses and individuals to pay insurance premiums in 
installments, improving affordability and liquidity.
	
	
With increasing demand for health insurance, cyber risk cover, and ESG-linked liability insurance, 
IPF will gain traction. For the retail segment, bundling IPF with motor/EV loans will open a new growth 
channel.
	
	
The convergence of EV adoption, solar energy expansion, and insurance awareness creates a multi-
pronged opportunity for the Company. Over the next 3–5 years, the focus will be on:
	
	
•	
Expanding into Tier-II and Tier-III cities with digital-first credit assessment tools.
	
	
•	
Strengthening risk management through credit scoring, asset monitoring, and diversified customer 
base.
	
	
•	
Innovating in product structuring to offer bundled finance solutions, such as EV + Insurance + 
Charging packages or Solar + Battery + Insurance financing.
	
	
The Company envisions becoming a leading Green Finance and Risk Solutions Partner, enabling 
India’s transition to a low-carbon economy. By offering innovative financing for EVs, solar adoption, and 
insurance premium management, the Company will not only achieve sustainable growth but also contribute 
to national energy security and climate goals.
	
	
Performance-wise, as of March 2025, NBFCs reported a Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 
30.88%, a Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of 2.48%, and a Return on average Assets (ROAA) 
of 2.08%. These indicators suggest a stable financial position, although the sector continues to navigate 
challenges related to consolidation, capital raising, and profitability pressures. The RBI’s regulatory focus in 
the coming year will likely include a closer examination of licensing requirements and supervisory actions 
against non-compliant NBFCs, ensuring that the sector remains resilient and capable of supporting India’s 
economic growth.

To mitigate such risks,

the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Company in accordance with the   Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report.

Key audit matter
How the key audit matter was addressed in our 
Audit
Allowances 
for 
Expected 
Credit 
Losses 
(“ECL”):
As at 31 March 2025, the carrying value of loan 
assets measured at amortised cost, aggregated 
₹83,084.01 lakhs (net of allowance of expected 
credit loss ₹760.47 lakhs) constituting approximately 
81.34% of the Group’s total assets.
Significant judgement is used in classifying these 
loan assets and applying appropriate measurement 
principles. ECL on such loan assets carried at 
amortised cost is a critical estimate involving 
greater level of management judgement. As part 
of our risk assessment, we determined that the ECL 
on such loan assets has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes for the Standalone Financial Statements. 
The elements of estimating ECL which involved 
increased level of audit focus are the following: 
• Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging 
the loan assets measured at amortised cost;
We have examined the policies approved by the respective 
Board of Directors of the Company that articulate the 
objectives of managing each portfolio and their business 
models. We have also verified the methodology adopted 
for computation of ECL (“ECL Model”) that addresses 
policies approved by the respective Board of Directors, 
procedures and controls for assessing and measuring 
credit risk on all lending exposures measured at amortised 
cost. Additionally, we have confirmed that adjustments 
to the output of the ECL Model are consistent with the 
documented rationale and basis
for such adjustments and that the amount of adjustment 
has been approved by the respective Audit Committee 
of the Board of Directors. Our audit procedures related 
to the allowance for ECL included the following, among 
others:
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the 
following:
126
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
• Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default 
(“PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and Exposure at 
Default (“EAD”) at product level with past trends;
• Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios 
and probability weights applied to reflect future 
economic conditions; and
• Adjustments to model driven ECL results to 
address emerging trends. (Refer Note 2.5.2.6 and 
34.A  to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
•
• Completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default 
(“EAD”) and the classification thereof into stages 
consistent with the definitions applied in accordance 
with the policy approved by the respective company’s 
Board of Directors including the appropriateness of the 
qualitative factors to be applied;
• Completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of 
information used in the estimation of the PD and LGD 
for the different stages depending on the nature of 
the portfolio; and
• Accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate 
including reasonableness of the methodology used to 
determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments 
to the output of the ECL Model.
Test of details on a sample in respect of the following:
• Accuracy and completeness of the input data such 
as period of default and other related information 
used in estimating the PD;
• The mathematical accuracy of the ECL computation 
by using the same input data as used by the Group.
• Completeness and accuracy of the staging of the 
loans and the underlying data based on which the ECL 
estimates have been computed.
• Evaluating the adequacy of the adjustments made 
to the output as per the ECL Model to ensure that 
the adjustment was in conformity with the policy 
approved by the Audit Committee of the Companies 
included in the Group.

Information Technology and General Controls:
The Group is dependent on its Information 
Technology (“IT”) systems due to the significant 
number of transactions that are processed daily 
across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, 
IT application controls are critical to ensure that 
changes to applications and underlying data are 
made in an appropriate manner and under controlled 
environments. Appropriate controls contribute to 
mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as 
a result of changes to applications and data. On 
account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the 
testing of the general computer controls of the IT 
systems used in financial reporting was considered 
to be a Key Audit Matter.
•
With the assistance of IT specialists, we obtained 
an understanding of the Group’s IT applications, 
databases and operating systems relevant to financial 
reporting and the control environment. For these 
elements of the IT infrastructure the areas of our 
focus included access security (including controls 
over privileged access), program change controls, 
database management and network operations.
In particular:
• We tested the design, implementation, and 
operating effectiveness of the Group’s general IT 
controls over the IT systems relevant to financial 
reporting. This included evaluation of Group’s 
controls over segregation of duties and access rights 
being provisioned / modified based on duly approved 
requests, access for exit cases being revoked in a 
timely manner and access of all users being recertified 
during the period of audit.
• We also tested key automated business cycle 
controls 
and 
logic 
for 
the 
reports 
generated 
through the IT infrastructure that were relevant for 
financial reporting or were used in the exercise of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements.
Our tests included testing of the compensating 
controls or alternate procedures to assess whether 
there were any unaddressed IT risks that would 
materially impact the Financial Statements.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Director’s Report including Annexures to Director’s 
Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the financial statements and 
auditor’s report thereon. These reports are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information identified above when it 
becomes available and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect 
to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance, including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company 
in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
128
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial 
statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements 
in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Annexure ‘B’ To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’  
section of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financials Statements under 
Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of Mufin Green 
Finance Limited (the “Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on 
Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
A company’s internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and 
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to 
standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Preparation and material accounting policies
2.1	 Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation and Presentation
	
The Standalone Balance Sheet, the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss and the Standalone Statement of 
Changes in Equity are prepared and presented in the format prescribed in the Division III of Schedule III to the 
Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”). The Standalone Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and presented 
as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The Standalone Balance Sheet, Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss, Standalone Statement of Cash Flows and Standalone Statement of Change in 
Equity are together referred as the standalone financial statements of the Company.
	
The standalone financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended under Section 133 of Act and relevant amendment rules issued 
thereafter (“Ind AS”).
	
The standalone financial statements are prepared and presented on going concern basis and the relevant 
provisions of Act and the guidelines and directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or any other 
authority, to the extent applicable.
	
Amounts in the standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees in lakhs rounded off to two 
decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to the Act. Per share data is presented in Indian Rupee to two 
decimal places. The Company presents its Standalone Balance Sheet in the order of liquidity. An analysis 
regarding maturity of assets and liabilities within 12 months after the reporting date and more than 12 months 
after the reporting date is presented in Note 40.
	
Accounting policies are consistently applied except where a newly-issued Ind AS initially adopted or a revision 
to an existing IND AS requires a change in the accounting policy.
2.2	 Functional and Presentation Currency
	
The standalone financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (Rs.) which is the functional and the 
presentation currency of the Company and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs with two decimals, except 
when otherwise indicated.
2.3	 Basis of Measurement
	
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments that are measured at fair values.
	
A historical cost is a measure of value used for accounting in which the price of an asset on the Standalone 
Balance Sheet is based on its historical cost, it is generally fair value of consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services at the time of transaction or original cost when acquired by the Company.
	
Fair value is the price that likely to be received on sell of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants on the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, 
the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or 
disclosure purposes in the standalone financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing 
transactions that are within the scope of IND AS 116 Leases.
	
Fair value measurements under IND AS are categorized into fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value 
141
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED

measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
	
•	
Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company 
can access on measurement date;
	
•	
Level 2 inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
•	
Level 3 where unobservable inputs are used for the valuation of assets or liabilities.
2.4	 Use of Estimates and Judgements
	
The preparation of the standalone financial statements in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards 
(“Ind AS”) requires the management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions. These estimates, 
judgements and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the standalone financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting estimates could change from period 
to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized 
prospectively. The Management believes that the estimates used in preparation of the standalone financial 
statements are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ due to these estimates and the differences 
between the actual results and the estimates are recognized in the periods in which the results are known/ 
materialize. Some of the areas involving significant estimation / judgement are determination of Expected Credit 
Loss, fair valuation of Investments, Repossessed assets, Income taxes and employee benefits.
2.5	 Material Accounting Policies
2.5.1 	
Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company 
and the revenue can be reliably measured and there exists reasonable certainty of its recovery.
2.5.1.1	
Interest
	
	
Interest income on financial instruments is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the 
amount outstanding and the effective interest rate (“EIR”) applicable.
	
	
The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows of the financial instrument through 
the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying 
amount. The future cash flows are estimated taking into account all the contractual terms of the instrument.
	
	
The calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are 
incremental and directly attributable to the specific lending arrangement, transaction costs, and all other 
premiums or discounts. For financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), 
transaction costs are   recognized in the standalone statement of profit and loss at initial recognition.
	
	
Interest income/ expenses is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount (principal not 
due) of non-credit impaired financial assets/liabilities (i.e. at the amortized cost of the financial asset before 
adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance). For credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is 
calculated by applying the EIR to the amortized cost of the credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. the gross 
carrying amount less the allowance for expected credit losses). Further, in terms of RBI Guidelines, interest 
accrued on credit impaired assets is recognized as and when received.
2.5.1.2	
Dividend Income
	
	
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right to receive dividend is established. 
2.5.1.3	
Fee and Commission Income
	
	
Fee and commission income include fees other than those that are an integral part of EIR. The Company 
recognizes the fee and commission income in accordance with the terms of the relevant contracts/ 
agreement and when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration.
2.5.1.4	
 Net gain on fair value change 
	
	
Any differences between the fair values on the date of acquisition and balance sheet date of the financial 
assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss, held by the Company on the balance sheet date 
is recognized as an unrealized gain/loss in the standalone statement of profit and loss. In cases there 
Notes forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
142
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
is a net gain in aggregate, the same is recognized in “Net gains on fair value changes” under revenue 
from operations and if there is a net loss, the same is disclosed in “Net loss on fair value changes”, in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.1.5	
 Other operational revenue
	
	
Other operational revenue represents income earned from the activities incidental to the main business 
and is recognized when the right to receive the income is established as per the terms of the contract and 
Late payment interest, bouncing charges etc. are accounted on the receipt basis.
2.5.1.6	
Other Income
	
	
Other Income represents income earned from the activities other than the main business is recognized 
when the right to receive the income is established as per the terms of the contract.
2.5.2 	
Financial Instruments
2.5.2.1	
Fair Valuation of Investments 
	
	
Some of the Company’s Investments are measured at fair value. In determining the fair value of such 
Investments, the Company uses quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or based 
on inputs which are observable either directly or indirectly. However, in certain cases, the Company adopts 
valuation techniques and inputs which are not based on market data. When Market observable information 
is not available, the Company has applied appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the valuation 
model.
2.5.2.2	
Recognition and Initial Measurement
	
	
All financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans and borrowings are initially recognized on 
the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
	
	
Loans are recognized when fund transfer is initiated or disbursement cheque is issued to the customer. The 
Company recognizes debt securities and borrowings (other than debt securities) when funds are received 
by the Company.
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs and revenues 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value 
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs and 
revenues directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities measured at FVTPL 
are recognized immediately in the standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.3	
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities
2.5.2.3.1	Financial Assets
	
	
The Company classifies and measures all its financial assets based on the business model for managing the 
assets and the asset’s contractual terms, either at:
	
	
-	
Amortized cost
	
	
-	
Fair Value through other comprehensive income
	
	
-	
Fair Value through Profit and Loss
2.5.2.3.1.1 	
Amortized Cost
	
	
	
The Company classifies and measures cash and bank balances, Loans, Trade receivable, certain debt 
investments and other financial assets at amortized cost if the following condition is met:
	
	
	
Financial Assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets 
in    order to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are Solely 
Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI);

MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
2.5.2.3.1.2	
Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVOCI”) 
	
	
	
The Company classifies and measures certain debt instruments at FVOCI when the investments are 
held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both, collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling the financial instruments and the contractual terms of the financial instruments meet 
the Solely Payment of Principal and Interest on principal amount outstanding (‘SPPI’) test.
2.5.2.3.1.3	
Fair value through Profit and Loss (“FVTPL”) 
	
	
	
	Financial assets at FVTPL are:
	
	
	
-	
assets with contractual cash flows that are not SPPI; and/or
	
	
	
-	
assets that are held in a business model other than held to collect contractual cash flows or held 
to collect and sell; or
	
	
	
-	
assets designated at FVTPL using the fair value option.
	
	
	
These assets are measured at fair value, with any gains/ losses arising on remeasurement is recognized 
in the standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.3.1.4	
FVOCI- Equity Instruments 
	
	
	
The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, 
unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity instruments 
at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments 
and are not held for trading.
	
	
	
If the Company elects to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in other comprehensive income. This cumulative gain 
or loss is not reclassified to standalone statement of profit and loss on disposal of such instruments. 
Investments representing equity interest in subsidiary, joint venture and associate are carried at cost 
less any provision for impairment.
	
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets.
	
	
	
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL.
2.5.2.4	
Evaluation of Business Model
	
	
Classification and measurement of financial instruments depends on the results of the Solely Payments 
of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding (“SPPI”) and the business model test 
(refer note 2.5.2.4.1). The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how the 
Company’s financial instruments are managed together to achieve a particular business objective.
	
	
The Company monitors financial assets measured at amortized cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income that are derecognized prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their 
disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was 
held. Monitoring is part of the Company’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for which 
the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether 
there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those 
instruments.
2.5.2.4.1 Business Model Test
	
	
An assessment of business model for managing financial assets is fundamental to the classification of a 
financial asset. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how financial assets 
are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. The Company’s business model does 
not depend on management’s intentions for an individual instrument; therefore, the business model 
assessment is performed at a higher level of aggregation rather than on an instrument-by-instrument 
basis.
	
	
The Company considers all relevant information and evidence available when making the business model 
assessment such as:
Notes forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
144
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
	
	
•	
how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model 
are evaluated and reported to the Company’s key management personnel;
	
	
•	
the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that 
business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and
	
	
•	
how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair 
value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
	
	
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Company determines whether newly recognized financial 
assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect a new business model. The Company 
reassesses its business model at each reporting period to determine whether the business model has 
changed since the preceding period. For the current and prior reporting period the Company has not 
identified a change in its business model.
	
	
Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (“SPPI”) on the principal amount outstanding
	
	
For an asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, its contractual terms should give 
rise to cash flows that meet SPPI test.
	
	
For the purpose of SPPI test, principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. That 
principal amount may change over the life of the financial asset (e.g. if there are repayments of principal). 
Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the 
principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, 
as well as a profit margin.
	
	
Contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are 
unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity 
prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are SPPI, such financial assets are either classified as 
fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
2.5.2.4.1.1	
Subsequent Measurement and Gain and Losses
	
	
	
Financial Assets at Amortized Cost
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The 
amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income as per EIR and impairment loss are 
recognized in standalone statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized 
in standalone statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Debt Instrument at FVOCI
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income is recognized in standalone 
statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on subsequent measurement is recognized in OCI 
and on derecognition the cumulative gain or loss recognized in OCI will be recycled to standalone 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Equity Instrument at FVOCI
	
	
	
Gains and losses on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and never recycled to the standalone statement of profit and loss. Dividends are recognized 
in profit or loss as dividend income when the right to receive payment has been established, except 
when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of whole or part of the cost of the 
instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are fair 
valued at each reporting date and not subject to an impairment assessment.
	
	
	
Financial Assets at FVTPL
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gain or losses, including any interest or 
dividend income, are recognized in the standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.4.1.2	
Reclassifications
	
	
	
If the business model under which the Company holds financial assets changes, the financial assets 
affected are reclassified. The classification and measurement requirements related to the new 
category apply prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the change in 
business model that result in reclassifying the Company’s financial assets.

2.5.2.4.2		
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
2.5.2.4.2.1 
Classification as Debt or Equity
	
	
	
Debt and equity instruments that are issued are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
	
	
	
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially 
unfavorable to the Company or a contract that will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity 
instruments and is a non-derivative contract for which the Company is or may be obliged to deliver 
a variable number of its own equity instruments, or a derivative contract over own equity that will or 
may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash (or another financial asset) for 
a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments.
2.5.2.4.2.2	
Equity Instruments
	
	
	
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the face 
value and proceeds received in excess of the face value are recognized as Securities Premium.
2.5.2.4.2.3	
Subsequent Measurement and Gain and Losses
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
Interest expense is recognized in standalone statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on 
derecognition is recognized in standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.5	
Impairment and Write-off
	
	
The Company recognizes loss allowances for Expected Credit Losses on the following financial instruments 
that are not measured at FVTPL:
	
	
-	
Loans and advances to customers;
	
	
-	
Other financial assets; 
	
	
-	
Loan commitments
	
	
Equity instruments are measured at fair value and not subject to an impairment loss. 
	
	
ECL is required to be measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
	
	
•	
12-month ECL, i.e., loss allowance on default events on the financial instrument that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date, (referred to as Stage 1); or
	
	
•	
Lifetime ECL, i.e. lifetime ECL that results from all possible default events over the life of the financial 
instrument, (referred to as Stage 2 and Stage 3).
	
	
A loss allowance for lifetime ECL is required for a financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial 
instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, ECL is 
measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL.
	
	
The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period whether 
a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instruments.
	
	
Based on the above process, the Company categorizes its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as 
described below:
	
	
Stage 1: When loans are first recognized, the Company recognizes an allowance based on 12 months ECL. 
Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified 
from Stage 2 to Stage 1.
	
	
Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Company records 
an allowance for the life time expected credit losses.
	
	
Stage 3: When loans are considered credit-impaired, the Company records an allowance for the life 
time expected credit losses. Stage 3 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved but 
considered as credit impaired assets as per regulatory guidelines.

For financial assets for which the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering either the entire 
outstanding amount, or a proportion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced. 
This is considered a (partial) derecognition/impairment of the financial asset.
2.5.2.6	
Determination of Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”)
	
	
The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across all categories of financial assets requires judgement.
	
	
In particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows based on Company’s historical 
experience and collateral values when determining impairment losses along with the assessment of a 
significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can 
result in different levels of allowances.
	
	
Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgments and estimates include:
	
	
•	
Bifurcation of the financial assets into different portfolios when ECL is assessed on a collective basis.
	
	
•	
Company’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
•	
Development of ECL models, including choice of inputs/ assumptions used.
	
	
The various inputs used and the process followed by the Company in measurement of ECL has been 
detailed below:
2.5.2.6.1	Measurement of Expected Credit Losses
	
	
The Company calculates ECL based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure expected cash shortfalls, 
discounted at an approximation to the portfolio. A cash shortfall is a difference between the cash flows that 
are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to 
receive.
	
	
When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Company estimates the expected portion of the 
loan commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present 
value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down. The expected cash shortfalls are 
discounted  at an approximation to the Interest rate on the loan.
	
	
The Company measures ECL on an individual basis, or on a collective basis for portfolios of loans that share 
similar economic risk characteristics. The measurement of the loss allowance is based on the present value 
of the asset’s expected cash flows using the asset’s original EIR, regardless of whether it is measured on 
an individual basis or a collective basis.
	
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:
	
	
Exposure at Default (EAD) is based on the amounts the Company expects to be owed at the time of default. 
For a revolving commitment, the Company includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount 
that is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur.
	
	
Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (as 
per ‘’Definition of default and credit-impaired’’) either over the next 12 months (12 months PD), or over 
the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.
	
	
Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Company’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted 
exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and preference of claim and availability of collateral or 
other credit support.
	
	
Forward-looking economic information (including management overlay) is included in determining the 
12-month and lifetime PD, EAD and LGD. The assumptions underlying the expected credit loss are monitored 
and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
2.5.2.6.2 Significant Increase in Credit Risk
	
	
The Company monitors all financial assets, including loan commitments contracts issued that are subject to 
impairment requirements, to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk the Company measures the loss allowance 
based on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL. The Company monitors all financial assets, issued loan 
commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are subject to impairment for a significant increase in 
credit risk.

MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED

In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the 
reporting date based on the remaining maturity of the instrument with the risk of a default occurring that 
was anticipated for the remaining maturity at the current reporting date when the financial instrument 
was first recognized. In making this assessment, the Company considers both quantitative and qualitative 
information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience that is available without 
undue cost or effort.
	
	
The quantitative factors that indicate a significant increase in credit risk are reflected in PD models on a 
timely   basis. However, the Company still considers separately some qualitative factors to assess if credit 
risk has increased significantly. For corporate lending, there is a particular focus on assets that are included 
on a ‘watch list’. Given an exposure is on a watch list once, there is a concern that the credit worthiness 
of the specific counterparty has deteriorated. ECL assessment for watch list accounts is done on a case by 
case approach after considering the probability of weighted average in a different recovery scenario. For 
individual loans the    Company considers the expectation of forbearance, payment holidays, and events 
such as unemployment, bankruptcy, divorce, or death.
	
	
Given that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is a relative measure, a given change, 
in absolute terms, in the PD is more significant for a financial instrument with a lower initial PD than 
compared    to a financial instrument with a higher PD.
2.5.2.6.3	Credit-Impaired Financial Assets
	
	
A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are 
referred to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit-impairment includes observable data about the following 
events:
	
	
•	
significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
	
	
•	
a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
	
	
•	
restructuring of loans due to financial difficulty of the borrowers;
	
	
•	
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties; or
	
	
•	
the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.
	
	
It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event. Instead the combined effect of several events may 
have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. The Company assesses whether debt instruments 
that are financial assets measured at amortized cost are credit-impaired at each reporting date. To assess if 
corporate debt instruments are credit impaired, the Company considers factors such as bond yields, credit 
ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise funds.
	
	
A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is granted to the borrower due to deterioration in 
the borrower’s financial condition. The definition of default includes unlikeliness to pay indicators and a 
back-stop if amounts are overdue for more than 90 days.
2.5.2.6.4 Definition of Default
	
	
The definition of default is used in measuring the amount of ECL and in the determination of whether the 
loss allowance is based on 12-month or lifetime ECL.
	
	
The Company considers the following as constituting an event of default:
	
	
•	
the borrower is past due more than 90 days+ Accounts Identified by the Company as NPA as per 
regulatory guidelines + Objective Evidence for impairment (Qualitative Overlay); or
	
	
•	
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company.
	
	
When assessing if the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligation, the Company takes into account 
both qualitative and quantitative indicators. The information assessed depends on the type of the asset, 
for example in corporate lending a qualitative indicator used is the breach of covenants, which is not 
as relevant for individual lending. Quantitative indicators, such as overdue status and non-payment on 
another obligation of the same counterparty are key inputs in this analysis.

2.5.2.6.5 Write-off
	
	
Loans are written off when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial 
asset (either in its entirety or a portion of it). This is the case when the Company determines that the 
borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay 
the amounts subject to the write-off. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. The Company may 
apply enforcement activities to financial assets written off/ may assign/ sell loan exposure to ARC/ Bank/ a 
financial institution for a negotiated consideration. Balance loan outstanding after expected recovery from 
sale of vehicles, security deposit, settlement etc. are written off in the standalone statement of profit and 
Loss. Recoveries resulting from the Company’s enforcement activities could result in impairment gains and 
same is adjusted in Impairment on financial instruments.
2.5.2.7	
Modification and Derecognition of Financial Assets
	
	
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a financial 
asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between the initial recognition and maturity of the financial 
asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows either immediately 
or at a future date. In addition, the introduction or adjustment of existing covenants of an existing loan 
would constitute a modification even if these new or adjusted covenants do not yet affect the cash flows 
immediately but may affect the cash flows depending on whether the covenant is or is not met (e.g. a 
change to the increase in the interest rate that arises when covenants are breached).
	
	
The Company renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulty to maximize collection and minimize 
the risk of default. Loan forbearance is granted in cases where although the borrower made all reasonable 
efforts to pay under the original contractual terms, there is a high risk of default or default has already 
happened and the borrower is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms in most of 
the cases include an extension of the maturity of the loan, changes to the timing of the cash flows of the 
loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in the amount of cash flows due (principal and interest 
forgiveness) and amendments to covenants.
	
	
When a financial asset is modified the Company assesses whether this modification results in derecognition. 
In accordance with the Company’s policy, a modification results in derecognition when it gives rise to 
substantially different terms. To determine if the modified terms are substantially different from the original 
contractual terms the Company considers the following:
	
	
Qualitative factors, such as contractual cash flows after modification, are no longer SPPI, change in currency 
or change of counterparty, the extent of change in interest rates, maturity, covenants, if these do not clearly 
indicate a substantial modification, then; a quantitative assessment is performed to compare the present 
value of the remaining contractual cash flows under the original terms with the contractual cash flows 
under the revised terms, both amounts discounted at the original EIR. If there is a significant difference in 
present value, the Company deems the arrangement substantially different, leading to derecognition.
	
	
In the case where the financial asset is derecognized the loss allowances for ECL is remeasured at the date 
of derecognition to determine the net carrying amount of the asset at that date. The difference between 
this revised carrying amount and the fair value of the new financial asset with the revised terms may lead 
to a gain  or loss on derecognition. The new financial asset may have a loss allowance measured based on 
12-month ECL except where the new loan is considered to be originated-credit impaired. This applies only 
in the case where the fair value of the new loan is recognized at a significant discount to its revised par 
amount because there remains a high risk of default which has not been reduced by the modification. The 
Company monitors the credit risk of modified financial assets by evaluating qualitative and quantitative 
information, such as if the borrower is in past due status under the new terms.
	
	
When the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in 
derecognition, the Company determines if the financial asset’s credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition by comparing:
	
	
•	
The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual 
terms;
	
	
•	
The remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms.
	
	
For financial assets modified, where modification does not result in derecognition, the estimate of PD 
reflects the Company’s ability to collect the modified cash flows taking into account the Company’s previous 
experience of similar forbearance action, as well as various behavioural indicators, including the borrower’s 
Notes forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025

payment performance against the modified contractual terms. If the credit risk remains significantly higher 
than what was expected at initial recognition, the loss allowance is continued to be measured at an amount 
equal to lifetime ECL. The loss allowance on forborne loans is generally measured based on 12-month ECL 
when there is evidence of the borrower’s improved repayment behaviour following modification leading to 
a reversal of the previous significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
Where a modification does not lead to derecognition, the Company calculates the modification gain/loss 
comparing the gross carrying amount before and after the modification (excluding the ECL allowance). 
Then the Company measures ECL for the modified asset, where the expected cash flows arising from the 
modified financial asset are included in calculating the expected cash shortfalls from the original asset.
	
	
The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the asset’s cash flows expire 
(including expiry arising from a modification with substantially different terms), or when the financial asset 
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to another entity. If the 
Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to 
control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated 
liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognize the financial asset and also 
recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
	
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain/loss that had been 
recognized  in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognized in the standalone statement of profit and loss, 
with the exception of equity investment designated as measured at FVOCI, where the cumulative gain/loss 
previously recognized in OCI is not subsequently reclassified to the standalone statement of profit and loss.
	
	
On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Company retains an option 
to repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Company allocates the previous carrying amount of the 
financial asset between the part it continues to recognize under continuing involvement, and the part it 
no longer recognizes on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The 
difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the sum of 
the consideration received for the part no longer recognized and any cumulative gain/loss allocated to it 
that  had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the standalone statement of profit and loss. A cumulative 
gain/loss that had been recognized in OCI is allocated between the part that continues to be recognized 
and the part that is no longer recognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts. This does 
not apply for equity investments designated as measured at FVOCI, as the cumulative gain/loss previously 
recognized in OCI is not subsequently reclassified to the standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.8	
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities
	
	
The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability 
derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in the standalone statement of profit 
and loss.
2.5.2.9	
Assets acquired under settlement
	
	
Asset acquired under settlement are measured at the prevailing market price/fair valuation including cost 
of acquisition, whichever is lower, on periodic basis. Any profit or loss arising on the sale of assets acquired 
under settlement of claims is recognized in Standalone statement of profit and loss.
2.5.3	
Investments in subsidiaries
	
	
Investment in subsidiaries are recognised at cost and are not adjusted to fair value at the end of each 
reporting period as allowed by Ind AS 27 ‘Separate financial statement’. Cost of investment represents 
amount paid for acquisition of the said investment.
	
	
The Company reviews the carrying amounts of its investments in subsidiaries at the end of each reporting 
period, to determine whether there is any indication that those investments have impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any) and provided for accordingly. Such impairment loss is reduced from the 
carrying value of investments

2.5.4	
Property, Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)
	
	
PPE held for use are stated in the Standalone Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
	
	
PPE is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item is expected 
to flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. PPE is stated at original cost 
net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment, if any. 
Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of PPE 
are allocated and capitalized as a part of the cost of the PPE.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits    are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the standalone statement of profit 
and loss.
2.5.5	
Intangible Assets
	
	
Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible 
assets are stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortization 
and cumulative impairment. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically 
attributable to acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and capitalized as a part of the cost of the 
intangible assets.
	
	
Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Intangible 
assets under development”.
	
	
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
use or disposal. Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets are recognized in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.
2.5.6	
Capital work-in-progress
	
	
Capital work in progress includes assets not ready for the intended use and is carried at cost, comprising 
direct cost and related incidental expenses.
2.5.7	
Depreciation and Amortization
	
	
Depreciation is recognized using written down value method so as to write off the cost of the assets less 
their residual values over their estimated useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Act. Depreciation 
method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect expected pattern of consumption of the future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed 
at each financial year end with the effect of any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is 
recognized on prospective basis.
	
	
Depreciation for additions to/deductions from, owned assets is calculated pro rata to the period of use. The 
useful life of the property, plant and equipment determined by the Company is as follows:
Class of Assets
Useful Life
Computer/Laptop
3 years
Server
6 years
Office Equipment
5 years
Furniture & Fixtures
10 years
	
	
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on written down value basis over the estimated 
useful life. The method of amortization and useful life are reviewed at the end of each accounting year with 
the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount 
with its carrying amount annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be 
impaired.

2.5.8	
Impairment of Assets other than Financial Instruments
	
	
As at the end of each accounting year, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If such indication exists, the PPE and intangible assets are tested for impairment so as to determine the 
impairment loss, if any.
2.5.9	
Employee Benefits
	
	
Short term Employee Benefits
	
	
Employee benefits falling due within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term 
employee benefits and are expensed in the period in which the employee renders the related service. 
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount 
of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
	
	
Defined Contribution Plans 
	
	
Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employees’ state insurance, employee provident 
fund and employee pension scheme etc. are charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made as and when services are rendered by the employees. Company’s provident fund 
contribution is made to a government administered fund and charged as an expense to the standalone 
statement of profit and Loss. The above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the 
Company has no further defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
	
	
Post-employment Benefits
	
	
The Company operates defined benefit plan in the form of gratuity and compensated absence. The liability 
or asset recognized in the Standalone Balance Sheet in respect of its defined benefit plans is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
said obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out flows, using market yields 
of government bonds that have tenure approximating the tenures of the related liability. The interest 
expenses are calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The net 
interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized in the standalone statement of 
profit and loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period in which they occur, directly in Other Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income. They are included in Other Equity in the Standalone Statement of Change in 
Equity and in the Standalone Balance Sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognized immediately in profit or loss as past 
service cost. 
2.5.10	
Leases
	
	
The Company as Lessee
	
	
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office premises. The Company assesses 
whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the 
contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the 
Company assesses whether:
	
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset
	
	
(ii)	
the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period 
of the lease and
	
	
(iii)	 the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease 
term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be 
exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Standalone Balance Sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
	
	
The Company as Lessor
	
	
The Company as a lessor, classifies leases as either operating lease or finance lease. A lease is classified as 
a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying 
asset. Initially asset held under finance lease is recognized in Standalone Balance Sheet and presented as 
a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Finance income is recognized over the 
lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on Company’s net investment 
in the lease. 
	
	
A lease which is not classified as a finance lease is an operating lease. Accordingly, the Company recognizes 
lease payments as income on a straight-line basis in case of assets given on operating leases. The Company 
presents underlying assets subject to operating lease in its Standalone Balance Sheet under the respective 
class of asset.
2.5.11	
Securities Premium
	
	
(i)	
Securities premium includes the difference between the face value of the equity shares and the 
consideration received in respect of shares issued under preferential allotment as equity shares by 
the company.
	
	
(ii)	
The issue expenses of securities which qualify as equity instruments are adjusted against securities 
premium.
2.5.12	
Share-based payment arrangements
	
	
The stock options to be granted to employees by the company under MGFL Employee Stock Option Plan 
2023’ (“ESOP 2023”/” Plan”), will be measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date. 
	
	
The fair value of the options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the 
vesting period on a straight line basis. 
	
	
The amount recognized as expense in each year is arrived at based on the number of grants expected to vest. 
2.5.13	
Dividends on Equity Shares
	
	
The Company recognizes a liability to make cash distributions to equity shareholders of the Company 
when the dividend is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company and 
a corresponding amount is recognized directly in equity. As per the corporate laws in India, an interim 
dividend is authorized when it is approved by the Board of Directors and final dividend is authorized when 
it is approved by the shareholders.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
	
Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term deposits 
with banks (with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of placement) and cheques on 
hand. Short term and liquid investments being subject to more than insignificant risk of change in value, 
are not included as part of cash and cash equivalents.
2.5.15	
Finance Costs
	
	
Finance costs include interest expense calculated using the EIR on respective financial instruments and 
borrowings is measured at amortized cost, amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the 
arrangement of borrowings and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.
2.5.16	
Foreign Currencies
	
	
(i)	
Functional currency of the Company and foreign operations has been determined based on the 
primary economic environment in which the Company and its foreign operations operate considering 
the currency in which funds are generated, spent and retained.
	
	
(ii)	
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency are recorded on initial 
recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign 
currency monetary items are reported at the rates prevailing at the year-end. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
	
	
Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at each 
Balance Sheet date at the closing spot rate are recognized in the standalone statement of profit and Loss 
in the period in which they arise.
2.5.17	
Segments
	
	
Operating segments are those components of the business whose operating results are regularly reviewed 
by the Chief Operating Decision making body in the Company to make decisions for performance assessment 
and resource allocation. Operating Segment are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to accounting policies are in line with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision maker.
2.5.18	
Earnings Per Share
	
	
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per 
share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is 
determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares.
2.5.19	
Taxes on Income
	
	
The Company’s tax jurisdiction is in India. Significant judgements are involved in determining the provision 
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for certain tax positions.
	
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognized in the 
standalone statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognized outside 
standalone statement of profit and loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in 
which case tax is also recognized outside standalone statement of profit and loss.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business 
loss and depreciation carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax 
losses and depreciation carry-forwards could be utilized.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent 
Notes forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
154
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date, and are 
recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered.	
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period    when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
	
	
The Company provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate that is expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities where an outflow is probable.
2.5.20	
Goods and Services Tax Input Credit
	
	
Goods and Services tax input credit is recognized in the books of account in the period in which the supply 
of goods or service received is recognized and when there is no uncertainty in availing/utilizing the credits.
2.5.21	
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
	
	
(a)	 Provisions are recognized when:
	
	
	
(i)	
The Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and
	
	
	
(ii)	
It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation; and
	
	
	
(iii)	 A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
	
	
Provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation and when the effect 
of time value of money is material, the carrying amount of the provision is the present value of those cash 
flows.
	
	
(b)	 Contingent Liability is disclosed in case of:
	
	
	
(i)	
A present obligation arising from past events, when it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation; or
	
	
	
(ii)	
A present obligation arising from past events, when no reliable estimate is possible.
	
	
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under such contract, the present obligation under the contract is recognized and 
measured as a provision.
	
	
(c)	
Contingent Assets:
	
	
	
(i)	
Contingent assets are not recognized in the standalone financial statements.
	
	
	
(ii)

Recent Accounting Developments
3.1	 Law enacted but not effective
	
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-
employment benefits received Indian Parliament’s approval and Presidential assent in September 2020. The 
Code has been published in the Gazette of India and subsequently, on November 13, 2020, draft rules were 
published and stakeholders’ suggestions were invited. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect 
has not been notified. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into effect and will record 
any related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
3.2	  New Standards/ Amendments notified 
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 
2025, MCA has notified Ind AS 117 – Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating 
to sale and lease back transactions, applicable from April 1, 2024. The Company has assessed that there is no 
significant impact on its financial statements.   
	
On May 9, 2025, MCA notifies the amendments to Ind AS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. These 
amendments aim to provide clearer guidance on assessing currency exchangeability and estimating exchange 
rates when currencies are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after April 1, 2025. The Company is currently assessing the probable impact of these amendments on its 
financial statements.

Note 39 : Financial Risk Management 
The Company is mainly engaged in Investment and Finance Activities. The Company’s principal financial liabilities 
comprise debt securities, borrowings (other than debt securities) and other payables. The main purpose of these 
financial liabilities is to finance and support Company’s operations. The Company’s principal financial assets include 
loans, term deposits with banks, Investments, cash and cash equivalents and receivables. 
The risk management policies of the Company are established to identify and analyses the risks faced by the Company, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities.
The Company is exposed to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s management oversees the 
management of these risks to ensure the Company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and 
procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Company’s policies and 
risk objectives. The major risks are summarized below:
39.1	Credit Risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or a customer 
contract, leading to financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities towards Loans 
to various customers. The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of 
each customer. Credit risk has always been managed by the company through credit approvals, establish credit limits 
and continuous monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the company grants credit terms in the normal 
course of business.
	
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a borrower failing to 
engage in a repayment plan with the Company. Where loans/interest have been written off, the Company continues to 
engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the loans/receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are 
recognized as income in the standalone statement of profit and loss.
	
The Company measures the expected credit loss of other receivables/loans based on historical trend, available external 
and internal credit risk factors such as financial condition, ageing of accounts receivable etc., regulatory norms, industry 
practices and the business environment in which the entity operates. Refer note 2.5.2.5 and 2.5.2.6 for Impairment 
and Write-off and Expected Credit Loss (ECL) policy of the Company.

not been adequately provided for. The carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the standalone financial 
statements, grossed up for any allowances for losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.

Level 2 - 	 Input other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	
Level 3- 	 Inputs for the assets or the liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
Inputs)
	
Valuation Methodologies of financial instruments measured at fair value: 
Type of Instruments
Valuation technique
Significant 
unobservable 
inputs
Inter-relationship 
between 
significant unob-
servable inputs and 
fair value 
measurement

Asset Value (NAV) as stated by the 
issuer of these Mutual Fund Units in 
the published statements as at Balance 
Sheet date and are classified as Level 
1. NAV represents the price at which

in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
	
(ii)	 The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value:
	
	
(a) 	 Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, other payables and other 
financial liabilities, approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of 
these instruments.
	
	
(b) 	 Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on 
parameters such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this 
evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of Mufin Green Finance Limited
Report on the audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Mufin Green Finance Limited (the “Company”) 
and its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the 
consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash 
flows for the year then ended, and a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information 
(hereinafter referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
consolidated financial statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the 
manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under 
section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended (“Ind AS”) 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 
March 2025 and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes 
in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date..
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report.
#
Key audit matter
How the key audit matter was addressed in our 
Audit
Allowances 
for 
Expected 
Credit 
Losses 
(“ECL”):
As at 31 March 2025, the carrying value of loan 
assets measured at amortised cost, aggregated 
₹82,741.92 lakhs (net of allowance of expected 
credit loss ₹758.76 lakhs) constituting approximately 
80.07% of the Group’s total assets.
Significant judgement is used in classifying these 
loan assets and applying appropriate measurement 
principles. ECL on such loan assets carried at 
amortised cost is a critical estimate involving 
greater level of management judgement. As part 
of our risk assessment, we determined that the ECL 
on such loan assets has a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes for the Standalone Financial Statements. 
Auditors of subsidiary and we have examined the policies 
approved by the respective Board of Directors of the 
Company that articulate the objectives of managing 
each portfolio and their business models. Auditors of the 
subsidiary and we have also verified the methodology 
adopted for computation of ECL (“ECL Model”) that 
addresses policies approved by the respective Board of 
Directors, procedures and controls for assessing and 
measuring credit risk on all lending exposures measured 
at amortised cost. Additionally, Auditors of the subsidiary 
and we have confirmed that adjustments to the output 
of the ECL Model are consistent with the documented 
rationale and basis for such adjustments and that 
the amount of adjustment has been approved by the 
respective Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Our audit procedures related to the allowance for ECL 
included the following, among others:
205
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
The elements of estimating ECL which involved 
increased level of audit focus are the following:
• Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging 
the loan assets measured at amortised cost;
• Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default 
(“PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and Exposure at 
Default (“EAD”) at product level with past trends;
• Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios 
and probability weights applied to reflect future 
economic conditions; and
• Adjustments to model driven ECL results to 
address emerging trends. (Refer Note 2.5.2.6 and 
35.A  to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
•
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the 
following:
• Completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default 
(“EAD”) and the classification thereof into stages 
consistent with the definitions applied in accordance 
with the policy approved by the respective company’s 
Board of Directors including the appropriateness of the 
qualitative factors to be applied;
• Completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of 
information used in the estimation of the PD and LGD 
for the different stages depending on the nature of the 
portfolio; and 
• Accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate 
including reasonableness of the methodology used to 
determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments 
to the output of the ECL Model.
Test of details on a sample in respect of the following:
• Accuracy and completeness of the input data such as 
period of default and other related information used in 
estimating the PD;
• The mathematical accuracy of the ECL computation 
by using the same input data as used by the Group.
• Completeness and accuracy of the staging of the 
loans and the underlying data based on which the ECL 
estimates have been computed.
• Evaluating the adequacy of the adjustments made 
to the output as per the ECL Model to ensure that the 
adjustment was in conformity with the policy approved 
by the Audit Committee of the Companies included in 
the Group.

Information Technology and General Controls:
The Group is dependent on its Information 
Technology (“IT”) systems due to the significant 
number of transactions that are processed daily 
across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, 
IT application controls are critical to ensure that 
changes to applications and underlying data are 
made in an appropriate manner and under controlled 
environments. Appropriate controls contribute to 
mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as 
a result of changes to applications and data. On 
account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the 
testing of the general computer controls of the IT 
systems used in financial reporting was considered 
to be a Key Audit Matter.
•
With the assistance of IT specialists, the auditors of 
subsidiary company and we obtained an understanding 
of the Group’s IT applications, databases and 
operating systems relevant to financial reporting and 
the control environment. For these elements of the IT 
infrastructure the areas of our focus included access 
security (including controls over privileged access), 
program change controls, database management and 
network operations.
In particular:
• Auditors of subsidiary and we tested the design, 
implementation, and operating effectiveness of the 
Group’s general IT controls over the IT systems 
relevant to financial reporting. This included evaluation 
of Group’s controls over segregation of duties and 
access rights being provisioned / modified based on 
duly approved requests, access for exit cases being 
revoked in a timely manner and access of all users 
being recertified during the period of audit.
• Auditors of subsidiary and we also tested key 
automated business cycle controls and logic for the 
reports generated through the IT infrastructure that 
were relevant for financial reporting or were used 
in the exercise of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Our tests included testing of the compensating 
controls or alternate procedures to assess whether 
there were any unaddressed IT risks that would 
materially impact the Financial Statements.

Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report 
including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and 
Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. These reports 
are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, 
compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to 
these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the 
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action, if required.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with 
respect to the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view 
of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the Ind AS and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective 
Boards of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the 
financial reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for 
207
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated 
in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated 
financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
We did not audit the financial statements of two subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets of 
₹1,588.92 lakhs as at 31 March 2025, total revenue of ₹2,130.68 Lakhs and net cash inflow amounting to ₹ 11.94 
Lakhs for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements, whose financial 
statements have not been audited by us. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose 
reports have been furnished to us by the management and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in 
so far as it relates to the amount and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in terms 
of sub-section (3) of section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on the 
reports of the other auditors.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements above, and our report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
below, is not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports 
of the other auditors.

e)	
On the basis of the written representations received from the directors of the Company as on 31 March 2025

f)	
With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
and the operating effectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in “Annexure A” which is based 
on the auditors’ reports of the Parent/ Holding Company and its subsidiary companies incorporated in India. 
Our report expresses an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of internal financial

according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of the report of the other auditors on 
separate financial statements and also the other financial information of the subsidiaries, as noted in the ‘Other 
matter’ paragraph:
	
i)	
The following litigation is pending as on March 31, 2025 having impact on the financial position of the 
Group.
	
	
(a)	
A demand of Rs. 918.28 lakhs was raised on the company by the concerned authority towards 
payment of stamp duty, under Rajasthan Stamp Act, 1998, on transfer of assets to the company 
during the demerger from APM Industries Limited (Demerged Company). The company has disputed 
this demand and has filed a petition to the concerned authority for withdrawal of the demand. Further, 
as per share transfer agreement, the liability of stamp duty payable on transfer of assets is to be 
borned by the sellers of the shares (i.e. promoters of APM Industries Limited). Hence, in any case 
the amount of the stamp duty will not be charged in the books of accounts of the company as the 
company will get reimbursements of such payments.
	
ii)	
The Group has made provision, as required under the applicable law or accounting standards, for material 
foreseeable losses, if any, on long-term contracts including derivative contracts.
	
iii)	
There were no amounts which were required to be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection 
Fund by the Company.
	
iv)	
(a)	
The respective Managements of the Company and its subsidiaries which are companies incorporated 
in India, whose financial statements have been audited under the Act, have represented to us and 
to the other auditors of such subsidiaries that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, no funds 
(which are material either individually or in the aggregate) have been advanced or loaned or invested 
(either from borrowed funds or share premium or any other sources or kind of funds) by the Company 
or any of such subsidiaries to or in any other person or entity, outside the Group, including foreign 
entity (“Intermediaries”), with the understanding, whether recorded in writing or otherwise, that 
209
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
the Intermediary shall, directly or indirectly lend or invest in other persons or entities identified 
in any manner whatsoever by or on behalf of the Company or any of such subsidiaries (“Ultimate 
Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate Beneficiaries.
	
	
(b)	 The respective Managements of the Company and its subsidiaries which are companies incorporated 
in India, whose financial statements have been audited under the Act, have represented to us that, 
to the best of their knowledge and belief, no funds (which are material either individually or in the 
aggregate) have been received by the Company or any of such subsidiaries from any person or entity, 
including foreign entity (“Funding Parties”), with the understanding, whether recorded in writing or 
otherwise, that the Company or any of such subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, lend or invest in 
other persons or entities identified in any manner whatsoever by or on behalf of the Funding Party 
(“Ultimate Beneficiaries”) or provide any guarantee, security or the like on behalf of the Ultimate

(c)	
Based on the audit procedures that have been considered reasonable and appropriate in the 
circumstances performed by us on the Company and its subsidiaries which are companies incorporated 
in India whose financial statements have been audited under the Act, nothing has come to our notice 
that has caused us to believe that the representations under sub-clause (i) and (ii) of Rule 11(e), as 
provided under (a) and (b) above, contain any material misstatement.
	
v)	
The holding company and its subsidiaries which are incorporated in India, whose financial statements have

software for maintaining their respective books of account for the year ended 31 March 2025, which have 
a feature of recording audit trail (edit log) facility and the same has operated throughout the year for all 
relevant transactions recorded in the respective software.
With respect to the matters specified in clause (xxi) of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the Companies (Auditor’s 
Report) Order, 2020 (the “Order”/ “CARO”) issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 143(11) of the 
Act, to be included in the Auditor’s report, according to the information and explanations given to us, and based on 
the CARO reports issued by us for the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’  
section of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under 
Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 
31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
of Mufin Green Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s and Board of Director’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms 
of their reports referred to in the Other matter(s) paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company 
and its subsidiaries.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial 
control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors 
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to 
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, 
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and 
its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the 
criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the respective 
companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid reports under section 143(3)(i) of the act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls in so far as it relates to two subsidiaries, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

Basis of Preparation and Significant accounting policies
2.1	 Statement of Compliance and Basis of Preparation and Presentation
	
The Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity are prepared and presented in the format prescribed in the Division III of Schedule III 
to the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”). The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows has been prepared and 
presented as per the requirements of Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity are together referred as the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended under Section 133 of Act and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter 
(“Ind AS”).
	
The consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented on going concern basis and the relevant 
provisions of Act and the guidelines and directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or any other 
authority, to the extent applicable.
	
Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees in lakhs rounded off to two 
decimal places as permitted by Schedule III to the Act. Per share data is presented in Indian Rupee to two 
decimal places. The Company presents its Consolidated Balance Sheet in the order of liquidity. An analysis 
regarding maturity of assets and liabilities within 12 months after the reporting date and more than 12 months 
after the reporting date is presented in Note 39.
	
Accounting policies are consistently applied except where a newly-issued Ind AS initially adopted or a revision 
to an existing IND AS requires a change in the accounting policy.
	
Basis of consolidation:
	
The consolidate financial statement incorporate the financial statement of the Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries being the entities that it controls. Subsidiaries are entities where the group exercises or controls 
more than one half of its total share capital. The net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group 
obtains control. The results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to 
their date of disposal, being the date on which control ceases.
	
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions 
and other events in similar circumstances. The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of financial 
statements are consistent with those of previous year. The financial statement of the Company with those of the 
Companies consolidated have been combined on a line by line basis by adding together the book values of like 
items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after eliminating intra group balances, intra group transactions 
and the unrealised profits / losses, unless cost / revenue cannot be recovered.
	
The excess of cost to the Group of its investment, on the acquisition dates over and above the Group’s share 
of equity in the Companies Consolidated, is recognised as Goodwill on Consolidation being an asset in the 
consolidated financial statements. The said Goodwill is not amortised, however, it is tested for impairment as at 
each Balance Sheet date and the impairment loss, if any, is provided for. On the other hand, where the share 
of equity in Companies consolidated as on the date of investment is in excess of cost of investments of the 
Group, it is recognised as Capital Reserve and shown under the head Other Equity in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Investment in Associates is accounted for. in Consolidated Financial Statements as per Equity method as per Ind 
AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.
	
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of Companies consolidated is identified and presented in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet separately within equity. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of Consolidated 
companies consists of:
	
(a) 	 The amount of equity attributable to non-controlling interests at the date on which investment is made; and
	
(b) 	 The non-controlling interests share of movements in equity since the date parent subsidiary relationship 
came into existence.
	
The Profit and other comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests are shown separately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.2	 Functional and Presentation Currency
	
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (Rs.) which is the functional and the 
presentation currency of the Group and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs with two decimals, except 
when otherwise indicated.
2.3	 Basis of Measurement
	
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments that are measured at fair values.
	
A historical cost is a measure of value used for accounting in which the price of an asset on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet is based on its historical cost, it is generally fair value of consideration given in exchange for 
goods and services at the time of transaction or original cost when acquired by the Group.
	
Fair value is the price that likely to be received on sell of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants on the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, 
the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or 
disclosure purposes in the consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing 
transactions that are within the scope of IND AS 116 Leases.
	
Fair value measurements under IND AS are categorized into fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
	
•	
Level 1 	
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can 
access on measurement date;
	
•	
Level 2 	
inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly; and
	
•	
Level 3 	
where unobservable inputs are used for the valuation of assets or liabilities.
2.4	 Use of Estimates and Judgements
	
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind 
AS”) requires the management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions. These estimates, judgements 
and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting estimates could change from period 
to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized 
prospectively. The Management believes that the estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements are prudent and  reasonable. Future results could differ due to these estimates and the differences 
between the actual results and the estimates are recognized in the periods in which the results are known / 
materialize. Some of the areas involving significant estimation / judgement are determination of Expected Credit 
Loss, fair valuation of Investments, Repossessed assets, Income taxes and employee benefits.

2.5	 Material Accounting Policies
2.5.1 	
Revenue Recognition
	
	
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured and there exists reasonable certainty of its recovery.
2.5.1.1	
Interest
	
	
Interest income on financial instruments is recognized on a time proportion basis taking into account the 
amount outstanding and the effective interest rate (“EIR”) applicable.
	
	
The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows of the financial instrument through 
the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying 
amount. The future cash flows are estimated taking into account all the contractual terms of the instrument.
	
	
The calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are 
incremental and directly attributable to the specific lending arrangement, transaction costs, and all other 
premiums or discounts. For financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), 
transaction costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at initial recognition.
	
	
Interest income/expenses is calculated by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount (principal not 
due) of non-credit impaired financial assets/liabilities (i.e. at the amortized cost of the financial asset before 
adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance). For credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is 
calculated by applying the EIR to the amortized cost of the credit-impaired financial assets (i.e. the gross 
carrying amount less the allowance for expected credit losses). Further, in terms of RBI Guidelines, interest 
accrued on credit impaired assets is recognized as and when received.
2.5.1.2	
Dividend Income
	
	
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive dividend is established. 
2.5.1.3	
Fee and Commission Income
	
	
Fee and commission income include fees other than those that are an integral part of EIR. The Group 
recognizes the fee and commission income in accordance with the terms of the relevant contracts / 
agreement and when it is probable that the Group will collect the consideration.
2.5.1.4	
 Net gain on fair value change 
	
	
Any differences between the fair values on the date of acquisition and balance sheet date of the financial 
assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss, held by the Group on the balance sheet date is 
recognized as an unrealized gain/loss in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. In cases there 
is a net gain in aggregate, the same is recognized in “Net gains on fair value changes” under revenue 
from operations and if there is a net loss, the same is disclosed in “Net loss on fair value changes”, in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.1.5    Revenue for construction and other contracts	
	
	
Revenue toward satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price 
(net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The Group satisfies a performance 
obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criterias is met:
	
	
1.      The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance 
as the Group performs; or
	
	
2.      The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is 
created or enhanced; or
	
	
3.      The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the entity 
has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
	
	
Construction Revenue
	
	
(i)	
The Company constructs various infrastructure projects on behalf of clients. Under the terms of the 
contracts, where the Company is contractually restricted from redirecting the properties to another 
customer and has an enforceable right to payment for work done; revenue is recognised over a period 
222

Notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
of time. The percentage-of-completion of a contract is determined by the proportion that contract 
costs incurred for work performed upto the reporting date bear to the estimated total contract costs. 
This is achieved by estimating total revenue including claims / variations and total cost till completion 
of the contract and the profit is recognised in proportion to the value of work done when the outcome 
of the contract can be estimated reliably. The management considers that this input method is an 
appropriate measure of the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations 
under Ind AS 115. The Company becomes entitled to invoice customers for construction based on 
achieving a series of performance related milestones. When a particular milestone is achieved, the 
customer is sent a statement of work completed assessed by expert. Previously recognised contract 
asset for any work performed is reclassified to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced 
to the customer. Advances received from customers in respect of contracts are treated as liabilities 
and adjusted against progress billing as per terms of the contract. Progress payments received are 
adjusted against amount receivable from customers in respect of the contract work performed. When 
the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised 
only to the extent of contract cost incurred that are likely to be recoverable.
	
	
(ii)	
Revenue from trading and consultancy service are recognises when it transfers control of a product 
or service to a customer.
2.5.1.6	
 Other operational revenue
	
	
Other operational revenue represents income earned from the activities incidental to the main business 
and is recognized when the right to receive the income is established as per the terms of the contract and 
Late payment interest, bouncing charges etc. are accounted on the receipt basis.      
2.5.1.7	
Other Income
	
	
Other Income represents income earned from the activities other than the main business is recognized 
when the right to receive the income is established as per the terms of the contract.
2.5.2 	
Financial Instruments
2.5.2.1	
Fair Valuation of Investments 
	
	
Some of the Group’s Investments are measured at fair value. In determining the fair value of such 
Investments, the Group uses quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or based 
on inputs which are observable either directly or indirectly. However, in certain cases, the Group adopts 
valuation techniques and inputs which are not based on market data. When Market observable information 
is not available, the Group has applied appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the valuation model.
2.5.2.2	
Recognition and Initial Measurement
	
	
All financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans and borrowings are initially recognized on the 
trade date, i.e., the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
	
	
Loans are recognized when fund transfer is initiated or disbursement cheque is issued to the customer. The 
Group recognizes debt securities and borrowings (other than debt securities) when funds are received by 
the Group.
	
	
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs and revenues 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value 
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs and 
revenues directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities measured at FVTPL 
are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.3	
Classification and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities
2.5.2.3.1	Financial Assets
	
	
The Company classifies and measures all its financial assets based on the business model for managing the 
assets and the asset’s contractual terms, either at:
	
	
-	
Amortized cost

-	
Fair Value through other comprehensive income
	
	
-	
Fair Value through Profit and Loss
2.5.2.3.1.1 	
Amortized Cost
	
	
	
The Group classifies and measures cash and bank balances, Loans, Trade receivable, certain debt 
investments and other financial assets at amortized cost if the following condition is met:
	
	
	
Financial Assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets 
in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are Solely 
Payment of Principal and Interest (SPPI);
2.5.2.3.1.2	
Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVOCI”)
	
	
	
The Group classifies and measures certain debt instruments at FVOCI when the investments are held 
within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both, collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling the financial instruments and the contractual terms of the financial instruments meet the 
Solely Payment of Principal and Interest on principal amount outstanding (‘SPPI’) test.
2.5.2.3.1.3	
Fair Value through Profit and Loss (“FVTPL”)
	
	
	
	Financial assets at FVTPL are:
	
	
	
-	
assets with contractual cash flows that are not SPPI; and/or
	
	
	
-	
assets that are held in a business model other than held to collect contractual cash flows or held 
to collect and sell; or
	
	
	
-	
assets designated at FVTPL using the fair value option.
	
	
	
These assets are measured at fair value, with any gains/losses arising on remeasurement is recognized 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.3.1.4	
FVOCI- Equity Instruments
	
	
	
The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, 
unless the Company’s management has elected to classify irrevocably some of its equity instruments 
at FVOCI, when such instruments meet the definition of Equity under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments 
and are not held for trading.
	
	
	
If the Company elects to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on 
the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in other comprehensive income. This cumulative 
gain or loss is not reclassified to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of such 
instruments. Investments representing equity interest in subsidiary, joint venture and associate are 
carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
	
	
	
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets.
	
	
	
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL.
2.5.2.4	
Evaluation of Business Model
	
	
Classification and measurement of financial instruments depends on the results of the Solely Payments 
of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding (“SPPI”) and the business model test (refer 
note 2.5.2.4.1). The Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how the Group’s financial 
instruments are managed together to achieve a particular business objective.
	
	
The Group monitors financial assets measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive 
income that are derecognized prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and whether 
the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is 
part of the Group’s continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining financial 
assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in 
business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those instruments.

2.5.2.4.1 Business Model Test
	
	
An assessment of business model for managing financial assets is fundamental to the classification of a 
financial asset. The Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how financial assets are 
managed together to achieve a particular business objective. The Group’s business model does not depend 
on management’s intentions for an individual instrument, therefore the business model assessment  is 
performed at a higher level of aggregation rather than on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
	
	
The Group considers all relevant information and evidence available when making the business model 
assessment such as:
	
	
•	
how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model 
are evaluated and reported to the Group’s key management personnel;
	
	
•	
the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that 
business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed; and
	
	
•	
how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair 
value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).
	
	
At initial recognition of a financial asset, the Group determines whether newly recognized financial assets 
are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect a new business model. The Group reassesses 
its business model at each reporting period to determine whether the business model has changed since 
the preceding period. For the current and prior reporting period the Group has not identified a change in 
its business model.
	
	
Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (“SPPI”) on the principal amount outstanding
	
	
For an asset to be classified and measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, its contractual terms should give 
rise to cash flows that meet SPPI test.
	
	
For the purpose of SPPI test, principal is the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. That 
principal amount may change over the life of the financial asset (e.g. if there are repayments of principal). 
Interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the 
principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, 
as well as a profit margin.
	
	
Contractual terms that introduce exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are 
unrelated to a basic lending arrangement, such as exposure to changes in equity prices or commodity 
prices, do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are SPPI, such financial assets are either classified as 
fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
2.5.2.4.1.1	
Subsequent Measurement and Gain and Losses
	
	
	
Financial Assets at Amortized Cost
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The 
amortized  cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income as per EIR and impairment loss 
are recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is 
recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Debt Instrument at FVOCI
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income is recognized in consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on subsequent measurement is recognized in OCI 
and on derecognition the cumulative gain or loss recognized in OCI will be recycled to consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
	
	
	
Equity Instrument at FVOCI
	
	
	
Gains and losses on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are recognized in other comprehensive 
income and never recycled to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Dividends are recognized 
in profit or loss as dividend income when the right to receive payment has been established, except 
when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of whole or part of the cost of the 
instrument, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are fair 
valued at each reporting date and not subject to an impairment assessment.

Financial Assets at FVTPL
	
	
	
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gain or losses, including any interest or 
dividend income, are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.4.1.2	
Reclassifications
	
	
	
If the business model under which the Group holds financial assets changes, the financial assets 
affected are reclassified. The classification and measurement requirements related to the new 
category apply prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the change in 
business model that result   in reclassifying the Group’s financial assets.
2.5.2.4.2		
Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments
2.5.2.4.2.1 
Classification as Debt or Equity
	
	
	
Debt and equity instruments that are issued are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in 
accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
	
	
	
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially 
unfavorable to the Group or a contract that will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments 
and is a non-derivative contract for which the Group is or may be obliged to deliver a variable number 
of its own equity instruments, or a derivative contract over own equity that will or may be settled 
other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash (or another financial asset) for a fixed number 
of the Group’s own equity instruments.
2.5.2.4.2.2	
Equity Instruments
	
	
	
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the face 
value and proceeds received in excess of the face value are recognized as Securities Premium.
2.5.2.4.2.3	
Subsequent Measurement and Gain and Losses
	
	
	
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 
Interest expense is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on 
derecognition is recognized in consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.5	
Impairment and Write-off
	
	
The Company recognizes loss allowances for Expected Credit Losses on the following financial instruments 
that are not measured at FVTPL:
	
	
-	
Loans and advances to customers;
	
	
-	
Other financial assets; 
	
	
-	
Loan commitments
	
	
Equity instruments which are measured at fair value are not subject to an impairment loss. 
	
	
ECL is required to be measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
	
	
•	
12-month ECL, i.e., loss allowance on default events on the financial instrument that are possible 
within 12 months after the reporting date, (referred to as Stage 1); or
	
	
•	
Lifetime ECL, i.e. lifetime ECL that results from all possible default events over the life of the financial 
instrument, (referred to as Stage 2 and Stage 3).
	
	
A loss allowance for lifetime ECL is required for a financial instrument if the credit risk on that financial 
instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, ECL is 
measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL.
	
	
The Group has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period whether 
a financial instrument’s credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the 
change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instruments.

Based on the above process, the Group categorizes its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described 
below:
	
	
Stage 1: 	When loans are first recognized, the Group recognizes an allowance based on 12 months ECL. 
Stage 1 loans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been 
reclassified from Stage 2/3 to Stage 1.
	
	
Stage 2: 	When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records 
an allowance for the life time expected credit losses. 
	
	
Stage 3: 	When loans are considered credit-impaired, the Group records an allowance for the life time 
expected credit losses. Stage 3 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved 
but considered as credit impaired assets as per regulatory guidelines.
	
	
For financial assets for which the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering either the entire 
outstanding amount, or a proportion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced. 
This is considered a (partial) derecognition/impairment of the financial asset.
	
	
The Subsidiary Companies applies expected credit loss (ECL) model by adopting the simplified approach 
using a provision matrix reflecting current condition and forecasts of future economic conditions for 
measurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets that are debt instruments, and are 
measured at amortized cost e.g. security deposits, trade receivables, bank balance, Lease receivables or 
any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset.
2.5.2.6	
Determination of Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”)
	
	
The measurement of impairment losses (ECL) across all categories of financial assets requires judgement.
	
	
In particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows based on Group’s historical 
experience and collateral values when determining impairment losses along with the assessment of a 
significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can 
result in different levels of allowances.
	
	
Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgments and estimates include:
	
	
•	
Bifurcation of the financial assets into different portfolios when ECL is assessed on a collective basis.
	
	
•	
Group’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
•	
Development of ECL models, including choice of inputs / assumptions used.
	
	
The various inputs used and the process followed by the Group in measurement of ECL has been detailed 
below:
2.5.2.6.1	Measurement of Expected Credit Losses
	
	
The Group calculates ECL based on probability-weighted scenarios to measure expected cash shortfalls, 
discounted at an approximation to the portfolio. A cash shortfall is a difference between the cash flows that 
are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive.
	
	
When estimating ECL for undrawn loan commitments, the Group estimates the expected portion of the loan 
commitment that will be drawn down over its expected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of 
the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn down. The expected cash shortfalls are discounted 
at an approximation to the Interest rate on the loan.
	
	
The Group measures ECL on an individual basis, or on a collective basis for portfolios of loans that share 
similar economic risk characteristics. The measurement of the loss allowance is based on the present value 
of the asset’s expected cash flows using the asset’s original EIR, regardless of whether it is measured on 
an individual basis or a collective basis.
	
	
The mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as follows:
	
	
Exposure at Default (EAD) is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default. 
For a revolving commitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that 
is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur.
	
	
Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation 
227

Notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
(as per ‘’Definition of default and credit-impaired’’) either over the next 12 months (12 months PD), or over 
the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.
	
	
Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. 
LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and preference of claim and availability of collateral or other credit 
support.
	
	
Forward-looking economic information (including management overlay) is included in determining the 
12-month and lifetime PD, EAD and LGD. The assumptions underlying the expected credit loss are monitored 
and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
2.5.2.6.2 Significant Increase in Credit Risk
	
	
The Group monitors all financial assets, including loan commitments contracts issued that are subject to 
impairment requirements, to assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk the Group measures the loss allowance based 
on lifetime rather than 12-month ECL. The Group monitors all financial assets, issued loan commitments and 
financial guarantee contracts that are subject to impairment for a significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting 
date based on the remaining maturity of the instrument with the risk of a default occurring that was 
anticipated for the remaining maturity at the current reporting date when the financial instrument was first 
recognized. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information 
that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience that is available without undue cost or 
effort.
	
	
The quantitative factors that indicate a significant increase in credit risk are reflected in PD models on a 
timely   basis. However, the Group still considers separately some qualitative factors to assess if credit risk 
has increased significantly. For corporate lending, there is a particular focus on assets that are included 
on a ‘watch list’. Given an exposure is on a watch list once, there is a concern that the credit worthiness 
of the specific counterparty has deteriorated. ECL assessment for watch list accounts is done on a case by 
case approach after considering the probability of weighted average in a different recovery scenario. For 
individual loans the    Group considers the expectation of forbearance, payment holidays, and events such 
as unemployment, bankruptcy, divorce, or death.
	
	
Given that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is a relative measure, a given change, 
in absolute terms, in the PD is more significant for a financial instrument with a lower initial PD than 
compared    to a financial instrument with a higher PD.
2.5.2.6.3	Credit-Impaired Financial Assets
	
	
A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Credit-impaired financial assets are 
referred to as Stage 3 assets. Evidence of credit-impairment includes observable data about the following 
events:
	
	
•	
significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
	
	
•	
a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
	
	
•	
restructuring of loans due to financial difficulty of the borrowers;
	
	
•	
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties; or
	
	
•	
the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.
	
	
It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event. Instead the combined effect of several events may 
have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. The Group assesses whether debt instruments 
that are financial assets measured at amortized cost are credit-impaired at each reporting date. To assess 
if corporate debt instruments are credit impaired, the Group considers factors such as bond yields, credit 
ratings and the ability of the borrower to raise funds.
	
	
A loan is considered credit-impaired when a concession is granted to the borrower due to deterioration in 
the borrower’s financial condition. The definition of default includes unlikeliness to pay indicators and a 
back-stop if amounts are overdue for more than 90 days.

2.5.2.6.4 Definition of Default
	
	
The definition of default is used in measuring the amount of ECL and in the determination of whether the 
loss allowance is based on 12-month or lifetime ECL.
	
	
The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default:
	
	
•	
the borrower is past due more than 90 days+ Accounts Identified by the Group as NPA as per 
regulatory guidelines + Objective Evidence for impairment (Qualitative Overlay); or
	
	
•	
the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group.
	
	
When assessing if the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligation, the Group takes into account 
both qualitative and quantitative indicators. The information assessed depends on the type of the asset, 
for example in corporate lending a qualitative indicator used is the breach of covenants, which is not 
as relevant for individual lending. Quantitative indicators, such as overdue status and non-payment on 
another obligation of the same counterparty are key inputs in this analysis.
2.5.2.6.5 Write-off
	
	
Loans are written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial asset 
(either in its entirety or a portion of it). This is the case when the Group determines that the borrower 
does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts 
subject to the write-off. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. The Group may apply enforcement 
activities to financial assets written off/ may assign/ sell loan exposure to ARC/ Bank/ a financial institution 
for a negotiated consideration. Balance loan outstanding after expected recovery from sale of vehicles, 
security deposit, settlement etc. are written off in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss. Recoveries 
resulting from the Group’s enforcement activities could result in impairment gains and same is adjusted in 
Impairment on financial instruments.
2.5.2.7	
Modification and Derecognition of Financial Assets
	
	
A modification of a financial asset occurs when the contractual terms governing the cash flows of a financial 
asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified between the initial recognition and maturity of the financial 
asset. A modification affects the amount and/or timing of the contractual cash flows either immediately 
or at a future date. In addition, the introduction or adjustment of existing covenants of an existing loan 
would constitute a modification even if these new or adjusted covenants do not yet affect the cash flows 
immediately but may affect the cash flows depending on whether the covenant is or is not met (e.g. a 
change to the increase in the interest rate that arises when covenants are breached).
	
	
The Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulty to maximize collection and minimize the 
risk of default. Loan forbearance is granted in cases where although the borrower made all reasonable 
efforts to pay under the original contractual terms, there is a high risk of default or default has already 
happened and the borrower is expected to be able to meet the revised terms. The revised terms in most of 
the cases include an extension of the maturity of the loan, changes to the timing of the cash flows of the 
loan (principal and interest repayment), reduction in the amount of cash flows due (principal and interest 
forgiveness) and amendments to covenants.
	
	
When a financial asset is modified the Group assesses whether this modification results in derecognition. In 
accordance with the Group’s policy, a modification results in derecognition when it gives rise to substantially 
different terms. To determine if the modified terms are substantially different from the original contractual 
terms the Group considers the following:
	
	
Qualitative factors, such as contractual cash flows after modification, are no longer SPPI, change in currency 
or change of counterparty, the extent of change in interest rates, maturity, covenants, if these do not clearly 
indicate a substantial modification, then; a quantitative assessment is performed to compare the present 
value of the remaining contractual cash flows under the original terms with the contractual cash flows 
under the revised terms, both amounts discounted at the original EIR. If there is a significant difference in 
present value, the Group deems the arrangement substantially different, leading to derecognition.
	
	
In the case where the financial asset is derecognized the loss allowances for ECL is remeasured at the date 
of derecognition to determine the net carrying amount of the asset at that date. The difference between 
this revised carrying amount and the fair value of the new financial asset with the revised terms may lead 
to a gain  or loss on derecognition. The new financial asset may have a loss allowance measured based 
229

Notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
on 12-month ECL except where the new loan is considered to be originated-credit impaired. This applies 
only in the case where the fair value of the new loan is recognized at a significant discount to its revised 
par amount because there remains a high risk of default which has not been reduced by the modification. 
The Group monitors the credit risk of modified financial assets by evaluating qualitative and quantitative 
information, such as if the borrower is in past due status under the new terms.
	
	
When the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in 
derecognition, the Group determines if the financial asset’s credit risk has increased significantly since 
initial recognition by comparing:
	
	
•	
The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual 
terms;
	
	
•	
The remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms.
	
	
For financial assets modified, where modification does not result in derecognition, the estimate of PD 
reflects the Group’s ability to collect the modified cash flows taking into account the Group’s previous 
experience of similar forbearance action, as well as various behavioural indicators, including the borrower’s 
payment performance against the modified contractual terms. If the credit risk remains significantly higher 
than what was expected at initial recognition, the loss allowance is continued to be measured at an amount 
equal to lifetime ECL. The loss allowance on forborne loans is generally measured based on 12-month ECL 
when there is evidence of the borrower’s improved repayment behaviour following modification leading to 
a reversal of the previous significant increase in credit risk.
	
	
Where a modification does not lead to derecognition, the Group calculates the modification gain/loss 
comparing the gross carrying amount before and after the modification (excluding the ECL allowance). 
Then the Group measures ECL for the modified asset, where the expected cash flows arising from the 
modified financial asset are included in calculating the expected cash shortfalls from the original asset.
	
	
The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the asset’s cash flows expire 
(including expiry arising from a modification with substantially different terms), or when the financial asset 
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred to another entity. If 
the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues 
to control the transferred asset, the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated 
liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognize the financial asset and also 
recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.
	
	
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain/loss that had been 
recognized  in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
with the exception of equity investment designated as measured at FVOCI, where the cumulative gain/loss 
previously recognized in OCI is not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss.
	
	
On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to 
repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial 
asset between the part it continues to recognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer 
recognizes on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference 
between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the sum of  the 
consideration received for the part no longer recognized and any cumulative gain/loss allocated to it that 
had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. A cumulative 
gain/loss that had been recognized in OCI is allocated between the part that continues to be recognized 
and the part that is no longer recognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts. This does 
not apply for equity investments designated as measured at FVOCI, as the cumulative gain/loss previously 
recognized in OCI is not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.2.8	
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities
	
	
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized 
and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

2.5.2.9	
Assets acquired under settlement
	
	
Asset acquired under settlement are measured at the prevailing market price/fair valuation including cost 
of acquisition, whichever is lower, on periodic basis. Any profit or loss arising on the sale of assets acquired 
under settlement of claims is recognized in Consolidated statement of profit and loss.
2.5.3	
Property, Plant and Equipment (“PPE”)
	
	
PPE held for use are stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
	
	
PPE is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item is expected 
to flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. PPE is stated at original cost 
net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment, if any. 
Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to acquisition of PPE 
are allocated and capitalized as a part of the cost of the PPE.
	
	
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic 
benefits    are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in the consolidated statement of 
profit and loss.
2.5.4	
Intangible Assets
	
	
Intangible assets are recognized when it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable 
to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets      are 
stated at original cost net of tax/duty credits availed, if any, less accumulated amortization and cumulative 
impairment. Administrative and other general overhead expenses that are specifically attributable to 
acquisition of intangible assets are allocated and capitalized as a part of the cost of the intangible assets.
	
	
Intangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Intangible 
assets under development”.
	
	
An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
use or disposal. Gains and losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.
2.5.5	
Capital work-in-progress
	
	
Capital work in progress includes assets not ready for the intended use and is carried at cost, comprising 
direct cost and related incidental expenses.
2.5.6	
Depreciation and Amortization
	
	
Depreciation is recognized using written down value method so as to write off the cost of the assets less 
their residual values over their estimated useful lives specified in Schedule II to the Act. Depreciation 
method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect expected pattern of consumption of the future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed 
at each financial year end with the effect of any change in the estimates of useful life/residual value is 
recognized on prospective basis.
	
	
Depreciation for additions to/deductions from, owned assets is calculated pro rata to the period of use. The 
useful life of the property, plant and equipment determined by the Group is as follows:
Class of Assets
Useful Life
Computer/Laptop
3 years
Server
6 years
Office Equipment
5 years
Furniture & Fixtures
10 years
	
	
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on written down value basis over the estimated 
231
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED

Notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
useful life. The method of amortization and useful life are reviewed at the end of each accounting year with 
the effect of any changes in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
	
	
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount 
with its carrying amount annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be 
impaired.
	
	
The useful life of Intangible Assets held by the Company is as follows:
Class of Assets
Useful Life
Computer Software
3 years
2.5.7	
Impairment of Assets other than Financial Instruments
	
	
As at the end of each accounting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE and intangible 
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If such indication exists, the PPE and intangible assets are tested for impairment so as to determine the 
impairment loss, if any.
2.5.8	
Employee Benefits
	
	
Short term Employee Benefits
	
	
Employee benefits falling due within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term 
employee benefits and are expensed in the period in which the employee renders the related service. 
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount 
of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
	
	
Defined Contribution Plans 
	
	
Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employees’ state insurance, employee provident 
fund and employee pension scheme etc. are charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution 
required to be made as and when services are rendered by the employees. Group’s provident fund 
contribution is made to a government administered fund and charged as an expense to the Consolidated 
statement of profit and loss. The above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the 
Group has no further defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
	
	
Post-employment Benefits
	
	
The Group operates defined benefit plan in the form of gratuity and compensated absence. The liability or 
asset recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of its defined benefit plans is the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
said obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out flows, using market yields 
of government bonds that have tenure approximating the tenures of the related liability. The interest 
expenses are calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The net 
interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized in the Consolidated statement 
of profit and loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognized in the period in which they occur, directly in Other Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income. They are included in Other Equity in the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity and in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognized immediately in profit or loss as 
past service cost. 
2.5.9	
Leases
	
	
The Group as Lessee
	
	
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office premises. The Group assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses 
whether:
232
MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED
CIN: L65990DL2016PLC447681
Notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025
	
	
(i)	
the contract involves the use of an identified asset
	
	
(ii)	
the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of 
the lease and
	
	
(iii)	 the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
	
	
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a 
corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee.
	
	
Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease 
term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be 
exercised.
	
	
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus 
any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
	
	
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
	
	
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. 
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, 
using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its 
assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.
	
	
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and lease 
payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
	
	
The Group as Lessor
	
	
The Group as a lessor, classifies leases as either operating lease or finance lease. A lease is classified as a 
finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying 
asset. Initially asset held under finance lease is recognized in Consolidated Balance Sheet and presented 
as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Finance income is recognized over 
the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on Group’s net investment 
in the lease. 
	
	
A lease which is not classified as a finance lease is an operating lease. Accordingly, the Group recognizes 
lease payments as income on a straight-line basis in case of assets given on operating leases. The Group 
presents underlying assets subject to operating lease in its Consolidated Balance Sheet under the respective 
class of asset.
2.5.10	
Securities Premium
	
	
(i)	
Securities premium includes the difference between the face value of the equity shares and the 
consideration received in respect of shares issued under preferential allotment as equity shares by 
the Group.
	
	
(ii)	
The issue expenses of securities which qualify as equity instruments are adjusted against securities 
premium.
2.5.11	
Share-based payment arrangements
	
	
The stock options to be granted to employees by the Company under MGFL Employee Stock Option Plan 
2023’ (“ESOP 2023”/” Plan”), will be measured at the fair value of the options at the grant date.
 	
	
The fair value of the options is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the 
vesting period on a straight line basis.
	
	
The amount recognized as expense in each year is arrived at based on the number of grants expected to 
vest.

 2.5.12	
Dividends on Equity Shares
	
	
The Group recognize a liability to make cash distributions to equity shareholders of the Group when the 
dividend is authorized and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group and a corresponding 
amount is recognized directly in equity. As per the corporate laws in India, an interim dividend is authorized 
when it is approved by the Board of Directors and final dividend is authorized when it is approved by the 
shareholders.
2.5.13	
Cash and Cash Equivalents
	
	
Cash comprises of cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term deposits 
with banks (with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of placement) and cheques on 
hand. Short term and liquid investments being subject to more than insignificant risk of change in value, 
are not included as part of cash and cash equivalents.
2.5.14	
Finance Costs
	
	
Finance costs include interest expense calculated using the EIR on respective financial instruments    and 
borrowings is measured at amortized cost, amortization of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the 
arrangement of borrowings and exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.
2.5.15	
Foreign Currencies
	
	
(i)	
Functional currency of the Group and foreign operations has been determined based on the primary 
economic environment in which the Group and its foreign operations operate considering the currency 
in which funds are generated, spent and retained.
	
	
(ii)	
Transactions in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency are recorded on initial 
recognition using the exchange rate at the transaction date. At each Balance Sheet date, foreign 
currency monetary items are reported at the rates prevailing at the year-end. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
	
	
Exchange differences that arise on settlement of monetary items or on reporting of monetary items at each 
Balance Sheet date at the closing spot rate are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
in the period in which they arise.
2.5.16	
Segments
	
	
Operating segments are those components of the business whose operating results are regularly reviewed 
by the Chief Operating Decision making body in the Group to make decisions for performance assessment 
and resource allocation. Operating Segment are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to accounting policies are in line with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision maker.
2.5.17	
Earnings Per Share
	
	
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per 
share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is 
determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares.
2.5.18	
Taxes on Income
	
	
The Group’s tax jurisdiction is in India. Significant judgements are involved in determining the provision for 
income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for certain tax positions.
	
	
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax expense is recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except when they relate to items that are recognized outside 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), 
in which case tax is also recognized outside consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business 
loss and depreciation carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax 
losses and depreciation carry-forwards could be utilized.
	
	
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date, and are 
recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax 
asset to be recovered.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period    when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
	
	
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
	
	
The Group provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate that is expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities where an outflow is probable.
2.5.19	
Goods and Services Tax Input Credit
	
	
Goods and Services tax input credit is recognized in the books of account in the period in which the supply 
of goods or service received is recognized and when there is no uncertainty in availing/utilizing the credits.
2.5.20	
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
	
	
(a)	 Provisions are recognized only when:
	
	
	
(i)	
The Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; and
	
	
	
(ii)	
It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation; and
	
	
	
(iii)	 A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
	
	
Provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation and when the effect 
of time value of money is material, the carrying amount of the provision is the present value of those cash 
flows.
	
	
(b)	 Contingent Liability is disclosed in case of:
	
	
	
(i)	
A present obligation arising from past events, when it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation; or
	
	
	
(ii)	
A present obligation arising from past events, when no reliable estimate is possible.
	
	
	
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic 
benefits expected to be received under such contract, the present obligation under the contract is 
recognized and measured as a provision.
	
	
(c)	
Contingent Assets:
	
	
	
(i)	
Contingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
	
	
	
(ii)	
Contingent assets are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
	
	
	
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.

to avoid excessive details.
2.5.22	
Statement of Cash Flows
	
	
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is prepared segregating the cash flows into operating, investing and 
financing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is reported using indirect method adjusting the net 
profit for the effects of:
	
	
i.	
changes during the period in operating receivables and payables transactions of a non-cash nature;
	
	
ii.

Recent Accounting Developments
3.1	 Law enacted but not effective
	
The Code on Social Security, 2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post-
employment benefits received Indian Parliament’s approval and Presidential assent in September 2020. The 
Code has been published in the Gazette of India and subsequently, on November 13, 2020, draft rules were 
published and stakeholders’ suggestions were invited. However, the date on which the Code will come into effect 
has not been notified. The Group will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into effect and will record any 
related impact in the period the Code becomes effective.
3.2	  New Standards/ Amendments notified 
	
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended March 31, 
2025, MCA has notified Ind AS 117 – Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating 
to sale and lease back transactions, applicable from April 1, 2024. The Group has assessed that there is no 
significant impact on its financial statements. 
      On May 9, 2025, MCA notifies the amendments to Ind AS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. 
These amendments aim to provide clearer guidance on assessing currency exchangeability and estimating 
exchange rates when currencies are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after April 1, 2025. The Group is currently assessing the probable impact of these amendments 
on its financial statements.

respective assumption occurring at the end of the reporting period and may not be representative of 
the actual change. It is based on a change in the key assumption while holding all other assumptions 
constant. When calculating the sensitivity to the assumption, the method (Projected Unit Credit Method) 
used to calculate the liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet has been applied. The methods 
and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change as compared with the 
previous period.

Note 40 : Financial Risk Management 
The Group is mainly engaged in Investment and Finance Activities. The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise 
debt securities, borrowings (other than debt securities) and other payables. The main purpose of these financial 
liabilities is to finance and support Company’s operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include loans, term 
deposits with banks, Investments, cash and cash equivalents and receivables. 
The risk management policies of the Group are established to identify and analyses the risks faced by the Group, to 
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s management oversees the management 
of these risks to ensure the Group’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and 
that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Group’s policies and risk objectives. The 
major risks are summarized below:
40.1	Credit Risk 
	
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or a customer 
contract, leading to financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities towards Loans to 
various customers. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each 
customer. Credit risk has always been managed by the Group through credit approvals, establish credit limits and 
continuous monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course 
of business. 
	
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a borrower failing to 
engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where loans/interest have been written off, the Group continues to 
engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the loans/receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are 
recognized as income in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
	
The Group measures the expected credit loss of other receivables/loans based on historical trend, available external 
and internal credit risk factors such as financial condition, ageing of accounts receivable etc., regulatory norms, industry 
practices and the business environment in which the entity operates. Refer note 2.5.2.5 and 2.5.2.6 for Impairment 
and Write-off and Expected Credit Loss (ECL) policy of the Group.
	
As at March 31, 2025, the company did not consider there to be any significant concentration of credit risk, which had 
not been adequately provided for. The carrying amount of the financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial 
statements, grossed up for any allowances for losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.  
40.2 Market Risk
	
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and market 
price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include 
loans, investments, borrowings and term deposits with banks.

(a) 	 Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, other payables and other 
financial liabilities, approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of 
these instruments.
	
	
(b) 	 Financial instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on 
parameters such as interest rates and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this 
evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected losses of these receivables.
