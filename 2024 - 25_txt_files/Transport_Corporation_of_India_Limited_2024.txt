promote a culture of safety for our drivers, employees, and even external drivers, focusing on their physical,

collaboration with well-being experts and medical professionals.
The Company ensures that all offices, warehouses, and branches maintain high standards of cleanliness,

Risk assessment has always been a critical component of the Company’s Health and Safety Management 
System. It involves identifying hazards, understanding the complexity of operations, and evaluating 
workplace conditions. As part of this ongoing commitment, the Company regularly conducts assessments 
across its offices and warehouses.
	
A structured process is in place for Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA). Comprehensive risk 
assessments are conducted for all routine operations. For non-routine tasks, a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is 
carried out, accompanied by a Toolbox Talk or KYT (Kiken Yochi Training) session prior to job commencement. 
Based on these assessments, appropriate control measures are implemented to mitigate potential risks.
	
Accident prevention remains a top priority for the Company’s vehicle drivers. This objective is supported 
through defensive driving training, which equips drivers with the skills to anticipate and avoid hazardous 
situations. Each day, the operations team conducts KYT or Toolbox Talks at job sites before work begins. 
Additionally, vehicle health checklists are provided to ensure proper maintenance and safety.
	
Driver training is a key element of the Company’s comprehensive safety program. It complements the 
efforts of staff responsible for the secure transport of goods. The Internal Audit team also plays a crucial 
role by visiting branches, warehouses, and transshipment locations to report any unsafe building conditions 
that could lead to work-related hazards.
c)	
Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves 
from such risks. (Y/N)

reported and resolved through appropriate corrective actions.

12.	 Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place
	
At the Company, a strong culture of safety is deeply embedded and championed at the highest levels of 
leadership. Safety and health are not just priorities but core values, integrated into every operational aspect. Our 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System is structured around the internationally recognized 
“Plan-Do-Check-Act” cycle, ensuring a proactive, systematic, and continuous improvement approach.
	
All credible risks are identified through structured risk assessments, and appropriate preventive and corrective 
actions are implemented to mitigate them. Every safety incident, regardless of severity, is promptly reported, 
thoroughly investigated, and the findings and lessons learned are widely communicated to prevent recurrence.
	
We maintain a comprehensive audit and inspection mechanism to verify compliance with internal safety 
standards as well as applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Regular reviews ensure that the system 
remains effective and evolves with emerging risks and best practices.
	
	 Key initiatives to prevent or minimize significant occupational health and safety risks include:
 	
	 Regular mock drills for fire, medical emergencies, and evacuation scenarios to ensure employee readiness.
 	
	 Periodic safety audits and site inspections to assess risk controls, safety culture, and emergency preparedness.
 	
	 Maintenance and periodic testing of fire detection, alarm, suppression, and emergency lighting systems.
 	
	 Extensive employee training programs on topics such as first aid, PPE usage, fire safety, behavior-based 
safety (BBS), electrical safety, working at heights, handling hazardous materials, and managing heatwave-
related health risks.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the 
strategy adopted to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such waste.
	
Our waste management practices are fully aligned with CPCB regulations, ensuring that all hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste are responsibly disposed of through authorized State Pollution Control Board partners 
for recycling or proper disposal. Additionally, all mixed solid waste (both dry and wet) are entrusted to certified 
vendors for recycling and composting. To minimize environmental impact, the company has adopted a range of 
effective waste management practices, including waste segregation, on-site composting, and waste reduction 
at the source. These initiatives have significantly reduced the strain on municipal landfills.
	
We also prioritize sustainability by eliminating single-use plastics, drink containers, and disposable utensils 
in our cafeterias and meeting rooms. Stringent monitoring processes are in place to further minimize waste 
generation.
	
Committed to continuous improvement, the company consistently strives to enhance its waste management 
practices across all locations. Our waste management philosophy is guided by the core principles of the 4Rs: 
Reduce, Reuse, Recover, and Recycle.
