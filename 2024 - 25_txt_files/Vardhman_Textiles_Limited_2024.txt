1.
Climate 
Change
Opportunity 
& Risk
Opportunity- Reducing 
reliance on fossil fuel-intensive 
processes and shifting to 
renewable energy helps 
decrease greenhouse gas 
emissions, thereby mitigating 
climate change.
Risk- Businesses may lose 
customers who demand high 
sustainability standards and 
face regulatory changes like 
the Eco-design Directives 
and CBAM. These shifts 
could impact operations 
and competitiveness. 
Compliance may require 
costly adjustments to meet 
sustainability targets.
For optimizing our production 
processes various energy-saving 
initiatives implemented such as 
upgrading to more energy-efficient 
equipment & focusing on the 
installation of solar plants and rooftop 
solar panels at our facilities and signing 
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) 
with renewable energy developers.
Key Actions/Plans to address Climate 
Change are-
	 Reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions 
by 42% by 2030, with our plan 
currently under review through 
the Manufacturers Climate Action 
Program (MCAP).
	 Our goal is to achieve 40% green 
power generation by 2026.
	 By the end of 2025, we plan to install 
70 MWp of solar power across our 
units.
	 Replacement of coal-fired boilers 
with three 80 TPH biomass boilers 
at MP unit and a 105 TPH paddy 
straw-fired boiler with turbine 
integration in Baddi has been 
initiated. Biomass includes locally 
sourced Agri-residues like rice husk 
and paddy straw. It reduced use of 
fossil fuels, thereby cutting down 
GHG emissions.
	 Installing 12,241 energy-efficient 
BLDC fans across units, replacing 
conventional fans to lower energy 
consumption and reduce electricity 
bills which are expected to save 
18.99 million units of electricity 
annually, contributing to Scope 2 
emission reduction.
	 Old LRB insulation on thermic fluid 
pipelines was replaced with high-
performance E-glass insulation to 
minimize heat loss and improve 
energy efficiency. This resulted in 
energy savings of ~7.93 lakh Kcal/hr.
	 Developed a dense urban forest 
using Miyawaki Methodology (Baddi)
on 1 acre land, with 11,000 saplings 
from 51 native species to support 
bio-diversity.
	 Initial Investment:
	 Capital cost for solar 
installations, shifting from 
coal to biomass boiler 
retrofitting capital cost.
	 Long-Term Benefit:
	 Reduced energy costs 
and stabilized expenses 
through decreased 
reliance on non-renewable 
resources.

2.
Water 
Stewardship
Opportunity 
and Risk
Opportunity:- Growing 
consumer and brand 
preference for sustainable 
practices; potential to reduce 
water consumption and 
operational costs
Risk:- Stricter enforcement 
by pollution control boards on 
effluent quality and discharge 
limits
Wastewater Recycling and Reuse: 
All manufacturing facilities are equipped 
with wastewater treatment systems, 
including Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs), followed by RO & MEE. The 
treated wastewater is then repurposed 
for a variety of applications, significantly 
reducing our reliance on freshwater 
resources.
Electro-Coagulation technology was 
implemented to reduce 80% of COD 
and color in wastewater, while also 
minimizing the chemical consumption 
in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP).
Modified ETP & ZLD System at 
VSGM–Ludhiana
The project has been initiated to retrofit 
the existing ETP into a Membrane 
Bio-Reactor (MBR)-based Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) system, integrating 
a 6-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) and 
Mechanical Vapor Recompression 
Evaporator (MVRE). This will help to 
reduce freshwater dependency by 
~80%.
4th Stage RO System at VFB–Budhni
4th stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) 
System implementation is underway 
with the existing 3-stage RO set-up to 
enhance overall water recovery.
Rainwater Harvesting Systems: 
Continuously invested in Ground Water 
Recharging initiatives since 2005, 
focusing on groundwater recharge, 
with 52 Rainwater Harvesting Systems 
(RWH) installed on various premises.
Positive- Reduced 
freshwater consumption 
leads to long-term cost 
savings and improved ESG 
ratings.
Negative- High compliance 
costs- failure to comply may 
lead to penalties or closure of 
operations.
Increased capital 
expenditure for water-saving 
infrastructure but essential to 
maintain long-term business 
continuity.

Responsible 
Sourcing
Opportunity 
and Risk
Risk: Our business heavily 
relies on cotton as a primary 
raw material and the 
production and sourcing 
of conventional fibers pose 
significant environmental 
and social challenges. These 
impacts are becoming a 
growing concern among 
stakeholders, particularly, 
regarding the sustainability of 
our products.
Opportunity: By embracing 
sustainable sourcing 
practices, we can minimize 
our environmental and 
social footprints while 
simultaneously creating 
opportunities to embed 
sustainability into our product 
design, enhancing both brand 
reputation and long-term 
value.
Currently, we are sourcing 36% 
of sustainable cotton, we have 
collaborated with Better Cotton as a 
Programme Partner. This partnership 
allows us to work closely with over 
12,000 farmers, focusing on natural 
resource management, fair work 
practices and climate adaptation 
strategies. Our commitment to 
responsible sourcing is further validated 
by the range of globally recognized 
certifications we hold. These include 
Regen Agri, GOTS, GRS, Oeko-TEX, 
Organic, OCS, Recycled Polyester 
Fiber, CMI, BCI, Fairtrade and FSC 
certifications.
Long-Term Benefit:
Emerge as market leader 
for sustainable products 
providing end-to-end 
traceability for customers.
4.
Waste 
Management
Opportunity 
and Risk

waste management 
practices, significantly reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Risk- Inadequate waste 
management poses risks 
that can impact a business's 
legal compliance, reputation, 
operational effectiveness and 
its ability to maintain long-
term sustainability.
	 In waste management, we follow the 
3R principle - Reduce, Reuse and 
Recycle to effectively manage and 
minimize waste.
	 Vardhman's Renova Plant in Baddi 
is our first recycling facility, enabling 
us to divert waste from landfills and 
re-purpose it for use in production.
	 In AT Baddi, a brine recovery unit 
has been initiated to reclaim salt 
from the waste water streams of 
dyeing, enabling its reuse & reduce 
the salt disposal quantity to landfill.
Target set to reduce 50% hazardous 
waste send to landfill by 2030.
Long-Term Benefit:
	 Lower disposal expenses 
and reduced reliance on 
raw materials through 
increased recycling and 
reuse efforts.
	 Create new revenue 
streams by selling recycled 
materials or developing 
eco-friendly products, 
capitalizing on the rising 
demand for sustainable 
goods.
	 Strengthen brand image 
and market position as a 
leader in sustainability.
5.
Customer 
Satisfaction
Opportunity 
and Risk
Opportunity- Satisfied 
customers are more likely 
to become repeat buyers, 
contributing to sustained 
revenue streams.
Risk- High levels of 
customer dissatisfaction 
can significantly undermine 
trust and loyalty, resulting in 
reduced sales and potential 
harm to the Company's 
reputation.
	 Maintaining superior quality 
standards which leads to increased 
customer satisfaction, loyalty and 
brand reputation ultimately leading to 
increased revenue and profitability.
	 Developing high-quality, 
innovative products 
enables us to differentiate 
our-self in the market & 
business can achieve 
higher profit margins.

building expenses; 
however, it reduces legal 
liability and supports ESG 
ratings.
	 Improves operational 
efficiency, reduces 
downtime and potential 
insurance premium 
reductions.
	 Enhances employee 
retention, morale and 
reduces absenteeism,

unsatisfactory, they can escalate the matter further.
	
Stage II: The grievance can be escalated in writing to the concerned Sectional Head. If the worker remains dissatisfied with 
the outcome, he/she may escalate the issue to the Head of Department and, if needed, to the Industrial Relations Department.
	
Stage III: If the grievance remains unresolved after Stage II, it can be referred to the Grievance Redressal Committee for a 
final resolution.
	
This structured approach ensures that all concerns are addressed fairly and promptly at each level.

Initially, our GHG emission calculations for FY 23-24 utilized EPA emission factors and CEA version 19.0. However, these 
calculations were later revised to align with CEA version 19.0, revised factor which incorporates renewable energy sources 
(RES) and captive power injection into the grid. The revised emission figures have been validated by Intertek, a third party 
assurance provider.
	
Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for fiscal year 2024-2025 increased, primarily due to adopting the IPCC Emission Factor library 
for Scope 1 calculations and an increase in the Grid factor for Scope 2 from 0.716 to 0.727 MT CO2e/MWh. Third party 
validation of this data is currently in progress.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
	
The Company is steadfast in its commitment to reducing carbon emissions, exemplified through a series of proactive measures 
aimed at mitigating Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This year, the company is spearheading a range of initiatives focused 
on greenhouse gas reduction, including:
	
	
Expansion of Rooftop Solar Plant- We have expanded our rooftop solar energy capacity from 31 MWp to 70 MWp 
across various unit rooftops. This expansion has significantly reduced our reliance on grid-based power, helping to lower 
our carbon footprint.
	
	
Biomass based Boilers- In line with our green energy commitment, we are replacing coal-fired boilers with three 80 TPH 
biomass boilers at our MP unit and a 105 TPH paddy straw-fired boiler with turbine integration at our Baddi facility. The use 
of locally sourced agricultural residues such as rice husk and paddy straw not only reduces our fossil fuel consumption 
but also supports the rural economy and reduces GHG emissions.
	
	
Switching to E-Glass Insulation in Thermic Fluid Pipeline
	
	
Replaced old LRB insulation on thermic fluid pipelines with high-performance E-glass insulation to minimize heat loss 
and improve energy efficiency. This upgrade has resulted in energy savings of approximately 7.93 lakh Kcal/hr, leading 
to reduced coal and rice husk consumption and a decrease in direct Scope 1 emissions.
	
	
Sludge Dryer Implementation: The company has introduced sludge dryers across all three Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs), effectively mitigating GHG emissions associated with landfill disposal.
	
	
Sustainable Packaging & EPR Compliance: The entity demonstrates its environmental stewardship by achieving 
100% recycling of plastic packaging waste, minimizing its carbon footprint. 91% of packaging materials are recyclable 
or biodegradable.
	
	
Miyawaki Forest Development (Baddi): Developed a dense urban forest using the Miyawaki method, planting 11,000 
saplings from 51 native species over 1 acre of land. Acted as a carbon sink, improved local ecosystem, enhanced green 
cover and improved air quality.
	
	
Brine Recovery System at Baddi: Installing a brine recovery unit to reclaim salt from wastewater streams, enabling its 
reuse in the dyeing process. It helps to reduce our hazardous waste quantity which goes to landfill in form of MEE Salt 
and Reduced chemical purchase costs

Initiative undertaken
Details of the initiative (Web-link, if any, may be 
provided along-with summary)
Outcome of the initiative
1
 Installation of Electro-
Coagulation System
 Electro-Coagulation technology was installed after 
the dyeing and printing machines to pre-treat the 
effluent. This system helps in removing color, COD and 
suspended solids before the effluent enters the main 
ETP, thereby improving overall efficiency.
Achieved up to 80% reduction in color and 
COD, decreasing the chemical requirement 
in the ETP. Leads to improved treated water 
quality, reduced sludge generation and better 
compliance with effluent standards
2
Expansion of Rooftop 
Solar Plant
The expansion of solar energy capacity from 31 MWp to 
70 MWp has been initiated across various unit rooftops 
and unused lands to enhance reliance on renewable 
power
Helped offset a large portion of grid-based 
power, reducing carbon footprint. 
3
 Green Energy Initiative 
– Biomass Boilers
Replacement of coal-fired boilers with three 80 TPH 
biomass boilers at MP unit and a 105 TPH paddy straw-
fired boiler with turbine integration in Baddi has been 
initiated. Biomass includes locally sourced Agri-residues 
like rice husk and paddy straw.
 Reduced use of fossil fuels, thereby cutting 
down GHG emissions. Also supports the 
circular rural economy by utilizing agricultural 
waste and improving air quality.
4
 4th Stage RO System 
at VFB–Budhni
In response to increased production demand, a 4th-stage 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) system is being implemented in 
series with the existing 3-stage RO setup to enhance 
overall water recovery efficiency.
Enabled high recovery of water (>97%), 
significantly reducing the load on the Multi 
Effect Evaporator (MEE) and achieving ~40% 
energy savings in the water treatment process.
5
 Modified ETP & ZLD 
System at VSGM–
Ludhiana
The project has been initiated to retrofit the existing ETP 
into a Membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR)-based Zero Liquid 
Discharge (ZLD) system, integrating a 6-stage Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) and Mechanical Vapor Recompression 
Evaporator (MVRE) to enable complete water recycling 
and reuse.
Reduced freshwater dependency by ~80%, 
enhanced water circularity and aligned with 
Zero Liquid Discharge mandates. Boosted 
environmental compliance and sustainability of 
operations
6
 Brine Recovery 
System at Baddi
A brine recovery unit is being installed to reclaim salt 
from the waste water streams of dyeing, enabling 
its reuse in the dyeing process again and promoting 
chemical circularity.
Reuse of recovered salt helped reduce 
chemical purchase costs, improved effluent 
salinity management and strengthened 
sustainable chemical practices.
