IRMEL, functioning as a service provider and does not produce any goods, therefore, 
generates waste exclusively from its projects & operations. All the waste is disposed of in 
an environmentally responsible manner through authorized vendors, in full compliance 
with the norms set by the Pollution Control Board, including recycling as mandated by 
regulations. The Company has established dedicated waste management processes 
across all its sites and locations. The hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored 
and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best 
industry practices. This hazardous waste is disposed of responsibly through authorized 
vendors for recycling, as mandated by regulation. In addition to hazardous waste, the 
Company also generates non-hazardous waste. The Company’s strategic objective is to 
eliminate or minimize waste generation and to divert waste from disposal by promoting 
reuse and recycling wherever feasible.

Has the Company implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its 
coverage and implementation. 
	
Given that water is not utilized in operational processes nor discharged as industrial effluent, IRMEL does not employ 
a Zero Liquid Discharge system. The Company’s facilities, including offices, City Gas Stations, and Compressed 
Natural Gas Stations, generate only domestic wastewater. This effluent is managed through appropriate disposal 
methods, including municipal or district sewer systems or repurposing for landscaping irrigation. The nature of 
this wastewater does not necessitate treatment prior to disposal.

10.	 Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishment. Describe the strategy 
adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and 
processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 
	
IRMEL maintains stringent waste management protocols with a primary focus on the safe handling and disposal 
of hazardous materials. A key component of hazardous waste is lube oil used in CNG compressors, which 
represents a hazardous waste generated by operations. To ensure safety and regulatory compliance, IRMEL has 
implemented procedures for the management of hazardous waste, e-waste, and other waste streams.
	
These procedures include the careful segregation and storage of scrap and used lube oil in dedicated facilities. 
All hazardous waste is handled, segregated, stored, and transported in accordance with applicable regulations 
and industry best practices. IRMEL also enforces a resource conservation policy that ensures compliance with 
environmental regulations related to natural resources, waste, and land. 
	
All waste materials are managed through vendors authorized by the State Pollution Control Board, who are 
responsible for recycling or environmentally sound disposal. Specifically, hazardous waste is disposed off 
through authorized recycling vendors as per regulatory mandates. Additionally, IRMEL has adopted the on-
demand delivery of odorant chemicals via tankers, significantly reducing the need for hazardous drum storage, 
handling, and disposal.

beginning with Banaskantha GA. This 
solution 
has 
streamlined 
forecourt 
operations, statutory compliance, asset 
management, dashboard reporting, and 
centralized document control resulting 
in 
improved 
operational 
efficiency, 
consistent and centralized data access, 
and enhanced compliance monitoring.
Centralized digital control minimizes the 
need for physical paperwork, contributing 
to lower paper consumption and reducing 
the environmental impact.Digital tracking 
of assets allows for timely maintenance, 
reducing equipment failures and potential 
leaks 
or 
emissions, 
which 
supports 
environmental protection.

By proactively coordinating with other 
utility 
agencies, 
IRMEL 
prevent 
gas 
leaks and pipeline damage, thereby 
reducing greenhouse gas effect, protects 
surrounding ecosystems and enhancing 
overall environmental safety.

environmental impacts. The primary sources of these impacts include the distribution of natural gas and the 
construction and maintenance of associated infrastructure. These activities can contribute to air and water 
pollution, as well as the emission of greenhouse gases factors that may accelerate climate change and harm 
local ecosystems.
	
To address these challenges, the Company has implemented a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
These include investments in renewable energy, technological advancements, continuous environmental 
monitoring, active community engagement, and strict compliance with regulatory requirements. Specific 
mitigation initiatives include the 'Dial Before You Dig' awareness campaign, leak detection programs, awareness 
drives for value chain partners, and coordination with utilities to minimize third-party damages.
