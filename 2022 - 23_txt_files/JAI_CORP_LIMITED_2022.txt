5.
Supply Chain 
Management
Risk
The 
Company 
understands 
that supply chain management 
is 
a 
potential 
risk. 
Any 
disruption in the flow of raw 
materials, 
transportation 
or 
logistics can cause delays in 
the manufacturing processes, 
resulting in loss of productivity 
and revenue. In addition, market 
uncertainties, political instability, 
and natural disasters can also 
pose significant risks to the 
supply chain. Procurement can 
be negatively impacted by the 
supply chain’s high dependency 
on a limited number of suppliers 
or vendors
The Company has established 
long-standing 
relationships 
with multiple suppliers/vendors. 
Continuous 
discussions 
and 
communication 
are 
maintained

these 
suppliers/vendors to ensure 
uninterrupted production and 
timely availability of required 
supplies.

to disruptions, and proactive 
risk management.

Management 
Policy 
to

related issues. In addition, the 
Company has implemented 
a robust cybersecurity policy, 
prioritizing the identification 
and resolution of cybersecurity 
threats.

solutions, 
aiming

water 
consumption,

trust. Therefore, the Company 
strives 
to 
invest 
in 
quality 
control measures, comply with

Describe the processes in place to safely 
reclaim your products for reusing, recycling 
and disposing at the end of life, for (a) 
Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) 
Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	
(a)	 Plastics (including packaging): The Company 
has implemented processes to safely reclaim 
plastic products for reuse, recycling, and 
disposal at the end of their lifecycle. This 
involves segregating plastic waste based 
on type and ensuring proper collection and 
storage. The Company enhances its recycling 
capabilities, transforming collected plastic 
waste into valuable resources for reuse. 
Moreover, the Company actively explores 
innovative 
strategies 
to 
reduce 
plastic 
packaging, encouraging the adoption of 
recycled materials and actively participating 
in circular economy initiatives. Through these 
proactive measures, the Company takes a 
holistic approach to minimize plastic waste 
generation and actively contribute to a more 
sustainable future.
	
(b)	 E-waste: The Company has established 
procedures for the safe reclamation of 
electronic waste (e-waste). This includes 
proper collection, storage, and transportation 
of electronic products that have reached 
the end of their life. The Company ensures 
compliance with relevant regulations and 
collaborates with authorized e-waste recyclers. 
These recyclers utilize environmentally sound 
methods to extract valuable components and 
materials while ensuring the safe disposal 
of hazardous substances. The Company 
promotes awareness among employees and 
stakeholders regarding the proper disposal of 
e-waste and encourages responsible e-waste 
management practices.
	
(c)	 Hazardous waste: As part of its commitment to 
environmental stewardship, the Company has 
implemented stringent processes for handling 
hazardous waste. This includes identifying 
and 
segregating 
hazardous 
materials 
generated during manufacturing processes, 
storage 
in 
designated 
containers, 
and 
adherence to applicable safety and disposal 
regulations. The Company engages licensed 
and certified waste management vendors for 
the collection, transportation, treatment, and 
disposal of hazardous waste. These vendors 
employ approved methods that minimize the 
environmental impact and ensure compliance 
with legal requirements.
	
(d)	 Other waste: The Company understands

significance 
of 
responsible 
waste 
management, extending beyond plastics, 
e-waste, 
and 
hazardous 
materials. 
It 
actively pursues strategies to minimize 
waste generation by optimizing processes, 
enhancing 
resource 
efficiency, 
and 
implementing waste reduction initiatives. The 
Company also encourages waste segregation 
and recycling practices whenever feasible. For 
non-hazardous waste, the Company ensures 
proper collection, sorting, and disposal 
in compliance with relevant regulations, 
relying on authorized waste management 
service providers. Additionally, the Company 
responsibly disposes of other types of waste 
by auctioning them through the MSTC portal 
to authorized government agencies.

result, the Company currently does not have any 
direct liability for the management of the plastic 
packaging waste.
