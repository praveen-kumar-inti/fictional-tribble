Given the nature of the sector in which the Bank operates, this question is not directly applicable. However, as a good

b.	
If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably? 
	
	
As an institution providing financial services, the Bank’s operations are not material resource intensive. Thus, 
sustainable sourcing of raw materials may not be a significant material issue for the banking sector in general. 
However, as a responsible corporate citizen, the Bank has been focusing on maximising its resource consumption 
efficiency, reducing waste generation while focusing on improving its process efficiency and productivity. Even 
as digitization of products and services has been reducing the requirement of paper, it remains a significant 
resource consumed during the Bank’s normal course of business, and it has focused on reducing its paper 
consumption further by scaling up recycling, procuring paper from more sustainable sources, and rationalizing

printing requirements internally within the business. For procurement of equipment that are required to run 
the banking operations, such as computer hardware, lighting devices, air conditioners and DG sets, the Bank 
considers green procurement and ensures that energy efficiency standards are duly considered during the 
purchase of such equipment. The Bank also has a Supplier Code Conduct outlining its expectations from vendors 
to adopt the sustainable practices.

Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life,

The Bank has a centralised and robust waste management system that helps segregate, collect, transport and recycle 
all the different categories of waste generated at its corporate headquarters, at Axis House, Mumbai, as well as 
several of its large offices. The Bank has undertaken several initiatives that helped reduction in waste generation, 
responsible waste disposal & recycling and reduce the load on landfills. In fiscal 2024, the Bank recycled ~210 metric 
tonnes of dry waste such as newspapers, shredded documents, dry paper cups and tissues. The Bank has deployed 
necessary systems and processes to effectively and sustainably manage paper waste and e-waste. In addition, the 
Bank’s digitization efforts across its office and branch locations are also helping rationalise its paper requirements. 
The e-waste generated by the Bank primarily consists of computers, monitors, modems, switches, laptops, scanners, 
routers, printers, and UPS systems. In addition to this, the Bank has engaged authorised vendors empanelled with 
SPCB (State Pollution Control Board) and CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) for disposal of e-waste in compliance 
with pertinent government regulations.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted 
by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
	
Given the nature of the Bank’s business activities, which is providing banking products and services to serve its 
customers and stakeholders, it largely consumes resources for running its banking operations. This includes purchased 
electricity and the use of diesel gen sets at its branches, and use of paper in its banking forms, statements, and other 
such documents that the Bank uses to conduct its banking activities. 
 
The Bank has in place its Policy on Environmental Management that provides a strategic guidance to its activities aimed 
at enhancing resource use efficiency and waste reduction while improving productivity and efficiency. Through varied 
initiatives, the Bank works towards reducing its resource consumption, as well as focus on enhancing energy efficiency. 
In addition, the digitization of its internal processes has aided its efforts, such as by replacing the need for paper. 
 
The Bank also engages with authorised waste recycling vendors empanelled with SPCBs (State Pollution Control 
Boards) and CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) for disposal of e-waste in compliance with pertinent government 
regulations. The waste-paper and plastics are given to local scrap dealers for recycling purposes. In general, the Bank 
does not utilise any hazardous and toxic chemicals in its products and processes, thus, it does not generate any 
hazardous or toxic by-product or waste as an outcome.
