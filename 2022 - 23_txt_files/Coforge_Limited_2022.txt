Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to 
manage such wastes.
        Waste management is a crucial aspect of our ESG plan.  Our interests start with reducing the amount of waste we generate 
and thus firstly minimize the need for disposal. Reusing items, such as glass jars or shopping bags, also limits, and reduces 
our waste. Recycling materials such as plastics, glass, and paper are also an integral part of our conservation plans prior to 
ending in landfills.
