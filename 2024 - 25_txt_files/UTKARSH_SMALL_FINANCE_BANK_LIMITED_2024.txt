Reimagine 
Redefine 
Rise 
The theme ‘Reimagine, Redefine, and Rise’ encapsulates a 
transformative journey that encourages us to envision new 
possibilities, redefine existing paradigms, and ascend to 
unprecedented levels of achievement. 
Reimagine: This phase involves challenging the status quo 
and envisioning innovative approaches. It requires a mindset to 
see beyond current limitations and conceptualise a future that 
aligns with our values. To steer through this period of change and 
transformation there needs to be a consistent and focused approach. 
It requires a conscious team effort to tide over this period of 
reimagination. At Utkarsh, we believe that  the onus lies in each of us to 
take a step in that direction. Resilience is one thing, but adapting to 
changing environment is another. A reimagined approach helps 
in building an agile and nimble force. 
Redefine: What brought us here needs a definitive action 
to take us to the next level. Building upon reimagined ideas will 
help to focus on reshaping and restructuring existing frameworks 
to accommodate new visions. It entails redefining goals, strategies, 
and processes to better reflect the reimagined possibilities, ensuring 
they are practical and attainable. 
Rise: The culmination of reimagining and redefining leads 
to rising above previous benchmarks. This ascent signifies 
growth, success, and the realisation of potential that was once 
constrained by perceptions and methodologies. At Utkarsh, we brace 
ourselves to work towards this defining moment. To Rise above the 
rest, taking giant strides towards Excellence in all that we do. Let us 
Reimagine, Redefine and Rise!

Chairman’s  Overview
A number of events in FY2024–25  had 
a significant bearing on your Bank’s 
performance given the background of 
adverse market conditions, coupled with a 
pronounced stress in the MFI segment. 
During the course of the financial year, we 
witnessed a rapidly evolving regulatory 
landscape, significant shifts in the 
competitive and technological landscape, 
and heightened expectations from all 
stakeholders. 
In this context, your Bank took significant 
steps to respond with agility, resilience, and 
purpose.
Navigating Through Change: A 
Year of Transformation
Amid uncertainties, India’s economic 
fundamentals remain strong, with higher  
growth in consumption, resilient rural 
demand, and a renewed government thrust 
on inclusive financial services. 
For Small Finance Banks like ours, this 
translated into challenges and opportunities. 
As one of the youngest categories in 
India’s banking system, we remain uniquely 
positioned to support the formalisation of 
financial services at the grassroots through 
our small finance bank.
Regulatory Developments: A 
Stronger Framework for Growth
FY2024–25 brought notable regulatory 
changes from the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI), which significantly impacted the 
way we operate. The revised guidelines on 
We will continue to 
build a legacy that 
makes a difference. One 
relationship at a time.
Dear Shareholders, Customers, Partners, and Colleagues,
14  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank
differential bank ownership  
	
structures, heightened expectations 
around governance and risk management, 
and increased attention on asset quality 
cum provisioning norms were initiatives 
designed to strengthen the sector’s 
credibility and long-term viability.
The RBI’s push toward greater regulatory 
convergence between Small Finance 
Banks and Universal Banks—especially 
in areas of capital adequacy, digital 
operations, and supervisory mechanisms—
reflects the maturity and potential of our 
category. Your Bank welcomed these 
measures and proactively adapted to align 
with the revised framework.
In particular, we enhanced our credit 
underwriting standards, upgraded our 
technology platforms for regulatory 
reporting, and strengthened our internal 
controls and audit practices. These steps 
are investments in our future resilience 
and demonstrate our commitment to 
transparency and compliance.
While the Joint Liability Group (JLG) 
segment presented its set of challenges 
during the year, due to the implementation 
of MFIN guardrails, the overall performance 
of the Bank reflects a story of strength, 
resilience, and balance. The growth in Fixed 
Deposits, healthy CASA levels, and a strong 
Capital Adequacy Ratio are testimony to 
our sound financial stewardship. The Bank 
maintained comfortable liquidity buffers, 
ensuring operational continuity and trust 
among depositors. These achievements 
highlight our commitment to long-term 
value creation and our ability to adapt and 
grow, even amid sectoral disruptions. It is 
this ability to hold firm to our fundamentals 
that will continue to guide us. 
Our Performance: Resilience 
and Growth in Tandem
Against this backdrop, your Bank registered 
a 7.5% growth in our total loan portfolio, with 
an expansion in our deposit base, which 
grew by 23.4% and reported a 23.7 Crore 
profit for the year.
Our Secured Loan Portfolio share 
increase to 43% in comparison to 34% 
in FY2023-24. This is in line with our 
expectation in making our Balance Sheet 
stronger each year.  
On the deposit side, we made notable 
progress in growing our retail deposit base, 
particularly in CASA (Current Account 
Savings Account), which improved our 
liability profile. We expanded our footprint 
with more than 200 new branches, 
enhanced our digital onboarding, 
and improved customer acquisition 
through simplified processes and digital 
engagement.
Digitisation and Financial 
Inclusion: Twin Pillars of Our 
Strategy
Digital transformation remains central to our 
long-term strategy. This year, we launched 
several initiatives including WhatsApp 
Banking to deepen digital adoption, 
internally and externally. Our mobile banking 
app, internet banking platform and Unified 
Payment Interface (UPI), equipped with 
enhanced user experience and security 
enables our customers to bank anywhere, 
anytime with ease and trust.
We believe that a hybrid approach – 
physical presence augmented by digital 
strength—will continue to define success in 
the financial inclusion space.
People and Culture:  
The Heart of Our Bank
At the core of our journey are our people. 
FY2024–25 saw us invest significantly in 
capability building, training, and employee 
engagement. 
Our employees are our brand ambassadors 
who not only build a connect with 
customers but also build a culture of trust 
and empathy. We continue to focus on 
building a diverse and inclusive workplace 
that values integrity, collaboration, and 
customer-centricity.
Sustainability and Governance: 
Building for the Long Term
Our commitment to responsible banking 
extends beyond numbers. This year, we 
advanced our Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) agenda by initiating 
policies on sustainable lending, social 
impact, and ethical conduct. We began 
reporting on key ESG metrics and set 
internal benchmarks for improvement. We 
came out with our first Sustainability Report 
last year and look forward to adding more 
value to our agenda in making our planet 
cleaner, greener and sustainable.  
The Road Ahead: Vision 2030
Looking forward, we continue to remain 
bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead. 
With the RBI now opening doors for SFBs 
to transition into Universal Banks, we are 
laying the foundation for our long-term 
aspiration. 
Our strategy for the next phase 
is anchored around two themes:
Scale with Purpose: We aim to expand 
responsibly by deepening our presence in 
high-potential markets, especially in semi-
urban and rural India.
Build a Future-Ready Bank: We will continue 
investing in digital capabilities, customer 
experience, and risk management to build a 
tech-enabled, resilient organisation.
In Gratitude
I would like to extend a heartfelt 
appreciation to our Board of Directors 
for their guidance, to our regulators for 
their trust, and to our employees for their 
dedication. Most importantly, I thank our 
customers and shareholders for their 
continued faith in our Bank.
Our Bank strives not only to be financially 
successful but also socially significant.
Let us continue to build a bank that truly 
makes a difference—one relationship at a 
time.
Warm regards,
Parveen Kumar Gupta

MD and CEO’s Message
Strategic Perspective
16  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank
It gives me pleasure to present the Annual 
Report for FY2024–25. Despite a complex 
and evolving operating landscape, 
the year stood as a testament to our 
resilience, adaptability, and commitment to 
responsible growth. We navigated sectoral 
challenges with agility, continued to serve 
our customers with dedication, and laid the 
groundwork for long-term sustainability. 
Our focus on prudent lending, innovation, 
and customer-centricity helped strengthen 
our fundamentals and position ourselves 
for opportunities in the microfinance sector.
Despite these challenges, I am pleased 
to report that we saw a significant 
improvement towards the end of the year. 
The microfinance sector stress peaked 
towards the end of the year with the 
stabilisation of collection efficiency and 
reduction in new PAR accretion  
as well as some improvement in 
disbursements.
The year also highlighted the constructive 
and proactive role played by the regulator 
in shaping the microfinance ecosystem. 
Timely interventions, including the 
issuance of guardrail norms and enhanced 
supervision, helped reinforce sectoral 
stability, improve credit discipline, and 
safeguard borrower interests. The 
regulatory framework provided a much-
needed clarity and direction, enabling 
institutions like Utkarsh Small Finance 
Bank to operate with greater confidence, 
transparency, and alignment with long-term 
sectoral goals.
We leveraged our diversified strengths to 
drive unstoppable growth. Headwinds in 
JLG strengthened our resolve. However, 
we continue to see good traction on our 
non-JLG and secured loan portfolio, 
healthy growth in deposits, led by retail term 
deposits and CASA. We also expanded 
our franchise and have more than 1,000 
banking outlets.
In terms of business performance, our 
deposits grew by around 23% year-on-year 
to H21,566 Crores. Deposits growth was led 
by a growth in retail term deposits, which 
grew by 33% year-on-year; our CASA 
deposit grew 31% year-on-year. Our CASA 
deposits ratio also improved to 21.8% as of 
March 2025 from 19.7% as on December 
2024. The share of CASA plus RTD ratio 
improved from 66% on March 2024 to 71% 
as on March 2025.
Our focus on sustaining a growth trajectory 
has taken on a new dimension. Rather 
than solely pursuing exponential growth, 
we are prioritising a strategy that involves, 
prudent risk management, mitigation of 
threats innovative solutions and sustainable 
practices.
Our Fixed Deposit book has grown steadily, 
underscoring a customer trust in the 
Bank’s stability. CASA remained healthy, 
contributing to a balanced liability mix, while 
our Capital Adequacy Ratio and liquidity 
position continue to reflect prudent financial 
management.
Our 331 branches in the top 100 centers 
focus on deposit mobilisation and retail 
asset loan sourcing, with potential for 
scaling. Our strategy includes customer 
360-degree perspective, product 
improvement, and digital enablement.
We launched NRI banking in the fourth 
quarter of FY2024-25. We reduced our 
CD ratio to 87% in March 2025 as against 
94% in March 2024. If we net off refinance 
borrowings from advances, our CD ratio 
declined to 78% as on March 2025. 
At Utkarsh, we are continuously integrating 
high-end technologies to enhance 
customer experience and efficiency.
India is ranked as the fourth largest 
economy in nominal terms, a little higher 
than Japan, with a nominal GDP of 
approximately $4.19 trillion. Projections 
suggest India could become the third 
largest economy by 2027, with a GDP of $5 
trillion in the next three years and $7 trillion 
by 2030, driven by continued growth.
The impact of recent economic trends and 
monetary policy changes on the banking 
industry in India can be broken down into 
areas, interest rate changes and profitability, 
credit growth and asset quality, liquidity 
and capital adequacy. The key challenges 
comprise Interest rate risk, Credit risk 
and Liquidity risk. Overall, the banking 
industry in India is expected to navigate 
these challenges while benefitting from 
the country’s strong economic growth 
prospects.
The number of potential clients for Small 
Finance Banks will increase based on an 
ongoing economic expansion, especially 
in semi-urban and rural regions. As the 
economy grows, more people and small 
businesses become financially stable, 
increasing their loans demand. Small 
and medium-sized banks are uniquely 
positioned to meet this demand, leading to 
higher savings.
Deposits at these banks have grown 
significantly, providing a steady funding 
source for lending operations. They 
can expand loan portfolios beyond 
microfinance to include secured products 
as the economy develops.
A robust GDP and the government’s 
sustained focus on inclusive growth ensure 
that these banks will continue to get policy 
support and initiatives that help them, like 
programmes that facilitate loan access for 
vulnerable groups. This is the right time to 
adopt the right approach for growth and 
achievements.
The use of India’s digital public 
infrastructure, especially UPI, has increased 
at an unprecedented rate. The number 
of UPI transactions has continuously 
increased. This digital momentum offers 
a low-cost, effective method of client 
outreach. On the other hand, utilising data 
analytics to provide bespoke banking 
products by comprehending consumer 
behavior can increase customer stickiness 
by facilitating upselling and cross-selling. 
The terminal learning is the integration of 
technology in all aspects of banking from 
concept to delivery to the customer at the 
last mile.

Business Overview

Annual Report 2024-25  |  19
Overview   
The holistic message from the Bank is 
that its business model continues to be 
robust despite the sectorial upheaval 
of the last financial year. Sensing its 
excessive dependence on the joint liability 
group business segment in the past, the 
Bank had embarked on a medium-term 
direction that would increase the non-joint 
liability group segment of the business 
when measured as a percentage of 
revenues. During the last financial year, 
this progress was underway when 
the entire 
microfinance sector in India was affected 
by a change in regulatory requirements. 
The upheaval validated the Bank’s 
decisions to broad base revenues 
towards more stable and sustainable 
revenue streams. By the close of the last 
financial year, even as the overall sectorial 
crisis appeared to have moderated, the 
financial spill-over arising from that crisis 
continued into the financials of most 
such institutions (our Bank included). 
The Bank is optimistic that its financials 
will stabilise starting the current financial 
year, strengthening its prospects around 
predictability and sustainability. 
The management wishes 
to reiterate that its 
overall business 
direction 
continues 
to 
remain relevant and that the Bank expects 
to return to attractive profitability starting 
the current financial year. 
Credit rating: This is the principal 
measure of our success because it 
reconciles a range of tangible and 
intangible competencies, condensed in 
a rating. At Utkarsh, our endeavour has 
been to consistently pitch at a higher 
credit rating (as appraised by the most 
demanding agencies). During the last 
financial year, the Bank’s credit rating was 
maintained at (ICRA) A+ (Stable) despite 
a sectorial and corporate weakening. The 
reputable credit rating agency factored 
the long-term robustness of the business 
model, the vast appetite for credit across 
India’s grassroots economy and the 
strength of the overall credit eco-system 
that strengthened timely repayments. 
Over the last few years, improved credit 
rating empowered the Bank to mobilise 
a lower borrowing cost from lenders and 
institutional lenders, which served as a 
hedge in a rising interest rate cycle (at that 
time). 
In a challenging 
FY2024-25, the Bank 
validated the robustness 
of its business model 
Bank’s  Performance 
Strategic perspective
20  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank
Financial performance: The Small 
Finance Bank’s total interest earned 
increased from H3,178 Crore in FY2023-24 
to H3,765 Crore in FY2024-25. There was 
a decline in interest earnings following 
a decline in the total loans made (as a 
result of the sectorial upheaval during 
the last fi nancial year). There was a sharp 
increase in Other Income in the last quarter 
of FY2024-25 on account of a focused 
approach and enhanced services. 
As the Small Finance Bank implemented 
new guardrails related to limiting the 
number of lenders to borrowers, there 
was a decline in the lending book that had 
a cascading impact on the bottom-line 
reported for the year. There was a 95.2% 
decline in the profi t after tax in FY2024-25 
when compared with the previous year 
following provisions. This decline was 
precipitated by an extensive H423 Crore 
provision made during the third quarter (the 
highest in any quarter of the small fi nance 
bank’s existence) of the last fi nance year. 
That the Bank could report a profi t in what 
was easily the most challenging year in the 
sector (apart from the pandemic) indicates 
the robustness of the business model and 
responsiveness to transforming market 
conditions.
Business performance: Despite a 
shakeout in the microfi nance sector in 
India, the Bank reported a creditable 
performance by growing deposits by 
23.42% year-on-year to H21,566 Crore in 
FY2024-25. This growth was higher than 
11% growth of deposits in India’s universal 
banking sector. This growth was largely on 
account of the credibility of its brand and 
practices as well as the low base eff ect 
of the previous year. Retail term deposits 
increased 33% year-on-year. The Current 
Account and Savings Account (CASA) 
deposit ratio stood at 21.8% as of March 
2025, when compared with 20.5% in March 
2024. The CASA plus retail term deposit 
ratio improved from 66% in March 2024 to 
71% in March 2025.
The implications of these improved 
numbers are as follows: 
 Current account and savings account 
(CASA) deposit ratio is a measure of the 
proportion of a bank’s total deposits that are 
in Current and Savings accounts. A higher 
CASA ratio indicates more profi tability due 
to cheaper deposits.
 Retail Term Deposits (RTD) comprise 
fi xed deposits held by individual customers, 
typically with a fi xed tenure and interest rate. 
While costlier than CASA, they are cheaper 
and more stable than bulk deposits or 
institutional borrowings.
 A higher CASA + RTD ratio implies that 
our bank can provide loans at competitive 
interest costs, accelerating disbursements. 
A strong CASA + RTD base refl ects a 
developed retail franchise, refl ecting 
depositor trust, reach, and service quality; 
an improved CASA + Retail Term Deposit 
ratio signals maturity in retail operations and 
reduces vulnerability to external funding 
shocks. Higher CASA + RTD ratios help 
address the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
and priority sector lending norms. They 
comprise a broader metric, indicating the 
proportion of total deposits that come from 
stable and low-cost sources—Current 
Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Retail 
Fixed Deposits.

Annual Report 2024-25  |  21
Loan portfolio: Our gross loan book 
growth moderated by 7.47 % year-on-
year in FY2024-25. This decline was on 
account of conservative lending following 
the upheaval in the country’s microfinance 
sector. The specific reasons for the 
decline in loan book growth comprised the 
following:
	 To curb reckless borrowing, the 
Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN), 
a self-regulatory organisation recognised 
by the Reserve Bank of India, introduced 
stricter lending norms. These comprised 
capping the total microfinance exposure 
per borrower at H2 Lakh and limiting the 
number of lenders to four per borrower. This 
translated into a significant reduction in loan 
disbursements as institutions adjusted to 
the new requirements.
	 The sector witnessed a sharp increase 
in credit costs, attributed to higher 
delinquencies, with loans overdue by more 
than 30 days increasing nearly 80 bps and 
inspiring cautious lending. The field staff 
attrition caused by the general elections 
and extreme weather events affected loan 
origination, collection and lending viability.
	 Adapting to rising delinquencies and 
increased regulatory scrutiny, the Bank 
optimised its net interest margin and 
operating expenses. These measures 
maintained profitability and guided loan 
disbursements. Most responsible small 
finance banks prioritised stable portfolios 
over aggressive growth, preferring to 
moderate their loan book growth and focus 
on cleaner Balance Sheets instead.
Utkarsh Small Finance Bank’s approach 
was no different. Microfinance 
disbursements were lower in FY2024-25 
due to a focus on collections that would 
help keep cash flows moving and the Bank 
liquid, which became a growing priority 
following the sectorial upheaval. The result 
was a decline of over H1,883 Crore in the 
micro-banking loan portfolio in March 2025 
compared to March 2024.
Joint liability group (JLG) comprises a 
lending model where a small group of 
individuals (usually women) guarantee each 
other’s loans. JLG loans (branch banking) 
represent the primary microfinance 
operations conducted directly through 
the Bank’s branches. JLG via business 
correspondents refers to the Joint Liability 
Group lending model executed through a 
network of third-party agents or partner 
institutions. JLG (Joint Liability Group) 
portfolio extends to groups of individuals 
(typically women) under a joint liability 
model, often used in microfinance.
The Bank moderated its overall exposure 
to the Micro Banking portfolio from 88% 
in FY2019-20 to 49% at the close of the 
year under review. Around 45% of our loan 
portfolio was JLG in nature, attracting a 
moral commitment across members to 
ensure repayment. Correspondingly, the 
non-micro banking portfolio (primarily 
secured lending) grew 43% year-on-year 
and accounted for 51% of the Bank’s total 
lending during the year under review (47% 
in the last quarter). In the non-micro lending 
segment, the small finance bank engaged 
in loans to the MSME sector, construction 
equipment, housing loans, commercial 
vehicles, micro loans against properties, 
personal needs and loans against gold as a 
collateral.
Asset quality:  At Utkarsh Small Finance 
Bank, success is derived from the ability to 
make safe loans as opposed to making the 
most loans. In view of this, there is always a 
commitment to achieve the sweet lending 
spot, marked by the largest quantum of 
safe loans that protects the Bank’s lending 
book quality and keeps it in business for the 
future.  
The Bank’s asset quality was affected 
during the year under review, following 
changes in the regulatory environment, 
coupled with the effect of the general 
elections and heatwaves. Repayment 
stress was observed in micro banking, 
particularly in Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar 
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. As a 
result of these extraneous realities, the 
Bank’s gross non-performing assets 
increased from 2.51% in FY2023-24 to 
9.43% in FY2024-25. 
The Bank responded to this challenge with 
a stronger focus on timely and complete 
collections. Collection efficiency in the 
X-bucket improved to 99.1% by the last 
quarter of FY2024-25 following an increase 
in the collections team, stronger technology 
use, repeated customer engagement, 
improved collection processes, specialised 
collection teams focused on specific 
buckets and a centralised meeting 
discipline.
The Bank also made extensive provisions 
that were more stringent than the RBI 
requirement. The extensive provision drew 
down the Bank’s surplus of the last financial 
year. 
Credit costs remained high due to stress 
in the joint liability group lending book and 
higher interest income reversals. The Bank 
held floating provisions of H190 Crore during 
the year, pursuant to the approval from RBI. 
The Bank fully utilised the floating asset 
provision as per relevant RBI regulations.

Debt cost: At Utkarsh Small Finance 
Bank, we capitalised on our credit rating 
to negotiate affordable funds.  The Bank 
reported a net interest margin of 800 bps 
during the last financial year, which was 
under pressure during the last financial 
year.  Net interest margins are a measure 
of profitability (difference between interest 
earned on loans and interest paid on 
deposits, expressed as a percentage of 
average earning assets). 
Liquidity: At Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, 
we pride on the fact that even as we seek 
to maximise growth, we leave an adequate 
safety buffer within the system that prevents 
us from over-reaching or stretching our 
Balance Sheet. Given a choice between 
stretching our Balance Sheet in our attempt 
to report superior numbers and the option 
of reporting slightly lower (yet attractive) 
numbers without stretching our financials, 
we will always select the latter. This was 
reflected in our capital adequacy ratio of 
20.93% by the close of the last financial 
year, which was higher than the RBI 
recommendation of 15%. Besides, our Bank 
had more than H791.72 Crore  in undrawn 
funding lines in addition to a fixed deposit 
corpus of H16,867 Crore by the close of the 
last financial year. This indicates that should 
there be an unforeseen loan demand spike 
in our business, the Bank will be attractively 
positioned to seamlessly call on the growth 
resources at its disposal – and not miss a 
single case disbursement. Besides, this 
prudence in keeping some financial reserve 
in store provides rating agencies the 
confidence that the Bank is conservative in 
fiscal practices, an asset in a sector marked 
by unpredictability. During the year under 
review, the Bank enlisted new institutional 
lenders like Samvedna Microfinance 
Pvt. Ltd., Laxmi India Finance Ltd., IIFL 
SAMASTA Finance Ltd. and K.M. Global 
Credit Pvt. .Ltd, broad basing its resource 
mobilisation platform.

Investments: The Bank continued to 
broadbase its presence deeper in the 
regions of its choice. The Bank opened 204 
branches in FY2024-25, increasing the 
total branch network to 1,092. Of the total 
branches added during the last fi nancial 
year, 55 were general banking branches 
and 149 were micro-banking branches. 
The Bank embarked on a business 
technology transformation project to 
enhance growth readiness, customer 
experience, and operational effi  ciency. 
There was a focus on improving core 
technology infrastructure and adopting 
futuristic technologies like AI.
Operating expenditure: At Utkarsh 
Small Finance Bank, our focus is to keep 
moderating the cost of staying in business. 
This cost usually comprises the cost of 
people to run the business, branches and 
brand. The lower the cost in relation to 
the quantum of lending indicates fi scal 
productivity. During the last couple of 
years, the Bank embarked on technology 
investments that were upfront but followed 
with a low incremental cost of customer 
acquisition or customer processing 
or customer service. By integrating 
technology deeper into our operating 
system, we will be able to moderate our 
operating expenditure as a percentage of 
revenues. The Bank increased branches 
from 888 to 1,092 at the close of FY2024-
25 and was present in 27 States. 
One of the most potent drivers of operating 
expenditure effi  ciency is the Bank’s decision 
to invest in cutting-edge technologies. 
We believe that enhanced technology 
investment will enhance process simplicity, 
business ease, customer service, replace 
the manual with the automated and 
increase employee productivity.  
We believe that some of the expenses 
incurred will only translate later into 
revenues, treated as a cost of staying in 
business. The Bank plugged all managerial 
positions; it created business verticals 
across diff erent funding slabs and nature 
of customers (MSMEs, for instance), 
which will enhance lending focus, enhance 
specialisation, enhance accountability and 
growth.
Utkarsh Small Finance Bank is graduating 
to become a digital-fi rst organisation, 
evolving from the physical to the ‘phygitech’ 
(physical plus digital). These technologies 
are being complemented by existing 
processes, creating the brand of a 
technology bank engaged in banking (as 
opposed to a bank that utilises technology). 
Outlook: The operating environment 
remained challenging for the microfi nance 
sector by the close of the year under 
review due to higher borrower leverage 
and tightened credit supply. However, there 
was a feeling that the worst had passed 
and industry players could look forward to 
increase lending without compromising 
their loan book quality. The Bank was 
optimistic about a stabilization in collection 
effi  ciency and improved asset quality in the 
coming quarters.
The management of your small fi nance 
bank remains committed to broad base its 
risk and increase the proportion of non-
micro banking loans and secured loans with 
a strategic shift towards individual loans and 
higher-yield products. The Bank introduced 
a secured credit card that is showing 
traction.

Expanding Our Liability Product Portfolio   
Deposit growth in FY24–25 was driven by a surge in retail term 
deposits. Going forward, we aim to strengthen and diversify the 
liability side of our Balance Sheet.
We diversified our funding mix in FY2024–25, ending the year 
with no short-term borrowings and maintaining healthy liquidity. 
Over the past five years, the share of deposits in our total funding 
increased. Despite a challenging environment, we remain 
optimistic about continued deposit growth, supported by our 
focused efforts. Our strategic partnerships to enhance our digital 
and fintech capabilities yielded positive results, contributing to a 
higher deposit mobilisation. The video KYC initiative for instant

Overview
At Utkarsh, we acknowledge a fundamental shift in how 
companies are perceived towards technology orientation and 
how deeply it is entrenched in the identity of the organisation’s 
core offerings. In this context, Utkarsh has consistently 
focused in enabling best-in-class technology experience for 
its customers. The Bank has a holistic approach in adopting 
cutting-edge technology in all its offerings and services. 
Utkarsh initiated its digital journey in January 2017 by 
establishing a robust core technology infrastructure. This 
comprised the implementation of essential banking platforms 
such as a core banking solution, internet banking, mobile 
banking, and a suite of control and peripheral business 
applications, delivered through a single, integrated engagement 
with a leading Indian technology provider. To support ATM and 
POS transactions, the Bank collaborated with a prominent 
switch partner, while data center operations and network 
management were outsourced to a Core Banking System 
vendor, ensuring centralised control and operational efficiency.
Digital transformation 
roadmap
Utkarsh launched its business 
transformation journey in FY2022–23 
with a forward-looking, strategic 
roadmap to reimagine products, 
processes, and the technology 
landscape. The initiative commenced 
with a comprehensive diagnostic phase 
to assess operational effectiveness and 
digital maturity, forming the foundation for 
a structured, high-impact transformation. 
The Bank is aligning technology 
investments with business objectives, 
empowering itself to scale sustainably 
and deliver inclusive, efficient, and future-
ready experiences.

Highlights, FY2024–25

delivery, streamlining internal processes, 
and enhancing customer engagement. 
The key achievements were as follows:
Retail and Customer innovation

secured and unsecured credit cards in 
partnership with prominent fintechs
Digital lending: Deployed a fully digital 
personal loan platform and began the 
rollout of a new loan origination system 
in collaboration with TCS.
Onboarding enhancements: Enabled 
Aadhaar-based VKYC, biometric, 
and facial recognition for secure and 
seamless account opening.
Customer engagement: Launched 
WhatsApp banking and Aadhaar-
enabled payment system (AEPS) for 
round-the-clock support.
Service and channel 
enhancements
	 Introduced cardless ATM 
withdrawals, eMandate for NACH, and 
ASBA functionality in digital channels.
	 Automated key workflows such as 
digital cashback processing and 
disbursement approvals.
Operational efficiency and 
automation
	 Implemented system-driven EMI 
calculations, geographic-specific 
ROI structures, and automated JLG 
collection improvements.
	 Enhanced data validation with PAN 
verification APIs, client liveliness 
checks, and location data updates.
API and integration 
improvements
	 Strengthened system connectivity 
through integrations with platforms 
such as Fino, NSDL, and Karza, 
enabling better internal coordination 
and third-party inter-operability.
Current: The Bank is at the design 
and implementation stage of its 
transformation programme that is 
centred around three priorities:
1. Reengineering core business 
processes: Digitising and optimising 
workflows to drive operational efficiency, 
reduce turnaround times, and enhance 
the customer experience.
2. Establishing strategic technology 
partnerships: Collaborating with 
leading technology providers to co-
develop secure, scalable, and future-
proof solutions.
3. Modernising the technology stack: 
Transitioning from legacy infrastructure 
to a modular, cloud-native, and API-first 
architecture that supports speed, agility, 
and innovation.
Vision: The Bank’s technology roadmap 
will deliver long-term strategic value 
across four key dimensions:
Scalable growth: The Bank will build 
a resilient and flexible digital foundation 
that supports rapid expansion in 
response to evolving market needs.
Customer-centric innovation: The 
Bank will redesign product journeys with 
an emphasis on personalisation, digital 
accessibility, and seamless omnichannel 
engagement.
Intelligent services: The Bank will 
harness the power of data analytics, 
artificial intelligence, and automation 
to deliver proactive, insights-driven 
customer solutions.
Resilience and regulatory readiness: 
The Bank will continue to  strengthen 
cybersecurity frameworks, enhance 
data governance, and ensure 
compliance through advanced 
infrastructure and robust internal 
controls.
Strengths
Vision-driven digital transformation: 
Utkarsh placed technology at the core 
of its strategic roadmap for enhanced 
scalability, customer-centricity, 
and future readiness, particularly in 
expanding its microfinance and retail 
banking presence.
Scalable and secure digital 
infrastructure: By investing in cloud-

health records (EHR) to track health vitals 
and manage prescribed medications 
efficiently. To promote menstrual hygiene, 
sanitary pad vending machines have 
been installed in all e-clinic centers. These 
machines offer rural women and girls 
a convenient, discreet, and affordable 
option to purchase sanitary pads at just H1, 
ensuring dignity and health in rural areas.
Health camps (polyclinic,  
multi-speciality and special camps):

services are limited, Utkarsh Welfare 
Foundation organises periodic health 
camps in remote rural areas, offering free 
consultations and medicines. These camps 
are staffed by qualified doctors and medical 
professionals to meet the healthcare needs 
of local communities. 
The camps comprised regular health

Management Discussion and Analysis
Indian Economic Review
Overview
India continued to strengthen its position as one of the world’s 
fastest-growing major economies, with GDP expanding by 6.5%, 
a moderation from the previous year’s pace but still a strong 
performance in the global context. Growth was powered by 
resilient domestic demand, a notable rural recovery, and robust 
expansion in services and construction. Agriculture also saw 
improved momentum, aided by favourable conditions.
Inflation steadily declined, easing to 4.63% for the year and 
dropping further to 3.34% in March 2025, creating space for the 
RBI to cut the repo rate to 6%. This brought relief to households 
and businesses, while also boosting consumer confidence. The 
rupee strengthened in the latter part of the year, and foreign 
exchange reserves rose to $676 billion, reflecting improved 
external stability.
The financial sector posted strong gains. Scheduled commercial 
banks brought down their gross NPA levels to 2.6%, and 
maintained a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 16.7%. Credit 
rating upgrades continued to outpace downgrades for the fourth 
straight year, thanks to low corporate leverage and consistent 
economic performance.
In the global context, the Indian economy presents a picture of 
strength, stability, and opportunity. First, strength comes from 
the strong balance sheets of the five major sectors - corporates, 
banks, households, government, and the external sector. 
Second, there is stability on all three fronts – price, financial, 
and political – providing policy and economic certainty in this 
dynamically evolving global economic order. 
Third, the Indian economy offers immense opportunities 
to investors through 3Ds – demography, digitalisation and 
domestic demand.
This 5x3x3 matrix of fundamentals provides the necessary core 
strength to cushion the Indian economy against global spillovers 
and propel it to grow at a faster pace.

Industry Overview
Indian Banking Industry
India’s banking sector continues to play a pivotal role in supporting 
economic growth through capital mobilisation, credit expansion, 
and financial inclusion. Banks and NBFCs remain the backbone of 
India’s financial sector, providing support to its growth aspirations 
by meeting the credit requirements of the productive sectors 
of the economy. Banks in India will continue to nurture and 
incentivise the development of infrastructure to give a ‘digital 
push’ to payments and settlements. They are  also committed to 
playing an enabling role in the adoption of emerging technology, 
while reinforcing its customer-centric measures and deepening 
financial inclusion. Maintaining financial stability and being a 
facilitator of development  will continue to remain the overarching 
goal of Bank’s in India under the regulatory and supervisory 
guidance of Reserve Bank of India. 
Though gross NPAs fell to a 12-year low of 2.6%, rising defaults 
in unsecured loans—making up 51.9% of new retail NPAs as of 
September 2024, pose risks, especially as many borrowers also 
hold secured loans. The sector remains well-capitalised but must 
manage emerging credit stress and global uncertainties.
Net interest income is expected to grow in 2025, with moderate 
growth expected through 2029, reflecting cautious optimism 
amid evolving dynamics.
(Source: IBEF, CNBC, Statista)
Small Finance Banking Industry
Small Finance Banks (SFBs) were established to drive financial 
inclusion by extending credit to underserved groups and small 
businesses. While the sector grew strongly in FY24 (24%), growth 
slowed to 18–20% in FY25 amid rising delinquencies, especially 
in microfinance. The GNPA ratio rose to 2.6–2.8% (from 2.1% in 
FY24), and ROA dropped to 1.4–1.6% from 2.1%. A modest ROA 
recovery to 1.6–1.8% is expected in FY26.
Profitability in H2 FY25 was hit by higher provisions and loan 
write-offs, needed to maintain asset quality for universal bank 
license eligibility. Margin pressure persisted due to high funding 
costs, increased secured lending, and rising operational 
expenses. Despite near-term challenges, SFBs remain pivotal 
in advancing inclusive banking through digital innovation and 
grassroots outreach.
(Source: ICRA)
Microfinance Industry
India’s microfinance sector remains critical for financial inclusion, 
supporting underserved individuals and small businesses. Stress 
levels rose, with NBFC-MFIs seeing 90+ DPDs climb to 3.5% and 
60+ DPDs to 5.6% by Q3 FY25, leading to slower disbursements 
and credit growth.
Profitability was hit by rising credit costs (peaking at 13.5% in Q3) 
and higher operating expenses. FY25 credit costs are expected to 
58  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
average 9.6%, as asset quality improves. Liquidity buffers remain 
adequate, but borrower overleveraging is a concern. To address 
this, a H2 lakh cap on total borrowings has been introduced, along 
with a new three-lender rule effective April 1, 2025.
While growth may moderate, these measures aim to ensure 
responsible lending. The NBFC outlook remains negative, but the 
MFI outlook is stable, supported by the sector’s importance and 
expected recovery in H2 FY26.
(Source: CNBC)
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector remains a key pillar of India’s economic 
growth, contributing 45.7% to exports in FY24 and employing 
over 25 crore people across 5.93 crore units. As a major driver of 
entrepreneurship, job creation, and rural development, the sector 
is central to India’s ambition of doubling its economy.
To boost MSME competitiveness, the Union Budget 2025–26 
raised the ministry’s allocation by 4.6% to H23,168 crore. Key 
reforms include increased investment and turnover thresholds for 
classification, expanded credit guarantee coverage, and targeted 
schemes for first-time entrepreneurs and sectors like footwear, 
leather, and toys.
MSME exports surged from H3.95 lakh crore in FY21 to H12.39 
lakh crore in FY25, with the number of exporting units tripling. 
The government now focuses on promoting R&D, tech adoption, 
and global partnerships to enhance product quality and global 
competitiveness, ensuring sustained growth and resilience for 
the sector.

Housing Finance
India’s housing finance sector has grown significantly, driven by 
rising incomes, affordability, and strong government support 
through schemes like PMAY. As of March 2024, the individual 
housing loan portfolio stood at H33 trillion, growing at a 13% CAGR 
over six years and comprising 14% of total systemic credit. Public 
sector banks hold 40% of this market, followed by private banks 
at 34.5%.
The sector is projected to grow at a 15–16% CAGR through FY30, 
with strong demand in affordable housing. HFCs’ portfolios rose 
13.2% to H9.6 trillion in FY24, with NIMs at 3.7%. Challenges include 
tight liquidity and stable borrowing costs, but NPAs are expected 
to remain moderate at 1.6–1.8% in FY25–26.

Commercial Vehicle & Construction Equipment 
Finance	
The commercial vehicle & construction equipment finance 
markets are experiencing steady growth, driven by global trade 
expansion, infrastructure development, and increasing industrial 
activity. In 2024, the commercial vehicle market reached $976.15 
billion and is expected to grow to $1,067.45 billion in 2025. Key 
drivers include e-commerce logistics, last-mile delivery, green 
transport initiatives, and supply chain efficiency.
Meanwhile, the construction equipment finance market, is 
expected to grow in 2025. This growth is fuelled by rising demand 
for construction equipment, smart city projects, accessible 
financing options, and stable resale values. Both sectors are set 
to benefit from continued infrastructure investment and evolving 
market dynamics.

Utkarsh Small Finance Bank’s Overview
Headquartered in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, Utkarsh Small Finance 
Bank Limited (Utkarsh SFBL) was incorporated on April 30, 2016, 
as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013. As

nationwide through its 1092 banking outlets spread across 
23 States and 4 Union Territories of the country. It maintains a 
significant presence in rural and semi-urban regions, aligning with 
its mission to serve underbanked communities.
This strategic focus on underserved areas has not only driven 
the Bank’s growth but also enabled compliance with the Reserve 
Bank of India’s directive that mandates at least 25% of branches 
be located in Unbanked Rural Centres (URCs). As of March 31, 
2025, 27% of Utkarsh SFBL’s outlets were situated in URCs. Over 
the past two financial years, the Bank has added more than 260 
branches, a steady expansion that supports its ongoing business 
growth and strengthens its diversified operational profile.
As of March 31, 2025, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank’s branch 
network comprised 761 Micro Banking (MB) branches and 331 
General Banking (GB) branches. The MB branches are primarily 
located in rural and semi-urban areas and focus on micro-
banking loans and advancing financial inclusion. In contrast, 
the GB branches are concentrated in metropolitan and urban 
centers, offering a broader range of services, including deposit 
mobilization and lending products such as MSME (retail assets) 
loans, housing loans, and loans for commercial vehicles & 
construction equipment.

in real estate sector, enabling growth in the institutional client base 
and an increase in CASA balances.
PFMS: Public Financial Management System (PFMS) is an 
initiative of Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India which provides a 
web-based application for e-payment of Direct Benefit Transfer

Defence Accounts Department (DAD) to act as a SPARSH 
Service Centre through all its General Banking Branches for 
which the Bank entered into an MoU with the Controller General 
of Defence Accounts, Ministry of Defence. This empanelment

To streamline and elevate the service experience, the Bank has 
deployed several technology-driven solutions, including tab-
based onboarding, next-generation applications, advanced 
customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and video 
banking capabilities. These digital tools play a key role in improving 
responsiveness, accessibility, and overall customer satisfaction.
Assets – Lending Products
Utkarsh SFBL continues to strengthen its retail loan portfolio 
by focusing on a diverse mix of lending products, including 
micro-banking loans through the Joint Liability Group (JLG) 
model, micro-banking business loans, MSME (retail assets) 
loans, housing loans, and loans for commercial vehicles & 
construction equipment.
As of March 31, 2025, the bank’s gross loan portfolio grew 
by 7.47% and stood at H19,665.59 crore. This expansion was 
primarily driven by strong performance in non-JLG segments, 
including other retail loans and wholesale lending, which together 
registered a robust 45% growth during FY25, albeit on a modest 
base. However, this growth was partially offset by a 17% decline in 
the JLG loan portfolio over the same period.
As of March 31, 2025, the Bank’s micro-banking loan book stood at 
H9,679 crores. Within this, the JLG (Joint Liability Group) segment 
saw a reduction, tapering down to H8,761 crores at the close of 
FY25 compared to H10,634 crores in FY24. On the other hand, the 
micro-banking business loan segment demonstrated a notable 
expansion, climbing to H910 crores in FY25 from H671 crores a 
year earlier—reflecting a year-on-year increase of 36%. This 
uptick was largely driven by onboarding seasoned JLG borrowers 
and sustained disbursals across recurring loan cycles.
Looking ahead, the Bank anticipates a positive momentum in 
JLG lending volumes alongside robust growth in business loan 
advances, underpinned by its established reach in regions that 
remain underserved. The Bank’s tech-led initiatives—ranging 
from fully digital loan and savings account onboarding to services 
like e-KYC, e-signatures, personalized QR-based collections, and 
micro-ATMs—are expected to reinforce a scalable and efficient 
operating model.
While Bihar and Uttar Pradesh continue to anchor the Bank’s 
micro-banking operations, its geographic footprint has been 
steadily expanding. As of the fiscal year-end, the micro-banking 
portfolio extended across 13 states and union territories, catering 
to over 28 lakh clients. The Bank’s presence spans 182 districts and 
is supported by a network of 761 dedicated micro-banking outlets.

Micro-Banking Lending
Utkarsh SFBL began its journey in September 2009 from Uttar 
Pradesh and has since built a strong track record in the micro-
banking sector. With a focused presence in rural and semi-urban 
regions, areas that remain largely underserved, the Bank has 
played a pivotal role in driving inclusive growth and expanding 
access to financial services.
The Bank offers Joint Liability Group (JLG) loans, Micro-Banking 
Business Loans for mature JLG clients, PM SVANidhi loans 
tailored for street vendors and PM Vishwarkarma to traditional 
artisans and craftspeople. These financial products are designed 
to empower low-income and underprivileged individuals who 
traditionally have limited access to formal banking. By supporting 
income-generating activities and entrepreneurial ventures, these 
loans have enabled many customers to improve their livelihoods 
and pursue their aspirations.
The JLG structure fosters strong credit discipline through frequent 
and personal interactions with borrowers. This model not only 
ensures financial sustainability across economic cycles but also 
delivers meaningful social impact—making micro-banking a true 
double bottom-line business for Utkarsh SFBL.

The bank offers cashless disbursement for all micro banking loans, 
ensuring that funds are transferred directly into the customer’s 
Bank account. In line with its digital strategy, the Bank is actively 
increasing cashless collections, primarily through customer-
specific QR codes and the bill desk payment gateway. This shift 
is expected to lead to greater adoption of cashless transactions, 
reducing operational risks associated with physical cash and 
improving the efficiency of field staff. Furthermore, the cashless 
payment model provides enhanced convenience and security 
for customers.
Onboarding micro banking clients is streamlined through E-KYC 
and E-sign processes, optimizing operational efficiency and 
ensuring a swift and seamless onboarding experience, ultimately 
offering a superior customer experience.
Joint Liability Group (JLG) Loans
The Bank offers Joint Liability Group (JLG) loans to clients for 
income-generating activities, leveraging a group-guarantee 
model that allows individuals to access loans without the need 
for collateral or security. This model encourages borrowers 
to foster credit discipline through mutual support, promoting 
responsible financial behaviour within the group and ensuring 
timely loan repayment.
The primary target segment for these loans is women in 
households engaged in existing or potential income-generating 
activities. The loan methodology includes regular centre 
meetings either fortnightly or bi-fortnightly and ‘stepped-up’ loans, 
which increase each time a client successfully repays a loan, 
demonstrating good credit discipline and a need for larger loans.
As of March 31, 2025, all of the bank’s JLG loan customers were 
women, with loans ranging from H6,000 to H1,00,000 to support 
various income-generating ventures.
Micro Banking Business Loans (MBBL)
To meet the growing funding needs of customers who have 
completed multiple loan cycles, the Bank offers micro-banking 
Saving, Pension and Health Insurance for Micro-
Banking Clients
As of March 31, 2025, the Bank had opened more than 25 lakh 
basic savings bank deposit accounts (BSBDA), aimed at offering 
appropriate savings and financial products to microfinance 
borrowers while encouraging a habit of saving.
To further promote financial security among its customers, the 
Bank offers the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) to savings account 
holders aged 18 to 40 years. Acting as both a point of presence 
and aggregator, the Bank enrols subscribers under the National 
Pension System framework, supporting long-term savings.
The Bank also provides Hospicash, a health insurance product 
that covers hospitalization expenses and also compensates 
for wage loss incurred by micro-banking customers during 
hospitalization, thereby offering both financial protection and 
income continuity.
Other Retail and Wholesale Lending Book
The Bank has consistently focused on building a well-diversified 
retail loan portfolio, catering to the varied financial needs of its 
customers. Over time, it has developed a comprehensive suite 
of retail loan offerings, including MSME (retail assets), housing 
loans, commercial vehicle (CV) & construction equipment (CE) 
loans, among others. The bank’s core geographies—Bihar, Uttar 
Pradesh, and other states—continue to offer substantial growth 
opportunities for these products as well.

business loans (MBBL) to its matured Joint Liability Group (JLG) 
borrowers. As of March 31, 2025  we have no. of JLG borrowers 
>27 Lakh and MBBL customer base is of more than 1 Lakh. 
Considering MBBL penetration level of ~ 4%, there is significant 
potential to grow.  During FY 2024-25, the bank’s MBBL loan 
portfolio reached H910 crore as of March 31, 2025. Given the Bank 
has long track record in JLG lending and has a large number of 
JLG borrowers , the Bank expects significant growth potential in 
MBBL lending which is also reflected in credit growth registered 
by the Bank in FY25. Furthermore, as the Bank provides MBBL 
loans only to its existing borrowers with good track record, asset

MSME (Retail Assets) Loans
The Bank offers a range of lending products to MSMEs, including 
secured and unsecured business loans, Micro LAP, and overdraft 
facilities. During FY 2024–25, the Bank expanded its MSME loan 
footprint to 86 branches, driving a robust 52% year-on-year growth 
in its MSME loan book—from H2,556.99 crore in FY 2023–24 
to H3,874.53 crore in FY 2024–25. This significant growth was 
fuelled by the bank’s deepening presence in underserved 
markets and its focus on financial inclusion. The MSME portfolio 
remains predominantly secured, with over 95% of loans backed 
by collateral, and the average ticket size ranging between H25 lakh 
and H35 lakh.
Housing Loans
The housing finance segment remains a key driver of economic 
growth in India. Utkarsh SFBL continues to strengthen its presence 
in this space by offering affordable housing loans to both salaried 
and self-employed individuals across formal, informal, and semi-
formal income groups. As of March 31, 2025, the Bank provides 
housing loans through 63 branches.
During FY 2024–25, the housing loan portfolio grew by 36%, 
increasing from H676.59 crore to H918.29 crore. This growth 
can be attributed to the Bank’s consistent focus on building the 
housing loan book, expanding network and a relatively small base 
of the Bank’s housing loan portfolio.
Commercial 
Vehicle 
(CV) 
& 
Construction 
Equipment (CE) Loans

both new and used commercial vehicles as well as construction 
equipment, with used vehicle loans accounting for less than 10% 
of the total CV & CE loan book as of March 31, 2025.
The Bank primarily serves small fleet operators, focusing on 
core geographies such as Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh—
regions that remain relatively underserved but offer strong 
growth potential. Moreover, markets like Chandigarh, Delhi 
NCR, Rajasthan, and West Bengal are emerging as attractive 
opportunities for expansion.
With CV & CE loans currently being disbursed through 47 
branches, the Bank’s loan portfolio in this segment grew 
significantly from H944.44 crore in FY 2023–24 to H1,188.13 crore 
in FY 2024–25.

and diversify its loan portfolio. Under this model, BC partners 
operate as an extended arm of the bank—acquiring, managing, 
and servicing customers while adhering to the bank’s internal 
governance policies and procedures.
The Bank leverages BC partnerships across multiple products, 
including Joint Liability Group (JLG) loans, small business loans,

the WSL share at similar levels going forward.

facilities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other 
entities engaged in manufacturing, services, or trading activities.

business expansion plans. In addition to fund-based lending, 
the Bank also offers non-fund-based products such as bank 
guarantees under its wholesale lending portfolio.
The loans typically range from H1 crore to H10 crore and are 
primarily secured by immovable property as collateral.
Business Strengths and Strategies
Strong microfinance expertise and rural reach: Utkarsh 
SFBL draws on the legacy and deep experience of its promoter 
company, UCL, to address the financial needs of unbanked 
and underbanked communities. Serving the underserved is 
a core element of the bank’s vision. With a strong foundation 
in microfinance and an extensive presence in rural and semi-
urban areas, Utkarsh SFBL is well-positioned to tap into growth 
opportunities in regions that remain relatively underpenetrated.
Expanding and diversifying the retail asset portfolio: 
Utkarsh SFBL remains focused on diversifying its retail asset 
portfolio to better serve the evolving financial needs of customers, 
particularly from unserved and underserved segments. The Bank 
aims to offer a comprehensive suite of retail loan products to 
address varying customer requirements across segments.
Driven by healthy growth in other retail loan categories, the share 
of micro banking loans in the bank’s gross loan portfolio declined 
from 62% in March 2024 to 49% in March 2025. This trend of 
decline in share of micro-banking portfolio is expected to continue 
over short to medium term.
Strengthening deposit base through retail-centric growth: 
Utkarsh SFBL offers a comprehensive suite of demand and time 
deposit products, including savings accounts, recurring deposits, 
and fixed deposits—designed to meet the needs of a diverse retail 
customer base at competitive interest rates. The Bank continues 
to prioritize deposit granularity, with a strong emphasis on growing 
its current account and savings account (CASA) base, along with 
retail term deposits.
As of March 31, 2025, the bank’s CASA and retail term deposit 
portfolio stood at H15,334.16 crore, accounting for 71.10% of 
total deposits, increasing from H11,550.72 crore (66.11% of total 
deposits) as of March 31, 2024. This consistent growth reflects 
Utkarsh SFBL’s strategic focus on building a stable, retail-led 
deposit base.
Broadening 
distribution 
network 
with 
significant 
cross-selling opportunities; Leverage Bank’s extensive 
franchise and presence further: As of March 31, 2025, the 
Bank operates an extensive physical network of 1,092 banking 
outlets, 708 are located in rural and semi-urban areas, aligning 
with Utkarsh SFBL’s core vision of financial inclusion. The Bank 
has opened more than 260 branches during last two financial 
years  FY24 & FY25,  providing services to a diversified clientele. 
Furthermore, our franchise and large customer base, in addition to 
the implementation of Lead Management System(LeMS), offers 
significant cross-sell opportunities. 
Prioritizing risk management and operational efficiency: 
Risk management is a central focus of the bank’s operations. 
Utkarsh SFBL has implemented a robust and comprehensive 
credit assessment and risk management framework designed to 
identify, monitor, and manage risks across various areas, including 
credit, market, liquidity, IT, and operational risks.
The Bank employs a range of risk parameters, including real-
time monitoring of regulatory changes and market trends both 
nationally and internationally. It frames policies, guidelines, and 
products in line with industry best practices, defines acceptable 
portfolio risk limits for each product, and utilizes an early warning 
system to track sector performance and establish boundaries for 
fund allocation to specific industries.
The bank’s effective credit risk management is evidenced by its 
strong portfolio quality indicators. Moreover, the bank maintained 
a healthy provision coverage ratio (PCR) of 51.18% as on March 
31,2025.

The bank’s success in managing these risks can be attributed 
to its efficient management team, composed of highly qualified

enables the bank to navigate challenges effectively, fostering a 
resilient and consistent franchise.
Pioneering technological advancements and expanding 
digital offerings: The Bank harnesses advanced, cost-effective 
technology to streamline its operations and improve efficiency. 
Utkarsh SFBL is committed to strategically investing in technology 
to optimize operations, reduce costs, and drive greater efficiency.

assisted services to a self-service delivery model. By continuing to 
invest in cutting-edge technology, Utkarsh SFBL aims to enhance 
the customer experience and provide a range of tailored financial 
products that meet diverse customer needs.
Strategic Business Technology Transformation 
Project	
Digital transformation has become a key driver in the evolving 
financial landscape, placing customer-centricity at the forefront. 
To manage and implement strategic projects efficiently, the bank 
has established a transformation management office (TMO) 
that serves as a centralized project management office (PMO). 
This office ensures all initiatives are executed within established 
timelines, while continuously evaluating progress and return 
on investment.
In collaboration with a leading consulting firm, the bank has also 
formed an internal team of select professionals to support the TMO. 
Utkarsh SFBL’s strategy focuses on diversifying and expanding 
its retail asset portfolio and liabilities business, while redefining 
customer journeys and optimizing operational efficiency. As part 
of this transformation, the bank is driving automation through 
the implementation of modern loan origination systems and 
enhancing the digital onboarding process with the support of an 
internal development team.
The bank is embracing cloud computing to build a robust and 
scalable IT infrastructure. Key applications are also being 
upgraded or replaced to meet the latest technological standards, 
ensuring a future-ready and efficient operational framework.
Commitment to Financial Inclusion and Focus on 
Priority Sector Lending
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates that small finance 
banks (SFBs) allocate 75% of their loan portfolio to priority sector 
lending (PSL), compared to 40% for universal banks. On account 
of higher proportion of PSL as compared to the requirement of 
the RBI, the Bank has been able to sell the surplus PSL portfolio 
through Priority Sector Lending Certificate (PSLCs) to earn non-
interest income for the Bank. .
As of FY 2024-25, after accounting for the sale of PSLCs and IBPC, 
the bank’s PSL achievement (based on quarterly averages) stood 
at 84.79%, significantly exceeding the RBI’s minimum requirement 
of 75%. This surplus PSL portfolio allowed the bank to earn non-
interest income from PSLCs, with PSLC income totalling H115.17 
crore in FY 2024-25.
Moreover, Utkarsh SFBL continues to comply with RBI norms 
for SFBs, ensuring that loans with a ticket size of up to H25 lakh 
constitute no less than 50% of its total loan portfolio. The Bank’s 
lending to the ticket size of less than H25 lakh was at 65.1% of the 
gross loan portfolio as on March 31, 2025.
Asset Quality
Bank’s Gross NPA Increased from 2.51% during FY 2023-24 to 
9.43% as on March 31, 2025. Bank’s Net NPA Increased from 
0.03% in FY 2023-24 to 4.84% as on March 31, 2025. The Bank 
has strengthened collections team by adding more manpower as 
well as separate team for bucket wise and vertical wise collections. 
The Bank has also implemented EBIX collection application for 
better tracking of our collection efforts. These have strengthened 
Bank’s collection efforts and are likely to support asset quality & 
collection efficiency.
The Bank was carrying floating asset provision of H189.96 Crore. 
During the year pursuant to the approval from Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI), the Bank has fully utilized the floating asset provision 
as per relevant RBI regulations. Consequently, the provision for 
NPA (“Provisions and Contingencies”) has been adjusted by 
H189.96 Crore for the year ended March 31, 2025. On an overall 
basis, the Bank had provision coverage ratio of 51.18% as of March 
31, 2025, against 98.92% for FY 2023-24.

by healthy growth in non-microfinance business during 
FY 2024-25. Bank’s NIMs declined from 9.44% in FY 2023-24

Outlook 
The reported year witnessed an increase in secured lending while 
there was a de-growth in JLG Segment. The Bank has reported 
annual operating profit (pre-provisions) of H1,007 crore in FY25. 
The Bank’s deposits registered healthy business growth of 
23.4% and reached H21,566 crore backed by increased branch 
penetration in urban and metropolitan areas. The bank opened 
204 branches during the year including 55 GB branches which 
are poised to augment deposit accumulation capability of the 
bank. The Bank also witnessed improvement in secured lending 
portfolio which have increased to 43% of gross loan portfolio from 
34% in FY24 and in the process providing more stability to the 
bank. Our high yield JLG portfolio underperformed during the year 
which we are expecting to improve going forward considering our 
good experience in Microfinance sector and other technological 
and human interventions. The Bank believes that there are 
significant growth opportunities available in the core operational 
geographies, owing to robust growth potential and relatively low 
financial penetration in FY26.
Utkarsh SFBL strives to be a retail-focused Bank, providing 
financial services to mass markets. The Bank intends to develop 
and offer a comprehensive suite of assets and liabilities products 
that will acquire new customers and strengthen the relationship 
with existing customers. Utkarsh SFBL will continue to augment 
the liabilities franchise further by expanding franchise, deepening 
relationship and targeting the top 100 districts of the country 
in terms of overall deposits, including   tapping of metropolitan 
and urban areas by promoting savings accounts and other 
deposit products.

Business Overview
Statutory Reports
Financial Statements
Annual Report 2024-25  |  73
complaints of Bank customers at the Bank level by an independent 
apex level authority within the Bank. Internal Ombudsman deals 
only with the complaints that have already been examined by 
the Bank’s internal grievance redressal mechanism and have 
remained partly or wholly un-redressed.
Further, the Internal Ombudsman also analyses the pattern of 
complaints such as product/category wise, consumer groups 
wise, based on geographical location etc. and suggests means 
for taking actions to address the root cause of complaints of 
different nature. The Internal Ombudsman holds meetings with 
concerned functionaries/department of the Bank and seeks 
records/ documents available with the Bank that are necessary 
for examining the complaint. Furthermore, in its endeavor to 
achieve fair, transparent, and customer-centric grievances 
redressal system, the Bank has synchronized its Internal 
Ombudsman mechanism with the Customer Relationship 
Management System.
In the backdrop of above, the presence of Internal Ombudsman 
at the apex level of Grievance Redressal Mechanism of the 
Bank is helping to enhance the impartiality of the mechanism, 
as the grievance resolution have an independent viewpoint as a 
precursor to Banking Ombudsman.

comprises Head Collections and Zonal and Regional teams to 
monitor over 150 fleet on street (FOS) and control delinquencies. 
The field teams are well trained in the Bank’s policies and code 
of conduct. The Bank also utilises an outsourced call centre for 
pre-EMI calling and reminding customers in case of over-dues for 
businesses other than the JLG lending business. The Bank also 
has an in-house legal team for the recovery of dues. There is a well 
laid down process and policy for the entire collections cycle: from 
tele-calling, customer servicing, legal notices, repossession, to 
auction of assets.
74  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
The Bank has established a robust and structured in-house 
collections framework to effectively manage and control 
delinquencies across its lending portfolio. The collections team is 
led by the Head of Collections, supported by Zonal and Regional 
Collection Managers, who oversee and coordinate the activities 
of over 150 Field Officers (Fleet on Street - FOS) deployed across 
various geographies.
These field teams are thoroughly trained in the Bank’s internal 
policies, operational procedures, and the Code of Conduct, 
ensuring that all customer interactions are handled professionally 
and ethically.
In addition to the in-house field force, the Bank leverages an 
outsourced call center to manage pre-EMI (Equated Monthly 
Installment) calling and to issue reminders for overdue payments. 
This outsourced support is utilized for all lending segments 
except the Joint Liability Group (JLG) lending business, which is 
managed separately.
To support legal recovery efforts, the Bank also maintains a 
dedicated in-house legal team. This team is responsible for 
initiating and managing legal proceedings related to overdue 
accounts, including the issuance of legal notices and coordination 
of repossession and auction activities.
The Bank follows a well-defined and comprehensive collections 
policy, which governs the entire lifecycle of the collections 
process. This includes:
	
Tele-calling and customer engagement
	
Field visits and follow-ups
	
Issuance of legal notices
	
Repossession of secured assets
	
Auction and disposal of repossessed assets
This structured approach ensures consistency, compliance, 
and efficiency in managing delinquencies while maintaining a 
customer-centric and legally sound recovery process
Treasury
The bank conducts its treasury operations from its dedicated 
office in Mumbai, operating under a structure that ensures 
independence among the dealing desk, settlement and operations 
team, and risk function. This separation promotes strong internal 
controls and enhances operational efficiency.
The treasury plays a vital role in managing the bank’s liquidity and 
financial stability. It oversees asset and liability management (ALM) 
and maintains the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), ensuring that the 
bank consistently meets its payment obligations and supports 
asset growth by participating in money and securities markets.
The function is governed by a board-approved comprehensive 
investment policy, along with other internal management policies. 
These guidelines help optimise investment portfolio yields while 
managing the overall cost of funds through a strategic mix of 
deposits. The treasury also ensures strict compliance with 
regulatory requirements, including those related to the cash 
reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).
To mitigate operational risks, the treasury has implemented 
a robust business continuity plan (BCP), which includes 
periodically conducting operations from alternate sites to ensure 
uninterrupted functionality.
Risk Management
Risk management forms a critical pillar of the bank’s strategic 
planning process, fostering informed, collaborative, and unbiased 
decision-making. The bank’s ability to effectively manage diverse 
categories of risks—while complying with current regulations and 
proactively preparing for emerging ones—positions it as a resilient 
and future-ready financial institution.
The bank follows a structured and integrated risk management 
approach encompassing credit risk, market and liquidity risk, 
operational risk, IT and cyber security risk, and other emerging 
risk domains. This framework is underpinned by robust systems 
involving people, processes, data, and technology to identify, 
assess, monitor, and mitigate risks in a timely manner. The bank 
ensures that risk management roles are handled by qualified and 
experienced professionals who receive continuous training to 
stay abreast of evolving risks.
The bank’s risk philosophy focuses on safeguarding the interests 
of depositors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders 
while maintaining the integrity and reputation of the institution. 
To cultivate a strong risk-aware culture, the bank conducts 
regular training through mandatory induction programs, refresher 
courses, and weekly risk workshops.
Oversight of the risk function is exercised by the risk management 
committee of the Board (RMCB), which periodically reviews the 
overall risk framework and strategic risk exposures. The bank 
also has dedicated senior management committees, including 
the credit risk management committee (CRMC), operational 
risk management committee (ORMC), asset liability and market 
risk committee (ALCO), and the information security committee, 
to manage specific risk domains. Furthermore, the bank’s 
internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) ensures 
comprehensive assessment of significant business risks to 
maintain capital adequacy and financial stability.
The bank has appointed a senior official as the chief risk officer 
(CRO), entrusted with the overall responsibility of managing 
key risk verticals, including credit risk, market and liquidity risk, 
operational risk, information security risk, and other emerging risk 
areas. Operating under the framework of board-approved risk 
management policies, the CRO plays a pivotal role in implementing 
and overseeing the bank’s risk strategy. The CRO maintains 
regular engagement with the risk management committee of 
the Board (RMCB), providing timely updates and insights on risk-
related developments, challenges, and mitigation strategies.

Credit risk
The bank defines 
credit risk as 
the potential for 
loss arising from 
a borrower or 
counterparty’s 
failure to meet their 
obligations as per 
the agreed terms. 
This type of risk can 
negatively impact the 
bank’s revenue and 
margins, posing a 
significant challenge 
to financial stability.
The credit risk management committee (CRMC) is responsible for overseeing and reviewing 
credit risk within the bank. The committee ensures the monitoring of prudential limits on 
large credit exposures, portfolio concentration, loan review mechanisms, and overall risk 
concentration. Furthermore, it addresses provisioning, regulatory compliance, and other credit-
related matters.
The bank has implemented various credit risk policies to limit the exposure to credit risk. Portfolio 
review and monitoring are carried out through an early warning framework and close monitoring 
of high-value customers.

Fraud risk
Fraud risks include 
cyber threats, scams, 
processing errors, 
and document 
mishandling, all of 
which can impact the 
bank’s reputation and 
revenue generation 
capabilities.
To mitigate this risk, the Bank has put together a Fraud Risk Management (FRM) department 
as an independent group in the Bank to enable fraud prevention, monitoring, investigation, 
reporting and awareness creation.
Fraud Risk Management Unit (FRM): The Fraud Risk Management (FRM) unit works within the 
overall risk management framework of the Bank. The responsibilities of the FRM Unit include 
effective application of fraud control measures, strategies and procedures. It is responsible for 
handling fraud complaints, desktop investigation, Fraud case mgmt., internal and regulatory 
reporting. 
Risk Containment Unit (RCU): RCU conducts risk-based evaluation of applications i.e. Screening 
& Sampling for any new account relationship in both Asset (Pre-sanction) as well as Liability 
(Post A/c Opening) Businesses at the time of on-boarding, on a sample basis. RCU Screening & 
Sampling (S&S) involves review / scrutiny of applications/documents based on dynamic trigger 
observed as well as inputs received from online checks such as CUG check i.e. Hunter/Sherlock 
checks. The objective behind RCU S&S Is to ensure that the submitted KYC documents are 
reviewed to ascertain any inconsistency or discrepancy in the documents or information 
submitted to the bank, for taking timely preventive and corrective actions to detect and prevent 
fraudulent applications at on-boarding stage.
Transaction Monitoring (TM): TM team monitors digital debit transactions carried out through 
various channels and payment modes, to safeguard our customers from any abnormal/
suspicious/fraudulent transactions. Transactions are monitored via near real time & real time

IT risk
The risks tied to the 
growing adoption 
of technology 
encompass system 
and process 
unavailability, which 
can lead to business 
losses due to both 
unintentional issues 
(such as faulty usage) 
and intentional events 
(such as cyber fraud).
To effectively manage IT risk and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of business 
and customer information, the bank has implemented security controls in line with the RBI 
cybersecurity framework. Regular security monitoring is conducted, and the bank adheres 
to regulatory guidelines as they are updated. To ensure business continuity while maintaining 
security, the bank has established controls such as VPN with multi-factor authentication, 
business continuity plans (BCP), and incident response protocols to address both operational 
and security risks.
Liquidity 
risk
An asset-liability 
mismatch can lead 
to liquidity risk for 
the bank, potentially 
forcing it to raise new 
liabilities at a higher 
cost or sell assets 
at a higher discount 
rate, which could 
negatively impact the 
bank’s margins.
The bank’s asset liability management (ALM) policy establishes a framework for managing 
liquidity risk, ensuring that the bank can meet its liquidity obligations and endure periods of 
liquidity stress, whether caused by internal or market-wide factors.
The bank’s liquidity profile is closely monitored both statically and dynamically, using key 
liquidity ratios and periodic liquidity stress tests. Liquidity positions and stress test outcomes are 
regularly reviewed by the bank’s ALCO and the risk management committee of the board.
In addition to regulatory limits, the bank has set prudential internal limits on liquidity gaps, 
borrowings, deposits, and placements. The bank also adheres to the liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) in line with RBI guidelines, ensuring alignment with the 
defined risk appetite.

to ID issuance—and onboarded apprentices under government 
schemes for future-ready talent. Our focus also included 
virtual training and leadership workshops aimed at improving 
performance across sales, liabilities, and assets.
We 
promote 
employee 
well-being 
through 
structured 
engagement activities, wellness initiatives, and recognition 
programs. From celebrating milestones like our 8th anniversary 
to awarding long-serving employees and recognising top 
performers, our aim is to motivate and retain talent. Our POSH 
policy, applicable to all employees and stakeholders, reinforces 
our zero-tolerance stance against harassment. These initiatives 
underscore our commitment to building a supportive, safe, and 
purpose-driven workplace.

Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited (hereafter referred as the 
“Bank” or “USFBL”), is a wholly owned subsidiary promoted by 
Utkarsh Core Invest Limited (formerly known as Utkarsh Micro 
Finance Limited) incorporated on April 30, 2016 under the 
provision of the Companies Act, 2013. The Bank is licensed by the 
Reserve Bank of India to operate as a Small Finance Bank under 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 on November 25, 2016. As per 
the Business Transfer Agreement, the entire balance sheet of 
Utkarsh Micro Finance Ltd. (now known as Utkarsh Core Invest 
Limited) was transferred to Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited 
as at the close of business on January 21, 2017. Subsequently, 
banking operations commenced on January 23, 2017, with the 
opening of five branches in Delhi, Patna, Nagpur, and Varanasi. 
The Bank has entered its 9th year of business operations. It 
was included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934 vide 
notification dated November 16, 2017 and was accorded the 
status of a Scheduled Commercial Bank.
The Bank aims to provide affordable & accessible banking 
services which are process centric, technology enabled, and 
people oriented resulting in reliable, scalable and sustainable 
institution facilitating socioeconomic change. The purpose is 
to provide banking products to the unserved and underserved 
sections of the country, which includes small and marginal 
farmers, micro and small industries, and other organized sector 
entities, at an affordable cost.
USFBL has prepared this disclosure document in compliance 
with the directions of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide its circular 
RBI/2015-16/58 DBR.No.BP.BC.1/21.06.201/2015-16 dated July 
1, 2015. The document provides a review of key observations 
pertaining to the Bank’s capital adequacy, credit quality, key 
business highlights and a review of its key risks as of March 
31, 2025.
I.	
Disclosure Framework (DF) – 1: Scope of 
Application	
The framework of disclosures applies to USFBL. The Bank 
does not have any subsidiary, nor does it have any interest 
in any insurance entity. All the information in this document is 
made as a standalone entity.
II.	 DF – 2: Capital Adequacy
	
1)	 Qualitative Disclosure:
a)	
The Bank is subject to the capital adequacy 
framework as per the “Operating Guidelines for 
Small Finance Bank” from Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI). As per capital adequacy framework, the Bank 
is required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk 
Weighted Assets (CRAR) of 15% with minimum Tier 
I capital as 7.5%. As of now, capital conservation 
buffer and counter cyclical buffer are not applicable 
for Small Finance Banks (SFBs).
For the purpose of capital adequacy, only credit risk 
is covered since there is no separate capital charge 
prescribed for market risk and operational risk as 
per the direction of RBI. For computation of capital 
for credit risk of SFBs, RBI has prescribed Basel 
II Standardized Approach and has permitted the 
use of external rating-based risk weights for rated 
exposure and regulatory retail approach for small 
retail loans.
	
Credit Risk (Standardized Approach)
	
Market Risk (Standardized Approach)
	
Operational Risk (Basic Indicator Approach)
For better assessment of the capital, the Bank is 
having Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process 
(ICAAP) 
with 
Simplified 
Approach, 
considering its nature, scope, geographic spread, 
complexity, and quantum of operations. Our risk 
management practices are in line with the required 
degree of supervision for a Small Finance Bank.
The Bank’s ICAAP focuses to ensure that the Bank 
has sufficient capital to support all the risks inherent 
to its business and an adequate capital buffer based 
on the business profile to cover future unforeseen 
risks upto a certain degree. The change in the 
level of credit risk, market risk and interest rate risk 
along with the changes in on- balance sheet and 
off- balance sheet exposures are assessed under 
different stress scenarios by the Bank to have better 
assessment of the capital requirement.
	
2)	 Quantitative Disclosure
Capital required for Credit Risk given below is arrived at 
after multiplying the risk-weighted assets by 15%.

V.	 DF – 5: Credit Risk Mitigation: Disclosures for 
Standardized Approach
	
1)	 Qualitative Disclosure:
Borrower’s financial strength and debt-servicing capacity 
shall be the primary consideration while granting credits 
and bank shall not rely, solely on collateral or guarantees 
as the primary source of repayment or as a substitute 
for 
evaluating 
the 
borrower’s 
creditworthiness. 
Nevertheless, collateral and guarantees, if properly 
taken and managed, serve a few important functions in 
credit risk management. These include:
	
to mitigate credit risk by providing the bank with 
a secondary source of repayment if the borrower 
defaults on a credit facility.
	
to gain control of the collateral which is the primary 
source of repayment of a facility in default.
	
to provide early warning of a borrower’s deteriorating 
repayment ability (particularly for credit facilities 
such as margin financing where top-up of collateral 
may be required from time to time); and
	
to enable bank to provide lower capital to 
credits which are secured by eligible collateral 
or guarantees.
Assets or rights provided to the Bank by the counterparty 
or a third party to secure a credit facility. The Bank must 
have a priority claim on the sale proceeds of collateralized 
assets or rights in the case of default of the counterparty 
or in case of occurrence of other credit events specified 
in the related facility documents collateral includes both 
primary and secondary securities provided to the Bank.
Primary security: Primary security is the asset created 
out of the credit facility extended to the borrower and 
/ or which are directly associated with the business / 
project of the borrower for which the credit facility has 
been extended.
Secondary security: Secondary security is any other 
security offered for the said credit facility. For example, 
mortgage of House, land, Fixed deposits, Gold etc.

Depending on the deal structure and overall assessment 
of borrower, the personal guarantee of promoter 
directors / partners / proprietor / property owners, etc. 
is taken in Wholesale Banking vertical on a case - to - 
case basis.
The credit documentation empowers the bank to 
apply the collateral freely to discharge the borrower’s 
obligations in so far as they are not discharged by 
the borrower in accordance with the loan agreement 
(e.g., due to breach of repayment terms, liquidation, 
or bankruptcy of the borrower). The bank verifies the 
existence and ownership of the assets being pledged 
before acceptance and ensures that there is no prior 
claim, or claim of equal ranking, by another party on the 
collateral. The bank secures its control of the collateral 
prior to the drawdown of credit facilities e.g., it obtains 
customers’ authorization to transfer the legal title to the 
pledged shares to the bank etc. Where there is a need for 
the collateral to be held by a third party, the bank obtains 
that party’s written confirmation that it has no claim 
over the collateral. Charges on collateral are registered 
promptly with the relevant authorities under applicable 
law (e.g., registrar of companies – ROC, CERSAI), 
where appropriate.
Valuations are based on the current market value of 
the collateral and are not biased to enable the bank, to 
grant a higher credit limit to the borrower or improve its 
internal credit rating, make a smaller amount of provision, 
or continue interest accrual for a problem credit. The 
bank ensures that the valuation method used, whether 
internal or external, is based on assumptions that are 
both reasonable and prudent and all assumptions 
should be clearly documented.
Collateral are being revalued on a regular basis, though 
the frequency may vary with the type of collateral 
involved and the nature & the internal credit rating of the 
underlying credit e.g., frequency for shares and properties 
as collateral would be different. Staff conducting internal 
valuations, carrying out site visits to collateralized 
properties or deciding on the use of external valuers etc. 
shall be independent of the marketing or credit granting 
& approval function. The bank monitors general trends 
in markets (e.g., property price and stock indices) for 
the major types of collateral taken. It conducts stress 
tests & scenario analysis on their portfolio of collateral to 
assess the impact under unusual market conditions (e.g., 
a significant decline in property or stock prices).
Authority and responsibility are clearly delegated to 
relevant individuals and departments for approving the 
acceptance, monitoring or safe custody of collaterals 
and guarantees. The bank ensures safe custody, easy 
retrieval, control over movement, control over access, 
of collateral & guarantees depending upon their nature 
& types e.g., use of fireproof vault etc. Collaterals 
& guarantees are being handled as per the bank’s 
internal procedures.
Bank periodically verify the availability of collateral 
though inspection and audit. Prior to the release of 
collateral or guarantees, bank shall ensure that:
	
all conditions for release stipulated in the relevant 
loan agreements have been fully complied with; and
	
the release has been duly authorized.
All the collateral acquired by the bank during the 
satisfaction of debts due to it will be disposed of at the 
earliest suitable opportunity. Disposal of collateral will 
be at arm’s length and through a transparent process 
(such as a public auction or independent estate agents 
for foreclosed properties etc.) to avoid complaints / 
disputes by the original owner. The bank will ensure that 
the disposal of collateral complies with relevant laws and 
regulations and where appropriate, legal advice should 
be sought.
Management information on collateral has been 
produced periodically to facilitate review by the senior 
management. The information required will depend 
on the nature and value of collateral taken by the bank. 
Following information can be included (inclusive):
	
Breakdown of credit exposure by type of collateral
	
Borrowings exceeding maximum loan to- value ratio.
	
Total current market value of assets foreclosed 
during satisfaction of debts.
	
Comparison of latest assessed market value with 
actual proceeds of collateral sold.
	
Current market value of collateral related to each 
classified credit.
Risk concentrations are the single most important 
cause of major problems in banks and may take many 
forms including exposures to types of assets, individual 
counterparties, groups of related counterparties and 
counterparties in specific geographical locations, 
economic or industry sectors,
The following exposures shall be included while 
monitoring geographical concentration of exposures:
	
Sanction limit or outstanding limit
	
Sanction limit but not disbursed; and
	
Agreement in principle
Geographical concentration risk has been monitored 
by the RMD based on region / zone in which the 
loan is booked. Bank endeavors to gradually reduce 
the geographical concentration to ensure that any 
unfavorable event in any region is not significantly 
affecting the bank’s portfolio. The concentration of the 
top two states shall not exceed 50% of the total portfolio. 
Concentration of any other state shall not exceed 15% 
of the portfolio. Similarly, portfolio concentration for JLG 
in single district shall not exceed 4% of the portfolio. If 
certain level of concentration is unavoidable due to the 
92  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
Bank’s trade area, geographic location, lack of access to 
diverse borrowers, Bank’s own expertise in a particular 
industry or economic sector, in such cases, the Bank 
shall monitor the performance of such portfolio very 
closely to take appropriate steps in case of any red flags.
The Bank complies with the statutory exposure limits 
set by RBI for individual counterparties, group of 
counterparties, geography / region, industry / sector 
etc. The Bank has established internal exposure limits 
that may be more conservative than the statutory limits 
stipulated by RBI, commensurate with capital base 
and balance sheet size. Appropriate justification shall 
be recorded for enhancement of such limits. The Bank 
shall carry out analysis of the credit portfolio, including 
estimates of its trends and use results in setting internal 
limits. Aggregate exposure in NBFC should not be more 
than 10% of the credit exposure of the Bank as per the 
last quarter balance sheet. Factors like the perceived risk 
of a certain sector or region, the nature of the product, 
maturity/tenor, and purpose of credit and sources of 
payment may also be considered while fixing internal 
exposure limits.

b)	
Strategies and Processes
Risk identification entails ensuring all instruments 
that result in Market Risk both on-balance sheet 
and off- balance sheet of the Bank is identified 
and monitored centrally. To achieve this objective, 
all new instruments/ products in which the Bank 
engages should be assessed. The Asset Liability 
Management Committee (ALCO) reviews all new 
instruments to evaluate whether they result in 
market risk. Modifications to existing instruments 
are reported to the ALCO to enable such evaluation.
The Market Risk Division of the Risk Management 
Department 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
design 
and implementation of the Bank’s market risk 
management/ALM 
system. 
The 
Division 
is 
independent from business and trading units, and 
provides an independent risk assessment, which 
is critical to the ALCO’s key function of controlling 
and managing market risks in accordance with 
the mandate established by the Board and Risk 
Management Committee. Mid Office of the Bank’s 
Treasury function is attached to the Market Risk 
Division of Risk Management Department. Mid 
Office prepares and analyses daily reports on 
various activities of the Bank’s Treasury. The 
Mid Office, which is responsible for the critical 
functions of independent market risk monitoring, 
measurement and analysis, reports to the Bank’s 
Chief Risk Officer through the Head of Market 
Risk Division.

Market Risk Measurement
Adverse movements in interest rates can affect both 
interest earnings and the fair or economic value 
of the financial instruments. The very nature of the 
financial intermediation business makes the Bank 
susceptible to interest rate risk and unmanaged 
risk could potentially pose a significant threat to the 
Bank’s earnings and capital. Interest rate risk results 
from both the trading book and banking book. The 
impact of interest rate risk on trading book is actively 
measured using trading book risk metrics like PV01, 
duration, etc. For the banking book, interest rate risk

arises through mismatches in re-pricing of interest 
rate sensitive assets (RSA), rate sensitive liabilities 
(RSL) and rate sensitive off-balance sheet items.
For SFBs, Reserve Bank of India has not prescribed 
capital charge for market risk. Since the market 
risk framework also covers specific risk charge, 
therefore, to assess the credit risk in the trading 
book, an external rating-based approach is used, 
and risk weighted assets so computed are included 
under credit risk.

1)	 Qualitative disclosures:
Operational Risk is defined as the risk of losses resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, 
and systems or from external events, which includes 
but is not limited to legal risk. It is inherent in all activities 
arising out of a bank’s business and operations and 
could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory fines, 
or other damage to the bank. The severity of impact on 
the bank, its employees and customers are dependent 
on the efficacy with which operational risk is managed 
by the bank. The goal is to keep operational risk at 
appropriate levels, considering the bank’s financial 
strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, and the competitive and 
regulatory environment in which it operates.

functions are accountable for operational risks 
and controls in their respective areas, which they 
manage as per the policies, standards, processes, 
procedures; and operational risk management 
framework laid down by the independent operation 
risk management (ORM) function.
ORM along with product and process managers 
facilitates the business and operation groups for 
carrying out risk and control self-assessments on a 
periodic basis. All the new products and processes 
including modifications thereof are reviewed by 
the control groups such as risk, compliance, legal 
and audit.

capturing operational risk incidents. Significant 
incidents reported are investigated to assess 
weaknesses 
in 
controls 
and 
identify 
areas 
for improvement.
The Bank also has a Whistle blower policy, which 
is open to employees and vendors for raising their 
concerns, with full confidentiality, on any fraud, 
malpractice or any other untoward activity or 
event. The Bank has a separate Risk Containment 
Unit (RCU) to pre-empt and weed out undesirable 
prospective customers at the on-boarding stage 
itself. The Bank also has Fraud Risk Management 
Unit to detect and prevent frauds as also address 
fraud risk related issues and conduct investigations 
wherever frauds have been detected or potential 
frauds are flagged.
There is an independent information security group, 
which addresses information and cyber security 
related risks. The function is governed by a Board 
approved policies on information security and cyber 
security. The Bank carries out periodical awareness 
exercise to ensure that employees are updated 
on information security practices. The information 
security function is driven by both technology and 
process driven controls.

IX.	 DF – 9: Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book 
(IRRBB)
	
1)	 Qualitative Disclosure
Interest rate risk is the risk where changes in market 
interest rates might adversely affect a bank’s financial 
condition. The immediate impact of changes in interest 
rates is on bank’s earnings through changes in its Net 
Interest Income (NII). A long-term impact of changes in 
interest rates is on bank’s Market Value of Equity (MVE) 
or Net worth through changes in the economic value of 
its, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions. The interest 
rate risk, when viewed from these two perspectives, is 
known as ‘earnings perspective’ and ‘economic value’ 
perspective, respectively.
The interest rate risk is measured and monitored 
through two approaches:
Earning at Risk (EAR): Earnings perspective involves 
analysing the impact of changes in interest rates on 
accrual or reported earnings in the near term. This is 
measured using TGA whose focus is to measure the 
level of a bank’s exposure to interest rate risk in terms of 
sensitivity of its NII to interest rate movements over the 
horizon of analysis which is usually one year. It involves 
bucketing of all RSA and RSL and off - balance sheet 
items as per residual maturity/ re-pricing date in various 
time bands and compute Earnings at Risk (EaR) i.e. loss 
of income under different interest rate scenarios over a 
time horizon of one year.
Market Value of Equity (MVE): This approach 
analyses the dynamic behaviour of economic value of 
equity with response to varying interest rate scenarios. 
Broadly, the MVE is defined as the difference between 
the market value of assets and market value of liability 
in response to a change in the interest rate. The linkage 
between the two is established via modified duration of 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
The Duration Gap Analysis (DGA) would involve 
bucketing of all on- and off- balance sheet Risk Sensitive 
Assets (RSA) and Risk Sensitive Liabilities (RSL) as 
per their residual maturity / re-pricing dates in various 
time bands and computing the Modified Duration Gap 
(MDG). MDG would be used to evaluate the impact on 
the Market Value of Equity (MVE) of the bank under 
different interest rate scenarios.
Modified Duration of an asset or liability measures the 
approximate percentage change in its value for a 100 
basis point change in the rate of interest.

c.	
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are considered in the remuneration processes.
	 	 An overview of the key risks that the bank considers when implementing remuneration measures.
The overall objectives for laying down a Compensation policy is to offer compensation systems that makes it 
possible to attract, retain and motivate the most outstanding professionals to enable the bank to attain its strategic 
objectives and sustainable growth within increasingly competitive context in which it operates. Further, the 
compensation system would be in line with the various regulatory frameworks. It also ends to align compensation

of risks. The identified risk parameters (and additions if any) will be reflected in the bank’s Performance Management 
System (PMS).
	 	 An overview of the nature and type of key measures used to take account of these risks, including risk difficult to 
measure (values need not be disclosed)
The bank uses the following key measures to take account of Risks in the business.
a)	
Financial Parameters which establish the linkage of compensation with individual performance as well as 
achievement of the corporate objectives of the Bank which include a significant variable pay component 
tied to the achievement of pre-established objectives in line with Bank’s scorecard while ensuring that the 
compensation is aligned with prudent risk taking.
b)	
Encourage attainment of long-term shareholder returns through inclusion of equity linked long-term incentives 
as part of compensation.
c)	
The mix of cash, equity and other terms of compensation are consistent with risk alignment. Further, the 
compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes.
d)	
The score cards used to measure performance include key metrics such as Non-Performing Assets, Audit 
Scores, Reserve Bank of India RBS report observations etc. to ensure that the performance measures cover 
all aspects of the job.
	 	 The ways in which these measures affect remuneration.
The measures listed above impact the immediate total CTC computation based on the overall performance 
measurement of an individual role holder for a given FY. In case of non-performance the variable component for an 
individual role holder is not given and for the rest it is computed on a sliding scale of performance review which is 
approved by the board and the NRC annually. Also caps of cash component of variable as well as deferment of both 
cash and non-cash bonuses is applied as per the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
	 	 How the nature and type of these measures have changed over the past year and reasons for the changes, as well

against property, wholesale lending that includes short term and 
long-term loan facilities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), 
mid and large corporate and institutional clients and gold loans. In

business loans to other existing branches. The Bank provides

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED
Opinion
We have jointly audited the accompanying financial statements 
of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK LIMITED (the “Bank”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, Profit 
and Loss Account, the Cash Flow Statement for the year then 
ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements 
give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949 and the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner 
so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act 
(“Accounting Standards”) as applicable to the Bank, the relevant 
circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank 
of India (“RBI”) from time to time and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at 
March 31, 2025, and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended 
on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing (“SA”s) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Sr. No.
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
1.  Identification of and Provisioning against Non-performing Assets (“NPAs”):
Total Loans and Advances (Net of Provision) as at March 31, 2025: Rs. 18,71,648 Lakhs
Provision for NPAs as at March 31, 2025: Rs. 94,910 Lakhs
Refer Schedule 9, Schedule 17(B)(c) and Schedule 18.4.1
Advances constitute a significant portion of the Bank’s assets and 
the quality of these advances is measured in terms of ratio of NPA to 
the gross advances of the Bank. 
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular issued by 
the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) on ‘Prudential Norms for Income 
Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining 
to Advances’ (the’ IRAC norms’) and amendments thereto (“RBI 
guidelines”) which prescribes the norms for identification and 
classification of Non-performing Assets (‘NPAs’) and the minimum 
provision required for such assets. 
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against NPAs considering 
various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
As the identification of and provisioning against NPAs requires 
considerable level of management estimation, application of 
various regulatory requirements and its significance to the overall 
audit due to stakeholder and regulatory focus, we have identified 
this as a key audit matter.
Our audit approach included testing the design, operating 
effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit 
procedures in respect of income recognition, asset classification 
and provisioning. In particular:
	y
We have evaluated and understood the Bank’s internal 
control system in adhering to the RBI guidelines;
	y
We have analysed and understood key IT systems/ 
applications used and tested the design and implementation 
as well as operational effectiveness of relevant controls 
in relation to income recognition, asset classification, viz., 
standard, sub-standard, doubtful and loss with reference to 
RBI guidelines and provisioning pertaining to advances;
	y
We test checked advances to examine the validity and 
accuracy of the recorded amounts, impairment provision for 
NPAs, recognition of floating asset provision based on board 
approved policy and its utilisation based on RBI’s approval, in 
compliance with IRAC norms and other RBI Guidelines.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
Information Technology (‘IT’) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
As a Scheduled Commercial Bank that operates on core banking 
solution (“CBS”) and other applications across its branches, the 
reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in the business 
operations. Since large volume of transactions are processed daily, 
the IT controls are required to ensure that applications process data 
as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate manner. 
The IT infrastructure is critical for smooth functioning of the Bank’s 
business operations as well as for timely and accurate financial 
accounting and reporting. 
Due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT environment 
we have ascertained Key Information technology (“IT”) systems 
used in financial reporting process as a key audit matter. 
In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we 
involved our technology specialists to understand the IT control 
environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems.
We conducted an assessment and identified key IT systems 
that are critical for accounting and financial reporting process 
and are relevant for our audit and tested their internal controls. In 
particular:
	y
We obtained an understanding of the Bank’s IT control 
environment and key changes during the audit period that 
may be relevant to the audit;
	y
We tested the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the Bank’s General IT controls over the key 
IT systems that are critical to financial reporting. This included 
evaluation of Bank’s controls to evaluate segregation of 
duties and access rights being provisioned / modified based 
on duly approved requests, access for exit cases being 
revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being 
recertified during the period of audit;
	y
We tested key automated and manual business cycle 
controls and logic for system generated reports relevant to 
the audit; and
	y
We also tested compensating controls and performed 
alternate procedures to assess whether there were any 
unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the 
financial statements.
Information Other than the Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report Thereon
	
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
preparation of the other information. The other information 
comprises the Chairman’s Statement, the Directors Report 
including annexures to the Directors report included in the 
Annual Report but does not include the financial statements 
and our auditors report thereon and the Basel II Disclosures 
under New Capital Adequacy Framework (Basel II 
Disclosures).
	
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and Basel II Disclosures and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
	
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
	
If, based on the work we have performed on the other 
information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s 
report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and those 
charged with Governance for the Financial 
Statements	
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of 
the Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of 
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Accounting Standards and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India and the 
circulars, guidelines and the directions issued by RBI, from time to 
time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding the assets of the Bank and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the financial statements that 
206  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management and Board 
of Directors are responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
The Bank’s Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing 
the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements	
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstance. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Bank has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial 
statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; 
and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the 
financial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

to financial statements of UTKARSH SMALL FINANCE BANK 
LIMITED (the “Bank”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our

Management’s 
Responsibility 
for 
Internal 
Financial Controls	
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal 
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank 
considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness

Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing 
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, 
to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls over financial reporting was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. the procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Bank’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
reference to financial statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of internal financial control 
with reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial control 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

Advances
	
a)	
Accounting and Classification
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing (NPA) as per RBI guidelines. Restructured assets are classified and 
provided for in accordance with the guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time.
The Bank considers a restructured account as one where the Bank, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s 
financial difficulty, grants to the borrower concessions that the Bank would not otherwise consider. Restructuring would 
normally involve modification of terms of the advances / securities, which would generally include, among others, alteration 
of repayment period / repayable amount / the amount of instalments / rate of interest (due to reasons other than competitive 
reasons). Restructured accounts are classified as such by the Bank only upon approval and implementation of the restructuring 
package. Necessary provision for diminution in the fair value of a restructured account is made and classification thereof is as 
per the extant RBI guidelines. The asset classification and necessary provisions thereon are done in accordance with the said 
RBI guidelines.
	
b)	
Inter Bank Participation Certificates
The Bank enters into Inter Bank Participation Certificate with Risk Sharing as issuing Bank and the aggregate amount of 
participation are reduced from the aggregate loan outstanding.
	
c)	
Provisioning
Provisions in respect of non-performing and restructured advances are made based on management’s assessment of the 
degree of impairment of the advances subject to the minimum provisioning levels prescribed under RBI guidelines with regard 
to the Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification & Provisioning prescribed from time to time.
The Bank also maintains provision on standard assets to cover potential credit losses which are inherent in any loan portfolio 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. However, provisioning rates prescribed by RBI are the regulatory minimum, and Bank made 
additional provisions in respect of advances to stressed sectors of the economy as approved by the Board from time to time. 
Provision made against standard assets is included in ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’.
Loans reported as fraud are classified appropriately as per relevant RBI guidelines and fully provided for immediately without 
considering the value of security.
	
d)	
Floating Provision
The Bank recognises floating provision as per the Board approved policy, which is in addition to the specific, contingent 
and general provisions made by the Bank. The floating provision will be utilised, with the approval of Board and RBI, in case 
of contingencies which do not arise in the normal course of business and are exceptional and non-recurring in nature and 
for making specific provision for impaired loans as per the requirement of extant RBI guidelines or any regulatory guidance / 
instructions. Floating provisions are netted off for NNPA Ratio and is included in ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions’.

Investments
	
Policies applicable for the year ended March 31, 2025
	
a)	
Classification
In accordance with Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) Master Direction - Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment 
Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), 2023 (‘RBI Directions’) issued on 12 September 2023 which is applicable from 
April 01,2024, the Bank classifies its entire investment portfolio (except investments in their own subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates) under three categories, viz., Held to Maturity (‘HTM’), Available for Sale (‘AFS’) and Fair Value through Profit and 
Loss (‘FVTPL’). Held for Trading (‘HFT’) is a separate investment sub-category within FVTPL.
Under each of these categories, investments are further classified under six groups – Government Securities, Other Approved 
Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures, and Other Investments for the purposes 
of disclosure in the Balance Sheet.
The Bank follows ‘Settlement Date’ accounting for recording purchase and sale transactions in securities, except in the case of 
equity shares where ‘Trade Date’ accounting is followed.
	
	
Basis of classification
The Bank classifies its investments as subsequently measured into the above categories based on the business model for 
managing the investments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the investments.
	
	
Business model assessment
The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an investment is held such that it best reflects the 
way the business is managed and is consistent with information provided to management. The information considered includes:
i)	
The objectives for the portfolio, in particular, management’s strategy of focusing on earning contractual interest revenue, 
maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the investments to the duration of the liabilities that are 
funding those investments or realising cash flows through the sale of the investments;
ii)	
The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales 
activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how 
the Bank’s stated objective for managing the investments is achieved and how cash flows are realised; and
iii)	
The risks that affect the performance of the business model, the investments held within that business model and how 
those risks are managed.
	
	
Assessment whether contractual cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest
For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the investment on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is 
defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Bank considers the 
contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could 
change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the 
Bank considers:
i)	
Reset terms;
ii)	
Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
iii)	
Leverage features;
iv)	 Prepayment and extension terms;
v)	
Terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and
vi)	 Features that modify consideration of the time value of money – e.g. periodical reset of interest rates.

Investments at HTM
	
	
An investment is classified at HTM only if both of the following conditions are met:
i)	
It is held with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows; and
ii)	
The contractual terms of the investment give rise to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (‘SPPI’ 
criterion) on principal outstanding on the specified dates.

For equity instruments not held with the objective of trading, the Bank has an option on initial recognition to classify such 
instruments under AFS. The Bank makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on 
initial recognition and is irrevocable.

capitalized but treated as an item of expenditure under Profit and Loss Account in respect of investment in securities. The 
transaction costs including brokerage, commission, etc. paid at the time of acquisition of investments is recognised in Profit and 
Loss Account.

Valuation:
The valuation of investments is performed in accordance with the RBI guidelines as follows:
i)	
Investments classified as HTM – These are carried at cost and not Marked-to-Market (‘MTM’) after initial recognition. 
Any discount or premium on acquisition of debt instruments is amortized over the remaining life of the instrument using by 
straight-line method (‘SLM’). The discount or premium amortized is reflected as a part of interest earned in the Profit and 
Loss Account.
ii)	
Investments classified as AFS – These are fair valued on a quarterly basis. The valuation gains and losses are 
aggregated, and the net appreciation or depreciation directly gets credited or debited to AFS reserve (net of effect of 
applicable taxes). Any discount or premium on acquisition of debt instruments is amortized over the remaining life of the 
instrument by using straight-line method (‘SLM’). The discount or premium amortized is reflected as a part of interest 
earned in the Profit and Loss Account.
iii)	
Investments classified as FVTPL/HFT - These are fair valued and the net gain or loss arising on such valuation is 
directly credited/debited to the Profit and Loss Account. Securities that are classified under the HFT sub-category within 
FVTPL are fair valued on daily basis, whereas other securities in FVTPL are fair valued on a quarterly basis. Any discount or 
premium on acquisition of debt instruments is amortized over the remaining life of the instrument using straight-line method 
(‘SLM’). The discount or premium amortized is reflected as a part of interest earned in the Profit and loss Account.”
iv)	 Investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures - All investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures are held at acquisition cost. Any discount or premium on the acquisition of debt instruments of subsidiaries 
and associates are amortised over the remaining life of the instrument using straight-line method (‘SLM’). The discount 
or premium amortized is reflected as a part of interest earned in the Profit and Loss Account. The Bank assesses these 
investments for impairment and provides for the same, in accordance with RBI Directions.
v)	
The fair value of the quoted securities are the prices declared by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd. (‘FBIL’). For 
securities whose prices are not published by FBIL, the fair value of the quoted securities is based upon quoted price as 
available from the trades/ quotes on recognised stock exchanges, reporting platforms or trading platforms authorised 
by RBI or Securities and Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) or prices declared by the Fixed Income Money Market and 
Derivatives Association of India (‘FIMMDA’).
vi)	 Treasury Bills, Exchange Funded Bills, Commercial Paper and Certificate of Deposits being discounted instruments, are 
valued at carrying cost.
vii)	 Market value of units of mutual funds is based on the latest net asset value declared by the mutual fund.
viii)	 Market value of investments where current quotations are not available are determined as per the norms prescribed by the 
RBI as under:
	
In case of unquoted bonds, debentures, Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) and preference shares where interest 
/ dividend is received regularly (i.e. not overdue beyond 90 days), the market price is derived based on the Yield to 
Maturity for Government Securities as published by FIMMDA / FBIL and suitably marked up for credit risk applicable 
to the credit rating of the instrument. The matrix for credit risk mark-up for each category and credit rating along with 
residual maturity issued by FIMMDA / FBIL is adopted for this purpose;
	
Equity shares, for which current quotations are not available or where the shares are not quoted on the stock 
exchanges, are valued at break-up value (without considering revaluation reserves, if any) which is ascertained from 
the company’s latest balance sheet which shall not precede the date of valuation by more than 18 months In case the 
latest Balance Sheet is not available, the shares are valued at H1 per investee company;
	
Security receipts are valued as per the Net Asset Value (NAV) obtained from the issuing Asset Reconstruction 
Company or Securitisation Company or estimated recovery whichever is lower.
	
Units of Alternate Investment Funds (AIF) are valued at the NAV published by the AIFs. If AIF fails to carry out and 
disclose valuation of its investments by an independent valuer as per the frequency mandated by the SEBI regulations, 
the value of units shall be treated as H1. If the AIF is not registered under the applicable SEBI regulations and the latest 
disclosed valuation of its investments by an independent valuer is not available for a period beyond 18 months, the

investment shall be valued at H1 per unit. Further, the Bank provides for investments in Alternate Investments Funds 
(AIFs) in line with RBI circular dated 19th December, 2023 and 27th March 2024.
ix)	 Non-performing investments (NPIs) are identified and depreciation / provision are made thereon based on RBI guidelines. 
Subsequent, MTM gains on NPIs are ignored. NPIs are segregated from rest of the portfolio and are not considered for 
netting valuation gains and losses. Interest on non-performing investments is not recognized in the Profit & Loss Account 
until received.
x)	
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions - Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (Repos) and 
securities purchased under agreements to resell (Reverse Repos) are accounted as collateralised borrowing and lending 
transactions respectively. The difference between the consideration amount of the first leg and the second leg of the repo 
is recognised as interest income or interest expense over the period of the transaction.
	
	
Day 1 gain/ loss on initial recognition
All investments are measured at fair value on initial recognition.
Unless facts and circumstances suggest that the fair value is materially different from the acquisition cost, it is presumed that the 
acquisition cost is the fair value. Situations where the presumption is tested include:
	
The transaction is between related parties.
	
The transaction is done outside the principal market for that class of securities.
	
The transaction is taking place under duress where one party is forced to accept the price in the transaction.
The Bank does not expect day 1 gain/ loss in case of investments which are executed through trading platforms like Recognized 
Stock Exchange or through online investment platforms whereby the prices are determined in an orderly transaction between 
market participants on the measurement date. Day 1 gain/ loss is tested when transactions are conducted outside the principal 
market or transactions are done with related parties.
Where the securities are quoted or the fair value can be determined based on market observable inputs (such as yield curve, 
spread, etc.) any day 1 gain/ loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Any day 1 loss arising from Level 3 investments is recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account.
Any day 1 gains arising from Level 3 investments is deferred. In the case of debt instruments, the day 1 gain is amortized on 
a straight-line basis up to the maturity date, while for unquoted equity instruments, the gain is set aside as a liability until the 
security is listed or derecognised.
	
	
Fair Value Hierarchy:
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants on the measurement date.
The management uses its judgment in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an 
active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market participants are applied.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Bank uses observable market data as far as possible.
Fair values are categorized into different levels (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in 
the valuation techniques. The levels are described as follows:
Level 1: The inputs used for valuation of financial instruments are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
instruments that the Bank can access at the measurement date.
Level 2: The valuation of financial instruments is based on inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: The valuation of financial instruments is based on unobservable inputs i.e. not based on observable market data.
	
	
Transition date accounting as on April 1, 2024
In line with the RBI Circular dated September 12, 2023, the fair value as on March 31, 2024 is the revised carrying value of 
investments. Further, the difference between the fair value as on March 31, 2024 and previous carrying value has been adjusted 
in the General Reserve.(Refer Schedule 18.30B)”
Schedule 17 – Significant accounting policies (Contd.)
228  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
Schedule forming part of the Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2025
Classification and valuation of Bank’s Investments is carried out in accordance with relevant RBI guidelines/directions and 
Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (‘FIMMDA’) and Financial Benchmark India Private Limited (‘FBIL’) 
guidelines prescribed in this regard from time to time.
	
	
Policies applicable for the year ended March 31, 2024
	
	
a)	
Classification
Investments are classified into ‘Held for Trading’ (‘HFT’), ‘Available for Sale’ (‘AFS’) and ‘Held to Maturity’ (HTM) categories 
at the time of purchase.
Investments that are acquired with an intention to hold till maturity are classified as “HTM”.
Investments that are held primarily for sale within 90 days from the date of purchase are classified as “HFT”.
Investments, which are not classified in the above two categories, are classified as “AFS”. Further, as per the RBI guidelines, 
HFT securities, which remain unsold for a period of 90 days are reclassified as AFS securities.
The Bank follows value date method of accounting for purchase and sale of investments, except for Government of India and 
state government securities where settlement date method of accounting is followed in accordance with RBI guidelines.
For the purpose of disclosure in the financial statements, the Investments are classified under six groups a) Government 
Securities b) Other Approved Securities c) Shares d) Debentures and Bonds e) Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures and f) Others.
Investments are classified as performing or non-performing as per RBI guidelines. Non performing investments are 
subjected to prudential norms for Classification, valuations and Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks prescribed 
from time to time.
	
	
b)	
Valuation
Investments classified as “Held to Maturity” securities need not to be marked to market and will be carried at acquisition 
cost, unless it is more than the face value, in which the premium should be amortised over the period remaining to maturity. 
Where in the opinion of the management, a diminution, other than temporary in the value of investments classified under 
HTM has taken place, appropriate provisions are made.
Investments classified as AFS and HFT are marked-to-market on a periodic basis as per relevant RBI guidelines. The 
securities are valued scrip-wise and depreciation / appreciation is aggregated for each category. Net appreciation in each 
category, if any, is ignored, while net depreciation is provided for. The book value of individual securities is not changed 
consequent to the periodic valuation of investments.
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificates of deposit are valued at carrying cost including the pro rata discount 
accrued for the holding period.
Quoted investments are valued at traded quoted price available on the recognised stock exchanges, subsidiary general 
ledger account transactions are valued as per the price list of RBI or prices declared by Primary Dealers Association of 
India (“PDAI”) jointly with FIMMDA / FBIL applicable as at the balance sheet date. For deriving market value of unquoted 
fixed income securities (other than Central and State Government securities), yields / mark-up rates (reflecting associate 
credit risk) declared by the FIMMDA / FBIL are considered.
Quoted Mutual Fund units are valued as per stock exchange quotes and un-quoted mutual fund units are valued at last 
available re-purchase price or Net Asset Value where re-purchase price is not available.”
	
	
c)	
Disposal of investments
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid three categories is recognized in the Profit and Loss account. Cost 
of investments is based on the weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of investment under HTM category, net 
of taxes and transfer to statutory reserve is appropriated from Profit and Loss account to “Capital Reserve” in accordance 
with the RBI Guidelines.
	
	
d)	
Transfer between categories
Transfer of investments between categories is accounted in accordance with the extant RBI guidelines:
a)	
Transfer from AFS/HFT to HTM is made at the lower of book value or market value at the time of transfer.

Schedule forming part of the Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2025
b)	
Transfer from HTM to AFS/HFT is made at acquisition price/ amortised cost if originally placed in HTM at par or at a 
discount and at amortised cost if originally placed in HTM at a premium.
c)	
Transfer from AFS to HFT category or vice-versa is made at book value and the provision for the accumulated 
depreciation, if any, held is transferred to the provisions for depreciation against the HFT securities or vice-versa.
	
	
e)	
Repurchase and Reverse repurchase transactions
Repurchase (‘Repo’) and reverse repurchase (‘Reverse Repo’) transactions including liquidity adjustment facility (with RBI) 
are accounted for as borrowing and lending transactions respectively. Accordingly, securities given as collateral under an 
agreement to repurchase them continue to be held under the investment account of the Bank and the Bank would continue 
to accrue the coupon/discount on the security during the repo period. The Bank continues to value the securities sold 
under repo as per the investment classification of the security. Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted for as 
interest expense and income on reverse repo transactions are accounted for as interest income.
	
	
f)	
Broken period interest, brokerage etc.
Broken period interest and costs such as brokerage paid at the time of acquisition of the investments are charged to the 
Profit and Loss account.
	
	
Investment Fluctuation Reserve.
Out of net profits earned during the year, transfer is made to Investment Fluctuation Reserve, for an amount not less than the 
lower of the (a) net profit on sale of investments during the year (b) net profit for the year less mandatory appropriations, till the 
balance in such Investment Fluctuation Reserve reaches a level of at least 2% of the aggregate FVTPL, HFT and AFS portfolio. 
Draw down from the Investment Fluctuation Reserve has been made in accordance with the applicable RBI guidelines.
D	
Fixed assets and depreciation / amortisation
	
Tangible assets
Tangible fixed assets are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortization and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes freight, duties, taxes and all other directly attributable expenditures towards acquisition and installation of assets 
before it is ready for commercial use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases 
the future benefit / functioning capability from / of such assets. Tangible fixed assets under construction and tangible fixed assets 
acquired but not ready for their intended use will be disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
Capital work in progress includes cost of fixed assets that are not ready for their intended use and also includes advances paid to 
acquire fixed assets. Depreciation is provided as per straight-line method from the date of addition over the estimated useful life of 
the asset.
For assets purchased/ sold during the year, depreciation is being provided on pro rata basis by the Bank. Depreciation on assets sold 
during the year is charged to the Profit and Loss account up to the date of sale. Assets costing less than H5,000 are fully depreciated 
in the year of purchase. If the management’s estimate of the useful life of a fixed asset at the time of acquisition of the asset or of the 
remaining useful life on a subsequent review is shorter, then the depreciation is provided at a higher rate based on management’s 
estimate of the useful life/remaining useful life. The management believes that depreciation rates currently used, fairly reflect its 
estimate of the useful lives and residual values of fixed assets which are in accordance with lives prescribed under Schedule II of 
Companies Act, 2013.
Leasehold improvements are amortised on straight line basis over the primary period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the 
assets, whichever is lower.
Losses arising from retirement or gains or losses arising from disposal of fixed assets which are carried at cost are recognized in the 
Profit and Loss account.
	
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Bank are measured initially at cost. The cost of an intangible asset comprises its purchase 
price including after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the item to its working condition 
for its intended use following initial recognition. After initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated 
amortization and any accumulated impairment loss. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future 
economic benefits from the specific asset to which it relates.
Schedule 17 – Significant accounting policies (Contd.)
230  |  Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited
Schedule forming part of the Financial Statements 
 for the year ended March 31, 2025
Intangible assets are amortized in the Profit and Loss account over their estimated useful lives from the date they are available for 
use based on the expected pattern of consumption of economic benefits of the asset. Intangible assets are amortized on straight line 
basis. Computer software are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life of three years.For assets purchased/ 
sold during the year, amortisation is being provided on pro rata basis by the Bank.
	
Impairment of Assets
In accordance with Accounting Standard 28- Impairment of assets, the Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there 
is any indication of impairment of assets based on internal / external factor If any such indication exists, the Bank estimates the 
recoverable amount of the asset. If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit 
to which the asset belongs to is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount will be reduced to its recoverable amount. The 
reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the Profit and Loss account. If at the balance sheet date there is 
an indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is 
reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of depreciable historical cost. Depreciation is provided on the revised 
carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life
E	
Foreign Currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transactions. Exchange 
differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the Profit and Loss account. Income 
and Expenditure items are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the balance sheet date based on exchange rates 
notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India (‘FEDAI’) and the resultant exchange differences are recognized in the 
Profit and Loss account.
F	
Derivatives
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts (other than those designated as hedges) at fair value, on the date on which the derivative 
contracts are entered into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet or reporting dates.
Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities when the fair value 
is negative (negative marked to market value). Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedges are 
recognised in the Profit and Loss account.
Derivative contracts designated as hedges are not marked to market unless their underlying transaction is marked to market. In 
respect of derivative contracts that are marked to market, changes in the market value are recognised in the Profit and Loss account 
in the relevant period.
The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained 
at the time of the inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Gains or losses arising from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are 
recognised in the Profit and Loss account. Contingent liabilities on account of derivative contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
are reported at closing rates of exchange notified by FEDAI as at the balance sheet date.
G	
Employee benefits
	
a.	
Defined Contribution Plan –
The Bank makes specified monthly contribution towards employee provident fund to Government administered provident fund 
scheme, which is a defined contribution scheme. The Bank’s contribution is recognised as an expense in Profit and loss account

administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India through gratuity trust (Group Gratuity scheme) and the contributions made 
by the Bank to the scheme is recognised in the Profit and loss account. The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect 
of defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of 
plan assets. The calculation of the Bank’s obligation under the plan is performed annually by qualified independent actuary 
using projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses arising during the year is immediately recognised in the Profit & 
Loss account.

H	
Share Issue Expenses
	
Share issue expenses are adjusted from Securities Premium Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
I	
Employee Stock Option Scheme
The holding company of the Bank has formulated Employees Stock Option Scheme. The scheme provides that subject to continued 
employment with the Bank, employees of the Bank are granted an option to acquire equity shares of the Holding Company that 
may be exercised within a specified period. The compensation cost for all options granted to employees by the Holding company 
is computed based on valuation of shares of Holding company as per intrinsic value method and is amortised over the period of 
vesting. Measurement and disclosure of the Employee Share-based Payment Schemes are done in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).

Employee Share based Payments’ issued by the ICAI and same is charged to Profit & Loss Account.
J	
Lease transactions
A lease is classified at the inception date as finance lease or an operating lease. Assets taken on lease where the Bank acquires 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at an amount equal to lower of its fair value and present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of lease liability so as to 
achieve constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are reflected 
as borrowings. Finance charges are recognised as finance costs in the profit and loss account.
Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership over the lease term are classified as 
operating leases. Operating lease rentals are recognised as and when the payments are made over the lease terms.
K	
Taxation
Income tax comprises the current tax (i.e. amount of tax for the period, determined in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961 and 
the rules framed there under) and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability for the period (reflecting the tax effects of timing 
differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period).
Provision for current income-tax is recognized in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and is made annually 
based on the tax liability after taking credit for tax allowances and exemptions.
The current tax, deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liability or asset is recognised using the tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realized in future. However, 
where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there 
is virtual certainty (supported by convincing evidence of future taxable income) of realization of such assets.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the amount that is reasonably/
virtually certain to be realized.
L	
Provisions and contingencies
The Bank recognises a provision when there is present obligation as a result of a past event that probably requires an outflow of 
resources and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When there 
is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that 
an outflow of resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.

Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is 
virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognized in the period in which the 
change occurs.
M	
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss after tax for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if contracts to issue equity shares were exercised or 
converted during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed using the weighted average number of equity shares and 
dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are anti-dilutive.
N	
Cash and cash equivalents
	
Cash and Cash equivalents include cash in hand, balances with RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and short notice.
O	
Cash Flow Statements
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash 
nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Bank are segregated.
P	
Segment reporting
	
The disclosures relating to segment reporting is done as per guidelines issued by the RBI.
Q	
Priority Sector Lending Certificates
The Bank vide RBI circular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.23/04.09.01/2015-16 dated April 07, 2016 trades in Priority Sector portfolio by selling or 
buying Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs). There is no transfer of risk on loan assets in these transactions. The fee paid for

Schedule 18  (Contd.)
18.2.2  Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
Qualitative disclosure around LCR
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a global minimum standard for Bank’s liquidity. The ratio aims to ensure that a bank has an adequate stock of 
unencumbered High - Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs for 
a 30 calendar days of severe liquidity stress scenario.
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring that banks 
have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to total estimated net outflows over a stressed period of 30 
calendar days.
The net cash outflows are calculated by applying RBI prescribed outflow factors to the various categories of liabilities (deposits, 
unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), as well as to undrawn commitments and derivative-related exposures, partially offset by 
inflows from assets maturing within 30 days.
The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The Board at overall level decides the liquidity risk 
tolerance/limits and accordingly decides the strategy, policies and procedures of the Bank for managing liquidity risk.
The Board has constituted Risk Management Committee (RMC), which reports to the Board, and consisting of Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) /Chairman and certain other Board members. The Committee is responsible for evaluating the overall risks faced by 
the Bank including liquidity risk. The potential interaction of liquidity risk with other risks is included in the risks addressed by the Risk 
Management Committee.
At the executive level, Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set by the Board as 
well as implementing the liquidity risk management strategy of the Bank in line with Bank’s risk management objectives and risk tolerance. 
A dedicated desk within Treasury function of the Bank is responsible for the day-to-day / intra-day liquidity management.
ALCO of the Bank channelizes various business segments of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to meet the Bank’s 
profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank.
The Bank has been maintaining HQLA (Level 1) primarily in the form of Excess CRR, excess SLR investments over and above mandatory 
requirement. LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day period. The present 
minimum regulatory requirement, as on March 31, 2025 is 100%.
In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which include deposits 
from individuals), Small Business Customers(those with deposits upto H7.5 crore) and Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). 
Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the 
cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted 
to the RBI. The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The present 
minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2025 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities (viz., 
deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and offset with inflows 
emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and the average LCR maintained 
by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years as below:

18.2.3  Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
Qualitative disclosure around NSFR
In the backdrop of the global financial crisis that started in 2007, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposed certain 
reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations with the objective of promoting a more resilient banking sector. In this regard, 
comes into picture – “Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring” which presented two 
minimum standards, viz., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for funding liquidity.
The NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. “Available stable funding” 
(ASF) is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon of one year. The amount of stable 
funding required (“Required stable funding”) (RSF) of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual 
maturities of the various assets held by that institution as well as those of its off-balance sheet (OBS) exposures.
Minimum Requirement: ASF(Available Stable Funding)/RSF(Require Stable Funding)>=100. The Bank is required to maintain the NSFR 
on an ongoing basis on a standalone basis. The minimum NSFR requirement set out in the RBI guideline effective October 1, 2021 is 100%.
The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for management of liquidity risk. The Board at overall level decides the liquidity risk 
tolerance/limits and accordingly decides the strategy, policies and procedures of the Bank for managing liquidity risk.
At the executive level, Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set by the Board as 
well as implementing the liquidity risk management strategy of the Bank in line with Bank’s risk management objectives and risk tolerance. 
A dedicated desk within Treasury function of the Bank is responsible for the day-to-day / intra-day liquidity management.

provisions, the Bank’s net worth and investments have increased by Rs.1.32 crore (post tax) and Rs. 1.76 crore (pre-tax) respectively 
as on April 01, 2024 on account of revision in the carrying value to the fair value as on such date. Subsequent changes in fair value of 
performing investments under Available for Sale (AFS) and Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’) (including Held For Trading 
(‘HFT’)) categories have been recognized through AFS reserve and Profit and Loss Account respectively. Figures for the previous year/
period are not comparable to that extent.

maintaining its books of account that have a feature of recording audit trail of each and every transaction creating an audit log of each

of recording audit trail has operated throughout the year and was not tampered with during the year. The Bank has established and 
maintained an adequate internal control framework and based on its assessment, believes that this was effective as of March 31, 2025.
